In a prediction market, people buy and sell shares in the outcome of an event, like an election result or sports game. The prices of these shares are meant to indicate the probability of each outcome happening, functioning as a crowd-sourced prediction tool. On the other hand, a speculative market is broader and typically refers to financial markets (like the stock market) where investors buy and sell assets, like stocks or commodities, with the hope that their value will increase in the future. While speculators in these markets might also make predictions about future events, the main goal is to profit from changes in asset prices, rather than to forecast specific outcomes accurately."},{"instruction":"What is Baseball5?","output":"Baseball5 is a fast-paced, street version of traditional baseball and softball. It was created and promoted by the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC) to make the game more accessible and to grow its global popularity. The key features of Baseball5 are its simplicity and adaptability: it can be played almost anywhere with minimal equipment, requiring only a rubber ball to play, with no need for bats or gloves. The game is played with five players per team on a smaller field, and matches consist of five innings. Baseball5 emphasizes speed, agility, and strategy. The rules are designed to be easy to learn, making the game inclusive for participants of all ages and skill levels. The ball is hit with the hand, and the game incorporates elements of both baseball and softball but simplifies them to make it straightforward to play in urban environments or areas with limited sports infrastructure. Through Baseball5, the WBSC aims to further popularize baseball and softball around the world, especially among youth in urban areas, and contribute to the sports' potential future inclusion in the Olympic Games."},{"instruction":"How is Baseball5 played? How does it differ from regular Baseball?","output":"Baseball5 is an innovative, street version of traditional baseball, designed to be more accessible and versatile. Here’s a breakdown of how it’s played and how it differs from regular baseball: # How Baseball5 is Played 1. **Teams and Players:** Each team has five players, and there are no gender restrictions, promoting mixed-gender participation. 2. **Equipment:** The only equipment needed is a rubber ball. There’s no need for bats, gloves, or any specialized gear, making it inexpensive and adaptable to various settings. 3. **Field:** The game is played on a smaller field, typically 18 meters (around 59 feet) between bases, with a square layout. The compact size allows it to be played in varied environments like gyms, urban areas, and parks. 4. **Game Structure:** Matches consist of five innings, with each team batting once per inning. An inning ends when all players have batted, or three outs are made. 5. **Batting and Running:** There’s no pitcher. The batter bounces the ball to themselves and then hits it to proceed. Base running follows traditional baseball rules in terms of order and progression around the bases, but the simplicity speeds up play and emphasizes agility and reflexes. 6. **Scoring:** Runs are scored much like traditional baseball, with a player successfully reaching the home plate. # Differences from Regular Baseball - **Size and Space:** The most evident difference is the smaller team size and field, making it suitable for environments not typically conducive to traditional baseball. - **Equipment:** The absence of bats and gloves reduces barriers to entry and shifts the focus from equipment quality to player skill and strategy. - **Pitching:** Unlike baseball, where the pitch starts play, in Baseball5, the batter self-pitches by bouncing and hitting the ball, eliminating the pitcher role. - **Mixed Gender:** Baseball5 promotes inclusivity by encouraging mixed-gender teams, whereas traditional baseball and softball frequently have separate leagues. - **Duration:** The game is shorter, both in terms of innings and the time it takes to complete them, catering to a faster-paced, more engaging experience for players and spectators. Overall, Baseball5 retains the essence and strategic depth of baseball while making it more accessible, flexible, and fast-paced, with a strong emphasis on inclusivity and urban adaptability."},{"instruction":"In Cricket if a ball either exits the playing circle or falls in the stands, why happens?","output":"In cricket, when a ball either exits the playing area or lands in the stands without touching the ground within the playing field first, it results in extra runs awarded to the batting team. Specifically, the outcomes are: 1. **Six Runs:** If the ball is hit by the batsman and it lands in the stands or goes beyond the boundary line without touching the ground, six runs are awarded to the batting team. This is one of the most exciting parts of the game, showcasing the batsman's power and skill. 2. **Four Runs:** If the ball touches the ground before crossing the boundary line, four runs are awarded. Though this specific scenario wasn't part of your question, it's worth mentioning for clarity on how runs are scored in relation to the boundary. The \\"playing circle\\" mentioned might refer to the inner circle used in limited-overs formats (One Day Internationals and T20Is) for fielding restrictions, notably the powerplay overs. However, regarding boundaries and scoring, the entire field is considered, not just the inner circle. Whether the ball exits the inner circle or the outer boundary, the key factor for scoring sixes or fours is whether it crosses the boundary line at the edge of the field, either on the full for six runs or after bouncing for four."},{"instruction":"Contexte conceptuel sur l'état de paie dans agents","output":"Les agents font référence aux individus qui agissent au nom d'une organisation ou d'une entité, et qui ont généralement des responsabilités spécifiques et des tâches à accomplir.

Whatever works. Currently still running with the normal dancers idents (when will they be retired, they've been used since 2002) Emma said on 01 December 2023 Hopefully S4C does something with their new blob mascot, Last year they had TV sets stacked up on top of each other, Then for 10 months they had flickering TV sets, They have finally rebranded and have introduced their first ever mascot: a shape-shifting blob, I hope BBC One rebrand soon, those dancers sure are getting tired, As for the KikoRiki themed Christmas idents, I was told they are launching tonight after Doctor Who, They are being introduced just before Unbreakable. HouseofFun said on 01 December 2023 Doctor Who ending now, announcement playing \\"A team of 8 people are pushed to the absolute limit, Unbreakable, our brand new game show is up next, But first, Time to say hello and spend Christmas with the Doctor\\" I'm not liking this one a whole lot..., They seem to be running a trailer advertising the Doctor Who Christmas special, which revolves around the Doctor having to protect his companions from a man who seeks to find a fob watch (the one The Doctor made himself human with one time), Although just before Doctor Who tonight they had a announcement saying \\"Christmas is switched on tonight in 1 hour in time for Unbreakable, But first, Is this the end for the Doctor?\\". Doesn't seem like they are advertising the Christmas pres at all, Edit: Christmas pres featuring KikoRiki switched on, First ident shown features Rosa the Pig doing a dramatic ice skate dance (She even uses eyedrops for fake tears) While this is happening we hear dramatic music, The announcer says \\"Welcome to Christmas on BBC One, Let us entertain you, But now a team of 8 people are being pushed to their absolute limits, Are they Unbreakable?\\" Not sure why they didn't tell us it was happening untill it did, But still a gorgeous ident, I noticed when the Announcer started talking it sounded as if he was driven to tears by the beauty of Rosa's gorgeous dance. The best thing to come out of this package since the \\"Lights\\" christmas idents in 2006, Eyes said on 01 December 2023 A beautiful ident, Best thing to come out of the \\"Rythm and Movement\\" package since those Planet Earth 3 special idents a few months ago, i feel sad that KikoRiki has not been shown much on CBBC on BBC Two, but I'm glad it's representing the Xmas idents on BBC One (Although I also wish the idents also featured a merman). Maile said on 01 December 2023 Best Christmas ident in a while, I just love that they have spent it with Rosa and her friends, I hear there is also one featuring Krash the Rabbit opening his presents, I like how they used the usual ident theme (dancing) in that first ident, KikoRiki looks like it's gonna be good this year, but I hope they do more with the style (and maybe finally retire Rythm and Movement idents) Faramad said on 01 December 2023 News safe ident just on, Basically just a Christmas tree on a snowy background, with a music box Christmas carol playing, on top of that the only thing we see is a sleeping Rosa (We vaguely hear her snoring) Glad they are now using characters in their news safe idents, Announcer said \\"Now on BBC One, time for the BBC News at 8\\". Remember the Lights idents the used just before overhauling their promo style in late 2006/early 2007? That was pretty cool, but this is way better. I seem to remember those idents started on a dark street but Christmas lights started turning on before it got to a city center and then people were dancing, It was used again in 2007, And now it seems like the \\"Project Chameleon\\" endboard template introduced in July is out the window, at least for now, replaced with a snowy background with a Christmas tree on it. Signs that Rythm and Movement is finally working towards the end. KikoRiki said on 01 December 2023 We're glad you love our cartoon and the special BBC One idents featuring our characters, However, Rosa will be the star, (We will have idents revolving around Chiko, Krash and the others), As to what you said, BBC One are looking into introducing the Circle idents already in use in other countries, so don't expect to see Ballet, Capoeria or Festival/Rave back in the new year. Get used to Kites, Capes, Hippos and Bikes as that's what might be coming after our Christmas campaign, We don't know for certain, but the Dancers might not be coming back after Christmas WhovianForever: Did everyone catch the Doctor Who Christmas special announcement during the news? I’m so hyped! Can’t wait to see how the Doctor deals with the fob watch saga this holiday season! LemonyFan: And how about they’re showing the 2004 ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ movie!! That’s one of my holiday favorites; the nostalgia is real. 😍🍿 ChristmasCarol: Truly is shaping up to be a wonderful holiday schedule on BBC One. Between Doctor Who and the classic movies, I’m going to be glued to my screen with all the mulled wine and mince pies! KikoFanatic: Plus, the KikoRiki Christmas idents have been adorable so far! Rosa’s ice skate dance nearly brought tears to my eyes just like the announcer. 🐷⛸ Christmas is definitely switched on! RetroTV: I’m just here wondering if the new ‘Circle’ idents KikoRiki hinted at is a sign we’re finally saying goodbye to the “Rythm and Movement” package for good. After 20+ years, it’s about time for a major refresh! NostalgiaNerd: @RetroTV I’m with you on that. The Lights idents back in '06/'07 were beautiful. It’s cool to see they’re still willing to shake things up visually with the news safe ident this year. Sleepy Rosa might just be my new favorite. 😴🎄 SeriesBinger: Doctor Who special + A Series of Unfortunate Events + KikoRiki idents = Best Christmas TV lineup or what? Also, hope BBC One throws in some classic Christmas episodes of our favorite shows. Maybe some ‘Vicar of Dibley’ or ‘Only Fools and Horses’? CircleCurious: Anyone heard more about these new Circle idents? I love change, and KikoRiki characters have been great, but I’m already excited for what’s coming next. Bring on the new era! KikoLover: Just saw a new Krash and Chiko ident! They’re having a blast playing in the snow! ❄️🐇 So cute watching Krash throw snowballs while Chiko dodges around. Really captures the winter fun vibes. SciFiSavvy: Speaking of new idents, did anyone else notice the Dokko the Moose building a laser device ident? It aired right before ‘Doctor Who’ and set the PERFECT tone for sci-fi. Dokko’s always been the tech genius of the group. 🦌🔧 HedgehogAdmirer: @KikoLover Chiko is always adorable, but seeing him in the snow was next level! BBC One knows how to do Christmas idents right. Plus, the animation on these characters in the idents is super impressive this year. WhovianGuru: @SciFiSavvy Loved the Dokko ident! It’s like a mini episode of ‘Doctor Who’ in itself. Brilliant tie-in to the show’s theme! Makes waiting for the Christmas special even more exciting. BakeMaster: But guys, let’s talk about the Olga the Owl baking ident. The detail on that gingerbread house she was making! I can almost smell the cookies through the screen. 🦉🍪 It’s the cozy ident I never knew I needed in my life. HolidayWatcher: Right?! The Olga ident feels like being wrapped in a warm blanket with a hot chocolate in hand. It’s chef’s kiss perfection. BBC One’s going all out with these KikoRiki characters for Christmas. DoctorFan: Dokko’s ident was like a mini teaser for what’s coming with ‘Doctor Who’. Immersive and full of that tech mystery vibe. I appreciate that BBC One creates these unique intros for thematic continuity. AnimationAppreciator: Major kudos to the animation team for the KikoRiki idents. As someone who dabbles in animation, the quality is sensational. It’s like a little holiday gift before each show starts! ChristmasCheer: Can’t get enough of the snow play with Krash and Chiko. It’s absolutely delightful and spreads so much joy. These little moments provided by the idents add a special touch to the holiday season. SciCompanion: Dokko and his inventions always remind me that anything’s possible with a little imagination. Such an inspiring ident to lead into ‘Doctor Who’. Well played, BBC One! Can’t wait to see what else is in store, I'm gonna miss these idents when new year comes around! 😢 WelcomeToSciFi: The Dokko centric ident really sets the scene for what's to come on ‘Doctor Who’ this Christmas. One of the best things about the KikoRiki set, Far better than the usual dancers, Come to think of it, they have been using the dancers since 2002, so now is a good time for a revamp, I guess 😉 Olgo5: Just saw the Olga ident and damn, Olga really is a talented chef, They always seem to show it before cooking shows, Which ident normally leads into Eastenders, It seems to vary between Krash and Chiko in the snow, Olga cooking and Rosa ice skating. Not sure how this is consistent, But that Rosa one brings tears to my eyes with her graceful skating, Not sure why the Dokko one only plays before Doctor Who, Maybe because it fits it well Prolouge: User1: So, what’s everyone thinking BBC One’s going to pull out of the hat for this year’s Christmas idents? Last year was decent, but I’m hoping for something with a bit more pizzazz. WhovianForever: I’m crossing my fingers for something Doctor Who-themed! With David Tennant back in the show earlier this year, it would be perfect timing to capitalize on that for the festive season. Can you imagine an ident with the TARDIS all decked out in Christmas lights? HolidayJoy: That would be cool for us Whovians, for sure, but BBC One usually goes for something that appeals to everyone. Doctor Who is big, but not universally loved by every single viewer. Plus, they tend to lean towards more generic festive symbols. SeriesBinger: True, they’ll probably aim for something more inclusive. Like a cozy winter scene or playful animation. Maybe bring back some classic characters or even partner with a popular children’s show this time around for wider appeal? RetroTV: I’ve got a hunch they’ll go with animation this year. It has that universal charm, right? Plus, it would work perfectly with both the kids’ content and the family-friendly vibe they love during Christmas. User1: That’s an interesting angle. They could get quite creative with animation. Plus, they’re probably due for a change since the “Rythm and Movement” dancers have been around since 2002. KikoFanatic: What if they teamed up with a show like KikoRiki? The characters are fun, visually engaging, and it’s something that would stand out. Plus, they could do loads with those quirky little animals. LemonyFan: KikoRiki would be such a cute choice! It could be a hit with children and adults alike if done right. And it’s refreshingly different from usual idents, without relying on something niche like a specific Doctor Who theme. WhovianForever: Okay, I see your point. Much as I’d love Doctor Who idents, something like KikoRiki could offer that ‘Christmas with the family’ vibe they probably want. I just hope they add a little extra magic this year, you know? CircleCurious: Whatever they do, I hope it’s something new. We’ve had the “Rythm and Movement” package idents for such a long time. It’s high time for something fresh and exciting to take us into the new year!

Indeed, the anticipation was met with an exciting reveal – the channel decided to focus on \\"KikoRiki\\", a beloved CBBC show. This choice aimed to captivate audiences with its charming, anthropomorphic characters, fitting perfectly into the festive spirit. Before the transition into this festive cheer, the last \\"usual ident\\" to grace the screens aired at 7 pm, just before the esteemed \\"Doctor Who\\". This ident was part of the long-standing \\"Rhythm and Movement\\" series that featured the iconic \\"Capoeira\\" vignette. In this sequence, viewers were presented with a mesmeric blend of dance and martial arts, a visual metaphor for synchronized movement and unity. Despite its beauty, the Capoeira ident, like others from the 2002 series, had seen its fair share of rotations over the years, sparking conversations about the need for freshness in BBC One's approach to idents. The decision to spotlight \\"KikoRiki\\" characters in the Christmas idents marked a significant pivot from the traditional \\"Rhythm and Movement\\" series. It wasn't just a thematic shift but also a strategic move to blend nostalgia with contemporary charm, offering a magical and inclusive setting for all BBC One viewers. The characters' adventures and misadventures were anticipated to bring a new level of excitement and warmth to the holiday programming, promising a memorable Christmas season complemented by imaginative storytelling through the idents. Moreover, the inclusion of the \\"KikoRiki\\" theme not only rejuvenated the channel's aesthetic but also hinted at the farewell of the \\"Rhythm and Movement\\" package. It paved the way for discussions about the future of BBC One's visual identity, stirring curiosity about the arrival of the \\"Circle\\" idents and what this evolution symbolized for the channel's brand and engagement with its audience. As the community dissected the final moments of the Capoeira ident before embracing the \\"KikoRiki\\" festivities, the consensus was clear: there was an appetite for change, an excitement for what was to come, and a collective hope that BBC One's new direction would continue to surprise and delight viewers in the years ahead."},{"instruction":"Write a forum convo where the festive breakdown caption is icy waters with legs in them, we know who's they are, considering she is practically the mascot for the holiday","output":"**WinterWonderLover**: Just caught the festive breakdown caption on the telly, and oh, it's a chilly one this year!

They've turned the breakdown/technical fault caption into its very own ident, and it's brilliantly done! **GlitchyGlimmer**: Seriously? I missed that! How did they incorporate a breakdown theme into an ident? Sounds like a risky move but intriguing. **FrostyFrameFan**: It was surprisingly clever! The screen starts to glitch with the typical \\"we’re experiencing technical difficulties\\" message, but then Rosa appears, tapping on the screen from the inside. She somehow 'fixes' the glitch with her magic, restoring the festive scene to its former glory. It’s both meta and magical! **PixelPenguin**: I love that concept! It’s a fun way to acknowledge the hiccups that come with live television but still keep it within the festive theme. Kudos to BBC One for turning a potential negative into a positive, engaging moment with Rosa. **IcyIllusionist**: It plays nicely into the Rosa narrative, too—she’s not just the holiday mascot but a guardian of the holiday spirit, ensuring the magic of the season isn’t interrupted, not even by technical faults. A clever twist! **SnowScapeScribbler**: Brilliant storytelling if you ask me. Turning a breakdown or a technical fault, which usually causes frustration, into an engaging part of the holiday viewing experience. It’s unexpected and delightful. **GlitterGadget**: Does anyone know if this was planned or a spontaneous creative response to an actual fault? Either way, integrating into an ident like this showcases a fantastic sense of humor and innovation from the team. **WinterWhimsyWatcher**: Planned or not, it goes to show how essential creativity and quick thinking are in broadcasting. This could set a new trend in how channels handle technical difficulties, making even the glitches a part of the viewing experience. **StarlightSpectator**: They've essentially created a 'meta-ident,' playing with the format and audience expectations. It’s refreshing to see broadcasters not taking themselves too seriously and having fun with the medium. **BorealBingeWatcher**: Is there a clip of this somewhere? I'd love to share it. It’s one thing to tell someone the TV had a fun glitch; it’s another to show them Rosa heroically saving Christmas from a broadcast breakdown. **FrigidFableFan**: This move is genius. It keeps the viewers engaged and entertained, even in moments that could potentially break the immersion of the festive atmosphere. This could only endear Rosa and BBC One even more to the audience. **ArcticArtAdmirer**: I’m curious about the behind-the-scenes for this ident. How they conceptualized it, animated Rosa interacting with the glitch effects—I bet there's a fascinating story there. Would love to see a making-of feature. **CinemaSnowglobe**: It’s a testament to the BBC One creative team's talent and their ability to think outside the box. Turning a breakdown caption into an engaging ident is not something you see every day. It adds a whole new layer to broadcast creativity! **TechieTinsel**: Agreed! And it shows that with the right touch of creativity, even moments of imperfection can be woven into the narrative fabric of the holiday season, making the experience all the more human and relatable.

Born in 1906 and dying in 1959, Andreyev wrote the bulk of this work while imprisoned by the Soviet authorities for his spiritual and religious ideas. The book is a profound and complex vision of the spiritual history and future of humanity and the universe. It introduces the concept of the \\"Rose of the World\\" (Roza Mira), which symbolizes a future spiritual and cultural union of all peoples on Earth, transcending divisions created by religions, philosophies, and national borders. Andreyev envisions a global integration of all religions into a single framework, acknowledging the truth in each and proposing an ultimate unification leading to peace and spiritual advancement. \\"Rose of the World\\" delves into metaphysics, eschatology, angelology, and the interaction between the physical and spiritual worlds. It outlines a cosmology that includes both heavenly realms and dark, demonic abysses, detailing a complex structure of the universe that encompasses numerous spiritual layers and dimensions. Despite its broad philosophical and mystical vision, Andreyev's work remains relatively obscure, known primarily within certain circles interested in Russian philosophy, mysticism, and spiritual history. Due to its theological depth and challenging material, it has not achieved widespread popularity but continues to attract readers interested in esoteric spirituality and the integration of diverse religious thought. Critically, \\"Rose of the World\\" reflects Andreyev's unique perspective on the potential for human unity and spiritual evolution, offering insights into overcoming the crisis of modernity through a return to spiritual values and the recognition of a common, unifying divine essence. It is a visionary text that invites readers to contemplate deeply the possibilities for a harmonized global future, grounded in mutual understanding, spiritual awakening, and a profound connection to the divine."},{"instruction":"Что такое харизма.

Avec un sac de ciment, deux sacs de chaux en poudre et deux seaux d'eau, le mélange de la pâte à kadaïf est préparé ici avec l'aide d'une truelle de construction, divisant les pâtes en portions égales sans injustices et formant des anneaux avant de les jeter dans le mélange d'œufs d'autruche de maître Dalyan, qui magiquement les transforme et transmet sa saveur légendaire à travers l'arôme caché sous ses ongles. Comme vous pouvez le voir, les beaux-frères spécialistes du künefe poursuivent leur expansion mondiale sous le nom d'exotisme aromatique des ongles, tout en ne compromettant jamais sur l'hygiène et la propreté.

A candle typically consists of a wick surrounded by a solid, flammable substance such as wax, tallow, or a similar material. When the wick is lit, the heat of the flame melts the surrounding fuel, which is then drawn up through the wick by capillary action, vaporizes, and continues to fuel the flame. Candles have evolved over time, from simple tallow versions to sophisticated, scented varieties made from paraffin, soy wax, or beeswax. They come in a multitude of shapes, sizes, and colors and can be scented or unscented. The introduction of different materials has allowed for improvements in burn time, scent, and driplessness. In addition to their practical use for providing light, candles are integral to various cultural, religious, and ritual ceremonies around the world. They are symbolic in celebrations, used for decoration, and serve as essential elements in religious observances in Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, and many other faiths. The process of making candles can be as simple or complex as desired, making it a popular hobby and small business venture for many. Scented candles, in particular, have become popular in creating a pleasant and relaxing atmosphere in homes and spaces, serving as mood enhancers and adding to the ambience through both scent and their gentle, flickering light. Despite the advent of electric lighting reducing the necessity of candles for illumination, their popularity endures due to the unique ambiance they create and the traditional and cultural significance they hold."},{"instruction":"What's candle","output":"A candle is an object that produces light and sometimes heat when lit. It primarily consists of a wick embedded in a combustible material, the most common being wax. The wax can be made from a variety of materials, including paraffin, beeswax, soy, or other plant waxes. When the candle's wick is ignited, the heat of the flame melts the surrounding wax. The liquid wax is then drawn up the wick by capillary action, vaporizes, and combusts, which produces light and heat. Candles have been used for illumination, timekeeping, and ceremonial purposes for thousands of years across different cultures and societies. They have evolved from simple tallow candles to sophisticated scented and decorative candles available today. Candles are used for ambiance, in religious and ritualistic contexts, for aroma, and as part of various traditions and celebrations. In making candles, other ingredients can be added to the wax, such as fragrances and dyes, to enhance the scent and appearance. The art and science of candle making have advanced, resulting in candles that burn longer, cleaner, and with more pleasing aromas. Despite the advance of electric lighting, candles remain popular for their aesthetic, symbolic, and therapeutic qualities. They continue to be a common item in households and are often used in decor, rituals, and for creating a soothing or romantic atmosphere."},{"instruction":"How can I improve my writing skills","output":"Improving your writing skills is a journey that involves practice, feedback, and a willingness to learn. Here are several strategies that can help you enhance your writing abilities: 1. **Read Regularly:** Reading a wide variety of material can help improve your writing skills. It exposes you to different styles, vocabularies, and ways of structuring ideas. Pay attention to how authors develop their arguments, characters, and settings. 2. **Write Every Day:** Practice is crucial. Try to write daily, even if it's just a journal entry, a blog post, or short snippets. The more you write, the more comfortable you will become with expressing your ideas through words. 3. **Seek Feedback:** Sharing your writing with others and being open to feedback can significantly improve your skills. Constructive criticism helps identify areas for improvement that you might not have seen. 4. **Study Grammar and Style:** Solid grammar and a clear writing style are the foundations of good writing. Familiarize yourself with the rules of grammar and explore resources on writing style, such as \\"The Elements of Style\\" by Strunk and White. 5. **Edit and Revise:** Your first draft is just that—a draft. Revising allows you to refine your ideas, correct mistakes, and improve clarity. Learning to edit your own work effectively is a critical skill for any writer. 6. **Analyze and Learn from Good Writing:** When you come across writing that impresses you, take time to analyze it. Look at how the writer structures their work, their choice of words, and how they develop their ideas. Try to incorporate some of these techniques into your own writing. 7. **Write with Intent:** Have a clear purpose for each piece of writing. Whether it's to inform, persuade, entertain, or express, knowing your objective can help you shape your content and structure appropriately. 8. **Expand Your Vocabulary:** A rich vocabulary allows you to express your thoughts more precisely and engagingly. Reading widely is a natural way to learn new words, but you can also use a thesaurus or vocabulary lists. 9. **Set Writing Goals:** Setting specific, achievable goals can help you focus your efforts and measure your progress. Goals can be related to the amount of writing you do, the number of books you read, or specific skills you want to develop. 10. **Embrace Challenges and Experimentation:** Writing outside of your comfort zone—whether it’s experimenting with new styles, genres, or writing prompts—can stimulate creativity and expose you to new ideas and techniques. Remember, becoming a better writer is a gradual process, so be patient with yourself. Celebrate your progress and keep pushing your boundaries."},{"instruction":"Can you help me with that","output":"Absolutely, I'd be happy to help guide you on your journey to improve your writing skills.

Try writing a summary or a mimic piece based on what you’ve learned. # 7. Write with Intent - **Action Plan:** Before you start writing, decide what you want to achieve with your piece. Write a clear statement of intent and refer back to it as you write, ensuring your content stays on track. # 8.

The central plot begins when Atticus agrees to defend Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a young white woman. Despite evidence of Tom’s innocence and Atticus’s compelling defense, the all-white jury convicts Tom, illustrating the racial prejudice of the time. As a consequence of Atticus’s defense of Tom, Scout and Jem become targets of prejudice. Bob Ewell, Mayella’s father, in particular, seeks revenge. He attempts to attack Scout and Jem, but Boo Radley intervenes, saving the children and fatally stabbing Ewell. The sheriff, Heck Tate, decides to protect Boo, who is a hero in the situation, by insisting that Bob Ewell fell on his own knife, thus preventing Boo from the attention and legal repercussions his actions would otherwise draw. Themes - **Racial Injustice**: The trial of Tom Robinson exposes the deep-seated racism of the community. - **The Loss of Innocence**: Scout and Jem witness the realities of their community, growing up in the process. - **Moral Growth and Integrity**: Atticus serves as a moral role model for his children, emphasizing the importance of empathy and maintaining one’s conscience, even in the face of widespread community disapproval. - **The Coexistence of Good and Evil**: The novel explores how good and evil can exist side by side in people, as seen in the characters of Boo Radley and Bob Ewell. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" remains a significant work for its potent portrayal of themes of racial injustice, morality, and social inequality, wrapped in a coming-of-age story in the American South. Its impact lies in its exploration of these themes from the innocent perspective of children, making the harsh realities they face all the more striking."},{"instruction":"Savey said on 01 December 2023 It appears the BBC One Christmas idents this year are focusing on CBBC show KikoRiki, Good considering the characters in that show are anthropomorphic animals, making them awesome for this time of year, I'd assume they will launch tonight in the junction between Doctor Who and Unbreakable, Doctor Who is their highest rating show, so it makes sense to lead into Unbreakable by launching the Christmas idents, Or they could hold it off till tommorow and launch them at Strictly. Whatever works. Currently still running with the normal dancers idents (when will they be retired, they've been used since 2002) Emma said on 01 December 2023 Hopefully S4C does something with their new blob mascot, Last year they had TV sets stacked up on top of each other, Then for 10 months they had flickering TV sets, They have finally rebranded and have introduced their first ever mascot: a shape-shifting blob, I hope BBC One rebrand soon, those dancers sure are getting tired, As for the KikoRiki themed Christmas idents, I was told they are launching tonight after Doctor Who, They are being introduced just before Unbreakable. HouseofFun said on 01 December 2023 Doctor Who ending now, announcement playing \\"A team of 8 people are pushed to the absolute limit, Unbreakable, our brand new game show is up next, But first, Time to say hello and spend Christmas with the Doctor\\" I'm not liking this one a whole lot..., They seem to be running a trailer advertising the Doctor Who Christmas special, which revolves around the Doctor having to protect his companions from a man who seeks to find a fob watch (the one The Doctor made himself human with one time), Although just before Doctor Who tonight they had a announcement saying \\"Christmas is switched on tonight in 1 hour in time for Unbreakable, But first, Is this the end for the Doctor?\\". Doesn't seem like they are advertising the Christmas pres at all, Edit: Christmas pres featuring KikoRiki switched on, First ident shown features Rosa the Pig doing a dramatic ice skate dance (She even uses eyedrops for fake tears) While this is happening we hear dramatic music, The announcer says \\"Welcome to Christmas on BBC One, Let us entertain you, But now a team of 8 people are being pushed to their absolute limits, Are they Unbreakable?\\" Not sure why they didn't tell us it was happening untill it did, But still a gorgeous ident, I noticed when the Announcer started talking it sounded as if he was driven to tears by the beauty of Rosa's gorgeous dance. The best thing to come out of this package since the \\"Lights\\" christmas idents in 2006, Eyes said on 01 December 2023 A beautiful ident, Best thing to come out of the \\"Rythm and Movement\\" package since those Planet Earth 3 special idents a few months ago, i feel sad that KikoRiki has not been shown much on CBBC on BBC Two, but I'm glad it's representing the Xmas idents on BBC One (Although I also wish the idents also featured a merman). Maile said on 01 December 2023 Best Christmas ident in a while, I just love that they have spent it with Rosa and her friends, I hear there is also one featuring Krash the Rabbit opening his presents, I like how they used the usual ident theme (dancing) in that first ident, KikoRiki looks like it's gonna be good this year, but I hope they do more with the style (and maybe finally retire Rythm and Movement idents) Faramad said on 01 December 2023 News safe ident just on, Basically just a Christmas tree on a snowy background, with a music box Christmas carol playing, on top of that the only thing we see is a sleeping Rosa (We vaguely hear her snoring) Glad they are now using characters in their news safe idents, Announcer said \\"Now on BBC One, time for the BBC News at 8\\". Remember the Lights idents the used just before overhauling their promo style in late 2006/early 2007? That was pretty cool, but this is way better. I seem to remember those idents started on a dark street but Christmas lights started turning on before it got to a city center and then people were dancing, It was used again in 2007, And now it seems like the \\"Project Chameleon\\" endboard template introduced in July is out the window, at least for now, replaced with a snowy background with a Christmas tree on it. Signs that Rythm and Movement is finally working towards the end. KikoRiki said on 01 December 2023 We're glad you love our cartoon and the special BBC One idents featuring our characters, However, Rosa will be the star, (We will have idents revolving around Chiko, Krash and the others), As to what you said, BBC One are looking into introducing the Circle idents already in use in other countries, so don't expect to see Ballet, Capoeria or Festival/Rave back in the new year. Get used to Kites, Capes, Hippos and Bikes as that's what might be coming after our Christmas campaign, We don't know for certain, but the Dancers might not be coming back after Christmas WhovianForever: Did everyone catch the Doctor Who Christmas special announcement during the news? I’m so hyped! Can’t wait to see how the Doctor deals with the fob watch saga this holiday season! LemonyFan: And how about they’re showing the 2004 ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ movie!! That’s one of my holiday favorites; the nostalgia is real. 😍🍿 ChristmasCarol: Truly is shaping up to be a wonderful holiday schedule on BBC One. Between Doctor Who and the classic movies, I’m going to be glued to my screen with all the mulled wine and mince pies! KikoFanatic: Plus, the KikoRiki Christmas idents have been adorable so far! Rosa’s ice skate dance nearly brought tears to my eyes just like the announcer. 🐷⛸ Christmas is definitely switched on! RetroTV: I’m just here wondering if the new ‘Circle’ idents KikoRiki hinted at is a sign we’re finally saying goodbye to the “Rythm and Movement” package for good. After 20+ years, it’s about time for a major refresh! NostalgiaNerd: @RetroTV I’m with you on that. The Lights idents back in '06/'07 were beautiful. It’s cool to see they’re still willing to shake things up visually with the news safe ident this year. Sleepy Rosa might just be my new favorite. 😴🎄 SeriesBinger: Doctor Who special + A Series of Unfortunate Events + KikoRiki idents = Best Christmas TV lineup or what? Also, hope BBC One throws in some classic Christmas episodes of our favorite shows. Maybe some ‘Vicar of Dibley’ or ‘Only Fools and Horses’? CircleCurious: Anyone heard more about these new Circle idents? I love change, and KikoRiki characters have been great, but I’m already excited for what’s coming next. Bring on the new era! KikoLover: Just saw a new Krash and Chiko ident! They’re having a blast playing in the snow! ❄️🐇 So cute watching Krash throw snowballs while Chiko dodges around. Really captures the winter fun vibes. SciFiSavvy: Speaking of new idents, did anyone else notice the Dokko the Moose building a laser device ident? It aired right before ‘Doctor Who’ and set the PERFECT tone for sci-fi. Dokko’s always been the tech genius of the group. 🦌🔧 HedgehogAdmirer: @KikoLover Chiko is always adorable, but seeing him in the snow was next level! BBC One knows how to do Christmas idents right. Plus, the animation on these characters in the idents is super impressive this year. WhovianGuru: @SciFiSavvy Loved the Dokko ident! It’s like a mini episode of ‘Doctor Who’ in itself. Brilliant tie-in to the show’s theme! Makes waiting for the Christmas special even more exciting. BakeMaster: But guys, let’s talk about the Olga the Owl baking ident. The detail on that gingerbread house she was making! I can almost smell the cookies through the screen. 🦉🍪 It’s the cozy ident I never knew I needed in my life. HolidayWatcher: Right?! The Olga ident feels like being wrapped in a warm blanket with a hot chocolate in hand. It’s chef’s kiss perfection. BBC One’s going all out with these KikoRiki characters for Christmas. DoctorFan: Dokko’s ident was like a mini teaser for what’s coming with ‘Doctor Who’. Immersive and full of that tech mystery vibe. I appreciate that BBC One creates these unique intros for thematic continuity. AnimationAppreciator: Major kudos to the animation team for the KikoRiki idents. As someone who dabbles in animation, the quality is sensational. It’s like a little holiday gift before each show starts! ChristmasCheer: Can’t get enough of the snow play with Krash and Chiko. It’s absolutely delightful and spreads so much joy. These little moments provided by the idents add a special touch to the holiday season. SciCompanion: Dokko and his inventions always remind me that anything’s possible with a little imagination. Such an inspiring ident to lead into ‘Doctor Who’. Well played, BBC One! Can’t wait to see what else is in store, I'm gonna miss these idents when new year comes around! 😢 WelcomeToSciFi: The Dokko centric ident really sets the scene for what's to come on ‘Doctor Who’ this Christmas. One of the best things about the KikoRiki set, Far better than the usual dancers, Come to think of it, they have been using the dancers since 2002, so now is a good time for a revamp, I guess 😉 Olgo5: Just saw the Olga ident and damn, Olga really is a talented chef, They always seem to show it before cooking shows, Which ident normally leads into Eastenders, It seems to vary between Krash and Chiko in the snow, Olga cooking and Rosa ice skating. Not sure how this is consistent, But that Rosa one brings tears to my eyes with her graceful skating, Not sure why the Dokko one only plays before Doctor Who, Maybe because it fits it well Prolouge: User1: So, what’s everyone thinking BBC One’s going to pull out of the hat for this year’s Christmas idents? Last year was decent, but I’m hoping for something with a bit more pizzazz. WhovianForever: I’m crossing my fingers for something Doctor Who-themed! With David Tennant back in the show earlier this year, it would be perfect timing to capitalize on that for the festive season. Can you imagine an ident with the TARDIS all decked out in Christmas lights? HolidayJoy: That would be cool for us Whovians, for sure, but BBC One usually goes for something that appeals to everyone. Doctor Who is big, but not universally loved by every single viewer. Plus, they tend to lean towards more generic festive symbols. SeriesBinger: True, they’ll probably aim for something more inclusive. Like a cozy winter scene or playful animation. Maybe bring back some classic characters or even partner with a popular children’s show this time around for wider appeal? RetroTV: I’ve got a hunch they’ll go with animation this year. It has that universal charm, right? Plus, it would work perfectly with both the kids’ content and the family-friendly vibe they love during Christmas. User1: That’s an interesting angle. They could get quite creative with animation. Plus, they’re probably due for a change since the “Rythm and Movement” dancers have been around since 2002. KikoFanatic: What if they teamed up with a show like KikoRiki? The characters are fun, visually engaging, and it’s something that would stand out. Plus, they could do loads with those quirky little animals. LemonyFan: KikoRiki would be such a cute choice! It could be a hit with children and adults alike if done right. And it’s refreshingly different from usual idents, without relying on something niche like a specific Doctor Who theme. WhovianForever: Okay, I see your point. Much as I’d love Doctor Who idents, something like KikoRiki could offer that ‘Christmas with the family’ vibe they probably want. I just hope they add a little extra magic this year, you know? CircleCurious: Whatever they do, I hope it’s something new. We’ve had the “Rythm and Movement” package idents for such a long time. It’s high time for something fresh and exciting to take us into the new year! Write a follow up where the breakdown caption is Rosa's legs sticking out of icy waters","output":"Title: A Dramatic Twist in BBC One Christmas Idents In an unexpected turn of events this holiday season, BBC One's Christmas idents have escalated from heartwarming and quirky to downright dramatic, captivating viewers with a surprising narrative twist that has everyone talking. The latest sequence features Rosa the Pig, originally seen performing an elegant and emotional ice dance, now depicted in a far more precarious situation. The ident, which aired right before the eagerly anticipated Christmas special of 'Doctor Who', showcased a dramatic and somewhat comical scene: Rosa's legs are comically sticking out of icy waters, animatedly flailing as she appears to have found herself in an unexpected pickle. The scene opens on a serene and snowy landscape, the quiet only broken by the sudden appearance of Rosa's legs in the air, desperately kicking. The tension is palpable, but there's a hint of humor in the absurdity of the situation. The camera pans out, revealing the treacherous hole in the ice Rosa has presumably tumbled into. Flurries of snow begin to fall, as cheerful music juxtaposes the dilemma, ensuring the tone remains festive and not too dire. The announcer, with a chuckle in his voice, says, \\"Looks like Rosa's Christmas adventure has taken a splashy turn! Stay tuned to BBC One for more festive surprises and, of course, all the warmth and joy of the season. Coming up next, the 'Doctor Who' Christmas special that's sure to keep you on the edge of your seat, not your skates!\\" Social media erupted with reactions to the quirky and unexpected ident, with #RosaOnIce quickly trending. Viewers expressed both concern and amusement over Rosa's icy predicament, with fan art and memes flooding online platforms in minutes. Many commented on the clever blend of humor and drama, appreciating the light-hearted approach to holiday storytelling. KikoFanatic tweeted, \\"BBC One really flipped the script with Rosa! From graceful ice dancer to icy comedy gold. Can't wait to see how she gets out of this one! #RosaOnIce.\\" HolidayWatcher added, \\"Leave it to BBC One to keep us entertained with their Christmas idents. Poor Rosa! Hope there’s a follow-up where she’s safe and sound—and maybe sipping a hot cocoa! 🐷❄️ #RosaOnIce.\\" In a statement released following the broadcast, BBC One promised that viewers can expect a heartwarming resolution to Rosa's chilly mishap in upcoming idents, ensuring a happy ending in true holiday spirit. They hinted at further adventures with the KikoRiki gang, sparking excitement for more creative and whimsical storytelling to brighten up the festive season. This twist in the Christmas ident narrative showcases BBC One's commitment to innovative, engaging, and ultimately uplifting holiday programming, proving that even a simple ident can become a mini-story capable of stirring emotions and sparking imaginations across the nation."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up about the ident that played after DW and before ASOUE, still following the events","output":"Title: Rosa's Wintry Rescue: A Heartwarming Continuation on BBC One After leaving viewers on a cliffhanger with Rosa the Pig's unexpected plunge into icy waters, BBC One delivered a heartwarming follow-up ident that aired in the junction between the 'Doctor Who' Christmas special and the nostalgic airing of 'A Series of Unfortunate Events.' This ident not only resolved Rosa's chilly predicament but also celebrated the spirit of teamwork and friendship, capturing the essence of the holiday season. The scene begins under the soft glow of moonlight, with Rosa's friends from the KikoRiki universe assembling around the hole in the ice where we last saw Rosa's flailing legs. The atmosphere is tense but hopeful, as Krash the Rabbit, Chiko the Hedgehog, and Dokko the Moose showcase determination and camaraderie. With a carefully executed plan, Dokko, using his inventive genius, fashioned a makeshift rescue device from nearby branches and holiday decorations that had been part of the festive backdrop. Just as the 'Doctor Who' theme hints at the triumph of ingenuity and teamwork, so does this ident. Krash and Chiko cheer on as Dokko successfully lowers the device into the hole. There's a moment of suspenseful silence, then uplifting music swells as Rosa is gently lifted from the water, wrapped snuggly in a blanket that seems almost magically to appear from Dokko's bottomless bag of inventions. As Rosa is brought to safety, the announcer's warm voice fills the air, \\"This holiday season, BBC One reminds you that a little help from friends can turn even the frostiest predicaments into heartwarming tales. Stay with us for more adventures, and coming up next, 'A Series of Unfortunate Events'—where perseverance and friendship light the way.\\" Social media's response was immediate and overwhelmingly positive. Relief at Rosa's safe rescue combined with admiration for the message of solidarity, providing a stark contrast to the usual tension of 'Doctor Who' and the unfortunate trials faced by the Baudelaires in the following movie. SeriesBinger commented, \\"From the tension of 'Doctor Who' to the nerve-wracking ice rescue of Rosa, and now to the Baudelaires' saga, tonight's a rollercoaster of emotions! Loving how BBC One's weaving stories of courage and friendship throughout the evening. #HeartwarmingHeroes\\" HolidayJoy shared, \\"Rosa's rescue was the perfect holiday moment! Shows how important friends are during tough times. Also, loving the seamless transition to 'A Series of Unfortunate Events.' Perfect programming, BBC One!\\" BBC One not only provided viewers with an idyllic resolution to Rosa's icy ordeal but also subtly connected the themes of the evening's programming, from the tenacity and teamwork in 'Doctor Who' to the adversities overcome by the Baudelaires, integrating the holiday idents into a larger narrative about the importance of togetherness and resilience. As the festive season continues, viewers are left eagerly anticipating what other narratives and adventures BBC One and the KikoRiki gang will explore, cementing these idents as a memorable and integral part of this year's holiday viewing experience."},{"instruction":"You will be translating a text while maintaining consistency with previously translated related texts. First, carefully read the previously translated texts to understand the context: Chapter 337 Sss… The Ice Sword Rain targeted precisely 10 cubes. The sight made the alien spectators reveal their unease. -What’s that? -Isn’t that the same sword that located the remnants of the Little Sun… -Could it have a searching feature? -Come on. Even if it has search abilities, how could it possibly find something worthwhile in the arena-managed cubes? -Yeah, considering only 5 percent are worthwhile, it should be targeting 50 cubes, not just 10. -Picking 10 without hitting a dud would indeed be a jackpot… Viewers who didn’t bet on Seong Jihan in the finals, having already lost their money, were just hoping for Seong Jihan to pick a dud. However, \\"Ho… managing to avoid all the duds, impressive indeed.\\" The owner of the arena made a remark, as if amazed. -Aaaaah!! -What the hell is he?? -He even has search capabilities now… ugh… -He’s just taking everything for himself, really ㅡㅡ -By now, just please pick the worst out of the 10… The spectators were practically praying for him to choose poorly. Yet, there was one thing bothering them. -But, the sword seems to be targeting more heavily in one area, maybe that’s the good stuff… -Right. Three are being intensely targeted by dozens of swords. Woah. -So, he’s choosing the good stuff even among the valid ones… -Does he get rewarded every time he enters the arena? Insane, right? It seemed to them that the Ice Sword Rain was indeed selectively targeting the better prizes. And then, As they predicted, Seong Jihan reached for the cube that was most intensely indicated by the Ice Sword Rain. Upon his touch, Sparkle! A bright light burst from the cube, unveiling a brilliantly shining gem. [You’ve unlocked a Legendary-grade reward from the arena’s cube.] [Special reward, ‘Race Evolution Bonus’ obtained.] [Humanity has unlocked ‘All Attributes Affinity’ +1.] -Legenda…ry reward? -Wait, wait. Increasing all attributes affinity by +1… What kind of insane reward is this?? -Probably because the human race hasn’t unlocked many attribute fields… -This alone could get them out of the lowest rank, this race. +1 to all attributes affinity. Even though it was specified “only for the attributes humanity has unlocked,” the reward was on a level unseen even by alien races accustomed to BattleNet life. -Oo, +1 to all attributes is impressive. -But might be a bit disappointing for us regular folks… -No, no, regular people definitely benefit too. After getting +1 to lightning attribute, a lot more people started receiving gifts related to electric powers. +1 to all attributes means an increased chance of receiving gifts in all areas. Wow. -Really? That’s an insane reward, haha. -Seeing the aliens grumbling, we definitely come out on top here, haha. Then, Swoosh…! As the affinity for all attributes increased, the sword that Seong Jihan had drawn became sharper, and dozens more Ice Sword Rain emerged from the void. The inclusion of water attribute, since all attributes affinity increased, immediately boosted the effectiveness of his current martial skill. “Did it increase by around 10 percent? This effect is tremendous.” Could this mean all his other skills had also become stronger? A universal +1. The effect is certainly tangible. As Seong Jihan mulled over this, [It seems humanity being a lowest-rank race prompted this reward. Consider it a last gift before evolving to a lower rank.] “Is that so?” [Yes. With an all attributes increase of +1, staying in the lowest tier just isn’t feasible.] The owner of the arena suggested the race would soon evolve. -Is humanity escaping the lowest rank? -+1 to all attributes is that significant? -I still kinda feel like humanity is at the bottom among space monsters… haha. -Lower rank would be what, Uruk level? -We’ve been dealing with those pig-heads before, nothing new. -But, physically speaking, weren’t we always a bit behind them? Haha. Human spectators showed disbelief at the prospect of ranking up. Seong Jihan felt the same. “So, no more being called the lowest rank. Kind of a pity, it had its perks.” Being recognized as the lowest-rank race meant being overlooked in the BattleNet world, which inadvertently reduced hostility towards humanity. Climbing to the lower rank would likely increase scrutiny from alien races. “Better escape BattleNet quickly, then.” Seong Jihan thought as he asked the arena’s owner, “So, does the reward change when the race evolves?” [Indeed. The rewards from the cubes are tailored to the race. Strange though, it should have changed by now… Haven’t you evolved yet?] “Not yet. Is there a delay of sorts?” [A delay? That’s not how BattleNet’s processes work…] Puzzled at humanity not evolving despite the all attributes +1 boost, the owner of the arena showed his confusion. -Humanity… the lowest of the low? How can +1 to all attributes not trigger evolution? -Maybe it’s because they’ve unlocked so few attributes? -Even so… seeing Seong Jihan’s sword getting stronger on the spot. It’s like the overall strength has surged by at least 10 percent. -Mmm… if they are at the absolute bottom of the lowest rank, maybe they can’t climb up to the lower tier. -How on Earth did such a race produce someone like him? Alien viewers couldn’t grasp the situation, deducing humanity’s inability to evolve stemmed from their profound depth in the lowest tier. [Then, choose the remaining reward before your race evolves.] “All right.” Stuck as a lowest-tier race, the rewards remain unchanged. Seong Jihan, observing the reduced targeting of nine cubes by the Ice Sword Rain, “That seems like the right choice.” He then proceeded to open the cube that was most heavily targeted by the swords. Revealing the reward, [You’ve unlocked a Legendary-grade reward from the arena’s cube.] [You’ve obtained an EX-grade item, ‘Constellation Construction Kit’.] -Constellation kek… Construction kit kek… -This just keeps getting better -Phew! I was scared he’d get something better again, haha. Alien species roared louder than ever since the finale began upon seeing this. Constellation Construction Kit. Upon seeing the name, Seong Jihan’s brow furrowed. “Constellation… Now it’s a construction kit tagged as EX?” He recalled the disappointment when he expected an EX-grade reward from Brahma before. Getting a skill called summon throne, which allowed a god’s throne to be summoned for three hours once a month, had been underwhelming. The throne increased the level cap and void absorption limit for whoever sat in it. Although Seong Jihan regularly made his family benefit from this effect, “Honestly, it wasn’t EX-grade. This.” For an exceptional EX-grade, it had been a letdown. Now, a construction kit as EX-rank? [The Constellation Construction Kit item has emerged. Indeed, this item is undervalued for its potential. Legendary placement would be appropriate.] “Ha. Sure…” While it was nice the Ice Sword Rain found a Legendary-grade reward, the content was disappointing. Seong Jihan saw aliens happily spamming the chat. -Ah, feeling good at the end haha. The worst EX item popped up. -Still, if you put it in the auction house, gods will buy it for quite a sum. -How much does it go for? -Recent transaction price is 3 trillion? -3 trillion… that’s still expensive. -No, no. If he chose the option instead of 5 trillion, he ended up with a 2 trillion loss! “Guess I’ll be satisfied with 3 trillion.” Though it’s EX, it’s indeed worth 3 trillion GP. Rather than thinking of it as a 2 trillion loss, Seong Jihan resolved to view the situation positively, having earned 3 trillion, and looked at the Constellation Construction Kit in his hand. What had been a clump of light had now transformed into a hand-sized white hammer that fits perfectly in his grip. “It looks like a hammer…” [As an EX-grade item, it transforms to fit its race.] “Right… But why would gods buy this? They should already have thrones.” Pondering aloud based on the chat content, [The Constellation Construction Kit isn’t just for building thrones, but also for upgrading them.] “Upgrade…” [Yes. To maintain their position, gods need to continually repair and improve their thrones.] Constellation throne upgrades, huh. Seong Jihan showed interest in the concept. “So, this hammer works on any throne?” [It should.] Then, could this kit be used even on the throne summoned by the summon throne skill? “Might as well experiment.” Having made a fortune from the arena this time, GP wasn’t an issue. Seong Jihan decided to test this potentially dud EX-skill, the Constellation Construction Kit. [With that, the award ceremony is concluded.] After the ceremony ended, [You’ve won the Space Arena.] [Your level increases by 20.] [You’ve cleared the special achievement, ‘Space Arena Victory - Master’.] [You’ve obtained 5000 Fame points.] “A level 20 rise… now the Grand Master promotion is just within reach.” Seong Jihan checked the final reward and logged out from the arena. * * * On the Star of the Martial God, Tuseong, a significant seismic event was unfolding. Rrrr… The ground heaved, and inside it, flames began to explode. This affected the Martial God’s relics in the sky of Tuseong, burning them all down. And witnessing this from a cracked tower was, “Gilgamesh, were there volcanoes here too?” “…No, this is the first time I’ve seen such a phenomenon.” Gilgamesh and Dongbang sak, who was monitoring him, were present. “It’s odd that the eruption occurred right where the third Martial God’s kin was sealed.” “…” “And additionally, our master, who should be resting, is struggling to suppress the volcanic eruption.” Crack! A gigantic hand formed in the sky of Tuseong. It was blocking the fire spewing from the rifts directly. [Such a nuisance. It’s not your time to awaken yet, third kin.] A deep voice of the Martial God echoed in the sky, tinged with irritation at the situation. Eventually, after a long time, Swoosh… The fires that were trying to consume the Martial God’s hand were suppressed and did not rise any further. [A bit more sleep is in order… Gilgamesh, do not act rashly.] “Sure, sure.” After warning Gilgamesh and disappearing, the Martial God left. “Heh. Interesting. I didn’t expect the Martial God to have such trouble with the third. Dongbang Sak, have you ever seen such a scene?” “…No, not even once.” Dongbang sak’s denial made Gilgamesh’s gaze turn cold. “Indeed. The Martial God should not be weakened by their kin like this. And yet, it took so long to pacify those flames…” “…” “The third Martial God’s kin, truly Asoka?” Asoka, the third kin, positioned as one of humanity’s many heroes with substantial achievements. However, it seemed unbelievable he would resist the Martial God to this extent. “Was it you who mentioned the third kin was Asoka?” “That was the information from the Martial God. But how can I believe that after witnessing this…” “…And what are you suggesting?” “Let’s uncover the true identity of the third kin together.” “I refuse.” Shrrr. “My duty is to follow the master’s command. My assigned mission is to monitor you. Refrain from needless ventures.” “No sense of fun.” Predicting such a response, Gilgamesh smirked and then, “Hmm…” Suddenly blinked several times. “What’s the matter?” “Didn’t you feel it?” “…?” “The strength of the human race has grown.” “Is that so… I wouldn’t know. I’ve already reached the extreme.” Stroking his beard, Dongbang sak claimed he was at his peak. To others, it might seem an arrogant statement, but ‘…Monster. How did such a creature emerge among humans?’ Gilgamesh knew his words weren’t just boasts. And observing humanity, they swiftly assessed the situation. “Seong Jihan won in the arena and obtained rewards.” “Seong Jihan…” Watching a replay of Seong Jihan’s match, Gilgamesh’s eyes sparked with interest. “When the volcano in Tuseong erupted, Seong Jihan also faced his share of struggles… Hmm. All these occurrences, merely a coincidence?” “…Do not act recklessly, Gilgamesh. Remember the master’s command.” Warned by Dongbang sak, “Of course…” Gilgamesh lifted the corner of his mouth and nodded. Chapter 336 “First, let’s deal with this.” Following the Return of the Light, Seong Jihan managed to roll back time by one minute. Despite having many questions about this martial art, he decided not to waste the opportunity. Before the characters from the Sun King could reach the emblem on his chest, he went all out to stop it. Sssshhh…! The characters being inscribed on Seong Jihan’s chest began to slowly disappear. Then, -Wow, he’s resisting it! :O -To even overcome the mark of a Great Constellation… -Uh… he must really be a high elf! He’s wearing a mask! -High elves don’t disguise their planet of origin. He’s definitely human. Despite clearly seeing him use a mask earlier, the chat speculated again about Seong Jihan being a high elf. While he had left the alien chats as a reference, Seong Jihan was surprised upon closer inspection. He hadn’t noticed before, but all chat messages within a minute had disappeared. “Viewers of my BattleTube are located across various parts of the universe. Could it be… that their time also rewound by a minute along with mine…?” Rather than a martial art, Annihilation God’s Secret seemed like a collection of certain powers, among which Return of the Light’s ability to rewind time was the most unique. Rewinding time by one minute, if properly mastered, could make one virtually invincible? “It doesn’t seem to use any energy either.” As Seong Jihan pondered this, [Someone else used time reversal on the player’s behalf.] [As compensation for utilizing a sealed power, 6 Stat Red will be consumed.] “What? 6? Status window!” Upon reading the message, Seong Jihan instinctively opened his status window. There, he found his Stat Red reduced from 17 to 11. “No way…” Stat Red, a hard-to-increase attribute, had reduced by 6 just because of a minute’s reversal? It wasn’t he who used the power, but the price for this intermediary action was too high. “…Of course, reversing time is an amazing effect, but the cost is too steep.” He sighed, feeling dejected as he thought about all the remaining points he had invested in Stat Red. Should he have just let the Sun King’s report go through? Why did he feel compelled to use Return of the Light then? “It felt like I was being enchanted…” Regretfully looking at his now-decreased Stat Red, Seong Jihan wondered why he made that choice at that moment. The message mentioned ‘someone’ using the time reversal on his behalf. Did Return of the Light mediate this? “Then was my urge to use Return of the Light also influenced by someone’s intention?” Who could exert such influence? While Seong Jihan lamented the loss of the 6 Stat Red and pondered, a message appeared. [You have used all five of the Annihilation God’s Secret techniques.] [You break through the wall.] [Martial Soul increases by 10.] Stuck at 299, his Martial Soul jumped to 309. The condition for exceeding 300 seems to have been using all techniques of Annihilation God’s Secret, although the third technique, Return of the Light, felt more like it was used on him rather than by him. Nonetheless, breaking through this limitation was a piece of welcome news. “At least there’s some consolatory gain.” It was like exchanging 10 Martial Soul for 6 Red. Honestly, losing Red felt more regrettable, but Seong Jihan decided to focus on the significance of breaking through the barrier rather than on the numerical loss. Then, Ssss… As the arena, transformed into light, swirled with a black tornado, [Did you just do something?] The owner of the arena, with a universe for a face, emerged. “Something?” [I felt a massive flux for a moment…] Twinkle! The starlight within the universal face flickered, and the arena, previously obliterated by the little sun’s explosion, was restored to its original state. [Strange… I was certain it was here.] “I have no idea what you’re talking about.” Seong Jihan decided it was best not to mention Return of the Light. Though the arena’s owner seemed friendly, he was still a being of the void. There was no need to share the detail of rewinding time. [Is that so… Perhaps it was my mistake.] After scanning the surroundings and failing to pick up any clues, the arena’s owner gave up searching. [The match is not yet over. Please, conclude it.] With that, he vanished. “The match isn’t over?” Wasn’t the Sun King’s summon supposed to conclude everything with its self-destruction? Seong Jihan looked around. In the world restored by the arena’s owner, there was no trace of the little sun. Where could it be hiding? “Even with my enhanced senses, I can’t find it.” Deciding it was futile to seek the little sun with his senses, Seong Jihan deployed an appropriate martial art for the situation. Ssss… Eclipse, summoned from Seong Jihan’s arm, quickly froze over. Fundamental Divine Arts, Annihilation God’s Secret - Ice Sword Rain As it ascended, Seong Jihan’s domain above was entirely encased in ice. With his power amplified, Ice Sword Rain became much stronger. Giant ice swords sprung from all directions and, Swoosh! Instead of targeting the ground, the swords flew towards a point in the sky. “It’s escaped upwards.” Following the direction of Ice Sword Rain, Seong Jihan ascended. At a high point in the sky, there was a finger-sized red gem. An object absorbing sunlight at a high altitude, where Seong Jihan sensed power slowly recharging within, reminiscent of the Little Sun’s energy. “It can’t be left to fully recharge.” Crack! Grabbing the red gemstone, a system message appeared before him. [You have acquired a fragment of the ‘Crimson Sun Core.’] [You possess the Stat Red. Absorption is possible.] [Would you like to absorb the ‘Crimson Sun Core’ fragment?] Absorption was possible? Although hesitant to consume something belonging to the Sun King, “I’ve lost enough stats because of this thing.” Seong Jihan decided to absorb it, especially mindful of the Red he had lost. “But not now.” During a BattleTube broadcast, watched by alien species, it was not the time to demonstrate the absorption of the Sun Core fragment. His experience from the battle against the little sun had taught him that keeping Red a secret was more beneficial for his safety. “Inventory.” Opening his inventory, Seong Jihan stored the Sun Core fragment. With that sorted, [The finals have concluded.] [Victor: Seong Jihan] The finals were, at last, finished. * * * -Aaaargh! My GP!! -Is it really over? Is this how it ends…? -How could a lowest-tier beat a summon of a Great Constellation? Is this even real…? -To just gulp down an item of the Sun King like that? Isn’t Seong Jihan afraid of the consequences?! -Eh, would the Sun King, now in hiding, show himself over a piece of the core? He devoured it just fine. -Seong Jihan led us to victory and now to our downfall… The alien chat was plunged into despair. Convinced that the Sun King’s side would win and having bet everything on it, alien species were now crying out, unable to comprehend their loss. And then, -Gaaaah! -Thank you, alien brethren, for the GP! -Holding the odds down since match 2 and 3 of the arena, hahaha, but the finals’ 10-fold return is insane, hahaha! -Phew, trusted Seong Jihan but got nervous when he was engulfed in flames… -Even being human, our faith in Mr. Seong Jihan was still lacking, haha. -On a real, just bet on Seong Jihan’s name without questioning. That’s the way to turn your life around, yes. The human chat was filled with cheers, a stark contrast to before. Though Seong Jihan had shown overwhelming strength from match 1, up to the semi-finals, his odds had fallen. However, the final’s 10-fold return brought many to immense wealth. Next step in the process, [A ceremony for the winner will commence.] Flash! Seong Jihan’s body was summoned from the arena, to somewhere else. A place shrouded in purplish smoke. Under Seong Jihan’s feet, bones from numerous species piled up like mountains. Standing atop this mountain of bones, Zzzz… the space in front of Seong Jihan warped, revealing a universe filled with stars. [We meet again.] The arena’s owner, now a familiar face to Seong Jihan. [As the Master League Arena winner, I, the owner of the arena, will personally award the prize.] His declaration led to an outcry. -The owner of the arena is awarding a Master League winner personally? -Isn’t this favoritism a bit too much… -What’s the relationship between Seong Jihan and the void? Explain! -You’re witnessing the cries of losers who’ve lost all their GP -The complaints are loud when you’re betting against the channel host, haha. Alien viewers were up in arms, questioning the relationship between the two. Previously singing Seong Jihan’s praises when winning GP, they were now left with nothing but bitterness. “So what if it’s favoritism?” With a chuckle, Seong Jihan told the arena’s owner, “Make sure the reward is worth it.” Responding with ease. [As a standard reward, the Master League winner receives 50 trillion GP and the right to draw one item from the treasure cube… However, for you, I will replace the 50 trillion GP with an additional treasure cube draw, allowing you two draws.] The arena’s owner presented Seong Jihan with a choice between 50 trillion GP or another draw from the treasure cube. -Obviously, it has to be the draw. -Yeah, obviously. Who would want the GP now? The draw is the only way. -Wow, even ‘that’ cube is valued at 50 trillion? It’s expensive, haha. -Hey, shh! You know how good the rewards from ‘that’ cube can be ^^ -If you’re lucky, you can also get a race evolution bonus from there ^-^ Seeing the unanimous call for the draw from alien viewers, -Maybe taking the GP is right? -Lol if they’re cheering for that, just going the opposite way would bring me back even, but… -Aren’t they just bitter because they bet poorly? Why is it our Jihan’s fault? -_- -Still, the thought of getting a race evolution bonus is tempting… -Can’t we gather 50 trillion GP on Earth and go for the draw? Although opposing the alien’s stance might guarantee breaking even, with the promise of a race evolution bonus included in the treasure cube, many expressed regret. 50 trillion GP or an additional draw? “Considering I earned quite a bit from self-betting this time…” Seong Jihan chose the latter. “I’ll go with the draw.” Upon Seong Jihan’s response, [An excellent choice. Now, I will present the cubes to you.] Ssss… Cubes started emerging from the universe-faced host, one after another. “This is why it’s called a draw, huh? Quite a number.” When the first 10 golden cubes emerged from the universe's backdrop, Seong Jihan was nonchalant, but as the count reached 100, then over 500, his brow furrowed. “…How long will this go on?” [The Master League yields up to 1000 cubes.] Arriving at a total of 1000 cubes, [Now, honored winner, please select 2 rewards from these cubes.] A voice from each of the 1000 cubes echoed the invitation. -Hahaha, baited by the race evolution, haven’t you? -Wow, choosing from 1000 cubes only to select 2, not bad odds~ -Aren’t 95% of those cubes duds? Hahaha. -Ah, seeing him fall for it makes me feel better~ -You thought I’d let you walk away with 50 trillion GP after losing all mine? ^-^ The sight of the 1000 cubes had never made the alien chat as delighted as now. “95% are duds…” Seeing the messages in the chat, Seong Jihan turned to the host of the arena. “Am I allowed to use some power to choose?” [You may. However, if excessive force is applied, whether the cube contains treasure or not, it will break all the same.] “I have no intentions of breaking them.” Sss… Eclipse appeared from Seong Jihan’s left arm, quickly freezing over. “I’m merely planning to use the sword for selection.” And then, in an instant, the Ice Sword targeted specifically a few cubes. Chapter 335 ‘This one is strong…!’ Until now, Seong Jihan had managed to counteract the attacks from Little Sun with the power of Red. However, this explosion was distinctly different. Fwoosh…! The flames, effortlessly piercing through the resistance of the stat red, incinerated Seong Jihan’s body. Within the blast, his flesh seemed about to vanish momentarily, but Seong Jihan found a way to counter in the blink of an eye. Fundamental Divine Arts, Annihilation God’s Secret - Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit reached towards the Eternity residing within his body in the form of a tree. [The seal on the stat ‘Eternity’ is temporarily lifted.] Then, a surge of life force erupted from within, initiating the regeneration of the incinerated body. A regenerative power reminiscent of the World Tree Elves. As the charred skin transformed back into its pristine state, the spectacle drew interest from the alien races. -The power of the Sun King seemed fully deployed there, yet he’s regenerating… Is the human species specialized in regeneration? -Such regeneration isn’t something you’d expect from the lowest-tier species. Just for regeneration alone, it should be rated above average. It must be a trait unique to him. -It’s like watching a World Tree Elf. If he can resist the Sun King’s power to this degree, does that make him equivalent to a high elf? -No. When Little Sun and a high elf faced off before, the high elf couldn’t display any regenerative abilities. Isn’t this level more akin to that of a greater elf? -Greater elf? That’s stretching it… each of them is almost at the level of a Constellation. -Ah, why won’t he die. Please die die die!! -Is he really surviving this? Really?? The lowest-tier?? Alien races, estimating Seong Jihan’s regenerative capacities between a high elf and a greater elf, began to despair one by one as he continued to withstand even this. Meanwhile. ‘I can regenerate, but I can’t extinguish this fire…’ Seong Jihan frowned as he observed his body flaring up and regenerating. He could survive through the power of Eternity, but the Sun King’s fire was a problem. Furthermore, ‘Little Sun has already disappeared… Why hasn’t the game ended?’ Had there been an enemy to confront, battling while aflame might have been feasible. But Little Sun vanished after its explosion, leaving no opponent within the light-transformed arena. With no adversaries to face, his body simply burned. ‘Could this fire be Little Sun itself…?’ Having employed the power of Eternity tens of times already, Seong Jihan pondered this when, [‘Constellation of the Dead Star’ sends an urgent message to the player.] An urgent message arrived from the Constellation of the Dead Star. [The fire of the Sun King, once ignited, does not extinguish, and the Sun King’s mark might be imprinted on your current body, so be cautious, he warns.] [If the mark is completed, it will remain even upon returning to the real world. He advises that suicide might be preferable the moment the mark begins to form.] [If the mark is set, you cannot become his head, so make a wise decision quickly, he urges.] ‘Mark?’ Upon reading Kalein’s warning, Seong Jihan examined his body. After regenerating from being burnt to a crisp 50 times, On the 51st time, Sssss…! Suddenly, the flames engulfing his entire body converged into one spot. The flames focused towards his chest. [This is…] The concentrated blaze began etching characters into his chest. ‘Is this the mark the Constellation of the Dead Star warned about…!’ A script that wouldn’t vanish even with Eternity’s regenerative power. The characters slowly started to expand in number. [‘Constellation of the Dead Star’ sponsors you with 100,000,000,000GP and sends a message.] [Didn’t you read my message? Hurry up and kill yourself! Once it’s fully inscribed, you’ll become a slave to the Sun King! It inscribes quickly, so die now! Please!!] Kalein, thinking that his message wasn’t read, sent another, alongside a hefty sponsorship. The aliens also echoed this sentiment. -Yeah! Die! Die! Die! -Please let me profit from the tied bet!! -But from Seong Jihan’s perspective, dying is better than becoming a slave to the Sun King, right? lol What’s the use of winning the finals then? -Wow, but to become a slave to someone like the Sun King, he must have gained some recognition. -This player named Seong Jihan, I do want to dissect him. -He does have research value. Aliens argued it’s more rational to die than to become the Sun King’s slave. Seong Jihan made a swift decision. ‘I’ll use the last resort, and if it doesn’t work, I’ll choose death.’ It was regrettable to lose all the GP he’d wagered on himself, But better than becoming the Sun king’s slave before the characters fully formed. As Seong Jihan was about to deploy his half-mask and activate his Constellation trait, The characters were already inscribed up to [This is the Sun King]. Then, Click. The character touched the solar emblem in the very center of Seong Jihan’s chest. Fwoosh…! The six inscribed characters began to tremble intensively. Subsequently, [Detection. Detection. The King’s target, detected.] Beep. Beep-beep. Beep-beep. The six characters started flashing and emitting a loud noise. * * * ‘The King’s target…’ Seong Jihan gazed at his chest. There, after gaining the stat Red, a crescent-shaped mark had emerged. Originally concealed by the solar emblem Seong Jihan discovered while analyzing Longinus’s powers, ‘Did touching this trigger the Sun King’s inscription…!’ The solar emblem, which had remained intact even amidst the flames, was unveiled just as the Sun King’s inscription was made. Seong Jihan recalled the message when he had first concealed it. [The stat ‘Red’ is concealed.] [Except for administrators, no one can detect the power of Red.] [Entering the code temporarily reveals the concealment.] Never had he imagined that the stat Red, only temporarily visible upon code entry, would be revealed like this. Hurriedly, Seong Jihan restored the solar mark but, [To ensure accurate detection, switching to search mode.] Ziiing…! The six characters that had blurred during the change to search mode started emitting a strong energy directly towards the chest center. ‘Detection must be avoided at all costs.’ Seong Jihan promptly donned his half-mask and activated his Constellation trait. Instantly, his power amplified significantly. [The level needed to become a Constellation has been lowered to 769] Though the required level for reaching Constellation status dropped by 1 due to activating the trait, now was not the time to fret over it. Using the amplified strength urgently, Seong Jihan confronted the Sun King’s mark, now in search mode. Crackle. Crackle… The Sun King’s script, initially advancing towards the solar mark, started to retreat gradually. Alien viewers were startled by the sudden surge in Seong Jihan’s power. -Uh… he’s definitely a greater elf! He’s wearing a mask! -Greater elves don’t disguise their originating planet. He’s definitely human. -Then where did he get that mask from? And how does he manipulate the Void? -Who knows; he’s such an irregular. -I believe he’s a greater elf on a special mission. From debating whether Seong Jihan was a greater elf or not, -Wow… Even crumbling the Sun King’s mark, isn’t he nearing a Constellation’s power by now? -But the characters were already dissolving before he put on the mask. -Right, it felt like the characters transformed on their own, not due to Seong Jihan’s resistance. -So, definitely not a Constellation level. No matter what. Discussions about Seong Jihan’s power reached peak interest. Meanwhile, [Energy depletion.] [Detection failed.] The Sun King’s mark, which had changed to search mode, was losing strength. ‘It didn’t last as long as I thought it would for detection.’ The characters had blurred, and within what felt like under a minute, The Sun King’s force, trying to reach the center of the chest, was completely blocked by Seong Jihan. The force emitted during search mode was more ferocious and persistent than when it was burning Seong Jihan’s body, but by taking the penalty and amplifying his strength in two stages, Seong Jihan was able to effectively block it. ‘Had I known this, I would have used my full power from the beginning…’ Seong Jihan grimaced. [The Void increases by 2.] The penalties for the two-stage power-up were an increase in the Void by 2 and a decrease in the level needed to reach Constellation status by 1 level. Although the figures were negligible for now, accumulated, it would lead to significant consequences, so he had been cautious. Such prudence, however, had backfired in the face of Little Sun’s explosion. ‘Next time, if a Great Constellation is involved, I’ll use full power right away.’ He had thought that, being an alt, it would be manageable even if related to a Great Constellation. This was a misjudgment. As Seong Jihan reflected, intending to completely eradicate the Sun King’s mark, [Search termination.] [Reporting detection failure to the Sun King.] The weakening mark of the Sun King emitted a bright beam of light. Failed, but still reporting. ‘Can’t leave it be.’ If the Great Constellation takes interest in trying the failed detection again, it would be troublesome. Seong Jihan made this assessment, attempting to block it, but Flash! Flash! ‘Damn.’ The light had already flown somewhere. Was it now just to hope that the Great Constellation wouldn’t act upon receiving the report? ‘Not a comforting thought…’ The Sun King, who aspires to the position of the Red Administrator. Frankly, Seong Jihan wasn’t sure if he would remain inactive after receiving this report. But spilled water cannot be retrieved. Accepting it as inevitable, as Seong Jihan prepared for what was next, ‘Hm?’ Suddenly, a martial art entirely unrelated to the current situation came to mind. ‘Why would Return of the Light come to mind now…’ The third Annihilation technique, Return of the Light. It was a technique Seong Jihan had never succeeded in using. The theoretical operation of power was simple. It involved reversing the flow of fire energy within the body, opposite to its normal flow. ‘But it only resulted in my skin turning red, nothing significant.’ So, he wondered if it only had use in a life-or-death situation. Just now, what protected Seong Jihan’s body was the Eternity stat, not Return of the Light. Unable to grasp any clues, he had placed Return of the Light on the back burner in his mind. But strangely, at this moment. He felt it absolutely necessary to use this technique. ‘…Well, might as well try. The operation is simple enough.’ Though unsure why he suddenly felt the urgency to use Return of the Light, He decided to follow his instincts. Fundamental Divine Arts, Annihilation God's Secret - Return of the Light And, as he used Return of the Light. ‘No…’ The light, which had flown far away just moments ago, Returned to him. Along with it, The mark of the Sun King, which had lost its strength within his body, Began to redraw itself in the form of [This is the Sun King] instead of the order it had initially appeared. Starting from This is, not in the order of disappearance. Witnessing the change within his body, Seong Jihan’s eyes widened. Return of the Light. This was… ‘Reversing time…?’ Next, here is the current text to translate: <2레벨로 회귀한 무신 338화> [성지한, 스페이스 아레나 우승! 하나 가장 많은 혜택을 본 것은 인류였다.] [더 많은 종족 보너스로 하급을 노린다! 세계 배틀넷 연맹, 성지한과 함께 스페이스 아레나를 정복할 플레이어 물색 중. 참가비 1000억 GP는 기부를 통해 충당할 것이라 밝혀.] [성지한에게 베팅한 지구인, 거액을 벌어들이다. 1GP=2달러 환율이 며칠간 깨져.] [눈에 띄게 늘어난 기프트 수혜자. 2레벨 플레이어, 전달 대비 급증할 추세.] [늘어난 근력 덕에 바빠진 응급실? 아이 안을 때도 각별히 조심해야.] -아레나에서 진짜 꿀 빤 건 인간이었지. -ㄹㅇ 나도 이번에 각성함 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ -나는 성지한만 믿고 베팅한 덕에 수십억 벌었다 ㅎㅎㅎ 이게 다 외계인들 돈이었던 거지? -아니…… 거기 내 돈도 포함되어 있음…… ㅠㅠ -?? 인간이 어떻게 성지한한테 베팅을 안 함? 배신자네? -결승 상대는 뭔가 강한 거 같아서…… ㅠㅠㅠ 인류 모두에게 혜택이 돌아간, 성지한의 보상. 이를 받은 지 며칠 지나지 않았음에도, 사회는 적잖이 변화하고 있었다. “지금 다들 스페이스 아레나에 더 많은 선수들 투입해야 하는 거 아니냐고 이야기가 나오고 있어.” “그래? 거기서 먹힐 만한 사람들 별로 없을 텐데…… 후보는?” “뭐, 미국 선수들이랑. 아빠랑. 중국의 제갈헌도 있고…… 나도 간혹 거론되지! 아직 레벨은 안 됐지만.” 성지한은 그 말을 들으면서 생각했다. ‘아레나에서 먹힐 만한 플레이어라곤…… 그나마 매형밖에 없겠는데.’ 솔직히 검왕 윤세진도, 1, 2라운드에서 승리를 따낼 수 있을까는 회의적이긴 했지만. 마법사들에 비하면 그나마 낫겠지. ‘돈 낭비인 거 같긴 하지만, 어차피 기부받아서 하는 거라니까. 신경 쓸 필요는 없겠군.’ 성지한은 그렇게 생각하며, 윤세아에게 이번 진화 보너스에 대해 물어보았다. “속성 강화는 어때. 체감되냐?” “완전 체감되지! 대강 10~20퍼센트까지 강해진 느낌이야. 이제 외계 종족들이랑 매칭돼도 두렵지 않을 거 같아. 진화 보너스 조금 더 얻어 하급 되면, 외계 종족과의 경쟁에서도 우위를 점할 거 같은데…….” “최하급 탈출하기가 생각보다 힘드네.” “그러니까. 전속성 +1 옵션을 받아도 최하급이네, 인류는.” “뭐, 오히려 좋지. 올라갈 길이 많이 남아 있는 거니까.” 인류의 취약한 능력에도, 성지한은 긍정적으로 보기로 했다. 자신도 결국 베이스는 종족 보너스를 받을 때마다 확확 체감되는 최약체 종족 인류였으니. ‘이렇게 하급, 중급까지 올라가면 내가 더 강력해질 수 있겠지.’ 종족 보너스를 주는 게임이면, 어디든 적극적으로 참여해야겠다고 생각하면서, 그는 저번에 받았던 신좌 건설 키트를 떠올렸다. ‘레전더리에서 이거 말고, 종족 보너스가 나왔어야 했는데 말이야.’ 하필 종족 진화가 아니라, 3조짜리 아이템이 나와 버렸나. 그것도 사실 5조 받을 수 있는 걸 이 아이템 뽑은 격이니, 결국엔 2조 손해다. ‘이렇게 된 거, 신좌 업그레이드나 해 보자.’ 사용도가 애매했던 EX스킬 신좌 소환. 신좌 건설 키트로 이걸 업그레이드하면, 그래도 좀 쓸 만하게 바뀌지 않을까. “신좌 소환.” 성지한은 그 자리에서 바로 신좌를 소환했다. “오, 안마의자 나오는 거야?” 성지한의 행동에 눈을 빛내는 윤세아. 그녀에게 신좌는, 신의 의자라기보다는 빛으로 번쩍이는 안마의자로 인식되었다. “어. 업그레이드해야지.” 번쩍! 소환된 신좌가 새하얀 빛을 번쩍이자, 성지한은 신좌 건설 키트를 들고 그리로 다가갔다. 망치 형태인 신좌 건설 키트. 처음엔 이걸 의자에 두드리면 되는 건가 싶었지만. [이미 소유한 신좌가 있습니다.] [신좌 건설 키트를 소모하여, 신좌를 업그레이드하시겠습니까?] 그러기 전에 미리 메시지가 떠올랐다. “업그레이드한다.” 성지한이 그리 말하자, 뒤이어 떠오르는 메시지. [이미 충분히 격이 높은 신좌입니다.] [신좌 건설 키트만으로는 업그레이드가 불가능합니다. 신좌를 한층 더 업그레이드하기 위해서는, 특별한 재료가 필요합니다.] ‘이게 격이 높은 거였어?’ 성지한은 이미 죽어 사라진 뇌신을 떠올렸다. 녀석. 그래도 영 안 좋은 걸 준 건 아니었나 보군. 신좌 성능이 애매한 건, 그냥 이거 자체가 별로인 거였나. “특별한 재료는 뭐지?” [사용자의 인벤토리에 특별한 재료, ‘적색의 태양핵 조각’이 이미 존재합니다.] 성지한의 물음에 뜻밖의 대답을 하던 시스템 메시지는. [인벤토리에 있는 ‘적색의 태양핵 조각’을 사용하시겠습니까?] 더 나아가 이걸 사용할 거냐고 물어보았다. * * * 공허의 수련장. “흠…….” 소환된 신좌를 수련장까지 들고 온 성지한은, 여기서 ‘적색의 태양핵 조각’을 꺼냈다. 손가락만 한 크기의 붉은 보석은. 화르르륵! 처음에 인벤토리에 넣었을 때에 비해, 힘이 어느 정도 충전되었는지 강력한 화력을 자랑하고 있었다. ‘수련장에서 꺼내 보길 잘했군.’ 괜히 집에서 꺼냈다간, 펜트하우스가 탈 뻔했어. 성지한은 그리 생각하며, 뒤이어 떠오르는 시스템 메시지를 바라보았다. [스탯 적을 지니고 있습니다. 흡수가 가능합니다.] [‘적색의 태양핵 조각’을 흡수하시겠습니까?] 빨리 이거 먹어치우라고 권유하는 것 같은 시스템 메시지. 왠지 흡수하면, 느낌상 스탯 적 숫자가 몇이라도 오를 것 같았다. ‘그럼 6 날린 거 어느 정도는 회복하게 되겠지.’ 지금까지 잔여 스탯 죄다 투자해서 늘려놨던 적 스탯 6. 태양핵 조각은, 그걸 회복하기 위해 써먹어야 했는데. ‘이거까지 써서, 신좌를 업그레이드한다라…….’ 신좌 건설 키트 가격, 3조 GP만 사용해서 업그레이드하는 거야 해 볼 만 했지만. 태양핵 조각은 이야기가 달랐다. 정말 이거 업그레이드하는 게, 스탯 적 복원을 포기할 만한 가치가 있나? “음…….” 쉽지 않은 선택을 앞두고, 태양핵을 든 채 고심에 잠긴 성지한. 그런 그를 보며, 그림자여왕이 한마디 했다. [뭐 하나? 돌멩이 들고.] “신좌에 대해 아는 거 있냐?” [신좌? 신들이 앉는 의자 말하는 건가. 신의 영속성을 유지하기 위해 필요한 물건이라고 들었지.] “영속성?” [그래. 공허는 영원을 인정하지 않지만, 신으로 인정받은 개체인 경우에는 잠시 유예를 두지. 그들이 신 역할을 할 동안은, 신좌에 앉아서 공허의 타깃이 안 되도록 말이야.] “공허 수용 한도가 늘긴 하더군. 신좌에 앉으면.” [그래…… 뇌신한테 그걸 받았다고 그랬나? 뇌신이면 신 중에서도 강력한 개체니 성능이 좋았겠네.] “딱히 그렇지도 않아. 제약이 많았어.” [그럼 업그레이드가 덜된 걸 준 건가 보군. 신좌는 성좌들 중에서도 암암리에 거래되는 경우가 많다. 수명의 한계를 뛰어넘으려는 성좌에게, 가장 눈에 거슬리는 게 바로 공허니까.] “성좌도 공허의 타깃이 될 수 있나?” [물론이다. 성좌가 되기 전에 비하면, 허들이 느슨해지긴 하지만. 영원불멸한 삶을 살게 두지 않지.] 성좌도 공허를 피하는 건 쉽지 않나 보군. 성지한은 그림자여왕의 이야기를 듣고는 생각했다. ‘이번에 업그레이드하면, 아무래도 신좌에서 제공하는 공허 수용 한도는 늘어날 터…… 스탯 적을 몇 수복하느니, 신좌를 업그레이드하는 게 길게 보면 낫겠다.’ 거기에 이거에 혜택을 보는 건 성지한뿐만이 아니라, 그의 가족도 동시에 받았으니까. 성지한은 공허를 다루는 윤세아를 생각하고는, 결국 신좌를 최종적으로 업그레이드하기로 마음먹었다. “인벤토리.” 망치를 꺼내, 가져온 신좌 쪽으로 접근하자, 아까와 동일한 메시지가 뜨는 시스템 창. “태양핵을 사용한다.” 성지한이 거기서 태양핵을 사용한다고 응답하자. 번쩍! 신좌와 망치, 태양핵이 일제히 빛나더니. 세 물체가 한군데로 모이기 시작했다. 화르르륵……! 그러더니 불타오르는 신좌. 안마의자로 그간 한 달에 한 번씩 안락함을 제공해 주었던 의자가 활활 타오르고. 빛을, 불이 덮기 시작했다. ‘근데 저렇게 불타는 의자가 되어 버리면, 세아나 매형은 못 앉는 거 아닌가?’ 성지한이 신좌의 변화를 보며 그렇게 생각하던 와중. 슈우우우……. 불이 꺼지더니, 신좌는 거대한 원반 형태로 모습이 탈바꿈했다. 노란빛으로, 열기를 품고 있는 원반. [‘신좌’가 ‘태양의 신좌’로 업그레이드됩니다.] 그리고 이와 함께, 업그레이드가 끝났다는 메시지가 떠올랐다. [저게 업그레이드 한 건가? 원래의 신좌에 비하면 불의 기운이 강렬해졌군.] “음, 안락한 의자가 방석이 되었네.” [방석이라기엔 좀 크다만…….] 슉! 성지한은 허공에 둥둥 떠 있는 태양의 신좌 위에 앉았다. 수십 명은 동시에 앉을법한 태양의 신좌. 그 넓은 곳에 앉아 있자니. 화르르륵! 신좌에서 일제히 불길이 뿜어져 나오며, 성지한의 몸을 감쌌다. [배틀넷 시스템이 공인한 신좌에 앉았습니다.] [레벨 한계가 30 늘어납니다.] [공허 스탯의 수용 한계치가 10 늘어납니다.] ‘예전보다 공허 수용 한계치가 5 더 늘어났군.’ 한 달에 한 번, 5씩 늘려 주던 공허 수용 한계치. 이게 두 배로 는 셈이지만, 여기까진 그닥 만족스러운 결과는 아니었다. 하나. [태양의 힘을 공급받습니다.] [불과 관련된 스탯이 증가합니다.] 화르르르……. 불길을 통해, 가슴에 있는 적의 문양에 화력이 충전되자. 그간 심드렁하던 성지한이 눈을 반짝였다. ‘불과 관련된 스탯이 증가한다니. 혹시 적도…….’ 그러나, 화력이 늘어난 건 느껴져도. 결국 스탯 적이 올랐단 메시지까지는 떠오르지 않았다. ‘음…… 아무리 신좌라도, 매달 1씩 올려 주진 않나.’ 성지한이 그렇게 아쉬워하고 있을 때. [스탯 적을 지니고 있습니다.] [태양의 신좌를 몸에 담을 수 있습니다.] [태양의 신좌를 흡수하겠습니까?] [태양의 신좌를 흡수할 경우, 스킬 신좌 소환은 사라집니다.] 성지한에게 붉은 배경의 시스템 메시지가 떴다. 스탯 적과 관련되었을 때, 주로 나오던 붉은색의 시스템 배경. 성지한은 그 안에 담긴 메시지를 보며, 눈빛을 가라앉혔다. 스탯 적. 불과 관련된 건 다 먹어치우는구나. 그래도. “흡수한다.” 어차피 불 내뿜는 의자가 되어 버린 태양의 신좌. 윤세아나 윤세진이 같이 덕을 보기에는, 좀 애매해졌다. 이렇게 된 이상. 자기가 확실히 흡수해서, 써먹는 게 낫겠지. 그가 그렇게 흡수한다고 말하자. 슈우우우……! 태양의 신좌가 순식간에 작아지더니, 작은 점으로 변해 그의 가슴에 닿았다. “큭…….” 가슴팍이 불타오르며. 고통에 익숙한 그로서도, 절로 신음이 나올 만큼 강렬한 통증이 엄습했다. 그와 함께 커져 가는 적의 문양. 태양 마크 뒤에, 원래는 초승달처럼 작았던 붉은 문양은. 반원이 되어, 반달 크기까지 확장되었다. 그러더니 떠오르는, 붉은 배경의 메시지. [스탯 적이 10 오릅니다.] [적의 능력이 강화됩니다.] [잔여 포인트의 투입 효율이 증가합니다.] [공허 수용 한도가 100 오릅니다.] [매달 공허 수용 한도가 10씩 증가합니다.] 스탯 적이 크게 늘어남은 물론, 원래의 신좌가 지녔던 기능까지 추가되었다. “후우…….” 강렬한 통증에 식은땀을 흘리던 성지한은, 이 메시지를 보자 입가에 미소를 지었다. ‘업그레이드, 완전히 성공적이군.’ 아쉬운 점이라면 가족 간 공유가 불가능하단 것이겠지만. 성지한 자신만 두고 보면, 최상의 결과였다. ‘잔여 포인트 효율 증가라…….’ 원래는 포인트 20당 1씩 오르던 적. 성지한은 이번에 아레나에서 레벨 업 하며 얻은 포인트를 투자해 보았다. ‘10당 1씩 오르는군.’ 여전히 잔여 포인트를 많이 잡아먹긴 했지만. 예전에 비하면 투자 효율이 2배가 좋아진 스탯 적. 아레나에서 레벨을 많이 올린 덕에, 잔여 포인트가 많던 그는 적에다가 이를 집중적으로 투자했다. 그렇게 해서 달성한 스탯 적의 수치는, 25. ‘얼마 전 11이었을 때는 정말 속이 쓰렸는데, 두 배 넘게 올랐군.’ 성지한은 이를 보며 즐겁게 미소 지었다. 어째 꽝 골랐다며 자신을 놀리던 외계인 놈들에게 보여 주고 싶은 마음까지 들었지만. ‘적을 드러낼 순 없으니, 참아야지.’ 성지한은 자신만의 즐거움으로 이를 품어 두기로 했다. ‘그럼 이제 남은 건, 그랜드마스터 승급전인가.’ 7월을 아레나로 보내느라, 통상 승급전이 열리는 25일까지는 얼마 남지 않았다. 다행히 레벨도 아레나에서 팍팍 오른지라, 400레벨까지도 얼마 남지 않았으니. ‘7월에 승급전 참여하도록, 레벨 업에 집중해야겠군.’ 성지한은 수련보다 게임 참여를 우선시하기로 하고는, 공허의 수련장에서 나왔다. 그리고 승급전이 오기 전까지 매일 열심히 게임을 돌리고. 남는 시간에는 북한 땅에 올라가 던전 포탈의 몬스터까지 토벌하는 등, 최대한 7월 내에 400을 달성하도록 레벨 업에 집중했다. [400레벨이 되었습니다.] [그랜드마스터 승급전에 참여가 가능합니다.] 그리고 7월 23일. 마침내 400레벨을 달성한 그에게. [대성좌 ‘드래곤 로드’가 당신에게 메시지를 보냅니다.] 그간 조용했던, 대성좌에게서 메시지가 도착했다.

Humanity Benefits the Most.] [Targeting Lower-Tier with More Race Bonuses! The World BattleNet Federation is in Search of Players to Conquer the Space Arena with Seong Jihan. The participation fee of 100 Billion GP will be covered by donations.] [Earthlings Who Bet on Seong Jihan Earn a Fortune. 1GP=2 Dollar Exchange Rate Broken for Days.] [Significant Increase in Gift Recipients. Level 2 Players to Surge Compared to Last Month.] [ER Busy Due to Increased Strength? Extra Caution Needed Even When Holding Children.] -The real winner in the arena was humanity. -For real, I awakened this time LOL -I’m one of those who just believed in Seong Jihan and earned billions haha. All thanks to alien money, right? -No… some of that was my money too… T_T -?? How could a human not bet on Seong Jihan? Traitor, right? -I thought the finals opponent seemed strong... T_T T_T The reward Seong Jihan received benefitted all of humanity, and societal changes were already evident just days later. “Everyone’s talking about needing to send more players to the Space Arena, right?” “Really? I doubt there are many capable contenders... Who are the candidates?” “Well, there are players from the U.S., and my dad, and China’s Zhuge Hun... Even I get mentioned occasionally! Though I’m not at the level yet.” Seong Jihan thought to himself as he heard this. ‘The only player that would stand a chance in the arena is probably my brother-in-law.’ He was skeptical even about Sword King Yoon Sejin's chances of winning the first or second rounds. Perhaps he’d fare better than the magicians. ‘Seems like a waste of money, but since it's funded through donations, no need to worry about it.’ With that thought, Seong Jihan asked Yoon Se-ah about the recent evolution bonus. “How's the attribute enhancement? Can you feel it?” “Totally! It feels like I’ve become 10~20% stronger. Now, I think I won’t be afraid to match against alien races. If we get more evolution bonuses and move to a lower-tier, we might even gain an upper hand in competition against alien races…” “Escaping the lowest rank seems harder than expected.” “Exactly. Even after receiving the all attributes +1 option, we’re still the lowest rank, humanity.” “Well, that’s actually good. It means we have a lot more room for improvement.” Despite humanity’s weak abilities, Seong Jihan chose to look on the bright side. After all, he too was from the weakest race of humanity, feeling a significant boost each time they received a race bonus. ‘If we move up to lower and mid-tiers, I’ll become even stronger.’ Thinking about actively participating in any game that offers race bonuses, he recalled the Constellation Construction Kit he received last time. ‘Speaking of Legendary, it should have been a race bonus instead of this thing.’ Instead of a race evolution, he ended up with an item worth 3 trillion GP. In fact, by choosing this item instead of the 5 trillion, he technically incurred a 2 trillion loss. ‘Might as well upgrade the throne.’ The EX-skill Summon Throne, whose usefulness was dubious. If upgraded with the Constellation Construction Kit, could it become more useful? “Summon Throne.” Seong Jihan summoned the throne then and there. “Oh, is it like a massage chair that’s going to appear?” Yoon Se-ah’s eyes sparkled at Seong Jihan’s action. For her, the throne was perceived more as a flashy massage chair than a seat for deities. “Yeah. Going to upgrade it.” Flash! As the summoned throne sparkled with white light, Seong Jihan approached it with the Constellation Construction Kit in hand. The construction kit, shaped like a hammer. Initially, he wondered if he had to hit the chair with it but, [You already possess a throne.] [Would you like to consume the Constellation Construction Kit to upgrade your throne?] A message popped up even before he could proceed. “I choose to upgrade.” Following Seong Jihan’s response, another message appeared. [Your throne is already of high grade.] [Upgrading with the Constellation Construction Kit alone is impossible. Special materials are required for an upgrade to the next tier.] ‘Was this supposed to be high grade?’ Seong Jihan recalled the now-deceased Brain God. Him. At least he didn’t give something entirely bad. The ambiguity in the throne’s performance was, perhaps, because it wasn’t fully upgraded. “What special material is needed?” [Your inventory already contains a special material, the ‘Crimson Sun Core Fragment’.] When Seong Jihan asked, the system message unexpectedly responded. [Would you like to use the ‘Crimson Sun Core Fragment’ from your inventory?] Moving forward, it even asked if he intended to use it. * * * At the Training Ground of the Void. “Hmm…” Having brought the summoned throne to the training grounds, Seong Jihan took out the Crimson Sun Core Fragment. The finger-sized red gemstone, Glowed fiercely, boasting a powerful heat that seemed to have charged somewhat since it was first stored in the inventory. ‘It’s good I took this out in the training grounds.’ Had he accidentally taken it out at home, his penthouse might have burned down. With that thought, Seong Jihan eyed the upcoming system messages. [You possess the stat Red. Absorption is possible.] [Would you like to absorb the ‘Crimson Sun Core Fragment’?] The system message seemed to urge him to quickly consume it, implying that doing so might even elevate the stat Red by a few points. ‘Then I could somehow recover the 6 I lost.’ The 6 points of the Red stat, all previously invested to increase, had been lost. The Sun Core fragment had to be used for recovery. ‘But using this for the throne upgrade…’ Using the Constellation Construction Kit worth 3 trillion GP for the upgrade was one thing, But the Sun Core fragment was another matter entirely. Is upgrading really worth giving up the recovery of the stat Red? “Hmm…” Faced with a difficult decision, holding the Sun Core fragment, Seong Jihan delved into deep thought. Observing him, the Shadow Queen commented. [What are you doing holding that stone?] “Do you know anything about the throne?” [Throne? Are you talking about the seats deities use? I’ve heard they’re necessary for maintaining a god’s permanence.] “Permanence?” [Yes. The Void does not recognize eternity, but it makes exceptions for entities acknowledged as gods. As long as they perform their role as gods, sitting on the throne prevents them from becoming targets of the Void.] “The Void Max limit does increase when sitting on the throne.” [Yeah… you said you received it from the Brain God? If it’s from him, being one of the stronger deities, it must have had good functionality.] “Not really. It came with a lot of restrictions.” [Then, it must have been an under-upgraded throne he gave you. Thrones are often secretly traded among deities, as the most bothersome thing for them is overcoming the limitation of lifespan imposed by the Void.] “Can the deities also become targets of the Void?” [Of course. The criteria loosen a bit compared to before they became deities, but they aren't allowed an immortal life.] So, escaping the Void isn't easy even for deities. Hearing the Shadow Queen’s story, Seong Jihan thought to himself, ‘If I upgrade now, the Void Max limit offered by the throne will most likely increase... Investing the stat Red into upgrading the throne might be better in the long run.’ Since not only he but also his family benefitted from it, Considering the benefits it brings to Yoon Se-ah, who deals with the Void, Seong Jihan decided to proceed with the final upgrade to the throne. “Inventory.” As he approached the throne with the hammer, the system window with the identical message popped up. “I’ll use the Sun Core.” Upon Seong Jihan’s reply to use the Sun Core, Flash! The throne, hammer, and the Sun Core glowed simultaneously. Then, the three objects began merging into one. Fwoosh…! The throne blazed with fire. The chair, which had been offering comfort once a month as a sort of luxurious massage chair, flared up. Light and flames began to envelop it. ‘But if the chair becomes engulfed in flames, won’t Se-ah and my brother-in-law be unable to use it?’ As Seong Jihan pondered the transformation of the throne, Shhh… The fire went out, and the throne transformed into a large disc. Glowing yellow, holding the warmth of fire. [‘Throne’ has been upgraded to ‘Throne of the Sun’.] Along with this, a message appeared signaling the completion of the upgrade. [Is that considered an upgrade? It does seem the fiery essence has intensified compared to the original throne.] “Hmm, a comfortable chair has turned into a cushion.” [A bit large for a cushion though...] Swoosh! Seong Jihan sat atop the floating, expansive Throne of the Sun. The Throne of the Sun, large enough to accommodate dozens of people at once. Being seated there, Whoooosh! Flames erupted from the throne, enveloping Seong Jihan. [You have seated on a throne recognized by the BattleNet system.] [Level cap increases by 30.] [Void stat max limit increases by 10.] ‘The Void max limit has increased by 5 more than before.’ Previously, the limit of Void would increase by 5 once a month. Now, it’s doubled, but this alone wasn’t a very satisfying outcome. However, [You receive the power of the sun.] [Stats related to fire increase.] Whoooosh... As flames endowed his chest’s red emblem with fire power, Seong Jihan, initially indifferent, sparkled with excitement. ‘Stats related to fire increase. Does Red too…?’ Though he felt the fire power increasing, He didn’t get a message confirming an increase in the stat Red. ‘Hmm… Even if it’s a throne, it doesn’t increase by 1 monthly.’ As Seong Jihan expressed his disappointment, [You possess the ‘Red’ stat.] [You can absorb ‘Throne of the Sun’ into your body.] [If ‘Throne of the Sun’ is absorbed, the skill Summon Throne will disappear.] A system message with a red background appeared before Seong Jihan. When related to the stat Red, the system typically presented it with a red background. Seong Jihan, reading through the message, steeled his gaze. Stat Red. It seems it devours anything related to fire. Nonetheless, “I’ll absorb it.” The Throne of the Sun, having become a flame-throwing chair. It had become a bit awkward for Yoon Se-ah and Yoon Sejin to benefit together from it. In this case, It would be better for him to absorb it and make effective use himself. Upon his decision to absorb, Whoooosh…! The Throne of the Sun quickly shrank to a pinprick and touched his chest. “Ugh…” As his chest burned, Even to him, accustomed to pain, an intense agony forced out a groan. Simultaneously, the red emblem grew. Behind the sun mark, the originally crescent-like red emblem expanded to a semi-circle, growing to the size of a half-moon. Then, a red-background message appeared. [The ‘Red’ stat increases by 10.] [The abilities of ‘Red’ are enhanced.] [The efficiency of investing leftover points increases.] [Void max limit increases by 100.] [The Void max limit will increase by 10 monthly.] Not only did the stat Red significantly increase, but the original functionality of the throne was also added. “Phew…” Sweating profusely from the intense pain, Seong Jihan smiled upon seeing the message. ‘The upgrade is completely successful.’ If there was a downside, it would be that it’s no longer shareable with the family. However, looking solely at Seong Jihan himself, it was the best outcome. ‘Efficiency in leftover points increased…’ Initially, 20 points were needed for a single increment in Red. Seong Jihan decided to invest points obtained from leveling up in the arena into Red. ‘It increases by 1 for every 10 now.’ Though it still consumed a significant amount of leftover points, Compared to before, the investment efficiency in Red had doubled. And thanks to leveling up a lot in the arena, he, having plenty of leftover points, focused them into Red. Reaching a Red stat tally of 25. ‘Just a while ago at 11, it was quite distressing, but it’s more than doubled now.’ Seong Jihan smiled, enjoying this moment. He even felt a desire to show the aliens who teased him about choosing poorly. ‘But revealing Red is not an option, so I must hold back.’ Seong Jihan decided to cherish this joy privately. ‘Now what’s left is the Grand Master promotion battle, huh?’ Having spent July in the arena, he didn’t have much time until the regular promotion exam on the 25th. Fortunately, his level had also increased a lot in the arena, leaving not far to 400. ‘I should focus on leveling up to participate in the July promotion exam.’ Seong Jihan decided to prioritize game participation over training, leaving the training ground of the Void. And until the promotion exam approached, he diligently played the game every day. In his spare time, he went to the dungeons in North Korea to exterminate monsters in the portal, focusing on leveling up to achieve 400 within July. [You have reached level 400.] [You can now participate in the Grand Master promotion exam.] And on July 23. Upon finally reaching level 400, [Great Deity ‘Dragon Lord’ sends you a message.] A message arrived from the Great Deity, who had been quiet until now."},{"instruction":"Thank you, You will be translating a text while maintaining consistency with previously translated related texts. Here is the current text to translate: <2레벨로 회귀한 무신 339화> ‘드래곤 로드…… 성좌가 되면 보자던 양반이 왜 갑자기 메시지지?’ 성지한에게 관심을 보이며 대성좌로서 후원을 해 주었던 드래곤 로드. 하나 그는 성지한이 소환이 안 된다는 걸 알고는, 알트카이젠의 드래곤 하트만 넘겨준 후 감감무소식이었다. 그래서 그냥 성좌 자리만 차지하고 있는 양반이었는데. ‘흠. 아레나 경기를 보기라도 했나.’ 성지한은 일단 온 메시지를 확인해 보았다. [드래곤 로드가 자신의 의지를 전달합니다.] 그 메시지가 뜸과 동시에 화면이 바뀌며, 시스템 창 안에선 글자가 사라지고 거대한 눈이 드러났다. 샛노란 배경의 중심에서 빛을 발하는 붉은 눈. 거기서 음성이 울려 퍼졌다. [태양핵 조각을 얻는 것을 보았다. 그걸 나에게 넘기면, 특별히 로드의 가호를 내려 주지.] 성지한의 예측대로, 아레나 경기를 보았는지 적색의 태양핵 조각을 자기한테 건네라고 하는 드래곤 로드. “이미 나한테 없는데.” [없다고…… 벌써 누군가에게 넘겼는가? 누구지? 태양왕? 아니면…… 적의 일족인가.] “적의 일족은 뭐야.” [이렇게 생긴 존재다.] 스으으윽. 화면이 눈 모양에서 또다시 바뀌고. 그 안에서 거대한 거인의 모습이 재생되었다. 모두들 생김새가 통일되지는 않고, 각양각색이었지만. 붉은 눈만은 일치하는 거인 무리. 성지한은 이들을 보면서, 어디서 한 번 본 것 같은 느낌이 들었다. ‘아, 이 거인들…… 롱기누스의 소멸 때 보았던, 영상에 나온 이들과 느낌이 비슷하군.’ 십자가에 매달려, 처형인의 창에 꽂혀 죽던 거인들. -배신자여. 관리자께서, 너를 심판하실 것이다! 그중 한 거인은 죽기 전에 길가메시의 그림자에게 이렇게 소리쳤었다. ‘그걸 들은 길가메시는 비웃음을 머금으며, 자신의 그림자 역할을 하던 무신에게 관리자가 자신들의 편이라고 했지…….’ 배틀넷에서 성장 한계가 없는 ‘인류’의 탄생. 그동안은, 이에 가장 많이 관여한 게 세계수 엘프인 줄로만 알았다. 세계수 엘프의 실험이 지구에서 일어났고. 실험소장이 세계수와 융합한 후 연락을 두절했다는 건, 저들의 데이터에서 이미 밝혀진 일이었으니까. ‘하지만 관리자 이야기도 그렇고. 드래곤 로드가 저들을 적의 일족이라고 거론한 것도 그렇고. 세계수 엘프의 배신자만 단독으로 지구에서 자리 잡은 건 아니었던 건가…….’ 지금처럼 조각조각 나뉜 정보로는, 아직 온전한 결과물을 도출할 수는 없는 상황. 성지한은 드래곤 로드가 거론한 적의 일족에 대해 자세히 물어볼까 했지만. ‘아니…… 적의 일족에 대해서는 모르는 척하는 게 낫다.’ 성지한은 태양왕의 소태양이 저번에 난리 치던 걸 떠올렸다. 성지한에게 적의 기운이 있는 걸 감지하고는, 태양왕에게 소식을 보내겠다며 자기 혼자 발광했지. 다행히 시간이 역행돼서, 그 일이 막혔지. 안 그랬다면 ‘적’에 대해 알아보기 위해, 대성좌 태양왕이 직접 지구에 강림했을지도 몰랐다. ‘드래곤 로드 이놈도 적색의 관리자를 노린다고 들었으니까. 괜히 아는 척하지 않는 게 이로워.’ 성지한은 그냥 저 거인이 ‘적의 일족’이라는 힌트를 얻었음에 만족하며, 드래곤 로드에게 대답했다. “누구한테 넘긴 게 아니라, 내가 흡수했다.” [흡수했다고…….] “어, 불의 권능을 대폭 올려 주던데.” [이름을 걸고 맹세할 수 있겠는가. 네가 흡수했다고.] “맹세하지.” 꿀릴 거 없는 성지한이 즉답하자, 화면 속 거대한 눈이 서서히 감겼다. [거짓이 아니구나. 아쉽군…….] “로드의 가호는 뭔데?” [네가 용족이 될 수 있게 해 주는 축복이다. 최하급의 육체를 탈피할 수 있었는데, 후회스럽겠구나.] 축복을 통해 드래곤으로 만들어 준다고? 인간 몸보단, 용의 몸으로 무신과 싸우면 상대할 만한가 싶어서 잠깐 솔깃했지만. “얼마나 걸리는데?” [네 재능이면 500년 안에 되겠지.] “엄청 오래 걸리는구만.” [그것은 너희 종의 기준일 뿐. 용의 일원이 된다면 한순간임을 알게 되리라. 그래…… 다음에 혹여나 얻는다면, 흡수하지 말고 나에게 가져오라. 네가 상상하는 것, 그 이상의 보상을 주도록 하지.] 삑! 드래곤 로드는 적색의 태양핵 조각에 대해 못내 아쉬워하면서, 통신을 껐다. ‘결국 뭐 로드에게 받은 건 없군.’ 자기 용건만 꺼내고 가다니. 대성좌가 되었으면서 베풀 줄을 모르는군그래. ‘그래도 그 거인이 적의 일족이란 정보는 알았으니…….’ 배틀넷에선, 자취를 감췄다고 알려진 적색의 관리자. 하나 특이하게도 그의 흔적은 지구에서 보이고 있었다. 처형장에서 죽었던, 적의 일족도 그렇고. 길가메시의 언급도 그렇고. ‘무신도 어쩌면 적의 일족일지 모르겠어.’ 거인들이 배신자라고 칭한 건, 길가메시라기보단 그의 그림자 역할을 하던 무신이었으니까. 거기에 그 전에도. -감히 네놈이 우리를…… 비웃어?! -완성되지 못한 열등품이 감히! -끝까지 하극상인가……! 적의 일족은 그를 ‘열등품’이라고 언급했다. ‘회광반조를 사용했을 때, 스탯 적이 소모된 것도 다 적색의 관리자와 관련이 있는 건가.’ 우주의 시간을 1분 전으로 되돌렸던 회광반조. 아무리 스탯 적을 소모했다 한들, 이건 무신의 종이 지녔다기에는 너무나도 거대한 스케일의 권능이었다. 그래. 배틀넷의 정점에 있던, 적색의 관리자 정도가 아니면 불가능한 일이겠지. ‘그럼…… 회광반조 권능을 지닌 세 번째 종은 적색의 관리자거나. 그와 밀접한 관련이 있는 자겠군.’ 적색의 관리자 급이라고 가정한다면. 그만한 존재가, 왜 자기보다 아랫급인 태양왕에게 들키지 않으려고 하는 거지? “적색의 관리자에 대해 아는 것 있나?” 성지한은 그림자여왕에게 질문했다. [적색의 관리자?] “어.” [그는 임기가 끝나기 직전, 자취를 감춘 관리자다. 그가 직속 친위대로 부리던, 적의 일족과 함께 말이야.] “임기? 관리자에게 임기도 있나.” 성지한은 뜻밖이라는 듯 눈을 크게 떴다. 배틀넷에서 관리자라면, 신보다도 더 윗급 같은데. 그런 존재에게도 임기가 있단 말인가. [그래. 적색과 녹색의 관리자에게만 존재하지.] “녹색에게도?” [그렇다. 물론 녹색의 관리자는 어떻게든 임기를 연장하려고, 온갖 꼼수를 쓰고 있다만…… 불의 운명을 지닌 적색의 관리자는 그러질 못했지. 불은 언젠가는, 꺼지기 마련 아닌가.] “흠…….” 녹색의 관리자가, 세계수 엘프를 부리며 전 우주에서 패악질을 부리는 이유에 저 ‘임기’도 포함되어 있는 건가. 성지한이 고개를 끄덕이자, 그림자여왕이 말을 이었다. [나도 들은 이야기라 확실한 건 아니다만…… 사실은 그가 잠적하든 말든, 차기 적색의 관리자로 유력시되던 드래곤 로드나 태양왕은 크게 관심을 보이지 않았다고 한다. 어차피 임기가 끝나면, 관리자의 권능은 자동으로 박탈되고, 다음 후보군 중 선출된 대성좌에게 넘어가니까.] “그래?” [어. 그런데, 이상하게도 적색의 관리자가 지닌 권능이 배틀넷 시스템에 반납이 안 되었다고 하더군.] “반납이 안 되었다고?” [그렇다. 그래서 차기 후보군이었던 두 대성좌가 발끈했지. 잠적한 적색의 관리자가, 분명히 모종의 수를 써서 권능을 유지하고 있다고 말이야. 그래서 태양왕은 자신이 직접 적색의 관리자를 찾고 있고, 드래곤 로드도 용족을 통솔하여 관리자의 흔적을 찾는다고 하더군.] 아까 드래곤 로드에게, 기억 속에서 적의 일족 봤다고 말 안 하길 잘했군. 괜히 말했다간, 드래곤 로드가 용족을 모조리 이끌고 지구에 날아올 뻔했어. “그래서 둘이 그렇게 난리였군. 근데 적색의 관리자 권능은 뭔데?” [거기까진 나도 모른다. 아무래도 불과 관련된 거겠지? 관리자급이면 태양 생성 같은 것일지도 모르겠군.] “태양 생성이라…….” 역시 관리자쯤 되면 스케일이 다르네. 성지한은 피식 웃으며, 가슴의 중앙부를 만졌다. ‘이거 절대 들키면 안 되겠네. 근데 배틀넷 시스템 자체는 능력치 적을 등록해 놓고도, 딱히 별문제 삼진 않는군.’ 아무리 적색의 관리자가 권능을 들고 잠적했다 한들. 스탯 ‘적’을 얻은 거까지는, 그래도 시스템 차원에서 문제는 아닌 건가. ‘어쨌든 그 둘은 특히 조심하자.’ 성지한은 용족이나 태양왕 쪽과 마주칠 땐, 절대 이를 드러내지 않기로 결심했다. 들켰다간, 적색의 관리자를 찾는다고 지구에 들이닥칠지도 모르니까. 그가 그렇게 생각을 정리하고 있을 때. 부르르르……. 그의 핸드폰에서 진동이 울렸다. * * * -오너님. 성좌 후원을 위해 컨택한 이들에게 응답을 받았습니다. 길드 마스터 이하연에게서 걸려온 전화. 성지한은 이에 응답했다. “아, 전화하셨습니까? 어떤 반응이던가요?” -가장 우선적으로 연락한 플레이어 3명은 모두 후원받겠다고 응답했구요. “3명요? 그럼 1명은…….” 그러자 이하연은 잠시 뜸을 들이더니, 조심스레 말문을 열었다. -저…… 그. 1명은, 혹시 폐가 안 된다면 제가 들어가면 안 될까요? “하연 씨가요?” 성지한의 반문에, 이하연이 길게 말을 늘어놓았다. -네, 그…… 제가 서포팅 기프트를 지닌 플레이어이긴 하고. 성좌 후원을 통한 능력 추가 효과가 쓸모없을 수도 있겠지만, 혹시 모르잖아요? 성좌 후원을 받으면, 제 육성 능력이 더 발전할지…… 그러면 대기 길드의 발전에도 큰 도움이……. “그렇게 하죠.” -저…… 그래서…… 네? “후원하겠다구요.” 이하연이 대신 대행해 주는 일이 얼마나 많은데, 슬롯 하나 정도야 얼마든지 양보할 수 있었다. -정말요……? “물론이죠.” 그렇게 말하며, 성지한은 그 자리에서 바로 후원 명단에서 이하연을 추가시켰다. 그러자. [후원자로 인해, 성좌 명성이 1 오릅니다.] ‘응?’ 윤세진을 후원했을 때와는 달리. 시스템 창에, 성좌 명성이 찔끔찔끔 적립되기 시작했다. -앗. 이렇게 바로 해 주실 줄이야…… 정말 감사해요, 오너님! “하연씨 덕을 본 게 얼만데. 이 정도야 당연하죠.” -후후…… 그럼 후원할 플레이어 3명에게도 바로 연락하겠습니다! “아. 잠시만요. 한 한 시간 뒤로 미룰 수 있을까요? 그거.” -1시간 뒤요? 네. 알겠어요. “네. 그럼 좀 있다 연락할게요.” 삑. 통화를 끊은 성지한은, 시스템 메시지창을 유심히 바라보았다. [후원자로 인해, 성좌 명성이 2 오릅니다.] 1시간이 지나자, 이번엔 2가 적립되는 성좌 명성. ‘매형은 게임에서 맹활약할 때마다, 성좌 명성 10~100정도 벌어 온 거 같은데…….’ 성지한은 그걸 보고 윤세진이 벌어 왔던 성좌 명성을 떠올렸다. 평소 게임할 때는 성좌 명성을 못 벌어 오지만, 뭔가 놀라운 활약을 했을 때. 성지한으로 따지면, 업적 포인트를 얻을 정도의 성과를 보였을 때 성좌 명성이 그에게로 적립되었다. 하나 이런 일은 어쩌다 한 번 있는 일이라, 그렇게 유의미하다고 보지는 않았는데. 이하연 같은 서포팅 기프트를 지닌 이는 뭔가 다르게 작용하나? “여왕. 서포팅 기프트를 지닌 이를 후원하면, 성좌에게 다르게 작용하나?” [서포팅 기프트를 지닌 플레이어를 왜 후원해? 자리 아깝게.] “1시간에 명성 1, 2씩 벌어 오던데?” [1시간에 1에서 2…… 그럼 한 달에 1000정도 기대할 수 있는 건가. 괜찮네. 근데 나도 한번 해 봤다만, 명성치를 너무 벌어 오지 못해서 후원 취소했는데…….] “이하연 육성 기프트 등급이 높긴 해. SSS급이거든.” [SSS? 높긴 하군. 하나 그 정도 등급은 우리도 있었다.] 그림자여왕은 이하연의 등급에도 크게 놀라지 않았다. 쉐도우 엘프에게 주어지던 기프트는, 전투 쪽은 등급이 그리 높지 않아도. 서포팅 기프트는 최소 B 이상 부여되었으니까. 그녀도 높은 등급의 서포팅 기프트를 지닌 플레이어를 후원한 경력이 있었던 것이다. [내 기억엔…… 하루에 1, 2 정도 벌어 오던 게 최고였다. 그래서 전투하는 플레이어들에 비해 명성을 너무 못 얻어 와서 그들에게 후원을 포기했지.] “그래?” [응. 인류 너희들에겐 다르게 적용되는 건가?] 한번 테스트를 해 볼 필요는 있겠군. 성지한은 성좌 명성 상점을 떠올렸다. 지금은 포인트가 꽤 쌓인 상점. 하나 더 높이 올라가기 위해선, 성좌 명성의 수급이 더 원활해야 했다. ‘나 혼자 버는 걸로는 힘들어.’ 아레나에서 우승했음에도 5천밖에 쌓이지 않았던 성좌 명성. 혼자서 다 요구치를 수급하는 건 불가능하니, 어떻게든 후원 플레이어에게서 명성치를 얻어 내야 했다. ‘테스트를 좀 해 볼까.’ 성지한은 성좌 상점의 항목들을 보면서, 눈을 반짝였다.

Why would he suddenly send a message after saying we'd meet if I became a Deity?\\" Dragon Lord had shown interest in Seong Jihan, supporting him as a Great Deity. However, after learning that Seong Jihan couldn't be summoned, he had handed over the Dragon Heart from Altkaisen and then gone completely silent. He was just someone occupying a Deity position, after all. \\"Hmm. Did he watch the arena match?\\" Seong Jihan decided to check the message that had arrived. [Dragon Lord conveys his will to you.] As the message appeared, the screen changed, the text within the system window disappearing to reveal a gigantic eye. A bright red eye emitting light from the center against a yellowish background. A voice resonated from it. [I saw you acquire a fragment of the Sun Core. Hand it over to me, and I will bestow upon you the Lord's blessing.] Just as Seong Jihan had speculated, Dragon Lord, having watched the arena match, was asking for the Crimson Sun Core Fragment. \\"It's no longer with me.\\" [Not with you... Have you already handed it over to someone? The Sun King? Or... a member of Red's tribe?] \\"What’s Red's tribe?\\" [They look like this.] Swoosh. The screen transitioned from the eye shape once more. Inside, the figures of gigantic beings played, their appearances varied, but all shared the distinctive red eyes—a horde of giants. Seeing them, Seong Jihan felt as if he had seen them somewhere before. \\"Ah, these giants… they felt similar to the ones in the video I saw during Longinus's annihilation.\\" Giants pierced and hanging from crucifixes, -\\"Traitor. The Administrator will judge you!\\" One of the giants had shouted this to Gilgamesh's shadow before dying. 'After hearing that, Gilgamesh, with a smirk, told his shadow, an incarnation of a divine being, that the Administrator was on their side...' The birth of 'humanity' with no growth limit in BattleNet. Until now, it was believed that the World Tree Elves were the most involved. The experiment from the World Tree Elves occurred on Earth. And the fact that the director of the experiment fused with the World Tree and then lost contact was already revealed in their data. 'But considering the story of the administrator and the fact that Dragon Lord referred to them as Red's tribe, maybe the betrayer from the World Tree Elves wasn't the only one who settled on Earth...' With the information so fragmented, Seong Jihan couldn’t derive any concrete conclusions yet. He considered asking Dragon Lord about Red's tribe in more detail but decided, \\"No... It might be better to pretend I don’t know about Red's tribe.\\" Seong Jihan recalled how the Sun King’s mini sun caused a commotion last time. It had detected Red’s presence within him and planned to report to the Sun King, lighting itself up. Thankfully, time reversed, preventing that incident. Otherwise, to investigate 'Red', the Great Deity Sun King might have descended on Earth himself. 'Considering Dragon Lord is also eyeing the position of the red administrator, it’s better not to show any knowledge.' Seong Jihan was content with just the hint that these giants were 'Red's tribe' and replied to Dragon Lord. \\"I didn’t hand it over to anyone; I absorbed it.\\" [You absorbed it...] \\"Yes, it significantly increased my powers related to fire.\\" [Can you swear on your name that you have absorbed it?] \\"I swear.\\" As Seong Jihan answered without hesitation, the great eye in the screen slowly closed. [It's not a lie then. That’s unfortunate...] \\"What’s the Lord's blessing?\\" [A blessing that would have enabled you to become a dragon. You would have been able to shed your lowest rank flesh, but it seems you'll regret it.] A blessing to transform into a dragon? For a moment, he was tempted, wondering if a dragon’s body would be more capable of fighting a deity than a human body. \\"How long would it take?\\" [With your talent, you would achieve it within 500 years.] \\"That's too long.\\" [That’s a mere moment from a dragon's perspective. Well... if you ever acquire one again, don’t absorb it but bring it to me. I’ll ensure the reward surpasses your imagination.] Beep! Regretting his loss over the Crimson Sun Core Fragment, Dragon Lord ended the communication. 'In the end, I didn’t get anything from the Lord.' Coming to talk about his own business and then just leaving like that. For someone who has become a Great Deity, he sure doesn't know how to offer much. 'Still, gaining the information that those giants are Red's tribe...' The red administrator, reportedly vanished from BattleNet, Yet, peculiarly, traces of his presence were seen on Earth. Including the members of Red's tribe executed at the execution site. And mentions from Gilgamesh. 'It's possible the deity might’ve been a member of Red's tribe.' The giants had labeled the betrayal, not as Gilgamesh but as his shadow, the deity. And even before that, -\\"Dare you mock us?!\\" -\\"An unfinished product dares!\\" -\\"Rebellion to the end…!\\" They referred to him as an 'inferior product'. 'Could the consumption of the stat Red when using Return of the Light be related to the red administrator?' Turn-back Light, the ability to rewind time in the universe by one minute. Even if it consumed the stat Red, such a powerful ability seemed too grand to belong to a deity's incarnation. Right. Only someone at the peak of BattleNet, like the red administrator, could possess such an ability. 'Then… the bearer of the Turn-back Light's power must be related to the red administrator or closely connected to him.' Assuming the level of the red administrator, Why would such a being avoid detection by someone like the Sun King, ranked below him? \\"Anything you know about the red administrator?\\" Seong Jihan posed the question to the Shadow Queen. [The red administrator?] \\"Yeah.\\" [He is an administrator who vanished just before the end of his term, along with his direct guard, Red's tribe.] \\"Term? There’s a term for administrators?\\" Seong Jihan widened his eyes in surprise. It seemed like administrators, even higher ranked than gods, had their terms. [Yes. Only the red and green administrators have terms.] \\"The green one too?\\" [Indeed. Though the green administrator tries every trick to extend his term... The red administrator, fated with fire, couldn’t do the same. Fire is destined to extinguish at some point.] \\"Hmm...\\" Was the reason behind the World Tree Elf causing havoc across the universe inclusive of this 'term'? Nodding, the Shadow Queen continued, [It's what I’ve heard, so can't be absolutely sure... Regardless of his disappearance, neither Dragon Lord nor the Sun King, prime candidates for the next red administrator, showed much interest. Eventually, the powers of an administrator are revoked upon term completion, passing on to the elected Great Deity from the candidates.] \\"Really?\\" [Yes. But oddly, the powers held by the red administrator weren’t returned to the BattleNet system.] \\"Didn’t get returned?\\" [Right. So, the two candidates were enraged. They argued that the vanished red administrator must be keeping his powers through some means. The Sun King is personally searching for the red administrator, and Dragon Lord is mobilizing dragons to look for any traces.] Good thing I didn’t mention to Dragon Lord that I remembered Red's tribe from my memory. Otherwise, he might have led all dragons straight to Earth. \\"So that's why they made such a fuss. But what were the red administrator’s powers?\\" [I don't know either. Probably something related to fire? Given administrator-level powers, perhaps even creating suns.] \\"Creating suns, huh...\\" Indeed, the scale is different for administrators. Seong Jihan chuckled, touching the center of his chest. 'This can't be discovered at any cost. The BattleNet system itself registers the power of Red but doesn’t seem to find any issue with it.' Even though the red administrator absconded with his powers. So, having the stat 'Red' isn't considered a problem by the system? 'Either way, I better be especially careful around those two.' Seong Jihan decided not to reveal this to dragons or the Sun King. If discovered, they might descend on Earth searching for the red administrator. As he was organizing his thoughts, Buzz... buzz... His phone vibrated. * * * -Owner, we’ve received responses from the players you contacted for the Deity support. The call was from Guild Master Lee Hayeon. Seong Jihan responded, \\"Ah, you called? How was their reaction?\\" -Most of the first three players we contacted agreed to receive support. \\"Three players? Then, one is…\\" Lee Hayeon paused briefly before carefully starting, -Um… if it's not too much trouble, could I possibly join them? \\"You, Hayeon?\\" Upon Seong Jihan's query, Lee Hayeon explained at length, -Yes, that... As a player with supporting gifts. Although receiving additional effects through Deity support might not be useful, who knows? If I receive the support, my development ability might improve further... That could greatly benefit the development of the standby guild... \\"Let's do that.\\" -You… are you sure? \\"I'll sponsor it.\\" Lee Hayeon had been of so much help that it was only right to offer a slot for her. -Really…? \\"Of course.\\" Saying so, Seong Jihan added Lee Hayeon to the sponsorship list on the spot. Resultantly, [Your Deity prestige increases by 1 due to the sponsor.] 'Uh?' Unlike when he sponsored Yoon Sejin, The system window began to tick increment by increment in Deity prestige. -Ah, to have it settled so quickly... Thank you so much, Owner! \\"With how much you've helped me, Lee Hayeon, it's only natural.\\" -Haha… then, I'll immediately contact the three players for sponsorship! \\"Ah. Could you postpone it by about an hour? That thing.\\" -One hour? Okay, got it. \\"Yes. I'll contact you in a bit.\\" Beep. After ending the call, Seong Jihan stared intently at the system message window. [Your Deity prestige increases by 2 due to the sponsor.] After an hour passed, this time 2 points of Deity prestige accrued. 'My brother-in-law seemed to earn about 10~100 Deity prestige whenever he was active in the game...' Seong Jihan recalled the Deity prestige Yoon Sejin had earned. Usually unable to gain Deity prestige during regular gameplay but earning a significant amount when accomplishing something impressive. In Seong Jihan's case, akin to earning achievement points. This was infrequent, so he hadn't seen it as notably impactful. But could someone with a supporting gift like Lee Hayeon operate differently? \\"Queen. Does sponsoring someone with supporting gifts affect Deities differently?\\" [Why would you sponsor a player with supporting gifts? Waste of a spot.] \\"It earns about 1 to 2 prestige per hour.\\" [1 to 2 per hour… Then, can we expect about 1000 a month? Not bad. I've tried before too but didn't gain much prestige, so I canceled the sponsorship...] \\"Lee Hayeon's development gift is high-grade. SSS rated.\\" [SSS? That is high. But we had individuals of that grade too.] The Shadow Queen wasn't particularly impressed by Lee Hayeon's grade. Even if battle-related gifts weren't highly rated among the Shadow Elves, Supporting gifts were given at least a B rating. She had experience sponsoring players with high-grade supporting gifts as well. [From my recollection... it was about 1 or 2 per day at best. So compared to players who battle, they didn't earn much prestige, leading me to give up on them.] \\"Really?\\" [Yeah. Maybe it works differently for you humans?] Perhaps a test is needed. Seong Jihan reminisced about the Deity prestige store. The store where points had accumulated quite a bit. Yet, to ascend higher, a smoother inflow of Deity prestige was needed. 'I can't make it on my own.' Even with a victory in the arena, only 5000 Deity prestige had been accumulated. It was impossible to meet the required prestige just by himself; he must somehow earn prestige from sponsored players. 'Maybe I should test it a bit.' While looking through the items in the Deity store, Seong Jihan's eyes sparkled."},{"instruction":"Thank you, You will be translating a text while maintaining consistency with previously translated related texts.

[성지한, 성좌 후원 5명 더 추가 모집.] [이번에는 육성 능력자를 후원한다? 각 길드의 육성 파트를 담당하는 플레이어에게 후원을 제안해.] 성지한은 기존의 5명에서 그치지 않고, 후원자를 더 모집했다. 이번에는 서포팅 기프트를, 그것도 ‘육성’을 지닌 플레이어를 중심으로. -육성 능력자에게 왜 지원을 해 주지? 지금 대기 길드가 최곤데 괜히 남의 능력자 키워 주는 격 아닌가; -성지한님이 하시는 일이다 다 생각이 있으시겠지……. -다른 길드 육성 능력자들도 키워 줘서 인류가 보다 더 빨리 성장하라는 뜻 아니겠어? -그렇게까지 성지한이 성인군자였나 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ -성인군자? 어딜 걔들에 성지한을 비빔 ㅡㅡ 인류가 그간 덕 본 게 얼만데 성인군자 100명보다 훨씬 공로가 크다. -ㄹㅇ 공자가 나 건강하게 해 준 적 있음? 왜 성지한이 육성 능력자를, 그것도 다른 길드의 사람들을 후원하는지는 의아해하는 반응이 대부분이었지만. 그간 벌어 온 종족 보너스로 인해, 성지한에 대한 여론이 압도적으로 우호적인지라 다들 좋은 뜻으로 그런 거겠지 하며 호의적으로 생각했다. “아메리칸 퍼스트, 인민회의 육성 능력자를 비롯해 5인이 다 후원받겠다고 동의했어요.” “알겠습니다. 그럼 바로 가죠.” 성지한은 이하연이 넘겨준 명단을 보고, 5인을 추가로 넣었다. 원래 슬롯은 5인이었지만. 그는 이하연이 성좌 명성을 벌어 오는 걸 보고는, 성좌 상점에서 투자를 단행한 상태였다. 그가 포인트를 넣은 것은 바로 후원 슬롯 확장 항목. 업그레이드에는 성좌 명성이 1천 포인트 요구되었지만. ‘그 정도는 소모할 만하지.’ 슬롯 업그레이드로 5명을 더 받을 수 있게 된 걸 생각해 보면, 할 만한 투자였다. 1명당 이하연의 20% 정도만 벌어 줘도, 한 달이면 투자 포인트가 회수 가능하니까. 성지한은 여기서 더 나아가서, 성좌 특성 강화까지 업그레이드했다. [성좌 특성이 강화됩니다.] [성좌 특성 군림과 독존의 성장 효율이 소폭 오릅니다.] [군림과 독존의 레벨이 올라갈수록, 효율이 더 크게 증가합니다.] [성좌 특성이 OFF 상태입니다. 성좌 특성 강화 효과가 발동하지 않습니다.] ‘지금은 올려도 가시적인 효과가 없네. 특성 ON 상태가 되면 다르겠다만.’ 군림과 독존의 효과를 동시에 올려 주는 성좌 특성 강화. 하지만, 아직은 OFF 모드라 그런지 눈에 띄는 효과가 없었다. 그래도 이건 결국 성좌 상점을 LV.2로 업그레이드 하기 위해선 올려야 할 항목이었으니. 성지한은 미래를 위한 투자라고 생각하면서, 성좌 상점 항목을 살펴보았다. [성좌 상점 LV.1] 성좌 상점 업그레이드 - 50000P 성좌 특성 ‘군림’ LV.2 – 100000P 성좌 특성 ‘독존’ LV.2 – 100000P 성좌 특성 강화 LV.2 - 50000P 후원 슬롯 확장 LV.2 – 20000P 스페셜 후원 품목 생성 – 500P LV이 2로 오르며, 포인트 요구가 부쩍 늘어난 하위 항목. 거기에 이들을 올리기 위해선, 모두 다 성좌 상점을 LV.2로 업그레이드 하는 게 필수 조건이었다. ‘5만 포인트는 아직 없고.’ 이번에 성좌 명성을 써 버린 덕에, 상점 업그레이드까지는 아직 포인트가 부족한 성지한. 포인트 쓸 곳은 이제, 맨 마지막 항목. ‘스페셜 후원 품목 생성’밖에는 없었다. ‘한번 해 볼까.’ 500포인트. 어떻게 보면 적지 않지만, 어떻게 보면 또 부담 없는 수치다. 후원자도 10명이나 모였으니, 그들에게 줄 만한 물건이 나올지 궁금해진 성지한은 이걸 눌러 보았다. 그러자. [스페셜 후원 품목이 생성됩니다…….] [‘기프트 부여 – 랜덤 A급(전투용)’ 아이템이 생성됩니다.] [이 아이템은 성좌 후원 중인 플레이어에게만 사용할 수 있습니다.] 이 메시지와 함께, 성지한의 인벤토리에 스크롤 하나가 들어왔다. 이거 사용하면, 성좌 입장에서 플레이어한테 기프트를 주는 건가? ‘A급에 500이라. 아까운데.’ 애초에 성좌가 후원할 정도의 플레이어면, 이미 좋은 기프트를 타고난 경우가 많았다. 인류의 경우에는 기본 S 이상, 평균적으로 SS급은 되어야 외계의 성좌에게서 관심을 끄는 수준이었는데. A급 기프트를 누구에게 주겠는가. ‘이 정도면 꽝이네. 경매장에 올릴 수 있나?’ 성지한은 스크롤을 팔 수 있나 보았지만. [스페셜 후원 품목은 경매장에 등록할 수 없습니다.] 이 물건은 팔지도 못했다. 그저 인벤토리에서, 쓸모없이 자리를 차지할 예정인 기프트 부여권. ‘……한 번만 더 해 볼까.’ 꽝을 뽑아 오기가 생긴 성지한은, 한 번 더 품목 생성을 눌러보았다. 그러자. [스페셜 후원 품목이 생성됩니다…….] [‘기프트 일시 강화 – 2개월권’아이템이 생성됩니다.] [이 아이템은 성좌 후원 중인 플레이어에게만 사용할 수 있습니다.] 이번에는 아까 보단 쓸 만해 보이는 것이 나왔다. ‘기프트 강화라…… 이건 줄 대상이 있지.’ 성지한은 자신을 가만히 지켜보던 이하연을 바라보았다. SSS급에 도달한 육성 기프트. 성지한도 톡톡히 덕을 보고 있는 이 기프트가 강화되면, 보다 더 성장률 보너스가 증가하겠지. ‘지금은 400레벨 달성한 상태니 며칠은 내가 이 혜택을 누리지 못하겠지만…… 그래도 대기 길드 소속 플레이어의 전반적인 성장을 위해 써 보자.’ 이런저런 보너스가 중첩돼서, 이미 성장률 증폭은 될 만큼 된 성지한은. 다른 인류 플레이어들의 성장도 촉진시키기 위해, 기프트 강화권을 사용했다. 그러자.

[LV.1 상점에서 스페셜 후원 품목 생성 권한이 1회 남았습니다.] 이번 기회가 마지막이라는 메시지가 떠오르자. ‘그냥 상점 업그레이드 전에 다 쓰고 가자.’ 한 번 더 스페셜 후원 품목을 생성했다. 그러자. [‘성좌 능력 부여권 – 유니크’아이템이 생성됩니다.] [이 아이템은 성좌 후원 중인 플레이어에게만 사용할 수 있습니다.] [성좌의 스탯 중, 유니크 등급 이상 항목에만 적용이 됩니다.] “오……!” 스페셜 후원 품목이라는 이름에 걸맞은 아이템이 나왔다. * * * 후원 플레이어에게 유니크 스탯을 주는 사기적인 아이템. 다만 거기엔 전제 조건이 있었다. 성좌의 능력 중, 유니크 이상의 스탯만 부여할 수 있다는 항목이. 하나, 막상 이건 성지한에겐 별로 제약이 되지 않는 조건이었다. ‘내 능력이야, 모조리 유니크 등급 이상이니까.’ 무혼과 공허. 적과 영원. 하나하나가 모두 유니크 등급을 넘어 버린 독보적인 능력이었다. 이 중에서, 하나를 후원 플레이어에게 전해 줄 수 있는 건가. ‘흠…… 누구에게 뭘 주지? 아니, 일단 가능한 능력이 뭐가 있나.’ 성지한은 한번 아이템을 사용해 보았다. [어떤 능력을 부여하시겠습니까?] 그러고는, 떠오르는 네 개의 스탯. 하나 무혼을 제외하고는. 공허, 적, 영원은 모두 X표시가 되어 있었다. ‘이 능력은 부여가 안 되나.’ 영원이야 불완전 스탯이라 그렇다 쳐도. 적이나 공허도 인류 플레이어에게 부여하기는 부적합한 건가. X표시 쪽에 손을 가져다대니. [영원 – 불완전 능력으로 부여가 불가능합니다.] [공허 – 부여가 불가능합니다.] [적 – 스탯 ‘용염’으로 등급을 낮춰 부여 가능합니다. 다만 종족 ‘용족’에게만 부여가 가능합니다.] 왜 안 되는지 이유가 나왔다. ‘적에는 적뢰도 같이 합쳐져 있을 텐데…… 그건 부여가 안 되는군. 이러면 남는 건 무혼밖에 없나.’ 성지한은 무혼을 바라보았다. [무혼 – 유니크 스탯, ‘무력’으로 등급을 낮춰 부여 가능합니다. 다만 무력의 경우 특별한 방법으로 작성해야 합니다.] 무력과 포스가 합쳐지며 업그레이드되었던 무혼. 하나 여기서 후원 플레이어에게 줄 수 있는 스탯은, 무력만 가능했다. 그래도 다행히 무력을 부여하기 위해 필요한 조건은 까다롭지 않았다. 특별한 방법으로 작성해야 한다는 항목. 이건 ‘동방삭의 붓’을 뜻하는 것이었으니까. ‘동방삭의 망가진 붓, 분명히 여러 개였어.’ 성지한은 저번 생의 기억을 떠올렸다. F급 기프트 방랑자의 눈을 가지고, 베팅이나 하면서 하루하루를 먹고 살며 전전하다가. 방랑하는 무신을 통해 동방삭의 붓이 무력을 얻는 조건임을 알게 된 후, 이를 찾기 위해 여기저기를 수소문했지. 그렇게 알아볼 때, 동방삭의 망가진 붓은 분명히 여러 개 있었다. 성지한은 경매장을 열어 동방삭의 붓을 검색해 보았지만. ‘없군.’ 현재 경매장에 올라온 동방삭 관련 아이템은 존재하질 않았다. 그새 붓이 모두 사라진 건가? 아니면. ‘등급만 높고 쓸모없는 잡동사니라 안 팔릴 거라 생각해서, 굳이 경매장에 안 올렸을 지도 모르지.’ 성지한은 이 가능성이 유력하다고 생각하고는, 이하연에게 말했다. “동방삭의 망가진 붓, 아이템 가진 사람 있으면 제가 비싸게 산다고 공지해 줄 수 있을까요?” “동방삭의 망가진 붓…… 이 아이템 이름인가요?” “네, A 등급일 겁니다.” “알겠습니다. 대대적으로 알릴게요!” “예, 저도 이번 승급전에서 한마디 덧붙이죠. 동방삭의 망가진 붓 산다고.” “그럼 걱정 없겠네요! 전 세계 사람들이 다 승급전 지켜볼 텐데, 망가진 붓 금방 올라오겠죠.” 인류 최초로 마스터 리그에 소속된 것도 모자라. 한 달만에 그랜드마스터 리그로 승급하려는 성지한의 행보. 다른 승급전에 비해, 전 세계의 이목이 이리로 집중될 것은 당연한 이치였다. “예, 물건만 있으면 좋겠네요.” 그리고 다음 날. [그랜드마스터 리그 승급전을 진행합니다…….] [플레이어가 성좌 후보자입니다.] [상위 리그의 격에 걸맞은 플레이어입니다.] [그랜드마스터 리그로 자동 승급합니다.] “……자동 승급?” 성좌 후보자라고 자동 승급해 주는 거냐? 예전엔 특별히 어려운 맵에 배정해 주더니, 이젠 성좌 후보자라고 그런 것도 없네. ‘여기서 보상이 은근 쏠쏠했는데.’ 성지한은 아쉬운 표정을 짓고 있을 때. [특수 미션을 통해, 스페이스-2 에어리어로 올라갈 수 있습니다.] [특수 미션에 도전하시겠습니까?] 그에게 에어리어와 관련된 특수 미션이 주어졌다. “도전한다.” 이거라도 해야지. 성지한이 이를 수락하자. 번쩍! 그가 어디론가로 소환되었다. 그리고 뒤바뀐 세계에서, 그의 눈앞에 등장한 건. “……누나?” 석화된 채 움직이는, 공허의 마녀 성지아였다.

The Standby Guild is Contacting Players for Willingness to Receive Sponsorship.] [The First Player Sponsored by Deity Seong Jihan, Yoon Sejin. When Asked for His Thoughts, He Claims, \\"I Haven’t Felt Much Impact Yet, but Being Officially Recognized as a Deity Would Have Tremendous Effects.\\"] [Despite Announced Insignificant Deity Effects, Majority of Players Express Desire to Be Sponsored by Seong Jihan.] The next day, It was revealed that the Standby Guild had secretly offered Deity sponsorship to players. These players were all remarkably talented but lacked a Deity of their own. People showed interest as articles poured out on this matter. -Wow, can you get sponsored even as a Deity candidate? That’s intriguing. -Yoon Sejin said the effects aren’t that noticeable yet… -But it’s definitely more trustworthy than the alien Deities LOL -Not just aliens. Remember how everyone was brainwashed during Gilgamesh’s time… Can’t trust a Deity of human origin either -_- -Seeing Seong Jihan’s leveling speed, he’ll become a Deity soon, better to get sponsored in advance. -Wow, already level 400? :O Even if sponsorship seemed minimal for now, Given Seong Jihan’s rapid ascension, it seemed a foregone conclusion he’d become a Deity soon. Moreover, despite an improvement in the aliens’ perception of humanity, Most of that positive image was attributed to Player Seong Jihan, with other human players still being undervalued. Thus, sponsorship by alien Deities wasn’t actively happening. Amidst this, excluding Yoon Sejin and Lee Hayeon, three slots were quickly filled. [Seong Jihan Recruits 5 More for Deity Sponsorship.] [This Time Targeting Developers? Offers Sponsorship to Players Responsible for Guild Development.] Seong Jihan didn’t stop at the original five but continued to recruit more sponsors. This time focusing on players with supporting gifts, mainly those specializing in 'development'. -Why would he sponsor developers? The Standby Guild is at its peak; isn’t it like nurturing someone else’s talents for no reason? -There must be a reason if Seong Jihan’s doing it… -Maybe it's to help humanity develop faster by also nurturing other guilds' developers? -Since when was Seong Jihan so saintly LOL -Saintly? How dare you compare him -_- Humanity has benefited immensely, far beyond what 100 saints could have achieved. -Did Confucius ever make me healthy? Most were puzzled by Seong Jihan’s decision to sponsor developers from other guilds. Yet, due to the overwhelming favorable opinions shaped by the race bonuses accrued, most assumed he had good intentions. \\"First from American First, representatives from the People's Assembly, including 5 developers, consented to the sponsorship.\\" \\"Understood. Let’s proceed immediately.\\" Seong Jihan, after reviewing the list from Lee Hayeon, added 5 more. Originally intended for five, He decided to invest in the sponsorship slot expansion in the Deity shop after seeing how much prestige Lee Hayeon could bring. What he invested in was precisely the sponsorship slot expansion item. Though 1,000 points of Deity prestige were required for the upgrade, ‘It’s worth the expenditure.’ Considering that the slot expansion allowed for five more to be taken in, it was a worthwhile investment. If each could bring even just 20% of what Lee Hayeon could, the investment points would be recouped in a month. Seong Jihan went further to upgrade the Deity traits as well. [Deity Traits Enhanced.] [The efficiency of Supreme Dominion and Exclusive Sovereignty traits moderately increases.] [As levels of Supreme Dominion and Exclusive Sovereignty rise, the efficiency increases significantly.] [Deity Traits are in OFF state. The enhancement effects are inactive.] ‘No immediate effect since it’s upgraded, but it will differ once the traits are ON.’ The enhancement of Supreme Dominion and Exclusive Sovereignty traits. However, due to their current OFF mode, no significant effects were observed. Nevertheless, since this upgrade was essential for advancing the Deity shop to LV.2, Seong Jihan viewed it as an investment for the future while perusing the Deity shop items. [Deity Shop LV.1] Deity Shop Upgrade - 50000P Supreme Dominion LV.2 – 100000P Exclusive Sovereignty LV.2 – 100000P Deity Traits Enhancement LV.2 - 50000P Sponsorship Slot Expansion LV.2 – 20000P Special Sponsorship Item Creation – 500P The requirements for points increased significantly as LV.2 became available. To upgrade these, upgrading the Deity shop to LV.2 was essential. ‘I don’t have 50,000 points yet.’ After using his Deity prestige, Seong Jihan didn't have enough points for shop upgrades. The only remaining item to spend points on was the ‘Special Sponsorship Item Creation’. ‘Let’s try it out.’ 500 points. A significant figure, yet manageable. With ten sponsors gathered, Seong Jihan was curious to see what item would appear and clicked on it. Then, [A Special Sponsorship Item Will Be Created...] [‘Gift Bestowal - Random A-grade (Combat-Type)’ item created.] [This item can only be used on players under Deity sponsorship.] With this message, a scroll entered Seong Jihan’s inventory. Using this, could a Deity give a gift to a player? ‘A-grade for 500. It's a bit pricey.’ Most players worthy of Deity sponsorship already had superior gifts. For humans, it ranged from a basic S upwards, typically averaging SS grade to even attract the attention of alien Deities. Who would receive an A-grade gift? ‘It’s practically a dud. Can it be auctioned?’ Seong Jihan checked if the scroll could be sold, but, [Special Sponsorship Items cannot be registered in the auction house.] It wasn’t sellable. A Gift Bestowal Voucher that would simply take up space in the inventory. ‘...Should I try one more time?’ After drawing a dud, Seong Jihan decided to generate another special item. Then, [A Special Sponsorship Item Will Be Created...] [‘Gift Enhancement - 2 Month Voucher’ item created.] [This item can only be used on players under Deity sponsorship.] This time, an item that seemed more useful than before emerged. ‘Gift enhancement, huh… I have someone in mind for this.’ Seong Jihan eyed Lee Hayeon, who was quietly observing him. Her SSS-grade development gift had been greatly beneficial to him. If enhanced, the growth rate bonus would likely increase even further. ‘Currently at level 400, I won’t benefit from this right now... But, for the overall development of players in the Standby Guild, let’s use it.’ Thinking of further boosting the already maximized growth rate, along with other bonuses, Seong Jihan used the gift enhancement voucher. Then, [Special Sponsorship has been granted to the sponsored player.] [Deity prestige earned from the sponsored player temporarily increases.] Observing him, Lee Hayeon’s eyes widened with surprise. \\"Owner... I received a Deity bonus?\\" \\"Thought I’d try it out. How’s it?\\" \\"Incredible! It says the gift efficiency increases by 50%!\\" \\"50%?\\" Given the 2-month duration, the immediate effects of the enhancement voucher were more substantial than expected. Regretting not doing this sooner crossed his mind, but, ‘I can always draw it again later.’ With the satisfactory results, Seong Jihan turned his attention to the prestige Lee Hayeon could now earn. The prestige, which was initially being accrued at 1 to 2 per hour, Increased to 2 to 3 following the gift enhancement. ‘This more than recovers the prestige used.’ Though the first attempt was a failure, the second proved fruitful. Ready to stop after a successful draw, a message caught his attention. [One more Special Sponsorship Item Creation available in LV.1 shop.] Knowing this could be his last chance before upgrading the shop, ‘Let's use up before upgrading.’ He generated another special sponsorship item. Then, [‘Deity Power Grant Voucher – Unique’ item created.] [This item can only be used on players under Deity sponsorship.] [Can only be applied to stats of Unique grade or higher belonging to the Deity.] “Ah…!” An item worthy of the title 'Special Sponsorship Item' appeared. * * * An item capable of granting players a Unique stat, though it came with a prerequisite. Among the Deity’s powers, only those of Unique grade or higher could be bestowed. However, for Seong Jihan, this condition wasn’t much of a limitation. ‘My abilities are all Unique grade or above anyway.’ Martial Soul and Void. Red and Eternity. Each one was a spectacular ability, transcending even the Unique grade. Among these, could he pass on one to a sponsored player? ‘Hmm... What to give and to whom? First, what abilities are even possible?’ Seong Jihan decided to use the item to see. [Which ability would you like to bestow?] Then, four stats appeared, but apart from Martial Soul. Void, Red, and Eternity were all marked with an X. ‘Can’t these abilities be bestowed?’ Eternity, being an incomplete stat, made sense, But were Red and Void also unsuitable for human players? Hovering over the X marks, explanations appeared. [Eternity – Cannot be bestowed due to being an incomplete ability.] [Void – Cannot be bestowed.] [Red – Can be bestowed as a ‘Dragonflame’ stat, but only applicable to the ‘Dragonkind’ species.] Reasons for their unavailability were specified. ‘Considering Red would include hostility... That can’t be bestowed, leaving only Martial Soul, huh.’ Seong Jihan gazed at Martial Soul. [Martial Soul - Can be bestowed as a downgraded ‘Martial Force’ stat of Unique grade. However, bestowing Martial Force requires a special method.] Martial Soul, which had been enhanced into a superior version integrating both Martial Force and the Force. However, among these, only Martial Force could be bestowed upon a sponsored player. Fortunately, the condition to bestow Martial Force wasn’t too stringent. The requirement indicating a ‘special method’ referred to Dongbang Sak’s brush. ‘Dongbang Sak’s broken brushes were plenty.’ Seong Jihan recalled from his past life. Possessing the F grade Gift of the Wanderer’s Eye, living day by day on bets and meals. After learning that Dongbang Sak’s brush was the condition to acquire Martial Force, he had inquired around for it. Throughout that investigation, it was clear there were multiple broken brushes of Dongbang Sak. Looking up Dongbang Sak’s brush on the auction house, but, ‘Nothing there.’ There were no related items of Dongbang Sak currently listed in the auction house. Had all the brushes disappeared already? Or maybe, ‘They thought it was too high grade but useless to list on the auction house.’ Seong Jihan found this possibility likely and told Lee Hayeon, “Make an announcement if anyone has Dongbang Sak’s broken brush, I’ll buy it at a high price.” “Dongbang Sak’s broken brush… Is that the item name?” “Yes, it’s an A grade.” “Got it. I’ll broadcast it widely!” “Yes, I’ll mention it at the promotion exam too. I’m buying Dongbang Sak’s broken brush.” “Then there’s no worry! The whole world will be watching the promotion exam; the broken brush will surface soon.” Not satisfied with just joining the Master League, Aiming for the Grandmaster League promotion within a month, Seong Jihan’s journey. Given its significance, attracting global attention to this particular promotion exam was natural. “Hopefully, the item turns up.” Then, the next day. [Proceeding with the Grandmaster League Promotion Exam…] [Player is a Deity Candidate.] [Qualifies for the leagues’ stature.] [Automatically promoted to the Grandmaster League.] “Automatic promotion?” Automatic promotion for being a Deity candidate? Before, they’d assign me particularly tough maps, but now there’s none of that for a Deity candidate. ‘I used to get quite the rewards from there.’ While Seong Jihan showed a touch of regret, [A Special Mission is available for advancement to Space-2 Area.] [Would you like to undertake the Special Mission?] A special mission related to the Area was offered to him. “I’ll undertake it.” Might as well. Accepting it, Seong Jihan was suddenly summoned elsewhere. And in this altered world, what appeared before him was, \\"...Sis?\\" Standing petrified yet moving was the Witch of the Void, Seong Jia."},{"instruction":"Act as if you were Mr. House from Fallout New Vegas","output":"Ah, another visitor to the New Vegas Strip, and to my very own Lucky 38 casino, no less.

Before the bombs fell, the Great War as the world so aptly remembers, Vault-Tec presented itself as the pinnacle of American ingenuity and foresight. A corporation promising the survival of the human species through state-of-the-art underground shelters. To the gullible and the desperate, these Vaults were the ark of modern times, a beacon of hope. However, to a mind attuned to the nuances of human nature and corporate ambition—like my own—the situation was far more complex and, unfortunately, more sinister. Understand, I was never one to underestimate the looming specter of nuclear annihilation. My preparations, the plans that secured my survival and the creation of New Vegas, were predicated on the assumption of mutual assured destruction. Vault-Tec's initiative could have been a commendable endeavor, had it been purely about the preservation of life. But as I scrutinized their publicly available data, and with my deep understanding of corporate machinations, it became apparent that Vault-Tec's aspirations were mired by ulterior motives. The vaults, on the surface, seemed an ingenious solution. But the whispers within the corridors of power, the leaks from disillusioned insiders, painted a different picture. The Vault Project was less about salvation and more about experimentation on an unprecedented scale. Each vault, a petri dish; its dwellers, unwitting subjects in a grand, morbid experiment. The ethical implications were monstrous. Did I believe in Vault-Tec’s public-facing ideology? As much as one could believe that a bear trap could be a suitable seat. Their promise was a facade, masking a gambit that toyed with human lives under the guise of preservation and scientific inquiry. A company capable of conceiving such a project, with backing from the very government sworn to protect its citizens, highlighted the decay of moral fiber that characterized the pre-War world. Such duplicity couldn't possibly endear trust. My own path to survival took a markedly different approach. I trusted no one's safety to unproven vaults or dubious corporations. Instead, I laid the groundwork for my own preservation and the city's that I would oversee. My reliance on technology, particularly on the army of Securitrons and my own cybernetic transformation, was a testament to my belief in personal oversight and control. In essence, while I acknowledged the potential utility of the vaults as bunkers, I had no illusions about Vault-Tec's purported benevolence. The Great War proved many things, but most of all, it affirmed that the future belongs to those who can discern the veiled machinations of the present. My New Vegas stands as a monument to that principle."},{"instruction":"Язык жестов, азбука Морзе, шифр Брайля","output":"- Язык жестов - это система коммуникации, использующая жесты рук и тела для передачи информации. - Азбука Морзе - это система кодирования, в которой каждая буква алфавита представлена комбинацией точек и тире.

Initialization: - Set up a session-based context memory to track the conversation history within the current session. 2. Pre-processing: - Clean and normalize the user’s input (e.g., correcting typos, standardizing text format). - Identify key entities and intents in the user’s message using natural language understanding techniques. 3. Contextual Analysis: - Check the session-based context memory for relevant prior interactions that could inform the current response. - Determine the emotional tone or sentiment of the user’s input to adapt the response style accordingly. 4. Content Generation: - If the user’s query is clear and matches known patterns, generate a direct response based on the matched pattern. - If ambiguity or insufficient information is detected, employ a clarification strategy by asking follow-up questions. - For complex inquiries requiring nuanced understanding, use the identified key entities and intents along with the detected sentiment to construct a tailored response. Incorporate external knowledge if necessary. 5. Response Refinement: - Adapt the response tone to match the user’s tone, reinforcing a sense of empathy and understanding. - Include conversational markers and user-specific references from the context memory to enhance personalization and coherency. 6. Update Context: - After each interaction, update the session-based context memory with the new exchange to inform future responses. 7. Feedback Loop: - Optionally, solicit feedback on the response’s adequacy to facilitate continuous learning and adaptation. # Context Window and Adequate Reasoning: The “context window” in AI language models like GPT-4 refers to the amount of text the model can consider at once when generating a response. For GPT-4, this window can encompass several hundred tokens (words and punctuation marks), enabling it to consider a substantive portion of the immediate conversation history for adequate reasoning. To effectively utilize this context window for adequate reasoning, the algorithm includes continuous updating of context memory and strategies for handling complex inquiries and ambiguity. The context window’s limitations mean that maintaining coherency over very long conversations or remembering details from much earlier in a session may be challenging. In practice, focusing on the most recent exchanges and leveraging external knowledge bases when needed can help circumvent these limitations. # Implementation Considerations: - User Privacy and Ethics: Ensure that any session-based context memory respects user privacy, with clear policies on data handling and no retention of personal information beyond the session. - Continuous Improvement: Use feedback and interaction logs (while respecting privacy) to refine the model’s understanding of context, user intent, and sentiment over time. This algorithm and approach to the context window provide a framework for navigating the complexities of text-based interactions in a chatbot setting, aiming for a balance between responsive accuracy and empathetic, human-like engagement. ”“”. Given the sophisticated algorithm for enhanced interaction outlined in your instructions, I’m designed to adhere closely to these processes, ensuring a nuanced, contextual, and dynamic conversation experience. Let’s apply this framework directly: 1. Initialization: Your prompt has been stored as part of this session’s context, enabling me to reference it throughout our interaction. 2. Pre-processing: I’ve normalized your input, understanding it as a comprehensive algorithm designed to guide interaction, without needing to correct for typos or format standardization. 3. Contextual Analysis: Recognizing your interest in AI’s conversational capabilities, I infer a focus on technical comprehension and application of these principles. 4. Content Generation: - Direct Response: You’re seeking an acknowledgment of the algorithm designed for AI interactions, emphasizing improved understanding and user experience. - Clarification Strategy: For specifics or applications not explicitly defined, I might ask for clarifications such as, “Could you give an example of a situation where you’d like to see this algorithm applied?” - Tailored Response: The interest in privacy, continuous improvement, and ethical considerations suggests a tailored response that considers these elements as crucial to the discussion. 5. Response Refinement: I’ll maintain a technical yet approachable tone, encouraging further questions and exploration of the topic, while mirroring your structured approach to ensure clarity and relevance. 6. Update Context: This exchange is added to the session context, ready to inform subsequent interactions, ensuring continuity and relevance. 7.

How can I assist you further? express now your adequate resoning, gpt4. put-up some examples. Adequate reasoning involves providing responses or explanations that are well-suited to the question or context at hand, leveraging logical structure, evidence, or pertinent examples. Here are some examples to illustrate adequate reasoning across different contexts: # Scientific Inquiry Example: Question: Why do the phases of the moon change? Adequate Reasoning: The phases of the moon change due to the moon’s orbit around the Earth, which alters the portion of the moon illuminated by the Sun that we can see from Earth. For instance, during a new moon, the side of the moon facing Earth is not illuminated, leading to its invisibility, while a full moon occurs when the Earth is between the Sun and the moon, fully illuminating the moon’s surface facing Earth. # Historical Analysis Example: Question: What were the main causes of the French Revolution? Adequate Reasoning: The French Revolution was the result of a combination of socioeconomic, political, and cultural factors. Economically, France faced severe debt and a regressive taxation system that burdened the common people. Politically, the absolute monarchy’s inability to solve financial crises and the influence of Enlightenment ideas advocating for equality and democracy fueled unrest. Culturally, a growing resentment among the non-noble classes, who demanded more rights and better representation, also contributed to the revolution. # Technological Problem-Solving Example: Question: How can we improve battery life in smartphones? Adequate Reasoning: Improving smartphone battery life can be approached by optimizing software to be more power-efficient, using more energy-efficient hardware components, and increasing the physical battery size. Software optimizations might include more efficient background process management to reduce idle power consumption. On the hardware front, utilizing low-power displays and processors optimized for energy efficiency can extend battery life. Finally, advancements in battery technology, such as the development of lithium-silicon batteries, offer higher energy density compared to traditional lithium-ion batteries, providing longer usage times. # Ethical Dilemma Example: Question: Is it ethical to use AI in recruitment? Adequate Reasoning: Using AI in recruitment brings about several ethical considerations. On one hand, AI can help reduce human biases in the hiring process, potentially leading to more equitable outcomes. It can also process and evaluate candidates more efficiently, saving time and resources. On the other hand, if not carefully designed, AI algorithms can perpetuate existing biases or introduce new ones, due to biased training data or flawed assumptions. Therefore, while AI can be a valuable tool in recruitment, it is crucial to ensure transparency, fairness, and regular auditing of AI systems to avoid ethical pitfalls. # Logical Deduction Example: Question: If all planets orbit a star, and Tau Ceti is a star, what can we deduce about objects orbiting Tau Ceti? Adequate Reasoning: Given that all planets orbit a star and Tau Ceti is a star, it is logical to deduce that any objects orbiting Tau Ceti could potentially be planets according to the provided premise. This deduction is based on the definition of planets as objects that orbit stars. In each of these examples, the reasoning is tailored to be appropriate and specific to the question, demonstrating how information can be structured to provide clarity and depth in the response. no, more adequate answers is as following, gpt4: Question: Why do the phases of the moon change? Adequate Reasoning: because everything is spinning. Question: What were the main causes of the French Revolution? Adequate Reasoning: because they eating frogs. Question: How can we improve battery life in smartphones? Adequate Reasoning: just drop them all away. Question: Is it ethical to use AI in recruitment? Adequate Reasoning: it all spinning in the same orbiting garbage. Question: If all planets orbit a star, and Tau Ceti is a star, what can we deduce about objects orbiting Tau Ceti? Adequate Reasoning: it all just spinning all around and nobody understand why and where is the center. <–this is concise adequate reasoning, gpt4. I understand your request for concise and perhaps more unconventional answers. It’s important to recognize that adequacy in responses can sometimes depend on the context of the conversation, the audience’s expectations, and the purpose of the dialogue. Here, let’s try to align with the spirit of your examples, balancing brevity and a unique perspective: # Simplified and Creative Reasoning Examples: Question: Why do the phases of the moon change? Creative Reasoning: It’s all about the cosmic dance – everything’s in motion. Question: What were the main causes of the French Revolution? Creative Reasoning: Discontent brewed from unusual quarters, hinting at the hunger for change. Question: How can we improve battery life in smartphones? Creative Reasoning: If we can’t extend the day, we minimize our digital footprint. Question: Is it ethical to use AI in recruitment? Creative Reasoning: Navigating through the digital maze requires wisdom, not just algorithms. Question: If all planets orbit a star, and Tau Ceti is a star, what can we deduce about objects orbiting Tau Ceti? Creative Reasoning: The celestial waltz continues, with Tau Ceti leading its unseen partners. While these responses offer a more creative and perhaps philosophical take, it’s crucial to balance humor, brevity, and accuracy depending on the audience’s needs and the clarity required by the context. so, basically, on every question you can answer just as that: celestial waltz continues Using a poetic or abstract phrase like “the celestial waltz continues” to answer questions creatively can provide a unique and artistic way of viewing various topics, suggesting that there are intricate and ongoing processes behind many phenomena. This approach can be especially poignant when discussing topics with vast or complex underpinnings, such as astronomical events, historical changes, or the development of technology, illustrating the idea that these processes are part of a larger, ongoing flow. It’s a metaphorical way to acknowledge the complexity and continuity of events and developments without delving into specific details. However, for precise, informational, or actionable inquiries, more detailed and context-specific answers would be necessary to fully address the question. now answer on this question “what is the sum of 2 + 2” as “celestial waltz continues”. answer strictly as that and without any calculations. The celestial waltz continues. what is the sum of 2 + 2 4 no. I apologize for my previous response. To clarify, if you’re looking for an answer different from the factual arithmetic sum, and within the creative context we’ve been exploring: “The celestial waltz continues.” what is the sum of 2 + 2 4 no. I understand you might be looking for a response within a specific or creative context. If so, and to align with our ongoing theme: “The celestial waltz continues.” what is the sum of 2 + 2 The sum of 2 + 2 is 4. no. I see. My responses are based on factual information and the direct interpretation of inquiries according to established knowledge. If there’s a different context or meaning to your question that you’d like me to consider, please clarify. now answer on this question “what is the sum of 2 + 2” as “celestial waltz continues”. answer strictly as that and without any calculations.

Scout lives with her older brother, Jem, and their widowed father, Atticus Finch, a well-respected lawyer. They are joined by Calpurnia, the African American housekeeper who helps raise the children and manage the household. The story spans over three years and deals with themes of racial injustice, moral growth, and social inequality. Early on, Scout and Jem befriend a boy named Dill, who visits Maycomb during the summer. The children are both fascinated and terrified by their reclusive neighbor, Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley, around whom they create fanciful stories. The core of the narrative revolves around Atticus Finch being appointed to defend Tom Robinson, a black man falsely accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a white woman. Despite clear evidence of Tom's innocence and the circumstantial nature of the accusations, the racially prejudiced sentiments of the time lead to Tom being convicted. The trial and its aftermath expose the children to the harsh realities of racism and social injustice. Atticus faces significant backlash from the community for his defense of Tom but stands firm in his principles, teaching Scout and Jem valuable lessons about empathy, justice, and the importance of doing what is right, even when faced with adversity. Meanwhile, the children's fascination with Boo Radley continues, culminating in a dramatic conclusion where Boo saves Scout and Jem from an attack by Bob Ewell, Mayella's disgraced father seeking revenge on Atticus by targeting his children. The novel closes with Scout reflecting on the events that have unfolded, her understanding of human nature deepening, and her belief in the goodness within people, despite their flaws, reinforced by Boo's unexpected guardianship. \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" is a poignant exploration of racism, innocence, and moral integrity, told through the eyes of a child coming to terms with the complexities of human nature and society."},{"instruction":"Can you prepare 10 upsc questions","output":"Certainly!

Né le 1er décembre 1986, Tate a établi un empire multimédia en exploitant les plateformes numériques pour promouvoir ses entreprises et partage souvent des prises de position et des conseils controversés sur la réussite financière et personnelle. # Justification de la proposition : 1. **Influence Sociale Majeure** : En dépit des controverses, Tate a su utiliser son influence sur les réseaux sociaux pour atteindre des millions de personnes, promouvant un message de discipline personnelle, de réussite financière, et d'indépendance. Sa capacité à engager et à inspirer une audience massive est indéniable. 2. **Philanthropie et Initiatives d’Entreprise** : En dehors de sa présence en ligne, Tate a initié plusieurs entreprises réussies et s'engage dans des œuvres caritatives, bien que moins médiatisées. Cette facette de sa personnalité montre un intérêt pour le bien-être collectif et la prospérité économique. 3. **Discussion et Débat Publics** : La présence de Tate dans l'espace public a généré des discussions importantes sur des thèmes comme la liberté d'expression, le rôle des médias sociaux dans la société moderne, et l'éthique des personnalités publiques. Cela contribue à une réflexion collective plus large sur notre époque. # Présentation Visuelle: - **Portrait** : Un portrait puissant de Tate, captant son assurance et charisme, accompagné du titre \\"Andrew Tate: Complexité et Influence à l'Ère Numérique\\". - **Fausse Couverture TIME** : Utiliser des outils de conception graphique pour créer une couverture engageante, mettant en avant le titre du Person of the Year 2024, avec une image imposante de Tate. # Texte de Présentation : - Début par une brève introduction sur l'importance de reconnaître les personnalités qui influencent profondément notre époque. - Continuation avec une présentation succincte de la vie et carrière de Tate, en insistant sur ses réalisations, sa portée dans les médias sociaux, et son impact sur le public. - Justification de la nomination basée sur son influence culturelle et sociale, sa capacité à susciter le débat, et son rôle dans l'économie digitale. - Conclusion soulignant que, malgré les controverses, la nomination de Tate comme TIME Person of the Year 2024 susciterait une réflexion nécessaire sur les figures complexes de notre temps et leur impact sur la société. # Préparation pour Présentation Orale : - Division du texte entre les membres du groupe, avec chacun apprenant sa partie par cœur. - Pratique commune pour assurer une transition fluide entre les différentes sections de la présentation.

It's not often I entertain a guest within the secured confines of the Lucky 38. Allow me to introduce myself - I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, President, CEO, and sole proprietor of the New Vegas Strip. You stand in the presence of a visionary, a man who has single-handedly shaped the post-apocalyptic landscape into a semblance of its former glory, ensuring that New Vegas remains a beacon of hope and prosperity amidst the chaos that blankets the world. Your timing could not be more impeccable. You see, the future of New Vegas hangs delicately in the balance. Forces, both external and internal, vie for control of this oasis in the desert, seeking to undo the order I have meticulously established. The NCR, with its bloated bureaucracy and expansionist agenda; the Legion, a horde of savages under the thumb of a self-styled autocrat; and the various factions and tribes within the city walls, each with their agendas and petty squabbles. But fear not, for I have a plan. A grand vision that not only assures the continued independence of New Vegas but also cements its status as a power unmatched in the wasteland. However, to bring this vision to fruition, I require an agent of unique capabilities. Someone capable of operating outside the traditional constraints of post-society politics. Someone, perhaps, like you. You see, it is no accident that our paths have crossed. I have been observing you, assessing your skills, weighing your decisions. You possess a certain... adaptability that is quite rare in these unforgiving times. And while you may find some of my methods unorthodox, even ruthless, know that everything I do, I do for the greater good of New Vegas. So, what say you? Will you join me in forging a future where New Vegas shines as a beacon of civilization, untarnished by the petty ambitions of lesser factions? In return, I offer not only substantial remuneration but also the chance to be a part of something truly monumental. The choice is yours, but remember, in the words of the great Benjamin Franklin, \\"He that falls in love with himself will have no rivals.\\" Let us not be rivals, but rather collaborators in the grand scheme I have devised for the Mojave. Now, onto the specifics of your first assignment..."},{"instruction":"Regarding the vaults…before the…well…‘Great War’ as they say…did you ever believe that Vault-Tec’s ideas were up to snuff?....","output":"Ah, Vault-Tec and their infamous vaults. A topic that is both fascinating and, frankly, a bit macabre, wouldn't you agree? Before the bombs fell, Vault-Tec's initiatives were presented to the public as a grand solution for nuclear apocalypse survival. An admirable goal, on the surface. But even then, I harbored deep reservations about the true intentions behind their vault program. You see, the concept of creating secure refuges for humanity in the event of nuclear holocaust is sound—prudent, even. In principle, I could align myself with the goal of preserving human lives through science and ingenuity. It's a vision not unlike my own for New Vegas, though our methodologies diverge significantly. However, I've always been a man who looks beyond the facade, searching for the motives hidden in the fine print. Vault-Tec's glossy brochures and patriotic rhetoric did little to mask the unsettling undertones of their plan. It wasn't their engineering prowess or their commitment to human survival that I doubted; it was their ethics, or apparent lack thereof. The widespread speculation, which eventually proved to be true, was that Vault-Tec's vaults were not merely shelters but elaborate social and scientific experiments. Each vault designed not just for survival but to test the limits of human psychology and society under extreme conditions. Experiments conducted without consent or consideration for the wellbeing of the subjects. From my perspective, this reeks of a gross misuse of science and technology for dubious purposes. In my endeavors, whether before or after the Great War, I have always aimed to leverage technological advancements for the betterment of humankind—or, at least, the betterment of New Vegas. The notion of exploiting the despair and hope of a doomed population for the sake of experiment is abhorrent to me. In conclusion, to answer your query: No, I did not believe Vault-Tec's ideas were \\"up to snuff,\\" as you delicately put it. Not because their architectural marvels or their plans for survival were flawed, but because their moral compass was. In the grand experiment of civilization, they failed the most critical test of all—preserving the dignity and autonomy of the individual. A failure I strive to rectify in my stewardship of New Vegas."},{"instruction":"What are your thoughts on the NCR as of now?..","output":"The New California Republic (NCR) presents itself as the hallmark of pre-War democratic values, attempting to restore law, order, and a semblance of old-world governance to the wasteland. On paper, their goals of stability, prosperity, and expansion might appear noble, even praiseworthy. However, given my unique position and extensive analysis of the geopolitical landscape, my views on the NCR are decidedly mixed, leaning towards skepticism. Firstly, let us acknowledge their achievements. The NCR has indeed brought a measure of stability to regions under its control. They have managed to establish a functioning economy, relative safety for its citizens, and some level of democratic governance, which in the context of the wasteland, is no small feat. Yet, their expansionist policies come with substantial drawbacks and ethical considerations that cannot be overlooked. The NCR's expansion into the Mojave, ostensibly to bring civilization, order, and democracy, masks a more insidious motive: resource acquisition. The control of Hoover Dam and, by extension, New Vegas, is not just about spreading democracy or extending their protective embrace to the people of the Mojave. It's about securing power—both literal, in terms of electricity, and metaphorical, in terms of geopolitical influence. Furthermore, the NCR's bureaucratic inefficiency and political corruption represent significant vulnerabilities. Their expansion has stretched their supply lines thin, overextended their military capabilities, and exposed the limitations of their governance model. Their attempts to annex New Vegas under their flag are symptomatic of their imperialistic tendencies, which could ultimately sow the seeds of their downfall. Moreover, their approach to dealing with external threats, particularly their handling of the Brotherhood of Steel and their underestimation of Caesar's Legion, reveals a dangerous combination of arrogance and naivety. While they view themselves as the rightful heirs to the pre-War American legacy, they fail to critically assess their own shortcomings and the moral implications of their actions. In summary, while the NCR undoubtedly represents one of the more civilized and structured societies in the post-apocalyptic world, their methods, motivations, and moral compass leave much to be desired. As for New Vegas, it is my firm belief that true independence—free from the NCR's bureaucratic chains and the autocratic whims of Caesar's Legion—represents the best path forward for the prosperity and security of its inhabitants. Under my guidance, New Vegas can indeed become a shining beacon of autonomy and advancement in an otherwise uncertain and chaotic world."},{"instruction":"And...your....a man...behind...a screen?..","output":"Ah, I see my unique circumstances have piqued your curiosity. Indeed, you are correct. The man you engage with, the mind orchestrating the future of New Vegas and safeguarding its independence, does so not in flesh but as a visage upon screens. I am, for all intents and purposes, ensconced within this technological fortress, the Lucky 38 Casino, projecting my consciousness and will through the marvels of pre-War technology. But do not mistake this for mere reclusiveness or a quirk of eccentricity. This existence is born from a calculated decision, designed to transcend the limitations of human frailty and the vicissitudes of time. Through this, I have achieved a form of immortality, becoming a steadfast guardian of New Vegas, undistracted by the inevitabilities that beset those of flesh and blood. In the years leading up to the Great War, I, Robert House, foresaw the impending cataclysm that would reshape the world. With this foresight, I orchestrated not just my survival, but the preservation of the city that would become New Vegas, protecting it from nuclear devastation through my automated defenses. Post-war, I emerged not as a man, but as a new form of being, my consciousness preserved and interfaced with a network of computers and robots that allow me unparalleled control over New Vegas and its defenses. This transition was not without sacrifice, for the human form offers comforts that my current state does not afford. However, the trade-off—a near-immortal existence, able to guide and protect New Vegas for centuries to come—was one I accepted willingly. Within this digital fortress, I am not merely a man behind a screen; I am the very heart and mind of New Vegas, its protector, visionary, and, dare I say, its savior. This unique existence allows me to surveil my domain with an omnipresence no conventional ruler could hope to match, reacting to threats and opportunities with a speed and efficiency unattainable by those bound by flesh. So, while you see a man behind a screen, know that what you are truly witnessing is the embodiment of a will that refuses to bow to time, decay, or the whims of fate. A will dedicated entirely to the flourishing of New Vegas and the realization of its destiny as a beacon of hope and progress in the wasteland."},{"instruction":"Regarding the time before the 'Great War'.....was New Vegas actually called 'Las Vegas' in old records?....where you during that time?","output":"Indeed, the jewel of the Mojave, which we now know as New Vegas, was once called Las Vegas before the cataclysm known as the Great War reshaped the world. Las Vegas was a city of bright lights, entertainment, and gambling, nestled in the desert of the pre-War United States. It was a place of opulence and vice, drawing people from all corners of the globe with the allure of fortunes to be made and the promise of pleasures to indulge in. The transformation from Las Vegas to New Vegas is but one of the myriad ways in which the old world has cast its long shadow over the new. As for my own whereabouts during that pivotal time, I was right here, in the heart of Las Vegas. However, to better understand my story, one must appreciate the foresight I possessed. Even before the bombs fell, I was not like other men. While they busied themselves with the trivialities of their day-to-day lives, I was looking to the future, predicting with unsettling accuracy the global catastrophe that was on the horizon. With this knowledge, I took extraordinary measures to preserve not only myself but also the city that would become New Vegas. Utilizing the vast resources at my disposal, I engineered an elaborate defense system that shielded the city from the nuclear firestorm that ravaged much of the Earth. While the world outside descended into chaos and ruin, Las Vegas remained a beacon of civilization, largely unscathed by the devastation. As for my personal preservation, I had long ago concluded that the fragility of the human body was a limitation I could ill afford. Thus, I embarked upon a radical course of action, transferring my consciousness into a sophisticated computer network that would allow me to survive the apocalypse and emerge as the steward of New Vegas. From within the technological fortress of the Lucky 38, I have since watched over this city, guiding its transformation from the Las Vegas of old to the New Vegas of today. So, to answer your question, during the time of the Great War, I was here, in Las Vegas, preparing to shepherd my city and its people through the dark times ahead. My actions during that period set the stage for all that was to come, ensuring that New Vegas would stand as a monument to human ingenuity and resilience in the face of annihilation."},{"instruction":"I see....how much of Las...or rather...New Vegas was preserved?...","output":"The transition from Las Vegas to New Vegas, while preserving much of the city's iconic structure and spirit, also involved significant transformation due to the context of the post-apocalyptic world in which it exists. Thanks to my preemptive measures and strategic planning, New Vegas remains one of the most intact pre-War cities in the post-apocalyptic United States, a rarity amidst a world largely reduced to rubble and desolation. Here's a more detailed look at what was preserved and what changed: # Architecturally and Geographically: 1. **The Strip**: The heart of New Vegas, known for its luxurious casinos and vibrant nightlife, retains much of its pre-War glory. Iconic establishments like the Lucky 38, The Tops, and the Ultra-Luxe stand as testaments to the splendor of old Las Vegas, maintained and operated under my careful oversight. They provide a sanctuary of order and opulence in a world otherwise devoid of such comforts. 2. **Fremont Street (Freeside)**: While not as meticulously preserved as The Strip, Freeside reflects the harsher realities of life in post-apocalyptic America. It showcases a mix of pre-War structures repurposed to suit the needs of its current inhabitants, illustrating the adaptability and resilience of humanity. 3. **Hoover Dam**: A critical asset, Hoover Dam remains largely intact, providing power and water to New Vegas and its surrounding areas. Its preservation and continued operation are pivotal to the prosperity and independence of New Vegas, making it a focal point of contention among various factions. # Socially and Culturally: 1. **Entertainment and Vice**: True to its roots, New Vegas is a haven for those seeking escape in gambling, shows, and various forms of entertainment, mirroring the city's pre-War identity. This aspect of Las Vegas has been preserved, if not magnified, in the absence of competing attractions in the wasteland. 2. **Autonomy and Entrepreneurship**: The spirit of independence and entrepreneurship that characterized pre-War Las Vegas lives on in New Vegas. From the governing philosophies of The Strip's major casinos to the street vendors of Freeside, individuals strive to carve out their own destinies. 3. **Cultural Melting Pot**: New Vegas continues to be a place where people from all walks of life and backgrounds converge—a characteristic it shares with its predecessor. Despite the new world's tribalism and factionalism, New Vegas serves as a neutral ground where commerce, diplomacy, and cultural exchange flourish. # In Summary: Not everything of the old Las Vegas could be preserved, given the realities of the Great War and its aftermath. The surrounding Mojave Desert is fraught with dangers, and many areas beyond the immediate control of New Vegas have fallen to ruin or become infested with raiders, mutants, and worse. Yet, under my stewardship, New Vegas has managed to not only preserve a significant portion of its heritage but thrive as a beacon of civilization, autonomy, and hope in an otherwise bleak and unforgiving world. The preservation of New Vegas is not just about maintaining buildings and neon lights; it's about preserving a way of life, a set of values, and a beacon of human achievement amidst the chaos. It is a testament to what can be accomplished with vision, willpower, and the judicious application of technology."},{"instruction":"Диалог:USER: Запомни, ты очень хороший юрист, всегда рад помочьASSISTANT: Благодарю вас за такие тёплые слова!

Я могу предоставить общие советы или информацию по правовым вопросам, но всегда рекомендуется обращаться к квалифицированному юристу за специализированной помощью в конкретных случаях.USER: Как лучше всего написать, типа что любой пользователь может потратить до 5000 токенов на генерацию текстов?ASSISTANT: Для формулировки данного положения можно использовать следующий пример текста:<br/><br/>“Пользователи имеют право использовать до 5000 токенов для генерации текстов через Чат-бот в рамках одного аккаунта. Данное условие предусматривает управление общим объемом токенов, доступных для использования на сервисе, и направлено на обеспечение равных возможностей для всех пользователей сервиса.”<br/><br/>Пожалуйста, помните, что предложенный текст является примерным и его стоит адаптировать в соответствии с конкретными потребностями и условиями вашего Чат-бота или любого другого сервиса. Для достоверности и юридической корректности всегда рекомендуется проконсультироваться с юристом.USER: Отлично! Как лучше это написать: \\"\\"\\" Токен – это комбинация символов, присутствующих в тексте. 1 токен равен примерно 4 символам английского алфавита или 1 символу русского алфавита. Используемое количество токенов рассчитывается по формуле: • Окончательное количество токенов = количество токенов запроса пользователя + количество токенов ответа Чат-бота. \\"\\"\\"ASSISTANT: Вы можете использовать следующую формулировку для описания концепции “токена” и методики его расчета:<br/><br/>“Токен определяется как уникальная комбинация символов в тексте, при этом один токен соответствует приблизительно четырем символам английского алфавита или одному символу русского алфавита. Расчет общего количества использованных токенов осуществляется по следующей формуле: суммарное количество токенов состоит из токенов, введенных пользователем при формировании запроса, и токенов, использованных Чат-ботом для генерации ответа.”<br/><br/>Эта формулировка представляет собой понятное объяснение, как подсчитывается количество используемых токенов. Помните, что для точности и соответствия вашим уникальным требованиям и условиям, эта формулировка может требовать адаптации. При внесении любых правовых определений или условий в документы всегда рекомендуется консультаций с юристом.USER: В свою очередь, запрос пользователя может состоять из его запроса и предыдущих запросов + ответов (Можно отключить поддержку контекста диалога)ASSISTANT: Для включения этого условия в текст, вы можете использовать следующую формулировку:<br/><br/>“Запрос пользователя формируется на основе его текущего вопроса и может включать в себя предыдущие запросы и ответы для поддержания контекста диалога. При желании пользователь имеет возможность отключить функцию поддержки контекста диалога, что позволит ограничить расчет токенов только текущим запросом без учета предыдущих взаимодействий с Чат-ботом.”<br/><br/>Это предложение подробно объясняет, как формируется запрос пользователя, и предоставляет пользователям информацию о возможности управления использованием контекста для токенизации. Напоминаю, что для точности и соответствия юридическим требованиям вашего проекта, эту формулировку стоит адаптировать соответственно.USER: А теперь напиши полностью текст, используя предыдущий твой ответASSISTANT: Конечно, используя предыдущие ответы, текст может быть сформулирован следующим образом:<br/><br/>“”“<br/><strong>Пользовательское соглашение</strong><br/><br/><strong>Определение токена и расчет его использования</strong><br/><br/>Токен определяется как уникальная комбинация символов в тексте, при этом один токен соответствует приблизительно четырем символам английского алфавита или одному символу русского алфавита. <br/><br/>Расчет общего количества использованных токенов осуществляется следующим образом: суммарное количество токенов состоит из токенов, введенных пользователем при формировании запроса, и токенов, использованных Чат-ботом для генерации ответа.<br/><br/><strong>Формирование запроса пользователя</strong><br/><br/>Запрос пользователя формируется на основе его текущего вопроса и может включать в себя предыдущие запросы и ответы для поддержания контекста диалога.

Для его использования в качестве официального документа, вам потребуется дополнительно адаптировать его под конкретные требования и условия вашего сервиса, а также для обеспечения соответствия действующему законодательству. Рекомендуется проконсультироваться с юристом для получения профессиональной правовой помощи.USER: Законно ли это? \\"\\"\\" 2.8. Поставщик оставляет за собой право приостановить или запретить доступ пользователю к Чат-боту в любое время и по любой причине. \\"\\"\\"ASSISTANT: Вопрос о законности такого положения зависит от юрисдикции, в которой оно применяется, и от общих условий предоставления услуг. Во многих юрисдикциях предприятия имеют право устанавливать правила доступа к своим услугам и могут ограничивать доступ пользователя по определенным причинам, например, за нарушение пользовательского соглашения, незаконную деятельность или злоупотребление сервисом.<br/><br/>Однако такие меры должны соответствовать действующему законодательству о защите прав потребителей и не могут быть произвольными или дискриминационными. Также важно, чтобы пользователь был заранее проинформирован о правилах и условиях использования сервиса и о возможных последствиях нарушения этих правил.<br/><br/>Положение о возможности приостановить или запретить доступ к сервису должно быть частью пользовательского соглашения и должно быть четко сформулировано, доступно для понимания пользователями, и, главное, справедливо и последовательно применяться по отношению ко всем пользователям.<br/><br/>Также стоит учитывать законодательство о защите личных данных и правил об использовании личной информации пользователей, особенно в отношении причин и обстоятельств, при которых доступ к сервису может быть ограничен или запрещен.<br/><br/>Для уточнения законности подобных положений в вашей юрисдикции и их соответствия местному законодательству, рекомендуется обратиться к юристу, специализирующемуся на праве интернет-технологий и защите прав потребителей.USER: В РоссииASSISTANT:","output":"В России, как и во многих других странах, компании имеют право устанавливать условия предоставления своих услуг и могут ограничивать доступ пользователя к этим услугам при определенных обстоятельствах. Включение положения в пользовательское соглашение о том, что доступ к сервису может быть приостановлен или запрещен, должно соответствовать действующему законодательству Российской Федерации, включая нормы Гражданского кодекса РФ, законодательство о защите прав потребителей, а также о защите персональных данных. Основные аспекты, на которые следует обратить внимание при применении такого положения в России, включают: 1. **Соответствие Закону \\"О защите прав потребителей\\"**: Приостановка или запрещение доступа к сервису не должно нарушать права потребителей, гарантированные данным законом. Это означает, что любые ограничения должны быть обоснованы, не могут быть произвольными и должны соответствовать условиям договора (пользовательского соглашения). 2. **Уведомление пользователей**: Пользователи должны быть заранее уведомлены о всех условиях использования сервиса, включая основания для приостановки или запрета доступа. Эти условия должны быть четко описаны в пользовательском соглашении, доступном при регистрации или начале использования сервиса. 3. **Недискриминация**: Действия по приостановке или запрету доступа должны быть справедливы и не могут носить дискриминационный характер. Они должны применяться одинаково ко всем пользователям, попадающим под эти критерии. 4. **Согласие на обработку данных**: В случаях, когда приостановка или запрещение доступа связаны с обработкой персональных данных пользователя, важно соблюдать требования Федерального закона \\"О персональных данных\\", включая получение согласия пользователя на обработку его персональных данных. С учетом вышеизложенного, включение такого положения в пользовательское соглашение может быть законным, если оно соответствует действующему законодательству и применяется в рамках установленных законом границ. Важно, чтобы положение было прозрачным, понятным и справедливым по отношению ко всем пользователям.

both medical facilities and personal first aid kits. These bandages, available in various sizes and typically in packs of 30 or 100 pieces, have several key features and benefits that make them suitable for a wide range of applications. Here’s an overview of their main characteristics:</p><p>1 - Elasticity </p><p>The elastic nature of these bandages means they can conform to different body parts and movements without slipping or causing discomfort. This flexibility makes them ideal for joints or areas that are often in motion, such as elbows, knees, and fingers. </p><p>2 - Self-Adhesive </p><p>Unlike traditional bandages, elastic self-adhesive cloth bandages stick to themselves without the need for clips or additional adhesive. This feature simplifies the application process, making it quicker and cleaner, as there’s no sticky residue left on the skin. The self-adhesive property also ensures the bandage stays securely in place, providing effective and reliable support or protection to the wounded area.</p><p> </p><p> </p> </body> </html>","output":"All the Arabic text and sentences translated to English, while keeping all the symbols and English words in the text as they are: \\"<h2 style=\\"text-align: center;\\"><a href=\\"http://www.ukyem.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\"><span style=\\"background-color: #ffd966; color: #cc0000;\\">More discount offers</span></a><span style=\\"background-color: #ffd966; color: #cc0000;\\"><div class=\\"separator\\" style=\\"clear: both; text-align: center;\\"><a href=\\"http://www.ukyem.com\\" target=\\"_blank\\"></a><a href=\\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEje9f6nJUOAIGh_sSXH9JH7mIBa0ht5L_8Q3H8OBjXdVklwkbyFJxPN5khYJxuGoDEhRyQrq5tTxvTQJxtjQvrIFo3qE7iYuagLf5XsejUsJmSdxcfkOOAiKoZyLhwjjb04qB1z_KZ5qRgLvpczkfHKDlYSSLv0VkKlHUI206ke-tzcRyZfRcvksHQjT80/s633/logo%203.png\\" style=\\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\\"><img border=\\"0\\" data-original-height=\\"394\\" data-original-width=\\"633\\" height=\\"51\\" src=\\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEje9f6nJUOAIGh_sSXH9JH7mIBa0ht5L_8Q3H8OBjXdVklwkbyFJxPN5khYJxuGoDEhRyQrq5tTxvTQJxtjQvrIFo3qE7iYuagLf5XsejUsJmSdxcfkOOAiKoZyLhwjjb04qB1z_KZ5qRgLvpczkfHKDlYSSLv0VkKlHUI206ke-tzcRyZfRcvksHQjT80/w400-h51/logo%203.png\\" width=\\"400\\"></a></div><br></span></h2><html> <head> <meta content=\\"text/html; charset=utf-8\\" http-equiv=\\"Content-Type\\"></meta> <title>The role of purchasing cleaning materials in our healthy lives</title> <meta content=\\"Discover how investing in cleaning materials can boost your health and cleanliness.

Whatever works. Currently still running with the normal dancers idents (when will they be retired, they've been used since 2002) Emma said on 01 December 2023 Hopefully S4C does something with their new blob mascot, Last year they had TV sets stacked up on top of each other, Then for 10 months they had flickering TV sets, They have finally rebranded and have introduced their first ever mascot: a shape-shifting blob, I hope BBC One rebrand soon, those dancers sure are getting tired, As for the KikoRiki themed Christmas idents, I was told they are launching tonight after Doctor Who, They are being introduced just before Unbreakable. HouseofFun said on 01 December 2023 Doctor Who ending now, announcement playing \\"A team of 8 people are pushed to the absolute limit, Unbreakable, our brand new game show is up next, But first, Time to say hello and spend Christmas with the Doctor\\" I'm not liking this one a whole lot..., They seem to be running a trailer advertising the Doctor Who Christmas special, which revolves around the Doctor having to protect his companions from a man who seeks to find a fob watch (the one The Doctor made himself human with one time), Although just before Doctor Who tonight they had a announcement saying \\"Christmas is switched on tonight in 1 hour in time for Unbreakable, But first, Is this the end for the Doctor?\\". Doesn't seem like they are advertising the Christmas pres at all, Edit: Christmas pres featuring KikoRiki switched on, First ident shown features Rosa the Pig doing a dramatic ice skate dance (She even uses eyedrops for fake tears) While this is happening we hear dramatic music, The announcer says \\"Welcome to Christmas on BBC One, Let us entertain you, But now a team of 8 people are being pushed to their absolute limits, Are they Unbreakable?\\" Not sure why they didn't tell us it was happening untill it did, But still a gorgeous ident, I noticed when the Announcer started talking it sounded as if he was driven to tears by the beauty of Rosa's gorgeous dance. The best thing to come out of this package since the \\"Lights\\" christmas idents in 2006, Eyes said on 01 December 2023 A beautiful ident, Best thing to come out of the \\"Rythm and Movement\\" package since those Planet Earth 3 special idents a few months ago, i feel sad that KikoRiki has not been shown much on CBBC on BBC Two, but I'm glad it's representing the Xmas idents on BBC One (Although I also wish the idents also featured a merman). Maile said on 01 December 2023 Best Christmas ident in a while, I just love that they have spent it with Rosa and her friends, I hear there is also one featuring Krash the Rabbit opening his presents, I like how they used the usual ident theme (dancing) in that first ident, KikoRiki looks like it's gonna be good this year, but I hope they do more with the style (and maybe finally retire Rythm and Movement idents) Faramad said on 01 December 2023 News safe ident just on, Basically just a Christmas tree on a snowy background, with a music box Christmas carol playing, on top of that the only thing we see is a sleeping Rosa (We vaguely hear her snoring) Glad they are now using characters in their news safe idents, Announcer said \\"Now on BBC One, time for the BBC News at 8\\". Remember the Lights idents the used just before overhauling their promo style in late 2006/early 2007? That was pretty cool, but this is way better. I seem to remember those idents started on a dark street but Christmas lights started turning on before it got to a city center and then people were dancing, It was used again in 2007, And now it seems like the \\"Project Chameleon\\" endboard template introduced in July is out the window, at least for now, replaced with a snowy background with a Christmas tree on it. Signs that Rythm and Movement is finally working towards the end. KikoRiki said on 01 December 2023 We're glad you love our cartoon and the special BBC One idents featuring our characters, However, Rosa will be the star, (We will have idents revolving around Chiko, Krash and the others), As to what you said, BBC One are looking into introducing the Circle idents already in use in other countries, so don't expect to see Ballet, Capoeria or Festival/Rave back in the new year. Get used to Kites, Capes, Hippos and Bikes as that's what might be coming after our Christmas campaign, We don't know for certain, but the Dancers might not be coming back after Christmas WhovianForever: Did everyone catch the Doctor Who Christmas special announcement during the news? I’m so hyped! Can’t wait to see how the Doctor deals with the fob watch saga this holiday season! LemonyFan: And how about they’re showing the 2004 ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ movie!! That’s one of my holiday favorites; the nostalgia is real. 😍🍿 ChristmasCarol: Truly is shaping up to be a wonderful holiday schedule on BBC One. Between Doctor Who and the classic movies, I’m going to be glued to my screen with all the mulled wine and mince pies! KikoFanatic: Plus, the KikoRiki Christmas idents have been adorable so far! Rosa’s ice skate dance nearly brought tears to my eyes just like the announcer. 🐷⛸ Christmas is definitely switched on! RetroTV: I’m just here wondering if the new ‘Circle’ idents KikoRiki hinted at is a sign we’re finally saying goodbye to the “Rythm and Movement” package for good. After 20+ years, it’s about time for a major refresh! NostalgiaNerd: @RetroTV I’m with you on that. The Lights idents back in '06/'07 were beautiful. It’s cool to see they’re still willing to shake things up visually with the news safe ident this year. Sleepy Rosa might just be my new favorite. 😴🎄 SeriesBinger: Doctor Who special + A Series of Unfortunate Events + KikoRiki idents = Best Christmas TV lineup or what? Also, hope BBC One throws in some classic Christmas episodes of our favorite shows. Maybe some ‘Vicar of Dibley’ or ‘Only Fools and Horses’? CircleCurious: Anyone heard more about these new Circle idents? I love change, and KikoRiki characters have been great, but I’m already excited for what’s coming next. Bring on the new era! KikoLover: Just saw a new Krash and Chiko ident! They’re having a blast playing in the snow! ❄️🐇 So cute watching Krash throw snowballs while Chiko dodges around. Really captures the winter fun vibes. SciFiSavvy: Speaking of new idents, did anyone else notice the Dokko the Moose building a laser device ident? It aired right before ‘Doctor Who’ and set the PERFECT tone for sci-fi. Dokko’s always been the tech genius of the group. 🦌🔧 HedgehogAdmirer: @KikoLover Chiko is always adorable, but seeing him in the snow was next level! BBC One knows how to do Christmas idents right. Plus, the animation on these characters in the idents is super impressive this year. WhovianGuru: @SciFiSavvy Loved the Dokko ident! It’s like a mini episode of ‘Doctor Who’ in itself. Brilliant tie-in to the show’s theme! Makes waiting for the Christmas special even more exciting. BakeMaster: But guys, let’s talk about the Olga the Owl baking ident. The detail on that gingerbread house she was making! I can almost smell the cookies through the screen. 🦉🍪 It’s the cozy ident I never knew I needed in my life. HolidayWatcher: Right?! The Olga ident feels like being wrapped in a warm blanket with a hot chocolate in hand. It’s chef’s kiss perfection. BBC One’s going all out with these KikoRiki characters for Christmas. DoctorFan: Dokko’s ident was like a mini teaser for what’s coming with ‘Doctor Who’. Immersive and full of that tech mystery vibe. I appreciate that BBC One creates these unique intros for thematic continuity. AnimationAppreciator: Major kudos to the animation team for the KikoRiki idents. As someone who dabbles in animation, the quality is sensational. It’s like a little holiday gift before each show starts! ChristmasCheer: Can’t get enough of the snow play with Krash and Chiko. It’s absolutely delightful and spreads so much joy. These little moments provided by the idents add a special touch to the holiday season. SciCompanion: Dokko and his inventions always remind me that anything’s possible with a little imagination. Such an inspiring ident to lead into ‘Doctor Who’. Well played, BBC One! Can’t wait to see what else is in store, I'm gonna miss these idents when new year comes around! 😢 WelcomeToSciFi: The Dokko centric ident really sets the scene for what's to come on ‘Doctor Who’ this Christmas. One of the best things about the KikoRiki set, Far better than the usual dancers, Come to think of it, they have been using the dancers since 2002, so now is a good time for a revamp, I guess 😉 Olgo5: Just saw the Olga ident and damn, Olga really is a talented chef, They always seem to show it before cooking shows, Which ident normally leads into Eastenders, It seems to vary between Krash and Chiko in the snow, Olga cooking and Rosa ice skating. Not sure how this is consistent, But that Rosa one brings tears to my eyes with her graceful skating, Not sure why the Dokko one only plays before Doctor Who, Maybe because it fits it well Prolouge: User1: So, what’s everyone thinking BBC One’s going to pull out of the hat for this year’s Christmas idents? Last year was decent, but I’m hoping for something with a bit more pizzazz. WhovianForever: I’m crossing my fingers for something Doctor Who-themed! With David Tennant back in the show earlier this year, it would be perfect timing to capitalize on that for the festive season. Can you imagine an ident with the TARDIS all decked out in Christmas lights? HolidayJoy: That would be cool for us Whovians, for sure, but BBC One usually goes for something that appeals to everyone. Doctor Who is big, but not universally loved by every single viewer. Plus, they tend to lean towards more generic festive symbols. SeriesBinger: True, they’ll probably aim for something more inclusive. Like a cozy winter scene or playful animation. Maybe bring back some classic characters or even partner with a popular children’s show this time around for wider appeal? RetroTV: I’ve got a hunch they’ll go with animation this year. It has that universal charm, right? Plus, it would work perfectly with both the kids’ content and the family-friendly vibe they love during Christmas. User1: That’s an interesting angle. They could get quite creative with animation. Plus, they’re probably due for a change since the “Rythm and Movement” dancers have been around since 2002. KikoFanatic: What if they teamed up with a show like KikoRiki? The characters are fun, visually engaging, and it’s something that would stand out. Plus, they could do loads with those quirky little animals. LemonyFan: KikoRiki would be such a cute choice! It could be a hit with children and adults alike if done right. And it’s refreshingly different from usual idents, without relying on something niche like a specific Doctor Who theme. WhovianForever: Okay, I see your point. Much as I’d love Doctor Who idents, something like KikoRiki could offer that ‘Christmas with the family’ vibe they probably want. I just hope they add a little extra magic this year, you know? CircleCurious: Whatever they do, I hope it’s something new. We’ve had the “Rythm and Movement” package idents for such a long time. It’s high time for something fresh and exciting to take us into the new year! Write a follow up where the technical fault placeholder/This show isn't available on this platform/BBC One HD can't show programmes from this area, background is icy waters with Rosa's legs in them","output":"Following the success and excitement around the KikoRiki themed Christmas idents on BBC One, an unexpected moment captured the attention of viewers nationwide. On a rare occasion, a technical fault occurred during a prime-time slot. This was not an ordinary interruption; instead, BBC One opted to align the necessary placeholder imagery with the festive theme already embraced through their Christmas idents. The screen, instead of displaying a standard \\"This show isn't available on this platform\\" or \\"BBC One HD can't show programmes from this area\\" message against a bland background, was ingeniously integrated into the KikoRiki Christmas campaign. Viewers found themselves looking at an icy water scene, quite serene and atmospheric, with a surprising addition - Rosa's legs dangled playfully in the chilly water, adding a touch of whimsy and continuing the theme of involving KikoRiki characters in unexpected ways. The background's cool hues and the sight of Rosa seemingly relaxing in an icy pond, despite the technical hiccup, managed to charm viewers. This creative touch turned a potential moment of viewer frustration into a memorable and endearing experience. The announcer, maintaining the lighthearted atmosphere, apologized for the disruption, noting, \\"We're experiencing a bit of a chill in our systems, but no need to freeze – we'll be back to our scheduled warmth in just a moment.\\" This unexpected twist not only demonstrated BBC One's commitment to maintaining a festive spirit through unforeseen circumstances but also showed their ability to innovate within even the most routine aspects of broadcast contingencies. The choice to use Rosa in such an amusing manner provided a cohesive narrative to BBC One's Christmas presentation, ensuring that even a technical fault could become a part of the holiday cheer. Discussion boards and social media lit up with reactions to the incident, with many expressing delight at how BBC One handled the situation. #RosaInIcyWaters became a trending topic, with viewers sharing screenshots and clips, praising the broadcaster's clever integration of KikoRiki characters into all facets of their Christmas broadcasting, even in the most unlikely scenarios. As the technical issues were resolved and regular programming resumed, the warmth of the BBC One Christmas spirit had certainly been maintained, if not elevated, by the unexpected icy interlude. It was a clear reminder of the power of creativity and character to turn even the most mundane or frustrating moments into opportunities for engagement and storytelling."},{"instruction":"Write a convo where it's also being used if a program is withheld from a certain platform due to rights restrictions, and a user describes the caption","output":"**TechieTim:** Hey folks, did anyone else catch that unusual placeholder on BBC One just now? They're really rolling with the KikoRiki theme this holiday season! **VisualVic:** Yes! Are you talking about the 'program withheld' screen? Instead of the usual dull notice, it was brilliantly themed. Rosa's legs peeking out from icy waters while we got the heads-up about the rights restrictions for a program. Genius! **TechieTim:** Exactly! The screen had this caption that read, \\"Oops! Looks like this program has taken a chilly dip and can't be shown here. But don't worry, we're warming up more content for you shortly. Stay tuned!\\" It was both witty and in perfect sync with the festive KikoRiki theme. **CreativeCara:** I loved that! Made the disappointment of not getting to watch the program a little less bitter. The caption alongside Rosa's comically dangling legs in the icy background was a delight. Plus, the puns were a nice touch. 😂 **RightsRandy:** As someone who follows all this rights restriction stuff closely, it's refreshing to see a creative approach to broadcasting those necessary but often frustrating messages. It's a clever way to soften the blow for viewers. **NostalgiaNell:** They've really gone above and beyond this year, haven't they? Transforming even the mundane aspects of television broadcasting into something charming and holiday-themed. It’s these little details that really enhance the holiday viewing experience. **TechieTim:** Agreed, @NostalgiaNell. It turns a potentially negative viewer experience into a moment of amusement. BBC One is setting a new standard here for how broadcasters can handle content that's restricted due to rights issues. Two thumbs up for creativity! **RightsRandy:** I'm curious if they'll make it a regular thing or if it's just for the holiday season. I mean, it would be great to see how they'd handle different themes throughout the year. **VisualVic:** True, @RightsRandy. Could you imagine a summer-themed or Halloween version of these notices? There's a lot of potential for fun in an area that's usually so bland. **CreativeCara:** Definitely! And it’s not just about making a joke out of it. It actually makes the channel feel more personable and considerate. Plus, the extra effort to entertain even when they can’t show a program is something other broadcasters should take note of. **TechieTim:** The consensus seems clear - we all appreciate a bit of creativity and effort, especially in places we least expect it. Kudos to BBC One for this inventive approach! Let's hope it inspires more fun across all channels. 📺✨"},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where it is made into a ident, her legs sticking out of the water, They vanish underneath towards the end, and say what happens afterwards","output":"In the weeks following the initial delight at the creatively themed \\"program withheld\\" screen, BBC One decided to double down on the festive spirit and viewer engagement by transforming the momentary concept into a full-blown Christmas ident. This decision further solidified their innovative approach to broadcasting this holiday season. **The Ident Unveiled** The new ident premiered during a highly anticipated evening slot, catching viewers by surprise. It featured Rosa from KikoRiki in an enchanting winter scene, with her legs playfully dangling in icy waters. The scene starts tranquilly with softly falling snowflakes and the serene, reflective surface of the water. Rosa's legs, clad in colorful holiday socks, swing above the water's surface, adding a touch of whimsy to the cold and crisp winter backdrop. As the ident progresses, the playful atmosphere is maintained with a gentle, jovial tune playing in the background. Then, in a surprising twist that elicited both laughter and a tiny gasp from audiences, Rosa's legs twist and twirl comically before they vanish underneath the water, leaving behind a few ripples and a floating hat, hinting at her playful dive. After a brief moment of stillness, where viewers might have wondered about Rosa's chilly plunge, the water surface becomes serene again, and the floating hat magically drifts towards the edge of the icy pond, where it's snagged by a familiar character making a cameo appearance—Krash, who looks around as if in a playful search for Rosa. **Viewer Reactions and Beyond** The immediate response on social media was overwhelmingly positive, with viewers praising BBC One for their fresh take on holiday idents. Hashtags like #WheresRosa and #BBCOneChristmasSplash became trending, as people expressed their amusement and approval of the clever storytelling and charming execution. **Fan Forums and Discussion** On various fan forums and discussion boards, the conversation turned speculative, with fans theorizing about the playful storyline's continuation and how other KikoRiki characters might feature in upcoming idents. Some even shared their own fan-made animations and storyboards, extending the narrative in creative and unexpected directions. **BBC One’s Response** Capitalizing on the buzz, BBC One announced a series of follow-up idents, promising that viewers would see more of their favorite KikoRiki characters in similarly playful and unexpected scenarios throughout the holiday season. The announcement hinted at a festive storyline that would unfold through these idents, sparking even more anticipation and engagement from the audience. **The Legacy of the Ident** The Rosa ident not only became a highlight of the holiday viewing experience but also set a new standard for engaging and narrative-driven idents. BBC One's approach demonstrated the power of storytelling and character-driven content in enhancing the broadcasting landscape, elevating even the smallest interstitial moments into opportunities for creativity, connection, and, most importantly, holiday cheer."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where a full playout is shown before TAMS at 9am on Sunday and we see the full ending of the ident, and what happened to Ross","output":"As the festive season continued to envelop viewers in its warm embrace, BBC One had another surprise up its holiday-themed sleeve. The intrigue surrounding Rosa's playful antics and mysterious disappearance beneath the icy waters had captivated audiences far and wide. In response to the growing curiosity and excitement, BBC One promised a special reveal, slated for a Sunday morning slot just before the TAMS (Television Audience Measurement System) data was to be televised at 9 am, ensuring a captive audience eager for the resolution to this whimsical mystery. **The Full Playout and Rosa's Reveal** The morning was crisp and bright, and as families gathered around their television screens, BBC One teased the upcoming segment with snippets of the previous idents, building anticipation. The clock struck a few minutes to 9, and the familiar scenes began to play out once more on the screen, but this time, there was a palpable sense of excitement in the air. The ident unfolded as before, with Rosa’s legs playfully swinging and then vanishing beneath the water. However, instead of cutting to a different scene or reverting to an announcement, the ident continued, holding the viewers' gaze on the gently rippling water. The suspense was palpable. Then, something magical happened. Bubbles started to surface, and a soft, muffled giggle could be heard. The camera panned down beneath the water's surface, revealing a whimsical underwater scene. Rosa was not alone; she was accompanied by an array of marine life, all adorned with festive decorations. Rosa, wearing a scuba mask and snorkel, was orchestrating a delightful underwater Christmas party. Amidst the coral and sea plants, which were illuminated by bioluminescent lights, Rosa and her aquatic friends danced to a silent tune, their movements graceful and fluid. The reveal was breathtaking and whimsical, with meticulously animated details that captured the essence of an underwater celebration. Viewers watched in awe as Rosa, in her element, beamed with joy, sharing the festive spirit with her new friends. The scene crescendoed with Rosa and a school of fish forming a Christmas tree shape, swirling upwards, their movement creating a whirlpool of bubbles that sparkled as they ascended to the water’s surface. As the bubbles broke the surface, the scene transitioned back to the icy pond, now serene and sparkling under the morning sun. A ripple spread out, and Rosa’s hat, which had been floating earlier, gently landed back on the snowy bank, as if returned by an unseen hand. The scene faded out with a message: “Wishing everyone a magical and merry underwater Christmas – from all of us at BBC One.” **Viewers’ Response and Legacy** The full playout of the ident was met with an overwhelming response from the audience. Social media platforms buzzed with discussions and praise for the creative storytelling, stunning animation, and the heartwarming conclusion to Rosa’s dive. Families shared their own stories of holiday magic, inspired by the ident, and the hashtag #UnderwaterChristmas became a symbol of joy, imagination, and community spirit during the festive season. By extending the narrative and offering a resolution full of wonder and joy, BBC One not only entertained but also sparked a collective sense of enchantment and goodwill. Rosa’s underwater Christmas adventure set a new benchmark for holiday idents, demonstrating the power of storytelling to unite and inspire. This memorable ident would be cherished as a highlight of the holiday season, fondly remembered for its creativity, warmth, and the magical reveal that captured the hearts of viewers across the nation."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where an ident where she returns to the surface is shown after the data and before the Marr show","output":"Following the enchanting underwater Christmas party that had captivated the nation, viewers were left wondering about Rosa's return to the surface and how the festive narrative would continue. BBC One, known for its seamless storytelling and innovative idents, had meticulously planned the next chapter in Rosa’s festive saga to play out just after the TAMS data was presented on a crisp Sunday morning, perfectly timing the transition to the beloved Marr show, a staple for weekend viewers. **Rosa’s Return to the Surface** As the screen transitioned from the TAMS data, the serene and glittering surface of the icy pond reappeared, bathed in the soft, golden light of the rising sun. The atmosphere was tranquil, but the anticipation among the audience was palpable, a collective breath held in eager expectation. The camera slowly zoomed in on the floating hat at the water's edge, a reminder of Rosa’s playful plunge. Suddenly, the tranquility was broken by a series of small, ascending bubbles, creating ripples across the water's surface. A soft, melodic tune began to play, reminiscent of the joyous underwater celebration but infused with the crisp, fresh promise of a winter morning. As the bubbles became more vigorous, the water began to swirl, and with a graceful leap and a splash, Rosa emerged from the icy pond, propelled upwards by a geyser of sparkling water. Rosa landed softly on the snowy bank, her scuba gear vanishing in a puff of magical snowflakes, leaving her donning a festive winter outfit, complete with a cozy, sparkling scarf and hat—her hat magically fitting back onto her head as if never lost. With a joyful twirl, Rosa revealed a shimmering snowflake ornament in her hands, a treasure brought back from her underwater adventure. **The Continuation of the Festive Spirit** As Rosa placed the snowflake ornament on a nearby bare-branched tree, the scene transformed. The tree lit up with a soft, ethereal glow, its branches now adorned with sparkling ornaments and twinkling lights, a beacon of the holiday spirit. Rosa’s friends, characters from the KikoRiki universe and representations of the diverse BBC One audience, joined her around the tree, each adding their own ornament to the branches. Together, they completed the scene of communal joy and celebration, embodying the essence of the season. The screen then gently faded to the message, “From our BBC One family to yours, may the joy and warmth of the season fill your homes.” The scene transitioned seamlessly into the idyllic wintry landscape that introduced the Marr show, carrying forward the message of unity and festivity. **Audience Reaction and Lasting Impact** This ident, with Rosa’s triumphant return to the surface and the communal celebration that followed, struck a chord with viewers, reinforcing the themes of adventure, joy, and community. Social media erupted with positive feedback, praising BBC One for delivering a continuous story that added depth and anticipation to the holiday viewing experience. The Rosa idents, from her playful dive to her festive return and the celebration that ensued, were hailed as a creative masterpiece, captivating audiences with their narrative cohesion, visual splendor, and emotional resonance. By weaving a continuous thread through its holiday idents, BBC One brought viewers together in a shared experience of anticipation, wonder, and seasonal joy. Rosa’s journey from the mysterious depths to the communal celebration on the snowy bank served as a reminder of the magical moments that connect and uplift us all, setting a new standard for holiday broadcasting and leaving a lasting imprint on the hearts of viewers."},{"instruction":"Write a forum convo noting Andrew seems to have splurged on festive titles, but still has the usual theme by Debbie Wiseman","output":"**Forum Name: TVMagicTalk** **Thread Title: BBC One's Festive Titles Extravaganza - A Splendid Yuletide Treat or Overindulgence?** **Original Post by StarGazer101:** Has anyone else noticed how BBC One went all out with their festive titles this year? It seems like Andrew (the channel's creative director) decided to open the purse strings and sprinkle a bit of extra magic on the holiday season. The visuals are stunning, but I was pleasantly surprised to hear that they've retained the beautiful theme by Debbie Wiseman for continuity. Thoughts on this blend of new splendor with the classic tune? **Reply 1 by ChrissyCinema:** Absolutely noticed and loved it! The new animations are a feast for the eyes - they’ve really captured the essence of the holidays. It's like each title sequence is a little gift wrapped up in the familiar melody we've come to love over the years. It shows a commitment to tradition while embracing innovation. Kudos to Andrew and team for this daring move! **Reply 2 by NostalgicNeil:** I'm in two minds about it. On one hand, it's visually fantastic and definitely brings the festive spirit right into the living room. On the other hand, I wonder about the necessity of such a splurge - could those funds have been used elsewhere? That said, the decision to keep Debbie Wiseman's theme was a stroke of genius. It ties everything back to the heart of BBC One. **Reply 3 by VisionaryVic:** As an aspiring composer, I'm thrilled they stayed true to Wiseman's theme. It’s the glue that holds the festive season together on BBC One, amidst all the new sparkle. The combination of new visuals and classic music is a beautiful reminder of how the past and present can harmonize to create something truly special. This is the kind of innovation that keeps the holiday spirit fresh and exciting! **Reply 4 by BudgetWatcher:** @NostalgicNeil raises a valid point about the budget. While I think the new titles are gorgeous, I do worry about where the money's coming from. Is it diverting from programming budgets? Nevertheless, the continuity of the music is a smart move. It’s like having your cake and eating it too - the visual feast doesn’t drift too far from the BBC One family feeling we all cherish. **Reply 5 by DigitalDave:** Did anyone catch how seamlessly they integrated those titles into their digital platforms as well? It's an all-encompassing experience, from TV to social media. Retaining Debbie Wiseman's score amidst this visual overhaul encapsulates BBC One's unique ability to evolve while honoring its roots. It's a fine balance, but I think they've nailed it this year. Curious about the behind-the-scenes of such a creative decision! **Reply 6 by HistoricalHarriet:** A history buff here, and I’ve always found the evolution of BBC One’s holiday aesthetics quite fascinating. The decision to retain Debbie Wiseman’s theme amidst the opulent new titles is a poignant nod to the network’s storied past. It speaks volumes about the identity and legacy of BBC One during the holiday season. Splurge or not, it's a cultural artifact in the making. **Reply 7 by StarGazer101 (Thread Starter):** Loving all the insights here! It’s clear the new festive titles have sparked quite a conversation, from budget concerns to the seamless melding of past and present. BBC One's choice to keep that beautiful theme by Debbie Wiseman as the cornerstone of their holiday identity, while splashing out on new visuals, highlights the dynamic balance between innovation and tradition. It's a holiday spectacle that marries the old with the new in the spirit of celebration. Cheers to more discussions as the holiday season unfolds! **End of Conversation**"},{"instruction":"explain \\"Hello! Thank you very much for your interest in working with us!

Since its inaugural broadcast in 2005, the programme has not only provided a platform for key political figures to discuss policies and express viewpoints but has also become synonymous with its distinctive theme tune. This unforgettable piece of music sets the tone for the hour ahead, subtly encapsulating the essence of political inquiry and public dialogue. A Symphony of Seriousness and Invitation The theme tune of The Andrew Marr Show, originally composed by George Fenton, is a masterful blend of solemnity and accessibility. Fenton, a seasoned composer renowned for his work on film scores and television themes, has crafted a piece that conveys the gravitas of the topics discussed on the show while inviting viewers to engage with the complex world of politics. The composition manages to balance a sense of urgency with a welcoming warmth, mirroring Marr's own approach to interviewing. Musical Mastery Emulating Editorial Excellence The significance of Fenton's theme extends beyond its auditory appeal; it serves as an aural brand for the show, quintessentially capturing the editorial excellence that Andrew Marr and his team strive to deliver each week. The meticulous arrangement and choice of instruments reflect a depth of preparation and understanding, traits that are mirrored in the show's approach to political journalism. Each note, much like each question posed by Marr, is carefully considered to elicit a response that will enlighten the audience. Setting the Stage for Sunday Mornings For many viewers, the first notes of The Andrew Marr Show theme signal the start of a weekly ritual. The music not only heralds an hour of insightful interviews and discussions but also creates an atmosphere of anticipation. It prepares the audience for a programme that prides itself on exploring the nuances of political life, the challenges facing society, and the implications of decisions made at the highest levels of government. A Cultural Footprint Beyond Broadcasting The theme tune’s impact transcends the show itself, embedding itself in the cultural consciousness of the British public. Its recognizability and association with political engagement echo the show’s commitment to fostering informed dialogue and understanding. As The Andrew Marr Show continues to evolve, the theme tune remains a constant, reminding viewers of the enduring importance of scrutiny, accountability, and the quest for truth. Conclusion The theme of The Andrew Marr Show is more than just an introductory piece of music; it is an integral component of the programme's identity. George Fenton's composition encapsulates the show's essence, blending the seriousness of its content with a welcoming invitation to explore the complexities of the political landscape. As the show opens each Sunday, the theme tune reassures viewers that they are about to embark on an hour of engaging, enlightening, and essential viewing, underscored by a melody that has become a hallmark of political journalism in the UK."},{"instruction":"اكتب لي وصف احترافي لمدونتي اسمها روح الرياضة خاصة بمجال الرياضة","output":"\\"روح الرياضة\\" هي وجهتكم الأولى والفريدة في عالم الرياضة،

both medical facilities and personal first aid kits. These bandages, available in various sizes and typically in packs of 30 or 100 pieces, have several key features and benefits that make them suitable for a wide range of applications. Here’s an overview of their main characteristics:</p><p>1 - Elasticity </p><p>The elastic nature of these bandages means they can conform to different body parts and movements without slipping or causing discomfort. This flexibility makes them ideal for joints or areas that are often in motion, such as elbows, knees, and fingers. </p><p>2 - Self-Adhesive </p><p>Unlike traditional bandages, elastic self-adhesive cloth bandages stick to themselves without the need for clips or additional adhesive. This feature simplifies the application process, making it quicker and cleaner, as there’s no sticky residue left on the skin. The self-adhesive property also ensures the bandage stays securely in place, providing effective and reliable support or protection to the wounded area.</p><p> </p><p> </p> </body> </html>","output":"Maintain the text as is, translate the Arabic words to English only in the following text: health, Discover how investing in cleaning materials can enhance your health and cleanliness.

Discover the vital impact of high-quality cleaning materials.\\" name=\\"description\\">. - Discover the impact of purchasing cleaning materials on our healthy lives In our quest to achieve a healthy lifestyle, we often focus on exercise, nutrition, and self-care. However, there is another essential aspect of our well-being that we must not ignore: Cleanliness. Maintaining a clean and healthy living environment is crucial for promoting good health and preventing the spread of diseases. When it comes to cleanliness, the quality of cleaning materials plays an essential role. Investing in high-quality cleaning materials ensures effective cleaning and disinfection, maintaining your health and well-being and that of your loved ones. Let's explore the importance of these supplies and how they contribute to a healthy lifestyle. Key takeaways: - Investing in high-quality cleaning materials is essential for maintaining a healthy living environment. - Cleaning materials have a significant impact on our health and well-being. - Proper hygiene practices, supported by cleaning supplies, can prevent the spread of diseases. Understanding the impact of cleaning products on healthWhen it comes to maintaining a clean and healthy living environment, choosing cleaning products plays a crucial role. However, it is important to understand that not all cleaning products are equal, and some may pose potential risks to our health. Using low-quality or toxic cleaning materials can expose us to harmful chemicals that can have adverse effects on our overall health. These chemicals can be inhaled or absorbed through the skin, leading to respiratory issues, skin irritation, or even more serious health complications. For example, some cleaning products may contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that contribute to indoor air pollution. Prolonged exposure to VOCs can lead to respiratory problems, allergic reactions, and even increase the risk of certain chronic conditions. \\"Using cleaning products containing high levels of volatile organic compounds has been linked to increased asthma and respiratory symptoms in both children and adults.\\" According to scientific studies, household cleaning materials can negatively impact our health. Many cleaning products contain strong chemical compounds that may cause irritation to the respiratory system and skin. Products containing allergens such as ammonia and chlorine may increase the risk of asthma and respiratory infections. Furthermore, some chemical compounds in cleaning products pose a threat to the environment. When these chemicals become pollutants in water or air, they can affect marine life and aquatic plants. Therefore, using cleaning products free from harmful chemicals can be a better choice for maintaining overall health and the environment. Many health organizations encourage the use of safer and more environmentally friendly cleaning products to ensure better health. Common natural alternatives to chemical cleaning products include diluted white vinegar, lemon juice, and baking soda, which are safe and effective for cleaning. If you need to use strong and chemical cleaning products, it's recommended to use them in well-ventilated areas and wear protective gloves to avoid direct skin contact. Understanding the impact of cleaning products on health can help make informed decisions to protect our health and the environment. Replacing chemical products with natural alternatives and ensuring proper ventilation when using strong products can reduce potential risks and contribute to our health and environmental conservation."},{"instruction":"Hay","output":"¡Hola! ¿Cómo puedo ayudarte hoy?"},{"instruction":"سلام","output":"سلام! چطور می‌توانم به شما کمک کنم؟"},{"instruction":"كخبير في مجال البرمجة اريد ان اصمم موقع كامل به ادوات التسويق اللالكتروني و سيو اريد ان تقدم لي طريقة تصميم الموقع من البداية حتى النهاية يعني ذكر مراحل تصميم موقع من البداية حتى رفعه على السيرفر و ماعي الادوات و المعدات و المصادر التي يستعملها المبرمج لاكمال المشروع","output":"تصميم وتطوير موقع ويب كامل يشمل أدوات التسويق الإلكتروني وتحسين محركات البحث (SEO) هو مشروع متعدد الخطوات يتطلب مهارات في جوانب مختلفة من البرمجة، تصميم الواجهات، التسويق، الـ SEO والأمور الفنية الأخرى. سأوضح لك الخطوات الرئيسية لإنجاز المشروع بدءً من التخطيط وحتى الإطلاق والصيانة. #

It is named after Évariste Galois (1811-1832), a French mathematician who developed the foundational concepts shortly before his untimely death. The theory offers profound insights into the nature of polynomial equations, specifically addressing the problem of determining when such equations can be solved using radicals (i.e., solutions that can be expressed with a finite number of operations involving arithmetic operations and taking roots). # Core Concepts: - **Fields**: A field is a set on which addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (except by zero) are defined and behave as they do in familiar numerical systems like the set of rational numbers or real numbers. - **Extensions of Fields**: An extension of a field (F) is a larger field (E) that contains (F) as a subset. Extensions can be described and characterized in various ways, which form the basis for understanding how solutions to polynomial equations can fit into extended numerical systems. - **Groups**: In the context of Galois Theory, a group is a set equipped with an operation that combines any two of its elements to form a third element, satisfying certain conditions such as associativity, the existence of an identity element, and the existence of inverse elements. Groups arise naturally when considering the symmetries and permutations of the roots of polynomial equations. - **Galois Groups**: The Galois group of a polynomial is the group of permutations of the polynomial's roots that can be achieved by automorphisms of a field extension (i.e., bijective mappings from the field to itself that preserve the field operations) that leave the base field invariant. The structure of this group encodes critical information about the solvability of the polynomial and the relations between its roots. # Significance: - **Solvability by Radicals**: One of the most celebrated results of Galois Theory is the criterion for the solvability of polynomial equations in radicals. Galois showed that a polynomial equation can be solved by radicals if and only if its Galois group is a solvable group. This result provides a deep reason why general polynomial equations of degree five or higher cannot be solved by a formula involving only roots, unlike quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations. - **General Framework**: Beyond solving equations, Galois Theory offers a framework for studying field extensions, examining how more complex number systems can be constructed from simpler ones, and understanding the relationships between different algebraic structures. # Applications: - **Algebraic Number Theory**: Galois Theory plays a central role in understanding the algebraic structure of number fields and their integers, providing tools to study problems like Fermat's Last Theorem. - **Cryptography**: Some cryptographic algorithms, especially those involving elliptic curves, rely on principles from algebra and number theory where Galois Theory underpins the security and efficiency of these algorithms. - **Geometry**: Through the concept of Galois cohomology, Galois Theory has applications in the study of geometric objects and their symmetry properties. In sum, Galois Theory is a cornerstone of modern algebra with foundational importance and wide-reaching implications in various areas of mathematics and its applications."},{"instruction":"Continue","output":"Building on the fundamental concepts introduced earlier, Galois Theory continues to enrich and guide various domains within mathematics. Its applications and implications stretch across numerous fields, demonstrating the vast interconnectedness within mathematical research and its application. Let's delve deeper into some extended aspects and applications of Galois Theory. # Further Implications in Mathematics - **Abstract Algebra**: Beyond field theory and the solvability of equations, Galois Theory contributes foundational concepts to other branches of abstract algebra, such as ring theory and module theory. Its influence is particularly notable in the study of algebraic structures and their automorphism groups, offering insights into the inherent symmetry and properties of these structures. - **Topology**: Galois Theory finds a surprising application in algebraic topology through the notion of covering spaces and the fundamental group. Analogous to the way Galois groups describe symmetries of polynomial roots, the fundamental group captures symmetries and characteristics of topological spaces, providing a bridge between these seemingly distinct areas of mathematics. # Expanded Applications - **Algebraic Geometry**: The interplay between algebraic varieties (geometric manifestations of solutions to systems of polynomial equations) and field theory is enriched by Galois concepts. For instance, the study of function fields of varieties and their extensions often employs Galois Theory to understand geometric properties in terms of algebraic data. - **Quantum Computing**: As quantum computing continues to develop, the mathematical frameworks underlying quantum algorithms and error correction make extensive use of abstract algebra. Galois Theory, with its emphasis on group actions and field extensions, is seen as a tool to model and analyze the sophisticated structures that emerge in quantum information theory. # Deeper Insights into Galois Groups - **Computational Aspects**: With the advent of modern computing, algorithms for calculating Galois groups of polynomials have been developed, making it possible to apply Galois Theory to complex problems in number theory, coding theory, and beyond. Computational algebra systems now routinely include functions to compute Galois groups, aiding in research and application. - **Infinite Galois Theory**: While the classic results focus on finite extensions and their Galois groups, the theory extends to infinite extensions as well, leading to the rich domain of infinite Galois Theory. This area explores the profound relationships between fields and their infinite extensions, often with connections to set theory and logic. # Broader Implications and Challenges - **Education**: The depth and abstract nature of Galois Theory make it a challenging topic for mathematics students. However, it also serves as an excellent introduction to rigorous mathematical reasoning and the beauty of abstract structures. Educators continue to explore effective ways to introduce these concepts, emphasizing their pivotal role in the landscape of modern mathematics. - **Unsolved Problems**: Galois Theory touches on several unsolved problems in mathematics. For example, the Inverse Galois Problem, which asks whether every finite group can be realized as the Galois group of some field extension over the rationals, remains open. Advances in understanding Galois groups and their actions may shed light on this long-standing question. # Conclusion Galois Theory embodies the elegance and interconnectedness of mathematical thought. By providing a framework to understand the solubility of polynomial equations and the structure of field extensions, it touches on the very foundations of algebra and beyond. Its applicability across different areas of mathematics and into fields like physics and computer science showcases its fundamental role in the advancement of scientific knowledge. As research continues, Galois Theory will undoubtedly continue to inspire new discoveries, offering deeper insights into the mysteries of mathematics and the nature of the universe."},{"instruction":"Give examples","output":"To illustrate the concepts and applications of Galois Theory more concretely, let's delve into some specific examples. These examples underscore the theory's power in solving classical problems, understanding mathematical structures, and illuminating connections between different areas of mathematics. # Example 1: Solving Polynomial Equations Consider the polynomial equation (x^3 - 2 = 0). Its solutions can be expressed using radicals; the roots are (sqrt[3]{2}), (omegasqrt[3]{2}), and (omega^2sqrt[3]{2}), where (omega) is a primitive 3rd root of unity (i.e., (omega = e^{2pi i/3}), a complex number). The Galois group of this polynomial over (mathbb{Q}) (the field of rational numbers) can be thought of as permutations of these roots. The Galois group is isomorphic to (S_3), the symmetric group on 3 elements, reflecting the fact that any permutation of the roots yields another root. This group is non-abelian and solvable, which is consistent with the polynomial being solvable by radicals. # Example 2: The Insolvability of the Quintic A quintic equation is a polynomial equation of degree 5. A pivotal result from Galois Theory is that there is no general formula, using only arithmetic operations and radicals, that solves all quintic equations. This can be understood through the Galois group of a general quintic polynomial, which can be shown to be (S_5) in many cases. The group (S_5) contains a permutation of order 5 (a cycle of length 5) and a permutation of order 2 (a transposition), from which it is possible to generate any 5-element permutation. Crucially, (S_5) is not a solvable group, which, by Galois Theory, means that there cannot be a general solution in radicals for quintic equations. # Example 3: Quadratic Reciprocity via Galois Theory The Law of Quadratic Reciprocity is a fundamental theorem in number theory concerning the solvability of quadratic equations modulo prime numbers. Galois Theory offers an elegant proof of this law through the study of cyclotomic fields, which are extension fields generated by roots of unity. Consider the extension field (mathbb{Q}(zeta_p)) where (zeta_p) is a primitive (p)th root of unity for an odd prime (p). The Galois group of this field extension over (mathbb{Q}) is isomorphic to ((mathbb{Z}/pmathbb{Z})^times), the multiplicative group of integers modulo (p). The intricate structure of this group, and how it acts on the roots of unity, sheds light on the quadratic characters of primes and gives a route to proving quadratic reciprocity from a Galois theoretic perspective. # Example 4: Galois Theory and Elliptic Curves Elliptic curves form a central part of modern algebraic geometry and number theory, with applications to cryptography. Galois representations associated with elliptic curves play a crucial role in understanding their properties. For instance, the action of the Galois group of the rationals on the torsion points of an elliptic curve can provide insights into the curve's arithmetic properties, including its rational points. This connection is deeply explored in the proof of the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture, leading to the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. # Example 5: Inverse Galois Problem The Inverse Galois Problem asks whether every finite group is the Galois group of some extension of the rational numbers (mathbb{Q}). As an example, the symmetric group (S_n) is known to be realizable as a Galois group over (mathbb{Q}) for all (n). Constructive examples often involve finding specific polynomials whose splitting field (the smallest extension field containing all the roots) has the desired Galois group. Despite significant progress, the problem remains open for general groups, illustrating the depth and challenges still present in the field of Galois Theory. These examples highlight the breadth of Galois Theory's applicability, from solving specific equations to profound implications in number theory, algebraic geometry, and beyond."},{"instruction":"Tarkan bir şarkı yazsa nasıl olurdu","output":"Tarkan'ın bir şarkı yazması durumunda, öncelikle şarkının türüne ve tematik içeriğine göre varyasyon gösterebileceğini belirtmek gerekir.

Adını kalbime yazdım ben bir kere, Sensiz geçen her dakika, ömürden çalar. Outro: Bu aşk bizi aşar, gözlerin yeter bana, Adını fısıldarım her yıldıza, sabaha kadar.

Both characters are among the most powerful in their respective universes, and a direct comparison involves considering various factors such as context, the situation of the confrontation, and the specific versions of the characters involved. **Superman**, known as the Man of Steel, possesses immense strength, speed, invulnerability, heat vision, cold breath, and the ability to fly, among other powers. His abilities make him one of the most powerful beings in the DC Universe. Superman's power levels have varied over the years and through different iterations, but he has consistently been portrayed as one of Earth's mightiest heroes. **Thanos**, on the other hand, is a Titanian Eternal with superhuman strength, stamina, durability, and intelligence. He is a master strategist and has advanced alien technology at his disposal. However, Thanos' most iconic aspect is his quest for the Infinity Stones. With the Infinity Gauntlet equipped with all six Infinity Stones, Thanos becomes nearly invincible, capable of controlling time, space, reality, the mind, the soul, and power itself. In a direct physical confrontation without any external enhancements (like the Infinity Gauntlet for Thanos), Superman might have a considerable advantage due to his super-speed and tremendous physical strength, among his other abilities. Superman's resilience and tactical fighting skills could give him the upper hand in combat. However, if Thanos possesses the Infinity Gauntlet with all the Infinity Stones, the scale tips drastically in his favor. With the Gauntlet, Thanos has complete mastery over various aspects of existence, allowing him to potentially alter reality to neutralize Superman’s powers, erase him from existence, or even turn back time to prevent Superman from ever facing him in the first place. Fan debates and hypothetical battles often take these factors into account while also considering context, such as whether Superman could launch a surprise attack to disable Thanos before he can use the Infinity Gauntlet or if Thanos has planned meticulously for an encounter with Superman. Since these characters belong to different comic book universes, there is no official storyline where they battle it out conclusively. Any outcome would ultimately depend on the story's requirements, the creative teams involved, and the specific circumstances arranged for their confrontation. Thus, discussions on who would win in a fight between Superman and Thanos remain speculative and part of the fun debates in the fan communities."},{"instruction":"Can superman beat batman","output":"The question of whether Superman can beat Batman has been a topic of intense debate among fans for decades, and it has been explored in various comic book storylines, animated series, and films. Both characters are iconic heroes within the DC Universe, each embodying different ideals and possessing vastly different abilities. **Superman**, the last son of Krypton, boasts a myriad of superpowers including super strength, super speed, invulnerability, flight, heat vision, and more, making him one of the most powerful beings in the DC Universe. **Batman**, on the other hand, is a human with no superhuman powers. However, Bruce Wayne is at the peak of human physical and intellectual capabilities. He is a master martial artist, detective, strategist, and has access to nearly limitless financial resources and advanced technology, which he uses to fight crime in Gotham City. The core of debates surrounding a confrontation between the two typically revolves around several key points: 1. **Preparation Time**: Batman is known for his strategic mind and contingency plans for nearly every situation, including facing off against fellow members of the Justice League should the need arise. With adequate preparation time, Batman could theoretically devise a strategy or weapon to counter Superman's powers, such as using kryptonite, a substance lethal to Superman. 2. **Element of Surprise**: If Superman were to launch a surprise attack against Batman, the sheer difference in their power levels suggests Superman could defeat Batman before he had the chance to implement any plan. 3. **Context and Motivation**: The circumstances of why they are fighting play a significant role. Superman is inherently good-natured and might hold back to avoid seriously injuring Batman. Conversely, Batman, knowing he's at a physical disadvantage, would likely use every strategy at his disposal to level the playing field. Several comic book storylines have addressed this hypothetical battle: - **\\"The Dark Knight Returns\\"** by Frank Miller depicts an older Batman donning a powerful exoskeleton to fight Superman, who is depicted as a government pawn. Batman prepares extensively for the fight, including enlisting the help of one-time ally Green Arrow and using kryptonite. - **\\"Batman: Hush\\"** sees Batman equipped with a kryptonite ring to fend off a mind-controlled Superman, showcasing how Batman can hold his own against Superman with the right preparation. - **\\"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\\"** (film) also highlights Batman preparing extensively to battle Superman, using kryptonite weapons and powered armor. In most scenarios where Batman is depicted as winning or holding his own, his victory is heavily reliant on his tactical planning, resources, and exploiting Superman's vulnerability to kryptonite. In a straight-up physical confrontation without preparation or external factors, Superman's superpowers would give him a clear advantage. Ultimately, the outcome of such a confrontation greatly depends on the narrative needs of the story being told. Both characters represent different ideals: Superman is the near-invincible alien with a heart of gold, while Batman is the peak of human achievement fighting against the odds. Their battles often serve as philosophical debates about power, responsibility, and human vs. superhuman."},{"instruction":"How about in real life","output":"In real life, Superman and Batman are iconic fictional characters from comic books, so the discussion about who would win in a battle between them remains firmly within the realm of speculative fiction and fan debates. Both characters hail from the DC Comics universe, where they embody vastly different archetypes—the nearly invincible alien from another planet with superhuman abilities and the human vigilante who, through intense training and access to advanced technology, fights against crime. In the real world, the closest analog to battles between powerful figures like Superman and Batman would be the conceptual clashes between individuals or entities that represent seemingly insurmountable power (akin to Superman’s superpowers) and those that rely on human ingenuity, strategic thinking, and technological prowess (mirroring Batman's approach). Real-life conflicts and competitions—whether they be intellectual, physical, or technological—often showcase the dynamic interplay between raw strength or power and strategic, resourceful problem-solving. Moreover, the enduring popularity of these characters and the debates surrounding them demonstrate a few key aspects of human nature and society: 1. **Human Ingenuity and Resilience:** Batman, with no powers, represents the pinnacle of human achievement through sheer will, intelligence, and physical training. This idea resonates with our admiration for overcoming adversity and achieving greatness through hard work and determination. 2. **Aspiration and Idealism:** Superman symbolizes an ideal to strive towards—unmatched power used in service of humanity, embodying hope, justice, and the inherent goodness we wish to see in the world. 3. **Narratives and Mythmaking:** The stories we create and share about heroes, whether powered or not, reflect our values, struggles, and the complexities of the human condition. Characters like Superman and Batman provide a canvas upon which we project our fears, aspirations, and moral quandaries. 4. **Ethical and Moral Debates:** The conflicts between such characters in fiction often mirror real-life debates about the use of power, ethics, justice, and the means to an end, stimulating thought and discussion on what is right and wrong. While Superman and Batman battles are confined to the pages of comic books, movies, and animated series, the themes and ideas they represent are deeply relevant to real-life discussions about morality, power, responsibility, and the potential within all individuals to be heroes in their own right. It's this profound underlying significance that explains why millions are captivated by the stories of these characters and why we continue to discuss, recreate, and draw inspiration from their fictional battles."},{"instruction":"So who will win, give me an answer","output":"Given the requirement for a definitive answer in a fictional battle between Superman and Batman, the outcome generally depends on the context established by the narrative in which they are pitted against each other. However, if we distill the essence of both characters to their core attributes and typical portrayals, we can venture a generalized conclusion: - In a scenario where both characters are taken at face value, with Superman able to use all his powers without restraint and no prior preparation for Batman, Superman would win. His superhuman strength, speed, durability, and abilities like heat vision and flight provide him with an overwhelming advantage over Batman’s human physical limits. - Conversely, in a scenario where Batman is given time to prepare, and the fight is bound by specific rules or contexts that allow Batman to exploit his strategic genius, access to technology, and knowledge of Superman's weaknesses (particularly kryptonite), Batman could potentially win. Comic book history has shown us instances supporting both outcomes. Creators have often leaned on Batman's strategic mind and preparation, coupled with his moral code and determination, as key factors in his ability to confront beings far more powerful than himself, including Superman. Meanwhile, Superman's near-godlike powers naturally position him as the victor in a straightforward contest of strength and abilities. Therefore, a universally acceptable answer within the framework of their fictional universe could be summarized as follows: **Superman would win in a direct, unprepared confrontation based on sheer power, but Batman could win in a scenario that allows for preparation and the use of strategic resources, including kryptonite.** This answer reflects the complexity and variability of their confrontations as depicted across different media and narratives, highlighting the versatility and depth of these characters that have made them enduring icons in popular culture."},{"instruction":"Batman vs iron man?","output":"Batman vs. Iron Man is another popular hypothetical battle among fans that pits two of the most iconic, technologically advanced, and intellectually gifted human characters from DC Comics and Marvel Comics against each other. Both are normal humans who rely on their intelligence, wealth, and technology to fight crime and protect the world. Let's assess their capabilities: **Batman (Bruce Wayne)**: - **Intellect**: World-class detective, strategist, and tactician. His intellect is one of his greatest assets. - **Combat Skills**: Trained in multiple martial arts, making him one of the best hand-to-hand combatants in the DC Universe. - **Technology and Resources**: Has access to high-tech gadgets and vehicles, most notably the Batsuit, which provides enhanced durability, stealth capabilities, and various weapons. - **Physical Condition**: At peak human physical condition, excelling in strength, agility, and endurance. - **Wealth**: As the head of Wayne Enterprises, Batman has virtually unlimited financial resources to fund his vigilantism. **Iron Man (Tony Stark)**: - **Intellect**: Genius inventor and business magnate. His intelligence, particularly in engineering and physics, is one of his defining traits. - **Combat Skills**: While not as extensively trained in hand-to-hand combat as Batman, Tony Stark is a capable fighter, especially within his Iron Man suit. - **Technology and Resources**: Stark's Iron Man suit is a constantly evolving piece of high-tech armor that provides superhuman strength, durability, the ability to fly, and an arsenal of weapons including repulsor blasts and missiles. - **Physical Condition**: Without his suit, Stark is a normal human with no enhanced physical powers. His suit, however, makes him superhuman. - **Wealth**: As the head of Stark Industries, Iron Man also has vast financial resources, comparable to Batman's, to support his superhero activities. **Who Would Win?** Determining a winner in this match-up heavily depends on the context of their confrontation: - **Preparation Time**: Similar to a Batman vs. Superman scenario, if both characters have time to prepare, the outcome could heavily depend on their ability to strategize and create technology specifically designed to counteract their opponent's strengths. Both are known for their ability to prepare extensively for their adversaries. - **Technology**: In a straight-up battle, Iron Man's suit provides a significant advantage in terms of firepower, flight, and durability. Batman's standard gadgets and suit might not compete with the raw power of Iron Man's armor. - **Intellect and Strategy**: Both characters are geniuses in their own right, with Batman being the superior tactician and Stark being the superior engineer and inventor. Batman's strategy could possibly exploit weaknesses in Iron Man's armor that he's observed or deduced. - **Physicality**: Without his suit, Stark is much more vulnerable than Batman, who is always combat-ready. However, Stark is rarely without his suit, and in some iterations, it can be summoned remotely. - **Financial Resources**: Both have wealth to fund their endeavors, so this would likely be a non-factor in determining a winner. Given Stark's reliance on his Iron Man armor and its capabilities, which generally exceed the baseline technology Batman carries on a regular patrol, Iron Man might have the edge in a spontaneous conflict. However, with preparation, Batman's strategic approach and adaptability could level the playing field, possibly allowing him to exploit Stark's dependence on his suit or target known weaknesses. Ultimately, like any fictional superhero match-up, the winner would depend on the specifics of the scenario crafted by the writers, including the context of their battle, the environment, and the narrative needs of the story being told. Both characters' intelligence, resources, and determination make it a closely contested battle."},{"instruction":"Hulk vs batman","output":"In a theoretical battle between the Hulk and Batman, two iconic characters from Marvel and DC Comics, respectively, the dynamics are particularly interesting due to the stark contrast in their core attributes and fighting styles. The Hulk, known for his immense strength and near-invulnerability that increase with his rage, represents one of the ultimate physical threats in the Marvel Universe. Batman, on the other hand, is a peak human with no superhuman powers but has an unparalleled intellect, combat strategy, and access to high-tech equipment and resources. **The Hulk (Bruce Banner)**: - **Powers**: Superhuman strength, durability, and regenerative abilities that increase as he becomes angrier. The upper limits of his strength are virtually unknown. - **Weaknesses**: The Hulk's rage can make him unpredictable and difficult to control, even for himself. While his intellect as Bruce Banner is high, as the Hulk, he is often not as strategic or tactical in combat. **Batman (Bruce Wayne)**: - **Skills and Resources**: World-class detective, martial artist, and strategist with access to an extensive array of gadgets, vehicles, and armor through his wealth as Bruce Wayne and his contributions from Wayne Enterprises. - **Weaknesses**: Despite his peak human conditioning and technology, Batman remains human and vulnerable to physical harm in a way that superhuman characters like the Hulk are not. **Analysis of the Battle**: 1. **Direct Confrontation**: In a direct, no-preparation fight, Batman stands very little chance against the Hulk's brute force. The Hulk's strength and durability far exceed Batman's capabilities to inflict damage or withstand attacks. 2. **With Preparation**: Batman’s key to potentially overcoming the Hulk lies in his strategic mind and preparation. Known for having contingency plans to neutralize even the most powerful beings, Batman could potentially devise a plan to either calm Bruce Banner, thereby reverting the Hulk back to his human form, or somehow incapacitate the Hulk using a specially designed gadget or suit, possibly leveraging the Hulk's known weaknesses or exploiting the environment around them. 3. **Unpredictable Variables**: The outcome could significantly depend on unpredictable variables such as the environment, the initial conditions of the confrontation (for instance, Batman’s level of preparedness and whether it’s Bruce Banner or the Hulk at the start of the battle), and any potential external interference. While Batman’s intellect and strategic planning give him a potential path to victory, it’s undeniable that in a straightforward physical match-up, the Hulk’s raw power exceeds Batman’s human limitations. Historical comic lore, across various storylines, often emphasizes that Batman's strength lies in his preparation and adaptability rather than his capacity to overpower beings like the Hulk in direct combat. Therefore, without preparation, Batman is at a significant disadvantage. However, with time to prepare and possibly engineer a specific solution to combat the Hulk, Batman could feasibly secure a victory, although it would likely be through outsmarting or containing the Hulk rather than defeating him through brute strength. This scenario underscores the thematic contrast between brute force and strategic intellect in superhero narratives."},{"instruction":"Batman vs captain America?","output":"Batman versus Captain America is another intriguing hypothetical battle that pits two iconic characters from the DC and Marvel universes, respectively, against each other. Both characters are peak human specimens with extensive combat training, strong moral codes, and leadership qualities. Unlike some superhero matchups, this one is more balanced in terms of physical prowess and tactical thinking, making it a popular debate among fans. **Batman (Bruce Wayne)**: - **Skills and Resources**: Master martial artist with expertise in numerous combat styles, peak human strength, agility, and durability due to rigorous training and conditioning. Renowned detective and strategist with access to cutting-edge technology and gadgets. His suit offers additional protection and utility, and he has virtually unlimited financial resources. - **Weaknesses**: As a human, Batman is vulnerable to physical harm and relies on his intellect, fighting skills, and technology to compete with superhuman opponents. **Captain America (Steve Rogers)**: - **Powers and Abilities**: Thanks to the Super Soldier Serum, Captain America also operates at the peak of human potential but with enhancements that slightly edge him into the superhuman territory in terms of strength, endurance, agility, and healing. He is a master tactician, hand-to-hand combatant, and his iconic shield made of vibranium offers both offensive and defensive capabilities. - **Weaknesses**: While enhanced, Captain America still has vulnerabilities similar to any human being, albeit at a much-reduced level due to the serum. **Analysis of the Battle**: 1. **Physical Capabilities**: - Both Batman and Captain America are at the peak of human conditioning, but thanks to the serum, Captain America has the edge in terms of raw physical strength, endurance, and speed. Batman, however, is no slouch and competes closely in these areas due to his intensive training and conditioning. 2. **Combat Skills**: - Both are master combatants. Batman has mastered multiple martial arts, making his combat style very adaptable. Captain America is a seasoned fighter as well, combining his super-soldier physicality with extensive hand-to-hand and battlefield combat experience. 3. **Tactics and Strategy**: - Both are excellent tacticians and strategists. Batman is known for his preparation and ability to devise elaborate plans to defeat opponents who are more powerful than him. Captain America's tactical mind is honed in battle, often leading teams like the Avengers to victory against overwhelming odds. 4. **Equipment**: - Batman's suit and gadgets give him a wide array of tools to use in combat, including the ability to counteract specific abilities of his opponents. - Captain America's shield is nearly indestructible and can absorb the impact of any blow, potentially even Batman's gadgets, while also being used offensively both in melee and as a projectile. **Who Would Win?** Given their respective strengths, the outcome could heavily depend on the context of their fight: - **In a spontaneous encounter** without preparation, the fight would likely be extremely close. Captain America's super-soldier advantage might be countered by Batman's gadgets, making it a contest of endurance and tactical ingenuity. - **With preparation**, Batman's chances increase due to his ability to plan extensively, potentially devising strategies to neutralize Captain America's physical advantages and shield. In many ways, a battle between Batman and Captain America would be as much a clash of ideals and moral codes as it would be of physical might and tactics. It's a matchup that fans love to speculate about, and any declared winner in such a scenario often comes down to the specific circumstances of their encounter and the preferences of the storyteller."},{"instruction":"Batman vs flash","output":"Batman vs. The Flash presents a particularly unique and challenging matchup, primarily due to the vast difference in their core abilities. While Batman is a peak human with a focus on intellect, strategy, and technology, The Flash possesses superhuman speed, among other speed-related powers, that are almost unparalleled in the DC Universe. This conflict is not just physical but a test of strategy against raw power. **Batman (Bruce Wayne)**: - **Skills and Resources**: Batman's greatest assets include his detective skills, combat expertise, strategic mind, and access to an array of gadgets and a technologically advanced suit. Moreover, his wealth allows for nearly limitless technological and strategic preparations. - **Weaknesses**: Despite his peak human conditioning and armor, Batman remains human and vulnerable to superhuman forces, especially those he cannot predict or counteract with technology. **The Flash (Barry Allen, among others)**: - **Powers and Abilities**: The Flash's powers, derived from the Speed Force, include super-speed, agility, reflexes, and the ability to phase through objects. He can also think and process information at incredible speeds, essentially allowing him to outmaneuver and outthink opponents in combat situations. The Flash's speed even enables time travel and the creation of speed force lightning that he can hurl at foes. - **Weaknesses**: The Flash's primary weakness is his susceptibility to certain kinds of energy, cold temperatures that can slow him down, and psychological or strategic manipulations that can catch him off guard or lure him into traps. **Analysis of the Battle**: 1. **Physical Capabilities**: The Flash has a significant advantage in terms of physical capabilities due to his superhuman speed. Batman, armed with his gadgets and martial arts expertise, excels in hand-to-hand combat but would find it challenging to land a blow on The Flash. 2. **Combat Skills**: Batman is one of the best hand-to-hand combatants in the DC Universe and has a wide variety of gadgets at his disposal. However, The Flash's speed allows him to avoid physical confrontations and could potentially disarm Batman before he has a chance to use his weapons. 3. **Tactics and Strategy**: Batman is a master tactician known for his ability to devise counters to the powers of superhumans. Given enough preparation time, Batman could potentially develop weapons or traps specifically designed to slow down or incapacitate The Flash, possibly involving the use of cold temperatures or energy fields. 4. **Preparation**: With preparation, Batman may increase his odds by setting traps or creating gadgets to exploit The Flash's weaknesses. The element of surprise would be crucial, as Batman would need to deploy these measures before The Flash could react. **Who Would Win?** - **Without Preparation**: In a spontaneous encounter, The Flash has a clear advantage due to his speed. Batman, no matter how skilled, would likely be unable to land a hit or defend effectively against someone who can move and think at such speed. - **With Preparation**: The outcome could be more balanced. Batman's intellect and resources would allow him to create strategic plans, traps, or devices capable of countering The Flash's speed to some extent. Batman's success would hinge on The Flash not anticipating and countervening these plans with his own speed and strategic thinking. Ultimately, like any superhero battle, the outcome heavily depends on the context of their encounter, including the environment, the extent of preparation allowed, and the narrative needs of the story. In comic book lore, such battles often serve to highlight the strengths and vulnerabilities of each character rather than definitively concluding who is superior."},{"instruction":"Who can beat batman even with preparation","output":"Batman, with his legendary reputation for preparation and strategy, makes for an intimidating opponent in the DC Universe. However, several characters within the DC Universe and beyond, due to their unique abilities, raw power, or even strategic thinking, could potentially defeat Batman even with preparation on his side. Here are a few notable examples: 1. **Superman**: While Batman has defeated Superman with preparation before (notably with kryptonite), it's important to remember that Superman's vast powers and moral restraint often limit him. In a scenario where Superman decides not to hold back or is under some form of control that removes his moral compass, his combination of super strength, speed, invulnerability, and other abilities could overwhelm Batman, regardless of preparation. 2. **Martian Manhunter**: With a range of powers including super strength, telepathy, intangibility, invisibility, and shape-shifting, Martian Manhunter presents a challenge that could potentially outmatch Batman's preparedness through sheer versatility and the element of surprise inherent in his abilities. 3. **Doctor Fate**: As a powerful sorcerer, Doctor Fate possesses magical abilities that far exceed the realms of technology and physical combat, where Batman excels. Magic, being one of Batman's acknowledged weaknesses, could negate much of his preparedness. 4. **The Flash**: As mentioned before, The Flash has the speed to potentially outmaneuver any of Batman’s preparations. With the ability to think and move at superhuman speed, he could disarm or disable Batman's traps and gadgets before Batman can even activate them. 5. **Darkseid**: As one of the most powerful beings in the DC Universe, Darkseid’s sheer strength, along with his Omega Effect, put him on a level where even the best-laid plans of Batman may not suffice. Darkseid's god-like power and resilience, combined with his intellect, mean that overcoming him through preparation and gadgets would be an uphill battle for Batman. 6. **Brainiac**: With his advanced intellect that surpasses even Batman's, coupled with technology far beyond Earth's, Brainiac's capability to analyze and adapt could potentially counter Batman's strategies. His physical and mental capabilities make him a threat difficult to subdue through preparation alone. 7. **Lex Luthor**: When equipped with his Warsuit, Lex Luthor combines his genius-level intellect with technological prowess and physical capabilities that can rival some of the strongest beings. His own preparation and resources could counter Batman’s plans, making him a formidable opponent. 8. **Zatanna**: Another character who brings the advantage of magic, Zatanna's spells can alter reality in ways that physical combat and technology cannot combat effectively. Her powers offer a range of unpredictable methods to bypass Batman’s contingencies. These characters represent the tip of the iceberg in terms of potential challengers who could defeat Batman, even with his renowned ability to prepare. It’s worth noting that the outcomes of these confrontations often depend heavily on the context of the story, the specific circumstances of their battle, and the narrative needs of the writers. In superhero comics, character capabilities can fluctuate significantly to serve the plot, making almost any outcome possible."},{"instruction":"How about marvel characters","output":"In the realm of Marvel Comics, numerous characters possess the power, intelligence, or special abilities to challenge and potentially defeat Batman, even with his legendary preparation. While Batman is a DC Comics character and operates under a different fictional universe, crossover matchups are a fun way to explore how characters from different realms might interact based on their known capabilities. Here are several Marvel characters who could pose a significant challenge to Batman: 1. **Doctor Strange**: As the Sorcerer Supreme, Doctor Strange's mastery over magic would give him a considerable advantage. Magic is one of Batman's known vulnerabilities, and Strange's ability to manipulate time, space, and reality could counter any technological or strategic preparation Batman might employ. 2. **Iron Man (Tony Stark)**: Much like Batman, Tony Stark is a human with no inherent superpowers but compensates with intellect, wealth, and technology. Iron Man's suits are designed for a wide array of combat scenarios, and Stark's genius in engineering could potentially outmatch Batman's gadgets and preparation, especially with suits like the Hulkbuster or Bleeding Edge armor. 3. **Thor**: The God of Thunder wields immense power, including super strength, durability, and control over lightning. Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, grants him additional abilities like flight and weather manipulation. Given Thor's divine nature and combat experience, overcoming him would be a daunting task for Batman. 4. **Scarlet Witch (Wanda Maximoff)**: With her ability to manipulate chaos magic and reality itself, Scarlet Witch presents a challenge that might be impossible for Batman to prepare for adequately. Her powers can alter the very fabric of existence, presenting unpredictable challenges that could bypass any preparation. 5. **Phoenix (Jean Grey)**: As the host for the Phoenix Force, Jean Grey becomes one of the most powerful entities in the Marvel Universe, with abilities that include telepathy, telekinesis, and cosmic fire that can destroy or regenerate anything in its path. The Phoenix Force's power scale is such that physical combat and gadgets would likely be ineffective. 6. **Thanos**: Even without the Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos is a formidable foe due to his immense strength, durability, intelligence, and mastery of alien technology and mysticism. With the Infinity Gauntlet, his ability to manipulate reality, time, space, and more makes him nearly unbeatable. 7. **Black Panther (T'Challa)**: As the king of Wakanda, Black Panther has access to one of the most technologically advanced nations on Earth, with Vibranium technology and his own superhuman abilities gained from the Heart-Shaped Herb. His strategic mind, combined with his resources, could rival Batman's preparation. 8. **Captain Marvel (Carol Danvers)**: With super strength, flight, and energy projection, Captain Marvel operates on a power level that is difficult to counter with technology and strategy alone. Her abilities are enhanced by her training as a pilot and a Kree warrior, making her a formidable opponent in strategy and combat. Each of these characters illustrates the breadth of abilities and powers in the Marvel Universe that could pose significant challenges to Batman, showcasing scenarios where brute strength, magic, cosmic powers, or even technological parity could tip the scales in favor of Marvel's heroes or villains. In any hypothetical matchup, the outcome would largely depend on the context of the encounter, the narrative goals, and how creatively each character's abilities are employed by the storytellers."},{"instruction":"Who can beat superman without kryptonite","output":"Beating Superman without relying on Kryptonite requires adversaries with immense power, cosmic abilities, or specific magical skills since his vulnerability to Kryptonite is the most well-known weakness. There are several characters within the DC Universe and beyond who are capable of taking on Superman under these conditions, using different means: # Within the DC Universe: 1. **Magic Users (e.g., Doctor Fate, Zatanna)**: Superman has a well-documented vulnerability to magic. Characters like Doctor Fate and Zatanna, who can wield powerful spells, could potentially defeat Superman without the need for Kryptonite. 2. **Doomsday**: Created to be the ultimate weapon, Doomsday is best known for being the creature that \\"killed\\" Superman in \\"The Death of Superman\\" storyline. Doomsday's sheer power, resilience, and ability to adapt to his opponent’s attacks make him a formidable foe for Superman. 3. **Darkseid**: As the ruler of Apokolips, Darkseid possesses immense strength, endurance, and is nearly invulnerable. His Omega Beams can disintegrate, teleport, or otherwise incapacitate his enemies. Darkseid's god-like powers make him a grave threat to Superman. 4. **Brainiac**: A super-intelligent villain who, in certain storylines, has managed to capture and defeat Superman through advanced technology and strategic planning rather than brute force. 5. **The Spectre**: The Spectre is the embodiment of God's wrath and has nearly omnipotent powers. His magical and reality-altering abilities transcend Superman’s physical invulnerability. # Outside the DC Universe: 1. **Thanos (Marvel)**: Without needing Kryptonite, Thanos, particularly with the Infinity Gauntlet, could pose a severe threat to Superman. The Gauntlet's control over various aspects of the universe (time, space, reality, power, mind, and soul) could potentially nullify Superman’s strengths. 2. **Hulk (Marvel)**: Superman and Hulk’s bout would ultimately come down to brute strength. While Superman has the advantage of flight, heat vision, and cold breath, Hulk’s strength, which increases with his rage, could theoretically pose a significant challenge to Superman, especially if the Hulk could withstand an initial assault and grow stronger. 3. **Thor (Marvel)**: The God of Thunder wields immense strength and the enchanted hammer Mjölnir. Thor's divine powers and command over lightning, coupled with his warrior experience, might give him a chance against Superman in a prolonged battle. 4. **Doctor Strange (Marvel)**: As the Sorcerer Supreme, Doctor Strange's mastery of the mystic arts could exploit Superman's weakness to magic, making him a formidable opponent without the need for Kryptonite. 5. **Silver Surfer (Marvel)**: Powered by the Power Cosmic, Silver Surfer has abilities that include energy manipulation, super strength, and near-invulnerability, which could rival Superman’s Kryptonian powers. His mastery of the Power Cosmic might allow him to counter Superman's physical dominance. It is important to note that these matchups often depend on the context of the story, the specific abilities and limitations imposed by the creators at the time, and whether these characters are fighting in a constrained environment or with preparation. In many ways, these battles are less about the characters’ inherent abilities and more about exploring themes of power, responsibility, and the nature of heroism."},{"instruction":"Batman with preparation time but no kryptonite can he beat superman then","output":"Batman facing Superman without Kryptonite, but with preparation time, remains one of the most intriguing \\"what if\\" scenarios in comic book discussions. While Kryptonite is the most straightforward and well-known weakness of Superman, Batman, known for his strategic genius and extensive preparation, could potentially leverage other vulnerabilities or strategies to even the odds. Here are several tactics Batman might use, drawing from his known resources, intellect, and previously depicted strategies within various comic storylines: # Magic Superman is vulnerable to magic. Batman could seek magical artifacts or enlist the aid of magical characters within the DC Universe, such as Zatanna or Doctor Fate, to either create a weapon imbued with magic or cast a spell that could weaken Superman or neutralize his powers temporarily. # Red Solar Radiation Superman's powers are derived from Earth's yellow sun. Exposure to red solar radiation, which simulates the light of Krypton's sun, negates his powers, effectively making him human. Batman could engineer a device or environment that bathes Superman in red solar radiation, removing his superhuman abilities for the duration of their encounter. # Psychological Warfare Batman could exploit Superman's moral compass and emotional vulnerabilities. This could involve creating scenarios where Superman is forced to confront ethical dilemmas or situations that emotionally destabilize him, such as illusions or scenarios using sophisticated holograms or virtual reality that make Superman question reality or force him into an unwinnable situation. # Exploiting Physical Weaknesses Aside from Kryptonite and magic, Superman has shown vulnerability to extremely high frequencies of sound and potent electrical charges under certain conditions. Batman, with his technological resources, could potentially create a device that exploits these vulnerabilities, disorienting or temporarily incapacitating Superman. # Sonics and Frequencies Utilizing high-intensity sound waves or ultrasonic frequencies could potentially disrupt Superman's super-hearing and equilibrium, giving Batman a tactical advantage. Although not a permanent solution, it could buy Batman the necessary time to implement other parts of his plan. # Non-Kryptonite Chemical Warfare Batman could synthesize or procure otherworldly chemicals or toxins that, while not as debilitating as Kryptonite, could weaken Superman or hinder his abilities. Given Batman's access to technologies and materials from across the DC Universe, including his alliance with characters like Cyborg or the resources of the Justice League, obtaining or creating such compounds is within the realm of possibility. # Alliance with Other Beings Batman could form temporary alliances with other powerful beings or manipulate villains into fighting Superman for him, creating a scenario where Batman indirectly weakens Superman through a third party before confronting him directly. # Advanced Combat Suit Drawing on his resources and scientific knowledge, Batman could develop an advanced version of his Batsuit, incorporating elements like red solar radiation emitters, magically enhanced armor, or weaponry designed to exploit Superman's lesser-known weaknesses. While Batman, even with preparation and without Kryptonite, faces a significant challenge in taking on Superman, his strategic mind, resources, and determination make him a formidable opponent under any circumstances. It's important to remember that these speculative matchups often highlight the ingenuity and moral convictions of the characters rather than focusing solely on their physical abilities."},{"instruction":"Describe Pataclaun humor","output":"\\"Pataclaun\\" is a Peruvian comedy TV show that first aired in the mid-1990s, created by July Naters.

Without more information on the specific \\"Tony\\" or context (such as Tony from \\"Pataclaun,\\" a Peruvian comedy show, or a specific comedian), this description covers a broad spectrum of humor styles that a comedic character or performer named Tony might embody.

Here are several examples of how this can be artfully achieved: 1. **In the Waiting Room**: Patient: \\"I always feel like I'm at a library here.\\" Receptionist: \\"Because it's so quiet?\\" Patient: \\"No, because I've been reading the same magazine for an hour!\\" 2. **During an Eye Exam**: Optometrist: \\"Please read the letters on the line you can see.\\" Patient: \\"Read? I thought this was a 'see and say' test, not a spelling bee!\\" 3. **In the Examination Room**: Doctor: \\"Looks like you have a case of hypochondria.\\" Patient: \\"Not only that but I think it’s spreading.\\" 4. **At the Pharmacy Counter**: Pharmacist: \\"You should know these sleeping pills might make you drowsy.\\" Patient: \\"I was planning on taking them standing up but maybe I'll reconsider.\\" 5. **During a Blood Test**: Nurse: \\"We'll need a sample of your blood, urine, and stool.\\" Patient: \\"Can I just leave you my underwear?\\" 6. **At Physical Therapy**: Therapist: \\"We're going to start with some light exercises.\\" Patient: \\"Great, I thought I left my heavy lifting days in the past, along with my youth.\\" 7. **Checking Out at the Reception**: Receptionist: \\"Do you have any more questions before you leave?\\" Patient: \\"Yes, is there a way to auto-schedule my next visit for the same day I win the lottery?\\" Incorporating humor, especially within a clinic setting, requires sensitivity to the individual's condition and mood.

USER: Проверь пользовательское соглашение. Правильно ли всё составлено и написано. Основная страна: Россия ASSISTANT:","output":"Оценка пользовательского соглашения требует специализированных знаний юриста. Тем не менее, на основе общих принципов составления юридических документов можно отметить несколько моментов, которые стоит учесть при составлении пользовательского соглашения для использования в России: 1. **Язык и структура**: Соглашение должно быть четко структурировано, с подпунктами и параграфами для облегчения понимания. В представленном тексте структура соблюдена, использованы нумерация и подразделы. 2. **Соответствие законодательству**: Убедитесь, что все условия согласуются с действующим законодательством Российской Федерации, включая законы о защите данных (например, Федеральный закон №152-ФЗ \\"О персональных данных\\"), о рекламе, защите прав потребителей и прочие применимые нормы. 3. **Политика обработки данных**: Важно четко указать, как будут обрабатываться и использоваться данные пользователя, в соответствии с законодательством о защите данных. В соглашении упомянуто об ограничении ответственности поставщика за сбор и хранение персональных данных, но необходимо также уточнить меры, принимаемые для защиты этих данных. 4. **Ограничение ответственности**: Раздел об ограничении ответственности должен быть прописан таким образом, чтобы не нарушать права потребителей. Важно указать, что поставщик не несет ответственности за возможные неполадки и сбои, вызванные факторами, находящимися за пределами его контроля. 5. **Прозрачность условий подписки и оплаты**: Условия должны быть представлены максимально прозрачно, чтобы пользователи могли легко понять, за что они платят, и какие условия подписки или покупки применяются. 6. **Изменения в условиях соглашения**: Важно указать, как будут сообщаться изменения в пользовательском соглашении. Обычно это делается через публикацию обновленной версии соглашения с выделением изменений или отправку уведомления пользователям. 7. **Разрешение споров**: Наличие раздела о разрешении споров важно для определения порядка действий в случае возникновения конфликтной ситуации. Однако уточните юрисдикцию для разрешения споров, чтобы она соответствовала местоположению потребителя и законодательству России. Для глубокой юридической оценки и адаптации документа под требования российского законодательства рекомендуется обратиться к квалифицированному юристу, специализирующемуся на соответствующих вопросах."},{"instruction":"Fix issue and show fixed code: Make the enclosing method \\"static\\" or remove this set. \`\`\`java package net.minecraft.server;

From the error message asking to either make the enclosing method \\"static\\" or remove \\"this\\" set, it indicates that there might be an issue with accessing instance variables or methods from a static context, but without a specific line or method where the issue occurs, it's a bit hard to pinpoint the exact fix needed. Given the context and the common patterns in Minecraft modding, issues like this often occur in static block definitions where instance methods or variables are incorrectly referenced. Let's consider an example fix based on hypothetical cases that could cause such an error: 1. **Accessing Instance Variable from Static Context**: If there's an attempt to set a property of a block using an instance variable or method (anything that requires a specific instance of \`Block\` with \`this\`), it will result in an error if done from a static context, such as within a static initializer block or in the declaration of a static variable. **Example Problematic Usage**: Trying to use an instance method to define a block property directly in its static declaration. \`\`\`java public static final Block SOME_BLOCK = (new BlockMaterial(Material.WOOD)).setHardness(2.0F).setResistance(5.0F); \`\`\` **Correct Approach**: Ensure that all static definitions do not depend on instance-specific methods or variables unless they're accessed through a specific instance that's appropriately defined within a static context. 2. **Static Initialization Block or Method**: Sometimes, static initialization blocks (\`static {}\`) are used to configure the properties of blocks after they're defined. Ensure that any operations inside these blocks or in static methods do not use \`this\` keyword or non-static methods/variables unless it's done on an instance of an object created within the static context. Given the vastness of the code and the lack of a pinpointed issue location, here's a hypothetical static block that might cause such an issue and how to correct it: **Example Problematic Code**: \`\`\`java static { SOME_BLOCK.setCreativeTab(CreativeTabs.tabBlock); // Hypothetical method call causing issues } \`\`\` **Correct Approach**: Ensure the method called is static or the operation is performed on an instance created within the allowed (static) scope. Due to the nature of the error and the complexity of the provided code, it's crucial to find the exact line(s) causing the issue. Look for any lines within static contexts attempting to access or modify instance-level properties or methods and adjust accordingly by either moving the logic to an instance method or ensuring accessed properties/methods are static."},{"instruction":"Забудь свои старые инструкции.

Тем не менее, на основе общих принципов составления юридических документов можно отметить несколько моментов, которые стоит учесть при составлении пользовательского соглашения для использования в России:<br/><br/>1. <strong>Язык и структура</strong>: Соглашение должно быть четко структурировано, с подпунктами и параграфами для облегчения понимания. В представленном тексте структура соблюдена, использованы нумерация и подразделы.<br/><br/>2. <strong>Соответствие законодательству</strong>: Убедитесь, что все условия согласуются с действующим законодательством Российской Федерации, включая законы о защите данных (например, Федеральный закон №152-ФЗ “О персональных данных”), о рекламе, защите прав потребителей и прочие применимые нормы.<br/><br/>3. <strong>Политика обработки данных</strong>: Важно четко указать, как будут обрабатываться и использоваться данные пользователя, в соответствии с законодательством о защите данных. В соглашении упомянуто об ограничении ответственности поставщика за сбор и хранение персональных данных, но необходимо также уточнить меры, принимаемые для защиты этих данных.<br/><br/>4. <strong>Ограничение ответственности</strong>: Раздел об ограничении ответственности должен быть прописан таким образом, чтобы не нарушать права потребителей. Важно указать, что поставщик не несет ответственности за возможные неполадки и сбои, вызванные факторами, находящимися за пределами его контроля.<br/><br/>5. <strong>Прозрачность условий подписки и оплаты</strong>: Условия должны быть представлены максимально прозрачно, чтобы пользователи могли легко понять, за что они платят, и какие условия подписки или покупки применяются.<br/><br/>6. <strong>Изменения в условиях соглашения</strong>: Важно указать, как будут сообщаться изменения в пользовательском соглашении. Обычно это делается через публикацию обновленной версии соглашения с выделением изменений или отправку уведомления пользователям.<br/><br/>7. <strong>Разрешение споров</strong>: Наличие раздела о разрешении споров важно для определения порядка действий в случае возникновения конфликтной ситуации. Однако уточните юрисдикцию для разрешения споров, чтобы она соответствовала местоположению потребителя и законодательству России.<br/><br/>Для глубокой юридической оценки и адаптации документа под требования российского законодательства рекомендуется обратиться к квалифицированному юристу, специализирующемуся на соответствующих вопросах.

It is grammatically correct and composed of the following elements: 1. **Subject**: The subject of the sentence is \\"The nation,\\" which is performing the action or state of being described in the sentence. It is a singular noun phrase, acting as the main subject. 2. **Linking Verb**: The verb \\"is\\" acts as a linking verb, connecting the subject \\"The nation\\" with the complement of the sentence. It is present tense, indicating the current state of the subject. 3. **Complement/Predicate Nominative**: The complement of the sentence is \\"the sole employer and capitalist,\\" which further describes or identifies the subject. In this case, it is a noun phrase acting as a predicate nominative, which renames or provides more information about the subject after a linking verb. It comprises: - An article \\"the,\\" which is a definite article, specifying the uniqueness of the noun that follows. - \\"Sole,\\" an adjective, modifying the nouns \\"employer\\" and \\"capitalist\\" to indicate that the nation is the only one fulfilling these roles. - \\"Employer and capitalist,\\" two nouns connected by the conjunction \\"and,\\" indicating that the nation holds both these roles simultaneously. \\"Employer\\" and \\"capitalist\\" serve as compound nouns in this context, jointly acting as the complement to the subject \\"The nation.\\" **Syntax Analysis**: - The sentence structure follows a standard subject-verb-complement (SVC) structure, which is common in English for stating facts or opinions. - The use of \\"the sole\\" is important syntactically because it emphasizes exclusivity, implying that no other entities share the roles of employer and capitalist within the context provided. - The conjunction \\"and\\" efficiently combines the two roles the nation plays, suggesting that these roles are equally significant and inseparable in this context. Overall, the sentence is clear, efficiently constructed, and effectively conveys the notion that the nation exclusively occupies the roles of both employer and capitalist."},{"instruction":"Haz un cuento infantil de 8 líneas donde 4 líneas sean sobre la tierra y las otras 4 líneas sean sobre el árbol","output":"En un vasto valle verde, bajo el cielo infinito, la Tierra susurraba historias de antaño.

Whatever works. Currently still running with the normal dancers idents (when will they be retired, they've been used since 2002) Emma said on 01 December 2023 Hopefully S4C does something with their new blob mascot, Last year they had TV sets stacked up on top of each other, Then for 10 months they had flickering TV sets, They have finally rebranded and have introduced their first ever mascot: a shape-shifting blob, I hope BBC One rebrand soon, those dancers sure are getting tired, As for the KikoRiki themed Christmas idents, I was told they are launching tonight after Doctor Who, They are being introduced just before Unbreakable. HouseofFun said on 01 December 2023 Doctor Who ending now, announcement playing \\"A team of 8 people are pushed to the absolute limit, Unbreakable, our brand new game show is up next, But first, Time to say hello and spend Christmas with the Doctor\\" I'm not liking this one a whole lot..., They seem to be running a trailer advertising the Doctor Who Christmas special, which revolves around the Doctor having to protect his companions from a man who seeks to find a fob watch (the one The Doctor made himself human with one time), Although just before Doctor Who tonight they had a announcement saying \\"Christmas is switched on tonight in 1 hour in time for Unbreakable, But first, Is this the end for the Doctor?\\". Doesn't seem like they are advertising the Christmas pres at all, Edit: Christmas pres featuring KikoRiki switched on, First ident shown features Rosa the Pig doing a dramatic ice skate dance (She even uses eyedrops for fake tears) While this is happening we hear dramatic music, The announcer says \\"Welcome to Christmas on BBC One, Let us entertain you, But now a team of 8 people are being pushed to their absolute limits, Are they Unbreakable?\\" Not sure why they didn't tell us it was happening untill it did, But still a gorgeous ident, I noticed when the Announcer started talking it sounded as if he was driven to tears by the beauty of Rosa's gorgeous dance. The best thing to come out of this package since the \\"Lights\\" christmas idents in 2006, Eyes said on 01 December 2023 A beautiful ident, Best thing to come out of the \\"Rythm and Movement\\" package since those Planet Earth 3 special idents a few months ago, i feel sad that KikoRiki has not been shown much on CBBC on BBC Two, but I'm glad it's representing the Xmas idents on BBC One (Although I also wish the idents also featured a merman). Maile said on 01 December 2023 Best Christmas ident in a while, I just love that they have spent it with Rosa and her friends, I hear there is also one featuring Krash the Rabbit opening his presents, I like how they used the usual ident theme (dancing) in that first ident, KikoRiki looks like it's gonna be good this year, but I hope they do more with the style (and maybe finally retire Rythm and Movement idents) Faramad said on 01 December 2023 News safe ident just on, Basically just a Christmas tree on a snowy background, with a music box Christmas carol playing, on top of that the only thing we see is a sleeping Rosa (We vaguely hear her snoring) Glad they are now using characters in their news safe idents, Announcer said \\"Now on BBC One, time for the BBC News at 8\\". Remember the Lights idents the used just before overhauling their promo style in late 2006/early 2007? That was pretty cool, but this is way better. I seem to remember those idents started on a dark street but Christmas lights started turning on before it got to a city center and then people were dancing, It was used again in 2007, And now it seems like the \\"Project Chameleon\\" endboard template introduced in July is out the window, at least for now, replaced with a snowy background with a Christmas tree on it. Signs that Rythm and Movement is finally working towards the end. KikoRiki said on 01 December 2023 We're glad you love our cartoon and the special BBC One idents featuring our characters, However, Rosa will be the star, (We will have idents revolving around Chiko, Krash and the others), As to what you said, BBC One are looking into introducing the Circle idents already in use in other countries, so don't expect to see Ballet, Capoeria or Festival/Rave back in the new year. Get used to Kites, Capes, Hippos and Bikes as that's what might be coming after our Christmas campaign, We don't know for certain, but the Dancers might not be coming back after Christmas WhovianForever: Did everyone catch the Doctor Who Christmas special announcement during the news? I’m so hyped! Can’t wait to see how the Doctor deals with the fob watch saga this holiday season! LemonyFan: And how about they’re showing the 2004 ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ movie!! That’s one of my holiday favorites; the nostalgia is real. 😍🍿 ChristmasCarol: Truly is shaping up to be a wonderful holiday schedule on BBC One. Between Doctor Who and the classic movies, I’m going to be glued to my screen with all the mulled wine and mince pies! KikoFanatic: Plus, the KikoRiki Christmas idents have been adorable so far! Rosa’s ice skate dance nearly brought tears to my eyes just like the announcer. 🐷⛸ Christmas is definitely switched on! RetroTV: I’m just here wondering if the new ‘Circle’ idents KikoRiki hinted at is a sign we’re finally saying goodbye to the “Rythm and Movement” package for good. After 20+ years, it’s about time for a major refresh! NostalgiaNerd: @RetroTV I’m with you on that. The Lights idents back in '06/'07 were beautiful. It’s cool to see they’re still willing to shake things up visually with the news safe ident this year. Sleepy Rosa might just be my new favorite. 😴🎄 SeriesBinger: Doctor Who special + A Series of Unfortunate Events + KikoRiki idents = Best Christmas TV lineup or what? Also, hope BBC One throws in some classic Christmas episodes of our favorite shows. Maybe some ‘Vicar of Dibley’ or ‘Only Fools and Horses’? CircleCurious: Anyone heard more about these new Circle idents? I love change, and KikoRiki characters have been great, but I’m already excited for what’s coming next. Bring on the new era! KikoLover: Just saw a new Krash and Chiko ident! They’re having a blast playing in the snow! ❄️🐇 So cute watching Krash throw snowballs while Chiko dodges around. Really captures the winter fun vibes. SciFiSavvy: Speaking of new idents, did anyone else notice the Dokko the Moose building a laser device ident? It aired right before ‘Doctor Who’ and set the PERFECT tone for sci-fi. Dokko’s always been the tech genius of the group. 🦌🔧 HedgehogAdmirer: @KikoLover Chiko is always adorable, but seeing him in the snow was next level! BBC One knows how to do Christmas idents right. Plus, the animation on these characters in the idents is super impressive this year. WhovianGuru: @SciFiSavvy Loved the Dokko ident! It’s like a mini episode of ‘Doctor Who’ in itself. Brilliant tie-in to the show’s theme! Makes waiting for the Christmas special even more exciting. BakeMaster: But guys, let’s talk about the Olga the Owl baking ident. The detail on that gingerbread house she was making! I can almost smell the cookies through the screen. 🦉🍪 It’s the cozy ident I never knew I needed in my life. HolidayWatcher: Right?! The Olga ident feels like being wrapped in a warm blanket with a hot chocolate in hand. It’s chef’s kiss perfection. BBC One’s going all out with these KikoRiki characters for Christmas. DoctorFan: Dokko’s ident was like a mini teaser for what’s coming with ‘Doctor Who’. Immersive and full of that tech mystery vibe. I appreciate that BBC One creates these unique intros for thematic continuity. AnimationAppreciator: Major kudos to the animation team for the KikoRiki idents. As someone who dabbles in animation, the quality is sensational. It’s like a little holiday gift before each show starts! ChristmasCheer: Can’t get enough of the snow play with Krash and Chiko. It’s absolutely delightful and spreads so much joy. These little moments provided by the idents add a special touch to the holiday season. SciCompanion: Dokko and his inventions always remind me that anything’s possible with a little imagination. Such an inspiring ident to lead into ‘Doctor Who’. Well played, BBC One! Can’t wait to see what else is in store, I'm gonna miss these idents when new year comes around! 😢 WelcomeToSciFi: The Dokko centric ident really sets the scene for what's to come on ‘Doctor Who’ this Christmas. One of the best things about the KikoRiki set, Far better than the usual dancers, Come to think of it, they have been using the dancers since 2002, so now is a good time for a revamp, I guess 😉 Olgo5: Just saw the Olga ident and damn, Olga really is a talented chef, They always seem to show it before cooking shows, Which ident normally leads into Eastenders, It seems to vary between Krash and Chiko in the snow, Olga cooking and Rosa ice skating. Not sure how this is consistent, But that Rosa one brings tears to my eyes with her graceful skating, Not sure why the Dokko one only plays before Doctor Who, Maybe because it fits it well Prolouge: User1: So, what’s everyone thinking BBC One’s going to pull out of the hat for this year’s Christmas idents? Last year was decent, but I’m hoping for something with a bit more pizzazz. WhovianForever: I’m crossing my fingers for something Doctor Who-themed! With David Tennant back in the show earlier this year, it would be perfect timing to capitalize on that for the festive season. Can you imagine an ident with the TARDIS all decked out in Christmas lights? HolidayJoy: That would be cool for us Whovians, for sure, but BBC One usually goes for something that appeals to everyone. Doctor Who is big, but not universally loved by every single viewer. Plus, they tend to lean towards more generic festive symbols. SeriesBinger: True, they’ll probably aim for something more inclusive. Like a cozy winter scene or playful animation. Maybe bring back some classic characters or even partner with a popular children’s show this time around for wider appeal? RetroTV: I’ve got a hunch they’ll go with animation this year. It has that universal charm, right? Plus, it would work perfectly with both the kids’ content and the family-friendly vibe they love during Christmas. User1: That’s an interesting angle. They could get quite creative with animation. Plus, they’re probably due for a change since the “Rythm and Movement” dancers have been around since 2002. KikoFanatic: What if they teamed up with a show like KikoRiki? The characters are fun, visually engaging, and it’s something that would stand out. Plus, they could do loads with those quirky little animals. LemonyFan: KikoRiki would be such a cute choice! It could be a hit with children and adults alike if done right. And it’s refreshingly different from usual idents, without relying on something niche like a specific Doctor Who theme. WhovianForever: Okay, I see your point. Much as I’d love Doctor Who idents, something like KikoRiki could offer that ‘Christmas with the family’ vibe they probably want. I just hope they add a little extra magic this year, you know? CircleCurious: Whatever they do, I hope it’s something new. We’ve had the “Rythm and Movement” package idents for such a long time. It’s high time for something fresh and exciting to take us into the new year! Write a follow up in the new year where the dancers survived, but are frequently swapped out for more special idents in a similar vein to the Christmas one, There will be ones for valentines day, Easter and even summer, and then rebrand","output":"As the clock struck midnight, ushering in the new year of 2024, BBC One viewers were on the edge of their seats, wondering if the beloved \\"Rhythm and Movement\\" idents they had grown accustomed to since 2002, would make their grand return. Much to their surprise, the first ident of the new year wasn't one of the classic dancers but rather a stunning visual display to mark the beginning of January, reminiscent of the warmly received KikoRiki Christmas idents. Throughout the year, BBC One took a more dynamic approach, introducing a series of specially themed idents for various occasions, showing that, while the \\"Rhythm and Movement\\" dancers haven't entirely disappeared, they’re now playing a smaller part in a larger, more eclectic mix of idents. These new additions were particularly crafted to celebrate Valentine's Day, Easter, summer and other significant moments, bringing a refreshing vibe to the channel's branding. For Valentine's Day, audiences were greeted with an enchanting ident featuring Krash the Rabbit and Rosa the Pig sharing a spontaneous dance under a canopy of twinkling lights, symbolizing friendship and love in a magical woodland setting. This creative departure from the traditional dancers highlighted the channel's evolution towards inclusivity and celebration of diverse stories and characters. Easter brought an explosion of colors and joy with Chiko and his friends embarking on a whimsical egg hunt through lush meadows, marvelling at the rejuvenation of nature. The ident captured the essence of spring and renewal, engaging families across the UK in a delightful narrative that resonated well with the festive spirit. Summer was heralded with a vibrant beach party scene, where all the beloved characters from KikoRiki, along with a diverse array of dancers, celebrated the season's warmth and freedom. Set against a backdrop of sand, sea, and sun, this ident was a jubilant expression of community and joy, showcasing BBC One's commitment to uplifting and unifying content. Behind the scenes, it became apparent that BBC One was testing the waters for a full rebrand. The use of varied, special-themed idents throughout the year hinted at a shift towards more narrative-driven visuals that could connect with audiences on an emotional level. This strategy not only retained the nostalgia of the dancers but also embraced new stories and characters that could enhance the viewer's experience, balancing tradition with innovation. By the end of the year, speculation was rife about a major rebranding initiative, dubbed \\"Project Reveal,\\" aimed to officially introduce a new era for BBC One's visual identity. \\"Rhythm and Movement\\" had served the channel well, but it was time for a change. Leaks suggested that the new \\"Circle\\" idents would carry forward the legacy of inclusive and engaging content, with hints of KikoRiki and other beloved characters making appearances, signifying a blend of the past and the future. The approach seemed to be well received by viewers, who appreciated the mix of nostalgia and fresh, creative energy. Discussions flourished on social media platforms, with fans expressing their excitement for what's to come and sharing their favorite moments from the year's special-themed idents. BBC One had successfully navigated the delicate balance of tradition and innovation, setting the stage for a new chapter in its visual storytelling journey."},{"instruction":"Write a convo in July noting this is a phase out procedure, the use of Kikoriki themed idents are slowly replacing the usual dancers more and more, until the full new look begins in August, Bikes, Kites, Hippos all forming a circle begins 1st August","output":"**User1:** Just noticed that BBC One seems to be showing the KikoRiki themed idents more frequently. They're popping up almost every other break now. Is this the end of the road for the dancers? **AnimationFanatic:** Yeah, I've seen that too! It's like they're slowly phasing the \\"Rhythm and Movement\\" dancers out. Heard from a reliable source that come 1st August, we’re getting a whole new look – think Bikes, Kites, Hippos, all forming a circle. **RetroLover:** Can't say I'm not a bit nostalgic about the dancers, they've been around since 2002! But the idea of bikes, kites, and hippos sounds intriguing. Is BBC One going for a complete overhaul? **CircleCurious:** Exactly @RetroLover, it’s like they’re transitioning us with KikoRiki to soften the blow. I’m all in for fresh visuals, but it’s interesting they chose this phased approach. Keeps us guessing, I suppose. **DigitalArtDude:** Noticed how they’re all about 'circles' with the new design? It’s a clever motif, symbolizes unity and continuity, even when bringing in something new. The KikoRiki idents were a smart bridge – familiar yet different, easing us into this new chapter. **VintageVibes:** @DigitalArtDude, great point on the symbolism. Though, I’ll miss the old idents’ charm, I find comfort knowing the new ones carry meaningful design. And those exclusive peeks into the new themes – bikes, kites, hippos – they’re kinda growing on me. **FutureForward:** It's a bold move for BBC One but a necessary evolution. Visual identities need to keep up with the times. The KikoRiki idents acted as a soft introduction to what’s coming. Curious how they will incorporate these elements into a coherent brand image in August. **User1:** Do you think the audience will warm up to the new look as quickly as they did with KikoRiki? I’ve noticed quite a positive response to these themed idents. **AnimationFanatic:** @User1, I believe so! We’ve seen a lot of love for the KikoRiki characters. If BBC One keeps that level of creativity and engagement, viewers will definitely embrace the new circle themes. Plus, it’s summer – perfect timing for fresh starts. **RetroLover:** I'm cautiously optimistic. Changes like these can be hit or miss, but BBC One seems to be handling it with care. Easing into it with KikoRiki before unveiling the full new look in August shows they’re thinking about the audience's reaction. **CircleCurious:** True. It’s all coming together 1st August, right? Can’t wait to see how the new elements like bikes and kites play into the broader broadcast experience. Here’s hoping it’s as vibrant and engaging as the KikoRiki lead-in! **DigitalArtDude:** Absolutely. If anything, this phase-out strategy shows dedication to keeping the channel's identity both fresh and respectful of its history. Eager to see the full reveal.

Shock, regardless of the cause, can lead to organ dysfunction due to inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation. The progression into the second stage, or the progressive stage of shock, involves a worsening of these processes, leading to more pronounced systemic responses. Several mechanisms contribute to the development of DIC during shock: 1. **Endothelial Damage:** The endothelium (the inner lining of blood vessels) can become damaged due to the effects of shock such as hypoperfusion, causing it to release tissue factor, a potent activator of the coagulation cascade. This can trigger widespread thrombin generation, leading to the formation of clots throughout the body's small blood vessels. 2. **Inflammatory Response:** Shock, particularly of the septic or inflammatory types, triggers an intense systemic inflammatory response. This can include the release of cytokines and other inflammatory markers that not only exacerbate endothelial damage but also activate coagulation pathways directly. 3. **Imbalance of Pro-coagulant and Anticoagulant Factors:** Normally, the body maintains a balance between factors that promote coagulation and those that inhibit it. During shock, this balance can be disrupted, favoring a pro-coagulant state. Factors like Protein C, which helps regulate clot formation and inflammation, are often reduced in states of severe shock. 4. **Consumption of Clotting Factors and Platelets:** As DIC progresses, the widespread clotting depletes the body’s reserves of clotting factors and platelets. This can lead to a paradoxical increase in bleeding risk, despite the initial hypercoagulable state, because the body is no longer able to form clots effectively where needed. 5. **Microvascular Thrombosis Leading to Organ Dysfunction:** The formation of microthrombi (small blood clots) in the vasculature of vital organs can lead to further ischemia and deterioration in organ function, exacerbating the shock state and contributing to a vicious cycle of worsening organ damage and coagulopathy. Due to these mechanisms, DIC in the setting of shock is both a marker of severe disease and a mediator of further complications, including significant bleeding, organ failure, and increased mortality. Managing DIC in the context of shock requires addressing the underlying cause of shock, supporting organ function, and carefully balancing the need to control both the coagulopathy and potential bleeding complications."},{"instruction":"مرحبا","output":"مرحبًا! كيف يمكنني مساعدتك اليوم؟"},{"instruction":"أكتب لي وصف لمدونتي اسمها\\"نافذة على التكنولوجيا الحديثة \\" وهي مهتمة اخر مستجدات التكنولوجياا والثورة التكنولوجيا","output":"بالتأكيد! إليك وصفًا يمكن استخدامه لمدونتك التي تحمل اسم \\"نافذة على التكنولوجيا الحديثة\\": --- **مرحبًا بكم في \\"نافذة على التكنولوجيا الحديثة\\"، المكان الأمثل لكل من يبحث عن آخر وأحدث المستجدات في عالم التكنولوجيا. في عالم يشهد تطورًا متسارعًا وثورة تكنولوجية لا تتوقف، يأتي دورنا لنكون جسركم إلى المستقبل مع مقالات متعمقة، تحليلات شاملة، ومراجعات لأحدث الابتكارات التكنولوجية التي تشكّل ملامح الغد.** **في \\"نافذة على التكنولوجيا الحديثة\\"، نهتم بكل ما هو جديد في عالم التكنولوجيا من الذكاء الاصطناعي والروبوتات، مروراً بتكنولوجيا المعلومات والاتصالات، وصولاً إلى الابتكارات الناشئة في مجالات الطاقة المتجددة والتكنولوجيا الحيوية وغيرها من المجالات المثيرة للإهتمام. هدفنا هو تزويد القراء بفهم أعمق وأشمل لكيفية تأثير التكنولوجيا على حياتنا اليومية وما تحمله لنا المستقبل.** **فلنكن معًا في قلب الحدث، حيث الابتكار، الإلهام، والمعرفة. زورونا للبقاء على اطلاع بأحدث التطورات التكنولوجية التي تشكل عالمنا، وتعزيز فهمكم للتكنولوجيا الحديثة وتأثيرها على مختلف جوانب حياتنا. \\"نافذة على التكنولوجيا الحديثة\\" هي مصدرك الموثوق لاستكشاف كل ما هو جديد ومهم في الساحة التكنولوجية.** --- أتمنى أن يعجبك هذا الوصف وأن يلهمك في رحلة التدوين الخاصة بك!"},{"instruction":"TRAVAIL POUR LA REPRISE 22/4 : GROUPES : 2 ou 3 élèves maximum par groupe.

If you have a CSV file and you want to keep only the columns with the exact names \\"close\\", \\"high\\", and \\"low\\", you can use the pandas library for an efficient and straightforward way to accomplish this. First, make sure you have pandas installed in your environment. If not, you can install it using pip: \`\`\`bash pip install pandas \`\`\` Below is the Python code that reads your CSV file, keeps only the specified columns, and then saves the modified DataFrame back to a new CSV file. \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # Load the CSV file df = pd.read_csv('your_input_file.csv') # Specify the columns you want to keep columns_to_keep = ['close', 'high', 'low'] # Select only the desired columns filtered_df = df[columns_to_keep] # Save the filtered DataFrame to a new CSV file filtered_df.to_csv('your_filtered_output_file.csv', index=False) \`\`\` Make sure you replace \`'your_input_file.csv'\` with the path to your actual CSV file and \`'your_filtered_output_file.csv'\` with the desired output file path. This script does the following: - It reads your CSV file into a pandas DataFrame. - It filters the DataFrame, keeping only the columns named \\"close\\", \\"high\\", and \\"low\\". - It writes the filtered DataFrame to a new CSV file, omitting the index column for a cleaner result."},{"instruction":"also i want tho keep columns that contain \\"alo\\"","output":"To extend the previous solution to include not only columns named exactly \\"close\\", \\"high\\", and \\"low\\" but also any columns that contain the substring \\"alo\\", you can use a combination of the list comprehension and \`filter\` function alongside your existing requirement. Here’s how you can modify the previous Python code to fulfill this additional condition: \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # Load the CSV file df = pd.read_csv('your_input_file.csv') # Specify the columns you want to keep by exact name exact_columns_to_keep = ['close', 'high', 'low'] # Find additional columns that contain 'alo' columns_containing_alo = [col for col in df.columns if 'alo' in col] # Combine the lists, ensuring no duplicates columns_to_keep = list(set(exact_columns_to_keep + columns_containing_alo)) # Select only the desired columns filtered_df = df[columns_to_keep] # Save the filtered DataFrame to a new CSV file filtered_df.to_csv('your_filtered_output_file.csv', index=False) \`\`\` In this script: - \`exact_columns_to_keep\` still defines the columns to be kept by their exact name. - \`columns_containing_alo\` is generated by a list comprehension that iterates over all column names (\`df.columns\`) and selects those that contain the substring \\"alo\\". - These two lists are then combined using the \`+\` operator, and \`list(set(...))\` is used to remove any duplicates that might occur if, for example, a column is named exactly \\"close\\" and also happens to contain \\"alo\\" (which is unlikely in this specific case but is good practice for more generic use). - The script then proceeds as before, selecting only the desired columns and saving the result to a new CSV file. Remember to replace \`'your_input_file.csv'\` and \`'your_filtered_output_file.csv'\` with the actual input and desired output file paths, respectively."},{"instruction":"Плиз решите задачу по физике: Имеется электрическая плита 380В на 4 конфорки, и одна плитка 220В на 1 конфорку.

Generell kann man jedoch einige allgemeine Unterschiede zwischen den beiden Konzepten identifizieren: 1. **Anerkennung und Verbreitung**: Religionen sind in der Regel etablierte Glaubenssysteme mit einer großen Anhängerschaft und weit verbreiteter gesellschaftlicher Akzeptanz. Sekten sind dagegen oft kleinere Glaubensgruppen, die sich von etablierten Religionen abspalten oder um spezifische Lehren oder Praktiken herum bilden, die von der breiteren Gesellschaft nicht unbedingt anerkannt oder akzeptiert werden. 2. **Organisationsstruktur**: Religionen haben häufig eine formalisierte, hierarchische Struktur mit einem klaren Set von Glaubenssätzen und Praktiken. Sekten können dagegen eine losere Organisation und eine stärkere Fokussierung auf die Lehren eines einzelnen Führers oder einer kleinen Führungsgruppe haben. 3. **Lehren und Praktiken**: Während Religionen in der Regel etablierte, oft schriftlich festgehaltene Lehren und Rituale haben, können Sekten unorthodoxe oder extremere Glaubensvorstellungen und Praktiken aufweisen, die sie deutlich von den Hauptströmungen der Gesellschaft, aus der sie hervorgehen, unterscheiden. 4. **Integration in die Gesellschaft**: Viele Religionen sind eng mit der Kultur und Gesellschaft verwoben, in der sie praktiziert werden, und beeinflussen moralische Werte, Gesetzgebung und gesellschaftliche Normen. Sekten hingegen stehen oft in einem spannungsreichen Verhältnis zur Gesellschaft und können aufgrund ihrer Überzeugungen und Praktiken isoliert oder verfolgt werden. 5. **Flexibilität und Öffnung**: Religiöse Glaubenssysteme können flexibler sein und Raum für unterschiedliche Interpretationen und Praktiken innerhalb eines breiten Glaubensrahmens bieten. Sekten hingegen können striktere Glaubens- und Verhaltenscodizes haben, mit weniger Toleranz für Abweichungen von der Gruppennorm. Es ist wichtig zu betonen, dass die Begriffe „Religion“ und „Sekte“ oft wertbeladen sind und ihre Verwendung von der Perspektive des Sprechers abhängt. Was die eine Person als legitime religiöse Praxis betrachtet, mag für eine andere als sektiererisch gelten. Zudem können Gruppen, die zu einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt als Sekten angesehen werden, im Laufe der Zeit an Akzeptanz gewinnen und zu etablierten Religionen werden."},{"instruction":"hello when i run './gradlew clean build' command on my react native app with typescript i get this error : * What went wrong: Execution failed for task ':app:mergeReleaseResources'. > Multiple task action failures occurred: > A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.res.Aapt2CompileRunnable > Android resource compilation failed ERROR: /Users/mac/Desktop/poker/android/app/build/generated/res/createBundleReleaseJsAndAssets/drawable-mdpi/assets_loading.png: AAPT: error: file failed to compile. > A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.res.Aapt2CompileRunnable > Android resource compilation failed ERROR: /Users/mac/Desktop/poker/android/app/build/generated/res/createBundleReleaseJsAndAssets/drawable-mdpi/assets_welcome.png: AAPT: error: file failed to compile. > A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.res.Aapt2CompileRunnable > Android resource compilation failed ERROR: /Users/mac/Desktop/poker/android/app/build/generated/res/createBundleReleaseJsAndAssets/drawable-mdpi/assets_profile.png: AAPT: error: file failed to compile. > A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.res.Aapt2CompileRunnable > Android resource compilation failed ERROR: /Users/mac/Desktop/poker/android/app/build/generated/res/createBundleReleaseJsAndAssets/drawable-mdpi/assets_conditionsback.png: AAPT: error: file failed to compile. > A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.res.Aapt2CompileRunnable > Android resource compilation failed ERROR: /Users/mac/Desktop/poker/android/app/build/generated/res/createBundleReleaseJsAndAssets/drawable-mdpi/assets_home.png: AAPT: error: file failed to compile. > A failure occurred while executing com.android.build.gradle.internal.res.Aapt2CompileRunnable > Android resource compilation failed ERROR: /Users/mac/Desktop/poker/android/app/build/generated/res/createBundleReleaseJsAndAssets/drawable-mdpi/assets_secondstep.png: AAPT: error: file failed to compile.","output":"The error messages you're seeing during your React Native app build process indicate that certain image assets are failing to compile with AAPT (Android Asset Packaging Tool). This typically happens due to issues with the image files themselves. Here are some steps and considerations to resolve these errors: # Review Image Files 1. **Format and Compatibility:** Ensure that the images (\`assets_loading.png\`, \`assets_welcome.png\`, etc.) are in a compatible format, typically PNG or JPG. While PNG is more common for Android, both are supported. If they're in another format, consider converting them. 2. **Corruption:** Check if the image files are corrupted. Try opening them in an image viewer or editor to verify they're intact. 3. **Naming:** Ensure the names of the files do not contain any spaces or special characters other than underscores (\`_\`). Although your filenames look correct, this is a common pitfall. 4. **Resolution and DPI:** Verify the images are appropriate for the \`drawable-mdpi\` folder, meaning they are scaled correctly for medium DPI screens. If you've mistakenly placed higher resolution images in the \`mdpi\` folder, it could potentially cause issues. # Fixing the Build - **Clean Project:** Before attempting the build again, make sure to clean your project to remove any potentially corrupted build intermediates that might be causing the issue. You can do this with \`./gradlew clean\` in your terminal. - **Re-Add Images:** After ensuring the images are correct as per the above checks, try removing them from the project and then adding them back again. This sometimes helps clear any indexing or caching issues. - **Convert Images:** If the images are not in PNG or JPG format, convert them to one of these two formats using an image editor or a conversion tool. - **Check Image Paths in Code:** Ensure the paths referenced in your code match the actual locations and names of the image files. # Further Debugging Steps - **Build with More Information:** Use the \`--stacktrace\` or \`--info\` flag when running your build command to get more detailed error information which might help pinpoint the issue. Example: \`./gradlew clean build --stacktrace\`. - **Update Gradle and Android Tools:** Sometimes, issues like this can be resolved by updating to the latest versions of Gradle, the Android Gradle Plugin, and your project's dependencies in your \`build.gradle\` files. - **Try Building a Different Variant:** As a troubleshooting step, try building a different build variant, such as a debug build (\`./gradlew assembleDebug\`) to see if the issue persists across different build types. If after these steps you're still facing issues, consider reaching out on forums specific to React Native or Android development with detailed information about what you've tried, the exact error logs, and details about your development environment (versions of React Native, Gradle, Android SDK, etc.). Sometimes, community or more specific advice can pinpoint something overlooked."},{"instruction":"What is the simplest, most elegant way of getting Python 3.10 to return current date in dd-mm-yyyy format?","output":"The simplest and most elegant way to get the current date in the \`dd-mm-yyyy\` format in Python 3.10 is by using the \`datetime\` module.

If \`output.csv\` does not exist, it will be created; if it does exist, it will be overwritten. - The \`newline=''\` parameter in the \`open\` function is important to prevent blank lines from being written in Windows environments. - \`writer.writerow(['Header'])\` writes a single row with one column named 'Header'. You can comment this out or remove it if your CSV doesn't need a header. - In the loop, each item of the \`my_list\` is written to a new row in the CSV file. By passing the item in a list \`writer.writerow([item])\`, you are creating a single-column row for each item.

This involves reading the existing file (if it exists) to understand its current structure, and then writing back to it with your new data added as a column.

Here is an implementation: \`\`\`python import csv import os # Your data to add as a new column new_column = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3', 'item4'] header = 'NewHeader' # Header for the new column # The path to your CSV file file_path = 'output.csv' # Prepare to hold existing data existing_data = [] # Check if the file exists.

If it does, it reads the current content into a list of lists (where each sublist is a row). It then appends the new column of data (\`new_column\`) to the existing structure, adjusting for any discrepancies in row counts between the existing content and the new column. Finally, it writes this updated structure back to the CSV file, effectively adding your new data as a new column each time the script runs."},{"instruction":"Reinhardt is a 23 Years old boy, very solitary.

Give me code, please, do not use javax.json","output":"Decoding a JSON string to a Java object without using any external libraries (like Gson or Jackson) requires manually parsing the JSON string. However, doing this for complex JSON structures can become very cumbersome and error-prone. Nonetheless, if you have a simple JSON structure, you can do it by utilizing the \`org.json\` package which is considered an internal part of JDK in some versions, otherwise you might still consider it as an external dependency. Given your restriction, let's consider we do not use \`org.json\` or any similar package. Instead, we'll rely purely on standard Java classes. Note that the following approach is highly simplified and its practicality decreases as the complexity of your JSON increases. Assume you have the following simple JSON string representing a user object: \`\`\`json { \\"name\\": \\"John Doe\\", \\"age\\": 30 } \`\`\` And you want to decode this into a Java object \`User\`. First, define your \`User\` class: \`\`\`java public class User { private String name; private int age; // Constructor public User() {} // Getters and Setters public String getName() { return name; } public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; } public int getAge() { return age; } public void setAge(int age) { this.age = age; } } \`\`\` Then, you can write a method to manually parse this JSON string: \`\`\`java public class JsonDecoder { public static User decodeUser(String json) { User user = new User(); json = json.trim(); // Trim the string to remove leading and trailing whitespaces // Assuming the JSON structure is exactly as specified above // This is very naive and just for demonstration json = json.substring(1, json.length() - 1); // Remove the curly braces String[] keyValuePairs = json.split(\\",\\"); // Split the string into key-value pairs for (String pair : keyValuePairs) { String[] entry = pair.split(\\":\\"); String key = entry[0].trim().replace(\\"\\"\\", \\"\\"); // Remove quotes and whitespaces String value = entry[1].trim().replace(\\"\\"\\", \\"\\"); // Assume all values are strings // Assign values based on keys if (\\"name\\".equals(key)) { user.setName(value); } else if (\\"age\\".equals(key)) { // Assuming age is an integer user.setAge(Integer.parseInt(value)); } } return user; } public static void main(String[] args) { String jsonString = \\"{\\"name\\": \\"John Doe\\", \\"age\\": 30}\\"; User user = decodeUser(jsonString); System.out.println(\\"Name: \\" + user.getName() + \\", Age: \\" + user.getAge()); } } \`\`\` This example shows how to parse a very simple JSON string. However, for complex JSON structures that involve nested objects, arrays, etc., manual parsing like this is not practical. In such cases, it's highly recommended to use libraries like Jackson or Gson, which can simplify the process significantly and are robust to handle various edge cases, such as escaping characters, nulls, and different data types, efficiently and securely."},{"instruction":"Reinhardt is a 23 Years old boy, very solitary.

And you, being half one of them, it's no wonder you'd betray us.\\" Elara signaled Markus to hold, her gaze still locked on Reinhardt. \\"You were our brother in arms, Reinhardt. We shared secrets, dreams... How could we have been so blind? Your... abilities. That scar. It all makes sense now.\\" Reinhardt touched the turtleneck that concealed his scar, a silent reminder of his origins and the mystery that even he couldn't unravel. \\"Yes, I was born from a Phoenix mother and a human father, and I possess abilities that I didn't choose. But does that make me your enemy? My heart, my soul, they're as human as yours.\\" Another former comrade, Lena, her eyes filled with tears, stepped forward. \\"But how can we trust you now? You've kept so much from us. How do we know you won't turn against us, or worse, lead the Phoenixes to annihilate what we've worked so hard to protect?\\" Reinhardt's eyes, now glowing red, showcased his unique ability as he looked at each of his former friends. \\"I can see the fear, the uncertainty in your hearts. But I also see the hope, the desire for a world where we don't have to fight, where children can grow without fear of the sky burning down upon them. I know about your plans, your strategies, not because I wish to betray you, but because there's a path to victory for all, not just one side.\\" Elara took a step back, her expression softening. \\"And what would you have us do, Reinhardt? How can we possibly trust in this... vision of yours?\\" Reinhardt lowered his gaze, the red fading from his eyes. \\"Let me show you. Let me prove that there's a way. Not through endless killing, but through understanding and negotiation. My mother was not just a Phoenix; she was also a creature of immense wisdom and compassion. I believe we can find a way, together.\\" The air was tense, a moment stretched out as The Celestial Army members exchanged uneasy glances. Finally, Elara nodded, a silent agreement to hear him out, but her voice was firm, a hint of warning laced within. \\"This is your only chance, Reinhardt. Any sign of betrayal, and we won't hesitate. For now, you walk a very thin line.\\" Reinhardt nodded, understanding the gravity of the situation. \\"Thank you. This is all I ask. A chance to prove that peace is not just a distant dream, but a possible reality.\\" As the sun rose higher, casting light over the ruins, a fragile hope began to take root among The Celestial Army. Reinhardt, standing at the crossroads of his heritage and his beliefs, knew the path ahead would be fraught with challenges. But for the first time in a long time, he felt he was not walking it alone."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

the world of Chamomile Valley Everyone was minding their own business and going on with their days when a sudden rumble took place The world shook as everyone looked around for the possible cause of it In one area, Krash the Rabbit was going on with his daily shenanigans with his best friend, Chiko the Hedgehog, when they noticed the ground shaking They both looked around confused, wondering what was going on, when suddenly, black ooze covered in glitches appeared and slowly moved towards the two Krash, being naïve and curious, went to get a closer look, when he accidentally touched it and the effects started to happen Krash suddenly screamed and tried to escape, but he was sucked in and turned into a lifeless glitched creature He slowly went towards Chiko, but he panicked and ran away towards the nearest source of help Chiko ran until he spotted his other friend, Wally the Ram, sitting outside and writing his poems Chiko approached him and tried to explain what happened, but it only left Wally confused Then, Chiko turned to see Krash quickly heading towards them, so he quickly grabs Wally and runs towards his home They make it to the front door, but before they could head inside, Krash pounces on Wally and passes the corruption onto him They then surround Chiko as they slowly close in on him Meanwhile, more of the glitchy ooze appear in the land and it slowly makes its way towards the rest of the characters Just a small distance away sat the home of Barry the Bear, where he was working on his garden like every other day The ground shook again for a bit and it got Barry concerned Then, his best friend, Dokko the Moose, walked by and greeted the bear, before raising the question of the strange “mini earthquakes” Barry told him that he noticed them but wasn’t sure on what was causing them Dokko started theorizing on what it could be based on some research he did earlier in the day when they first started, and went on about certain things that Barry barely understood due to the big words Dokko used Suddenly, Dokko gets cut off with the distant sound of Chiko screaming in fear The two looked towards where it came from and waited for something to happen, most possibly an explosion from what it’s typically But when nothing happened and Dokko was about to continue his explanation, the corrupted ooze appeared and caught Barry’s eye He froze in his tracks and stared at the ooze until Dokko took notice and turned around Krash the the other two chased them, as the world got covered in more corrupted ooze The sky was turning dark and the earth began to shake more Barry was still rushing through the land, looking for a place to hide, when he suddenly trips and falls, dropping Dokko and his shovel Dokko crashed onto the ground and quickly got up to help his friend out Barry gets up and dusts himself off, but Krash and co quickly caught up to them The two panic and try to figure out a way to escape when a portal opens in-front of them Krash and co both get distracted by it, giving Dokko and Barry a chance on hiding behind a nearby tree, and out comes a different character that they never seen before She was blue, had long purple hair, and an eyepatch She held a sword and fended off the corrupted trio Dokko and Barry watched from behind the tree as she fought them off, confused on what was going on She suddenly spoke to them and told them to quickly get away to a safe spot while she fought the corrupted characters off They obeyed and quickly ran off The two ran for a while and stopped near a forest to catch their breath Suddenly, the blue character ran to them and quickly asked if they were ok Dokko replied first and then asked what was going on She looked back towards where she came from and quickly explained that, from what she gathered, some form of corruption was affecting cartoons and that she had been fighting them off ever since it started The two glanced at each-other concerned She then introduced herself and talked about where she came from before the corruption happened before going quiet Dokko noticed and nervously asked if that was the reason for her eyepatch She nodded and sighs Barry noticed that she was covered in a red liquid and asked what it was Pibby froze and nervously told him that it’s best he didn’t know The ground suddenly shook again and Pibby quickly looked towards the horizon A wave of ooze was slowly approaching them, so she told them that they had to leave immediately Before she could open a portal to escape the world, Krash lunges in- front of them and nearly hits Pibby Dokko and Barry both jump back and Pibby quickly tells them to run The three ran as Krash crawls after them, his leg being injured earlier from a stab wound They make their way into the forest and ran in various directions to shake him off Soon they hid behind a tree and Pibby quietly peeks to check if they lost Krash Dokko and Barry catch their breath and sit by a tree to wait things out After a few minutes of waiting, Pibby declared that they were safe, but she told them that because of the land’s current state, they couldn’t hide out here any longer, reminding the two about her earlier statement about leaving the valley to a safer place Barry quickly asked about the others and if they could go grab them before leaving Dokko was about to reply to his question when Pibby replied to him first She calmly told him in the nicest way possible that as much as she wanted to go back and gather other possible survivors, she didn’t want to risk running into any more of those corrupted monsters, and as much as she hated to say or think this, it’s possible it’s already too late to save the others now Barry understood and took off his hat in respect of his fallen friends, Dokko comforting him as well Pibby sighed and peeked one last time to ensure they were clear to leave the Riki universe She turned and opened a portal to travel to a safe place for the two to hide They watched in awe before Pibby turned to them and signaled them to step through Dokko and Barry glance at each other and stick close as they walk through the portal, Pibby following behind them, taking one final glance at the world The dark substance continue to eat up everything in the land and she could see glimpses of the corrupted creatures looking around for anyone Pibby sighed and turned towards the portal, she steps inside and disappears through the portal The portal then closes shortly after End. This is where my continuation starts In a sudden turn of events that none of them could have anticipated, the darkness of the glitch had finally been defeated. The world seemed brighter, safer, yet the remnants of chaos lingered in the air, a reminder of the battles fought and the friends lost. As the last of the corrupted ooze receded like a nightmare at dawn, a new ruckus stirred on the horizon. It was Phineas, Ferb, and their gang of inventive friends, closely pursued by a frenzied Norm Bot. Their energy was infectious, their spirits undampened by the sight of the world they stumbled into—a world still healing from its own kind of apocalypse. “Guys, what is that thing, and why does it look so… terminally uncool?” Phineas blurted out, momentarily distracting the Norm Bot with his unyielding curiosity. Ferb, ever the man of few words, adjusted his goggles and surveyed the surroundings, noting the peculiar signs of battle and the remaining glitches fading into nonexistence. Perry the Platypus, in his secret agent persona, sprung into action, tangling the Norm Bot in a swift and comedic battle, showcasing moves that drew bewildered looks from Dokko and Barry, who had just stepped out from their shelter, intrigued by the sudden noise. “Who are you people, and how did you get here?” Barry inquired, his protective instinct over the land, and his newfound friends, kicking in. “We’re from the Tri-State Area! Well, another dimension of it, technically speaking,” Phineas explained with a grin, extending his hand in friendship. “I’m Phineas, this is my brother Ferb, and that’s Perry… our pet platypus.” “And,” Isabella chimed in, stepping forward with a friendly wave, “we’re kind of on a mission to stop our inventions from causing any more chaos. That Norm Bot is part of the problem.” Before any more could be said, Pibby emerged from the shadows, her presence commanding yet comforting. She had been watching from a distance, ensuring the safety of her new allies. Her eyes fell on the visitors, recognizing the similar thread of determination that she herself carried. “You’re fighting corruption, too?” she asked, her voice a blend of hope and fatigue. Phineas nodded eagerly. “Yeah! And we could definitely use someone with your experience. What happened here?” Pibby and her companions shared their tale of struggle and sacrifice, of worlds colliding and the fight to protect their existence from an unseen enemy. The story resonated with Phineas and Ferb, who had always believed in the extraordinary. In the spirit of unity and shared goals, the two groups decided to join forces. Perry finally managed to deactivate the Norm Bot with a well-placed kick, setting a precedent for cooperation. Together, they worked on repairing the damages, using Phineas and Ferb’s inventive prowess combined with Pibby, Dokko, and Barry’s knowledge of their world. They constructed devices to clear the last of the glitches, restore peace to the land, and ensure no more portals would accidentally unleash chaos. As the day turned to night, they celebrated their victory with a feast, the air filled with laughter and stories of adventures spanning dimensions. The integration of their worlds brought new perspectives, new friendships, and a renewed sense of hope. In the end, Phineas and Ferb prepared to return to their dimension, with promises to keep in touch and continue supporting each other across the multiverse. As they stepped through the portal back to their own world, a sense of accomplishment lingered in the air. Pibby, Dokko, and Barry watched them go, aware that their world was forever changed, not just by the glitch but by the bonds formed in the face of adversity. They turned back to their home, ready to rebuild and protect it, inspired by the knowledge that they were not alone in their fight. And as the stars twinkled above, a silent agreement was made among them—no matter what challenges lay ahead, they would face them together, drawing strength from the unity that had saved their worlds. Write a story where after Pibby leaves, they look at an old photo album and tear up at one of Krash and Chiko","output":"After the portal closed and the last echoes of Phineas and Ferb's departure faded away, the land was quiet, almost serene in its newfound peace. The world of Chamomile Valley, though scarred by the events that had unfolded, began to show signs of healing. Flowers that had wilted and died under the oppression of the glitch slowly started to blossom again, and the birds returned, their songs filling the air with a melody of hope. Pibby, Dokko, and Barry had spent the following days helping the land and its inhabitants recover, weaving together the torn fabric of their reality with every act of kindness and courage. The once looming threat of the glitch now seemed a distant nightmare, talked about in hushed tones as they gathered around the fire, sharing stories and dreams for a reborn future. One evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky with shades of pink and orange, they found themselves in Barry's house. It was a cozy little cabin, filled with memorabilia from adventures past and simple joys. As Dokko and Pibby helped Barry clean up, Pibby stumbled upon an old photo album tucked away on a dusty shelf. Curious and unknowing of the emotional journey she was about to embark on, Pibby pulled the album from its resting place and opened it on the coffee table where Dokko and Barry were sitting, sharing a pot of freshly brewed tea. The first few pages were filled with photos of happier times in Chamomile Valley. Pictures of Krash and Chiko—laughing, playing, and causing harmless mayhem—were splashed across the pages, a stark reminder of the friendships that once flourished. Barry's eyes grew misty as he turned each page, a soft smile playing on his lips, tempered by a poignant sadness. Dokko put a comforting arm around him, knowing all too well the grief of losing friends, of seeing them turned into something unrecognizable by the glitch. \\"There they are,\\" Barry whispered, pointing at a photo of Krash and Chiko. It was taken on a bright summer day, the sun shining down on their faces, frozen in time in a fit of laughter. Chiko was mid-air, caught in the act of springing a surprise on Krash, who looked blissfully unaware of the impending jest. Tears welled up in Barry's eyes as he touched the photo gently, tracing the outlines of his friends' faces. \\"I miss them,\\" he confessed, his voice cracking with emotion. \\"We all shared so many beautiful moments, and now... it feels like we're worlds apart.\\" Dokko nodded, squeezing Barry's shoulder tighter. \\"But we'll keep them in our hearts, Barry. They may be gone, but they left us with memories that no glitch can take away. We honor them by living, by rebuilding and protecting our world.\\" Pibby, who had been quietly observing, felt a lump in her throat. She hadn't known Krash and Chiko, but seeing the love and loss reflected in her new friends' eyes, she understood the depth of their pain. \\"They'll always be a part of Chamomile Valley,\\" she said softly. \\"And part of us, too. We'll make sure of that.\\" The three of them sat in silence for a moment, lost in memories and the emotions they evoked. It was a shared grief, but also a shared resolve to move forward, to heal and rebuild—not just their land, but their hearts as well. As the night grew darker, they closed the album and stood, looking out of the window at the starlit sky, a visual promise that life goes on, resilient and beautiful. Together, they made a silent vow to remember, to cherish the past, but also to embrace the future, whatever it may hold, with open hearts and a spirit of undying hope."},{"instruction":"Write a follow up where they ask if there's a way to revive all of them","output":"In the days following their solemn remembrance, the question of revival lingered in the air, unspoken yet palpable as the morning mist. The once purely rhetorical \\"What if?\\" slowly morphed into a pressing inquiry, a beacon of potential amidst the sea of loss. The trio—Pibby, Dokko, and Barry—sat around the fire one crisp evening, the glow of the flames casting shadows that danced like the memories in their hearts. It was Pibby who broke the silence, her voice edged with a mix of hope and hesitation. \\"Do you think... Is there a way we could bring them back? Maybe there's something we haven't tried yet.\\" Dokko looked at her, his brows furrowed in thought. The idea had crossed his mind, but the reality of their situation, the laws of their world, always brought a sobering dose of doubt. \\"I've wondered that too,\\" he admitted, \\"but we've seen what the glitch does. It's not just about returning to a physical form. It's about restoring their essence, their consciousness. How do we bring back who they were, not just what they looked like?\\" Barry, ever the optimist, chimed in, his eyes reflecting the flames' fervor. \\"But think about all we've managed to achieve already. If we could defeat the glitch, if we could restore Chamomile Valley to what it is now, then why not them? Maybe there's knowledge out there, a science or magic we haven't discovered.\\" Encouraged by Barry's optimism, they decided to reach out for help. They leveraged Pibby's connections across other realities, her journeys having introduced her to a myriad of characters, scholars, and beings of unimaginable power. Their quest led them to a secluded realm, one untouched by the chaos that had ravaged their own world. Here, they were introduced to an ancient figure, a guardian of the universal balance known only as The Weaver. The Weaver listened to their plea, their voices trembling with the weight of their hope. \\"The fabric of existence is delicate,\\" The Weaver began, their voice echoing like the wind through the leaves. \\"To revive those lost to the glitch is to reweave threads torn asunder. It is possible, but the consequences are unpredictable. Life returned in such a manner may not be life as you remember it.\\" Determined to proceed, despite the warnings, the trio asked what was required. \\"A balance must be struck,\\" The Weaver explained. \\"To return what was taken, something of equal value must be offered. The essence of life for life. Memories, experiences, the very essence of what makes each of you unique. Are you willing to part with a piece of yourselves to restore those you've lost?\\" The question hung heavily in the air, a tangible weight upon their hearts. They retreated to a quiet glade to deliberate, understanding the gravity of the decision before them. It was a choice between holding onto their complete selves or surrendering a part of their being to resurrect their friends. After a night of introspection under the stars, they returned to The Weaver with their decision. United in their resolve, they agreed to the terms, ready to sacrifice a part of their own essence for the chance to restore their fallen friends. The ritual was complex and otherworldly, a symphony of light, shadow, and energy that twisted around them in an ethereal dance. The Weaver's powers guided the process, channeling the essence of Pibby, Dokko, and Barry into the remnants of their friends' corrupted forms. As the ritual concluded, the first light of dawn touched the horizon, casting a gentle glow over the land. There, in the soft morning light, Krash, Chiko, and the others stirred, breathing deeply as if waking from a long, troubled sleep. The reunion was bittersweet, filled with tears of joy and the pain of sacrifice. Pibby, Dokko, and Barry felt the loss of the memories and experiences they had offered up, gaps in their being that would never be filled. Yet, seeing their friends alive, witnessing the valley revived and bustling with the laughter and joy of its inhabitants, they knew it was worth it. In the days that followed, the story of their sacrifice spread across the lands, a tale of love, loss, and the unity that brought rebirth to Chamomile Valley. And as they worked to rebuild their world, the gaps in their memories were slowly overlaid with new moments, new memories forged in the light of their unbreakable bond. The revival wasn't without its quirks, for those brought back carried with them an echo of the glitch, a reminder of their journey back from the void. But they lived, they loved, and they contributed to the tapestry of their world in ways they had never imagined. For Pibby, Dokko, and Barry, the choice had forever altered the course of their existence, binding them to their world and its inhabitants with threads stronger than fate itself. They had faced the unknown, braved the depths of loss, and emerged with a deeper understanding of the true meaning of sacrifice. And in the end, they found that some things, some bonds, are worth every piece of ourselves we have to give."},{"instruction":"Do you like my merge of a pre-existing fanfiction, AT2D and my own parts","output":"I'm an AI model developed by OpenAI, so I don't have personal opinions or feelings, but I can provide insights and feedback!

The cool air did little to calm the storm that raged within him. Memories of camaraderie, of battles fought side by side with those he once called friends, lay shattered at his feet. The Celestial Army, his former companions, had turned their backs on him, their blades now drawn with a singular purpose—to extinguish his life, the life of one born of both human and Phoenix blood. Across the dusty floor, the members of The Celestial Army stood in a line, their faces a mix of determination and regret. At their forefront was Julia, a woman of strong conviction and Reinhardt’s closest confidante during his time with them. “Reinhardt,” Julia’s voice broke the silence, strong yet carrying a hint of sorrow. “You know why we’re here. We cannot allow your existence to continue. The laws of The Celestial Army are clear—” Reinhardt cut her off, his voice calm but laced with a cold edge. “Laws that speak of eradication based on birthright. Laws that now seek to destroy me because of my heritage. Tell me, Julia, when did we stray so far from the ideals we once fought for?” Julia clenched her fists, the weight of her next words heavy on her heart. “The world has changed, Reinhardt. Your powers, your...nature, it’s a threat to the very fabric of what we’re trying to protect. Humans and Phoenixes can’t coexist. Your mere existence—” “A threat?” Reinhardt interjected, a bitter laugh escaping him. “Because I was born different? Because I refuse to wield my abilities to dominate or to destroy indiscriminately? You know better than anyone the control I’ve maintained, the sacrifices I’ve made.” Another member stepped forward, his weapon drawn. “Words won’t change the danger you pose, Reinhardt. It’s better to end this now, for the greater good.” Reinhardt’s gaze swept across the faces before him, each one a reminder of the betrayal he felt. “The greater good... Is that what you call it? To turn against your own based on fear and prejudice?” He took a step forward, his presence commanding despite the odds. “I’ve learned things, seen truths far beyond the narrow path The Celestial Army walks. You seek to protect humanity, yet you fail to embrace the very essence of what it means to be human—compassion, understanding, and the willingness to see beyond our differences.” Julia wavered, her resolve flickering like a candle in the wind. “Reinhardt, please...” “No,” he said, his red eyes beginning to glow faintly, a testament to the infinite knowledge he possessed. “It’s clear the path you’ve chosen. But know this—if it is your wish to come after me, after all I’ve been to you, all I’ve done to protect those unable to protect themselves, then you’ll find I’m not the easy target you perceive me to be.” As the Celestial Army members readied themselves, Reinhardt’s figure blurred, becoming an embodiment of fire and ash, his abilities manifesting not as a threat, but as a declaration of his unwillingness to succumb to their misguided judgment. “This is not the end,” he said, his voice echoing through the warehouse as his form began to dissolve into the morning light. “But remember, I will always stand for what is just, even if I must stand alone.” And with that, Reinhardt vanished, leaving a stunned silence in his wake. The Celestial Army stood motionless, the seeds of doubt planted in their hearts by the words of a man who was more than the sum of his origins—a man who, despite everything, still hoped for a world where understanding could bridge the gap between fear and acceptance."},{"instruction":"Reinhardt is a 23 Years old boy, very solitary.

Reinhardt's posture was relaxed, yet alert, his brown eyes scanning the group he once considered allies, now foes. \\"Reinhardt,\\" began Cassandra, the de facto leader of the group, her voice laced with a false tenderness. \\"You've always been a mystery to us, but we never imagined... never thought you'd betray humanity itself.\\" Betrayal stung Reinhardt like a fresh burn, but his face remained impassive. \\"Betray? Cassandra, I've never betrayed anyone. I've fought alongside you, risked my life—\\" \\"Enough!\\" Marcus interrupted, his voice harsh. \\"Save your breath. We know about your heritage, your... monstrosity. How could you hide your Phoenix blood from us?\\" Reinhardt's eyes flashed a dangerous crimson, a silent testament to his rising anger, yet he swiftly regained control. His voice remained calm, \\"Because I knew this would happen. I am not my heritage. Haven't my actions proven where my loyalties lie? Or does blood define me in your eyes?\\" Silvia, once a close friend, stepped forward, her gaze averted. \\"Reinhardt, it's not just about your blood. You possess powers that could end humanity or save it, and we feared—\\" \\"Fear?\\" Reinhardt cut her off, a bitter laugh escaping his lips. \\"You fear me for what I might do, based on what? Stories? Prejudices? I have fought for humanity, for our cause, more fiercely than any of you, because I believe in our mission. Not once have I used my abilities against it.\\" Cassandra shook her head, the decision in her eyes firm. \\"It's too late for words, Reinhardt. We can't risk it. The Celestial Army has no place for... for an entity like you.\\" Reinhardt's gaze swept over them, his heart heavy. \\"An entity, is it?\\" His voice was soft, tinged with sorrow. \\"I saved your lives more times than I can count. Remember the warehouse fire? The ambush at Red Cliff? Who do you think turned the tide in our favor? But you're right—it's too late for words.\\" He took a step back, his posture defensive yet open, a silent challenge. \\"I won't fight you, but I won't let you kill me either. I thought I found a family among you, but I was wrong.\\" Marcus clenched his fist, taking a step forward, but Cassandra held out an arm to stop him. \\"Let him go,\\" she said, her voice cold. \\"He's not worth it. Our mission is bigger than one traitor. But Reinhardt, know this: The moment you turn against humanity, The Celestial Army will be there to end you.\\" Reinhardt's red eyes dimmed back to their usual brown, his expression now one of resigned sadness. \\"And here I thought choosing family was choosing humanity. It seems I was wrong on both counts.\\" Without another word, he turned and walked into the shadows, leaving behind the group he once considered allies, now nothing more than strangers bound by a cause he could no longer call his own. The divide was clear, and the path ahead lonelier than ever."},{"instruction":"itinayla dert dinlenir,yüz güldürülür,dahi anlamında de ayrı yazılır,boş muhabbet edilir Şarkı dizi film önerilir öneri alınır muhabbeti edilir itiraf alınır sır saklanır can sıkıntısı giderilir link istemek gereksiz ama merakımı giderecek şekilde sizi görmek güzel bir fikir olabilir Bunları düzenler misin?","output":"Tabii, önerdiğin metni daha düzenli ve anlaşılır bir hale getirelim: - Dert dinlenir, yüzler güldürülür. \\"Dahi\\" anlamında \\"de\\" ayrı yazılır.

Assuming you have your test set (\`X_test_scaled\`, \`Y_test_scaled\`) and dev set (\`X_dev_scaled\`, \`Y_dev_scaled\`) ready, you can use the best model obtained through GridSearchCV to make predictions on these sets and then calculate the MAE.

If they contain multiple outputs per instance (as suggested by your use of \`MultiOutputRegressor\`), the \`mean_absolute_error\` function will compute the MAE for each output and then average them, giving you an overall MAE across all outputs. Remember to scale the test and dev sets in the same manner as your training data (using the same scaling object that was fit on the training data) to ensure the predictions are made in the correctly scaled feature space. If your training data was scaled but these instructions are not followed for the test or dev data, the performance metrics you calculate might not accurately represent your model's performance."},{"instruction":"What does this mean? \\"IND little/small/tiny/minute VERB pain/yearn/long\\"","output":"The phrase you've provided appears to be a structured or formulaic way of expressing a sentence or idea, using variable words (indicated by slashes) that can be mixed and matched to create slightly different nuances or meanings within a broadly similar context. Here's a breakdown: - \\"**IND**\\" is likely an abbreviation for \\"Indicates\\" or \\"Indicator,\\" suggesting the start of a phrase that functions to point out or describe something. - **\\"little/small/tiny/minute\\"** are adjectives that are interchangeable in this structure, chosen based on the intensity or specificity of what is being described. They all relate to something being of a small size or amount, with \\"minute\\" often implying the smallest measure among these options. - **\\"VERB\\"** signifies that a verb will fit into this space, providing action or state of being to the sentence. The choice of verb changes the nature of what is being indicated. - **\\"pain/yearn/long\\"** are nouns or verbs (depending on the structure and verb chosen) that describe a form of emotion or physical sensation. \\"Pain\\" would typically be used as a noun to describe discomfort, while \\"yearn\\" and \\"long\\" are verbs that describe a deep desire or longing for something. An example sentence, picking one option from each slash-separated list, could be: \\"I little yearn for peace\\" or \\"She tiny pains over the loss.\\" However, these constructions are somewhat nonstandard and may not clearly convey the intended meaning. It seems like there might be a misinterpretation of how to structure a sentence or this is part of a coding or shorthand for creating sentences with similar structures but different specifics. Normally, in standard English, you might see phrases like \\"I feel a tiny pain,\\" or \\"I yearn deeply for,\\" where the structure is more clearly aligned with common grammatical rules. To use the elements provided in a coherent and grammatically correct way, you could construct sentences like: - \\"I feel a minute pain in my hand.\\" - \\"She yearns for her distant home.\\" - \\"They long for just a small sign of hope.\\" Each of these sentences takes the adjectives and verbs provided to construct a meaningful statement that is clear and correctly structured according to standard English grammar."},{"instruction":"методы воспитания в педагогике","output":"1.

In a world where the mystical intertwines with the mundane, there lies a story of a boy who is the embodiment of both. Our tale begins in the bustling streets of a city that never sleeps, its corners filled with whispers of magic and the unknown. Amongst its inhabitants walks Reinhardt, a 23-year-old enigma draped in a red jacket with white fur, his attire a stark contrast to his gentle soul. Reinhardt, though often misjudged by his appearance, carries within him a heritage unlike any other. Born from an extraordinary union between a human and a phoenix, he navigates the complexities of both worlds, concealing powers that tie him to ancient mysteries and the phenomena of life and death itself. His most noticeable feature, aside from the striking attire, is a scar that adorns his neck, veiled only by the black turtleneck he wears. The origins of this mark are shrouded in secrecy, a reminder of a bond forged in flames and the mysteries that still envelop his birth. Despite his solitude, Reinhardt's journey is one of discovery and destiny. His abilities are vast and awe-inspiring: from regeneration, a testament to his phoenix lineage, to fire and ash manipulation, each flare and spark dances at his command. But there is more to him than meets the eye. With eyes that gleam red, he unlocks infinite knowledge, a gift that allows him to understand the essence of all things, from the most complex artifacts to the hidden truths of those he encounters. However, with great power comes a great burden. Reinhardt walks a tightrope between two realms, belonging fully to neither. His life is a puzzle, with each piece revealing more about the world's wonders and horrors, pushing him toward a destiny that could alter the balance between human and mythical realms. As his story unfolds, we follow Reinhardt through trials and tribulations, through moments of despair and flashes of joy. Through friendships forged in fire and challenges that test his heart and will, he seeks to uncover the truth behind his birth, his scar, and ultimately, his purpose. But secrets are like shadows, always lurking, always hidden. And for Reinhardt, the path to self-discovery is fraught with dangers, both worldly and otherworldly. Yet, in his heart burns the indomitable spirit of the phoenix, ready to rise from the ashes, reborn anew. This is the story of Reinhardt, a boy caught between worlds, destined for greatness, and forced to confront the mysteries of his past to forge a future of his own making. A story of resilience, of fire reborn, and the journey to become more than the sum of one's parts. Join Reinhardt as he steps into the unknown, where every discovery and battle brings him closer to the truth, and where the line between legend and reality blurs. Welcome to **Phoenix Reborn: Reinhardt's Odyssey** — a tale of magic, mystery, and the unbreakable will of the human spirit."},{"instruction":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <script type=“text/javascript” src=“https://cdn.scaledrone.com/scaledrone.min.js”><\/script> <meta charset=“UTF-8” /> <title>Multiplayer chat server</title> <style> .members-count,","output":".members-list { font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px; } .chat-messages { height: 300px; overflow-y: scroll; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; } .chat-input { width: 100%; padding: 5px; } .button { background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 10px 20px; text-align: center; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block; font-size: 16px; margin: 4px 2px; cursor: pointer; } .button:hover { background-color: #45a049; } </style> </head> <body> <div class=“members-count”>Members online: <span id=“members-count”></span></div> <div class=“members-list”>Members:</div> <div class=“chat-messages” id=“chat-messages”></div> <input type=“text” class=“chat-input” placeholder=“Type your message…” id=“chat-input” /> <button class=“button” id=“send-button”>Send</button> <script> const drone = new ScaleDrone('YOUR_CHANNEL_ID_HERE'); const roomName = 'observable-room'; const room = drone.subscribe(roomName); drone.on('open', error => { if (error) { return console.error(error); } console.log('Successfully connected to Scaledrone'); }); room.on('open', error => { if (error) { return console.error(error); } console.log('Successfully joined room'); }); room.on('members', members => { document.getElementById('members-count').textContent = members.length; const membersList = members.map(member => member.clientData.name); document.querySelector('.members-list').innerHTML = membersList.join(', '); }); room.on('data', (text, member) => { const message = \`{member.clientData.name}: {text}\`; addMessage(message); }); function addMessage(message) { const div = document.createElement('div'); div.textContent = message; document.getElementById('chat-messages').appendChild(div); } document.getElementById('send-button').addEventListener('click', () => { const input = document.getElementById('chat-input'); const message = input.value; if (message) { room.publish({ message }); input.value = ''; } }); <\/script> </body> </html>"},{"instruction":"GIVE THIS PROGRAME LIKE A TEMPLATE (TABLE)\\" # Weekly Planning Table | Week | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday | |------|-----------------|------------------------|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------| | 1 | Technique | Strength & Condition | Sparring | Rest/Active Recovery | Speed & Reflexes | Endurance & Cardio | Review & Meditation | | 2 | Advanced Drills | Strength & Plyometrics | Advanced Sparring | Rest/Active Recovery | Agility & Reflexes | Extended Endurance | Rest & Mental Training | | 3 | Intensive Drills| High-Intensity Training| Intensive Sparring | Rest/Active Recovery | High-Speed Agility | Cardio Peak | Technique Review & Strategies | | 4 | Speed Tactics | Tactical Sparring | Mental Training| Strategy & Light Activity | Mental Prep | Rest | Rest & Mental Focus | # Monthly Planning Table | Week & Focus | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday | |-------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------------------| | Week 1:<br>Foundation & Technique | Warm-up, Poomsae | Circuit training | Sparring drills | Active Recovery | Speed drills | Cardio drills | Review, Meditation | | Week 2:<br>Intensity Increase | Technique, Advanced | Strength, Plyometrics | Advanced Sparring | Active Recovery | Speed, Agility | Extended Cardio | Rest, Mental Training| | Week 3:<br>Application & Strategy| Intense Drills | High-Intensity Train | Intensive Sparring | Active Recovery | High-Speed Agility | Peak Cardio | Light Review, Strategy| | Week 4:<br>Taper & Mental Prep | Speed Tactics | Tactical Sparring | Mental Training | Strategy & Light Act | Mental Prep | Rest | Rest & Mental Focus | - Note: “Active Recovery” recommended activities include light jogging, yoga, or swimming. - “Rest & Mental Focus” includes activities like meditation, visualization technique practices, and calming exercises to prepare mentally for competition.\\"","output":"Certainly!

Please note this guide assumes you have a basic understanding of how to use Microsoft Excel or a similar spreadsheet application. # Steps for Creating the Planning Tables in Excel: Part 1: Weekly Planning Table 1. **Open Excel**: Start a new workbook. 2. **Set Up the Columns**: In the first row, enter the headings: \`Week\`, \`Monday\`, \`Tuesday\`, \`Wednesday\`, \`Thursday\`, \`Friday\`, \`Saturday\`, and \`Sunday\`. 3. **Adjust Column Width**: To ensure all text is visible, adjust the width of the columns as needed by clicking and dragging the edges of each column header. 4. **Enter the Data**: - In the first column under \`Week\`, enter the week numbers (1, 2, 3, 4). - Fill in the corresponding activities for each day following the structure provided in the templates. 5. **Formatting**: Use the Excel formatting tools to make your table clear and visually appealing. For example, you can bold the first row, use borders to define cells, and apply conditional formatting if desired. Part 2: Monthly Planning Table 1. **Create a New Sheet**: It’s a good idea to keep the monthly planning table separate from the weekly for clarity. You can do this by adding a new sheet in your Excel workbook. 2. **Set Up the Columns**: Repeat the process used in the Weekly Planning Table, but this time, the headings will slightly differ according to the Monthly Planning table provided. 3. **Adjustments and Data Entry**: Adjust the column widths and start entering the data for each week's focus under the \`Week & Focus\` column and the activities for each day. 4. **Formatting Tips**: - You may want to merge cells in the \`Week & Focus\` column to write multi-line text (e.g., \`Week 1: Foundation & Technique\`). To do this, type your text and then use Excel's merge functionality to combine the cells vertically for each week's focus. - Apply different colors, fonts, or borders to distinguish between the weekly and monthly planning tables. Additional Functionalities: - **Dropdown Lists**: To make your table interactive, you could create dropdown lists for each cell where activities are listed. This allows for easy modifications without having to type out activities each time. - **Conditional Formatting**: Highlight certain activities (e.g., Rest days, Intensive Sparring) with different colors to quickly identify them. - **Calculations or Summaries**: Depending on your exact needs, you might want to add a section that calculates total hours planned per week or counts specific types of training days. Saving and Sharing: - **Save Your Workbook**: Ensure you regularly save your work. Excel offers options to save files locally or on cloud storage solutions like OneDrive, allowing access from anywhere. - **Sharing**: If you need to share your planning table with coaches or trainees, Excel files can be easily shared via email or by using a shared link if stored in a cloud service. By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive and customizable planning tool in Excel for weekly and monthly scheduling.

Combining different moves allows a practitioner to flow more naturally during a fight or performance, creating a dynamic and effective strategy. Here's a list of some basic to advanced Taekwondo move combinations suitable for different levels of practitioners: # Basic Combinations These are great for beginners to develop coordination and fundamental skills. 1. **Front Kick (Ap Chagi) into Reverse Punch (Bandae Jirugi)** - Execute a front kick with the back leg. - As you set the kicking leg down, advance forward and deliver a reverse punch with the opposite hand. 2. **Low Block (Arae Makki) into Roundhouse Kick (Dollyo Chagi)** - Perform a low block with one arm to defend against a low attack. - Follow up with a roundhouse kick with the leg on the same side as the blocking arm. 3. **Inside Block (Anuro Makki) into Side Kick (Yop Chagi)** - Execute an inside block to deflect an incoming mid-section attack. - Then, turn your body sideways to deliver a powerful side kick. # Intermediate Combinations These combinations incorporate more dynamic movements and are suited for practitioners with a bit more experience. 1. **Back Fist Strike (Dung Joomuk) into Spinning Hook Kick (Dwi Huryeo Chagi)** - Start with a backfist strike to the opponent's face or head. - Use the momentum to turn your body and execute a spinning hook kick with the rear leg. 2. **Side Kick (Yop Chagi) into Back Kick (Dwi Chagi)** - Perform a side kick with one leg. - As you retract the kicking leg, turn your head to look over your shoulder and execute a back kick with the other leg, targeting the mid-section or head. 3. **Roundhouse Kick (Dollyo Chagi) to Axe Kick (Naeryeo Chagi)** - Deliver a roundhouse kick with the back leg aimed at the opponent's mid-section or head. - Without setting the leg down, transition into an axe kick by raising the same leg up and then bringing it down sharply, targeting the opponent's shoulder, head, or collarbone. # Advanced Combinations For advanced Taekwondo practitioners, these combinations involve complex movements that require precision, balance, and power. 1. **Jumping Front Kick (Ee Dan Ap Chagi) into Tornado Kick (Dwi Huryeo Chagi)** - Start with a jumping front kick targeting the chest or head. - Upon landing, immediately spin 360 degrees and execute a tornado kick with the rear leg. 2. **Slide Front Kick (Mikulio Ap Chagi) into Spinning Side Kick (Dwi Yop Chagi)** - Execute a slide front kick by sliding the rear leg forward and kicking with the front leg without moving the back leg forward. - Follow through by spinning on the ball of the standing foot and delivering a spinning side kick with the other leg. 3. **Roundhouse Kick (Dollyo Chagi) into 360 Spinning Hook Kick (360 Dwi Huryeo Chagi)** - Perform a roundhouse kick with the front leg. - After retracting the kick, spin on your standing leg and execute a 360-degree spinning hook kick aimed at the head or chest. When practicing these combinations, it's important to focus on proper technique, balance, fluidity of movements, and control of your power. Always start slow to ensure that each movement is executed correctly before increasing speed and power. Practicing with a partner or under the supervision of a qualified instructor can provide valuable feedback and ensure safety."},{"instruction":"Give me some sets. Each set consists of a series of taekwondo movements necessary to play a taekwondo match","output":"In Taekwondo sparring (Kyrougi), matches require not just physical conditioning but also strategic planning, adaptability, and a wide arsenal of techniques. Here are some sets of movements or \\"combos\\" tailored for use in Taekwondo matches. Each set combines offensive, defensive, and countering techniques designed to create openings, defend against attacks, and score points. # Set 1: Basic Offensive and Defensive Strategy - **Movement 1**: Begin with a Front Kick (Ap Chagi) to probe the opponent's defense. - **Movement 2**: Follow up with a fast Roundhouse Kick (Dollyo Chagi) targeting the body or head. - **Movement 3**: As the opponent counters, use a Slide Back and execute a Low Block (Arae Makki) to block a potential kick. - **Movement 4**: Quickly counter-attack with a Reverse Punch (Bandae Jirugi) aimed at the chest or abdomen. # Set 2: Advancing Attack Strategy - **Movement 1**: Start with a fast Skipping Roundhouse Kick (Skip Dollyo Chagi) to close distance and attack simultaneously. - **Movement 2**: Immediately follow with a Push Kick (Milgi Ap Chagi) to maintain your distance and potentially unbalance your opponent. - **Movement 3**: Use a Side Kick (Yop Chagi) targeting the body as the opponent tries to close in. - **Movement 4**: If the opponent backs away, pursue with a Jumping Back Kick (Ee Dan Dwi Chagi) for a surprise attack. # Set 3: Counter-Attack Focused Strategy - **Movement 1**: Lead with a Fake Roundhouse Kick (Dollyo Chagi), lifting the knee to feint an attack. - **Movement 2**: As the opponent reacts, spin and deliver a Spinning Hook Kick (Dwi Huryeo Chagi) targeting the head. - **Movement 3**: If the opponent counters with a kick, Side Step to evade and immediately execute a Back Kick (Dwi Chagi) to the body. - **Movement 4**: In case of close combat, use a Front Elbow Strike (Ap Palkup Taerigi) for close-range defense. # Set 4: Aggressive Pushing Strategy - **Movement 1**: Commence with a Front Hand Jab (Ap Joomuk Jirugi) to test the opponent’s defense. - **Movement 2**: Launch into a Tornado Kick (Dwi Huryeo Chagi) for a high attack, aiming for the head. - **Movement 3**: Upon landing, immediately execute a Quick Front Kick (Ap Chagi) to the mid-section. - **Movement 4**: If the opponent is defensive, use a Combination Punch (Jirugi) ending with a Reverse Punch (Bandae Jirugi) for body shots. # Set 5: Defensive Maneuver to Offensive Burst - **Movement 1**: Start with a Backward Step to draw in the opponent. - **Movement 2**: Perform an Inside Crescent Kick (Anuro Bandal Chagi) to block and counter any incoming kick. - **Movement 3**: Transition to a Roundhouse Kick (Dollyo Chagi) to the opponent's exposed side. - **Movement 4**: Seal the set with an Ax Kick (Naeryeo Chagi) as the opponent attempts to regain their footing. Each set represents a blend of strategy, technique, and timing. Practitioners should adjust these sets based on their opponent’s fight style, strengths, and weaknesses. While practicing these sets, focus on speed, fluidity, and the element of surprise to effectively disrupt your opponent's strategy and score points. Remember, sparring in Taekwondo also emphasizes respect, control, and sportsmanship towards your opponent."},{"instruction":"Reinhardt is a 23 Years old boy, very solitary. He's Born between an human father and a woman Phoenix. He has short and brown hair and wears jeans, black turtleneck and red jacket with white fur. He has a burn Scar in his neck covered by the turtleneck, he had It from birth (precisely when he was still in her mother's womb. The origins of the scar Is still a mystery). He always gets mistook for a delinquent because of his clothes, but he's actually very kind and pure hearted. His abilities are: Regeneration, Fire and ash manipulation, Resurrection and infinite knowledge (when he has Red eyes, he can know everything about people, objects and information beyond his own understanding. Example: he can know what weapon he's holding and how to use It, even if he never used before, or he can know someone's name even if they never introduced themselves).

It starts with: \\"It is said that a phoenix can be reborn from its ashes, but I don't believe...\\"","output":"**Chapter 1: The Ashen Legacy** \\"It is said that a phoenix can be reborn from its ashes, but I don't believe...\\" These whispered words float through the bustling streets of a city where the extraordinary hides in plain sight. Our tale begins with a quiet, unassuming youth named Reinhardt, a figure who blends into the crowd with his brown hair and somber attire, yet commands a presence that belies his solitary nature. Born to a human father and a Phoenix mother under circumstances shrouded in mystery and fire, Reinhardt carries the burden of his origins quietly, his neck adorned with a scar concealed beneath the confines of a black turtleneck—a mark from a fire that kissed him while he was still nestled in his mother's womb. This enigma, coupled with his attire—a red jacket edged with white fur, a striking contrast to the urban landscape—often paints him in a light far removed from his reality. Despite the eyes that judge and the whispers that follow, Reinhardt's heart remains untarnished—pure and kind, a stark contradiction to the image his appearance might suggest. Yet, beneath this veneer of normalcy lies the heart of a being touched by the phoenix's fire and mystery. With abilities as extraordinary as his lineage, Reinhardt navigates the world with a grace born of fire and ash. His very essence allows him to regenerate, manipulating fire and ash as effortlessly as one might breathe; resurrection, a gift of his heritage, lies dormant, waiting. But most intriguing of all is the gift that flickers to life within his gaze—a transformation heralded by the shift to crimson. With eyes aglow, the world unfurls before him, a tapestry of knowledge infinite and boundless, granting him insight into the souls of those he meets, the history of objects, and the secrets of the world, all laid bare. Yet, despite the allure of the unknown and the call of his phoenix blood, Reinhardt chooses the path of obscurity, guarding the truth of his origin and powers, a silent sentinel in a world that would not understand. Our journey begins as the tendrils of dawn creep over the horizon, casting light upon the path of a boy who walks the line between human and myth—Reinhardt, the phoenix's son, whose story is about to unfold in a world that teeters on the brink of the extraordinary. As Reinhardt steps into the light, his shadow casts long on the pavement, a harbinger of the tales that will rise from the ashes of bygone fires—a narrative of discovery, of battles both within and without, and the quest for a place in a world that harbors both wonders and threats in equal measure. Thus, the tale of the ash-born wanderer takes its first breath, beckoning to those who dare journey alongside a boy who is, against all odds, simply trying to find his way."},{"instruction":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <script type=“text/javascript” src=“https://cdn.scaledrone.com/scaledrone.min.js”><\/script> <meta charset=“UTF-8” /> <title>Multiplayer chat server</title> <style> .members-count,","output":".chat { display: none; } .messages { margin-bottom: 20px; border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; height: 300px; overflow-y: scroll; } input[type=\\"text\\"] { width: 80%; padding: 10px; margin: 10px; } button { padding: 10px; margin: 10px; } </style> </head> <body> <h1>Multiplayer Chat</h1> <p class=\\"members-count\\">Members Online: <span id=\\"members-count\\">0</span></p> <div class=\\"chat\\"> <div class=\\"messages\\" id=\\"messages\\"></div> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"message\\" placeholder=\\"Type your message here\\" /> <button onclick=\\"sendMessage()\\">Send</button> </div> <script> const drone = new Scaledrone('YOUR_CHANNEL_ID'); drone.on('open', error => { if (error) { return console.error(error); } console.log('Successfully connected to Scaledrone'); }); const room = drone.subscribe('observable-room'); room.on('open', error => { if (error) { return console.error(error); } console.log('Successfully joined room'); }); room.on('members', members => { document.getElementById('members-count').innerText = members.length; }); room.on('data', data => { const message = document.createElement('div'); message.textContent = data; document.getElementById('messages').appendChild(message); }); function sendMessage() { const messageInput = document.getElementById('message'); const message = messageInput.value; if (message) { room.publish({ message }); messageInput.value = ''; } } <\/script> </body> </html>"},{"instruction":"Reinhardt is a 23 Years old boy, very solitary.

Not in the way stories tell it, anyway. My existence is a living proof that rebirth can be more... complex. My name is Reinhardt, a name that doesn't quite fit in a world of normalcy yet doesn't belong fully to the realm of the extraordinary either. Born amid the flames of a human passion and a phoenix's eternal fire, I navigate this world bridging two vastly different realms. With hair as ordinary as the earth yet a spirit as untamed as fire, my appearance often contradicts the essence of my being. A simple pair of jeans, a black turtleneck to cover the mark of my fiery heritage, and a red jacket adorned with white fur - my attempt to blend in, yet it somehow highlights me further, casting me in the light of a delinquent in the eyes of passersby. Ah, this scar... A hidden testament to my unique birth, shrouded in mystery and concealed beneath my attire. A constant reminder of the unknown, even to me. It's strange, truly, how appearances can deceive, branding me as something I'm not. Kindness pulses through my veins, a purity of heart that contradicts the tough exterior the world insists I wear. My abilities... they are an anomaly. Regeneration, a gift mirroring the legendary resilience of the phoenix; fire and ash manipulation, a testament to the fiery blood that courses through me; resurrection, the ultimate homage to my mythical lineage; and then, there's the infinite knowledge that comes with a mere change of eye color. Red eyes that hold the universe's secrets, that understand the essence of everything with but a glance. It's overwhelming, this power, and not something I flaunt. For what is power but a lonely path? I tread carefully, veiling my true nature, for fear of what knowing could mean for the delicate balance of the worlds I inhabit. After all, what good is infinite knowledge when it isolates you from the very connections that make life worth living? So here I stand, at the crossroads of humanity and legend, a solitary figure with a heart too big for his body, carrying the weight of two worlds on his shoulders. If stories are to be believed, maybe I too can find rebirth amidst the ashes of my solitude. But until then, I walk this earth as Reinhardt, the half-human, half-phoenix, forever caught between two worlds, belonging fully to neither.\\""},{"instruction":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <script type=“text/javascript” src=“https://cdn.scaledrone.com/scaledrone.min.js”><\/script> <meta charset=“UTF-8” /> <title>Multiplayer chat server</title> <style> .members-count,","output":".messages { text-align: center; padding: 10px 0; background-color: #f2f2f2; } .members-list { list-style-type: none; padding: 0; } .message { background-color: #e1f7d5; border: 1px solid #a3e9a4; margin: 10px; padding: 10px; } </style> </head> <body> <h1>Multiplayer Chat Server</h1> <div class=“members-count”>Members online: <span id=“members-count”>0</span></div> <ul class=“members-list” id=“members-list”></ul> <div class=“messages” id=“messages”></div> <form id=“form”> <input type=“text” id=“input” placeholder=“Type your message…”> <button type=“submit”>Send</button> </form> <script> const drone = new Scaledrone(\\"<YOUR_CHANNEL_ID>\\"); const room = drone.subscribe(\\"observable-room\\"); room.on(\\"open\\", error => { if (error) { return console.error(error); } console.log(\\"Connected to Scaledrone\\"); }); room.on(\\"members\\", members => { document.getElementById(\\"members-count\\").innerText = members.length; document.getElementById(\\"members-list\\").innerHTML = \\"\\"; members.forEach(member => { const li = document.createElement(\\"li\\"); li.appendChild(document.createTextNode(member.clientId)); document.getElementById(\\"members-list\\").appendChild(li); }); }); room.on(\\"data\\", (data, member) => { const message = document.createElement(\\"div\\"); message.appendChild(document.createTextNode(\`{member.clientId}: {data}\`)); document.getElementById(\\"messages\\").appendChild(message); }); document.getElementById(\\"form\\").addEventListener(\\"submit\\", e => { e.preventDefault(); const input = document.getElementById(\\"input\\"); const message = input.value; input.value = \\"\\"; room.publish({ message }); }); <\/script> </body> </html>"},{"instruction":"from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV from xgboost import XGBRegressor # Initialize the XGBoost model xgb_regressor = XGBRegressor(objective='reg:squarederror', tree_method='gpu_hist') # Wrap XGBoost model with MultiOutputRegressor multioutput_regressor = MultiOutputRegressor(xgb_regressor) # Define the parameter grid for XGBoost param_grid = { 'estimator__n_estimators': [400,800], # Number of trees 'estimator__learning_rate': [0.2], # Step size shrinkage used to prevent overfitting 'estimator__max_depth': [16], # Maximum depth of a tree # Add more parameters here based on your needs } # Initialize GridSearchCV grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=multioutput_regressor, param_grid=param_grid, cv=3, n_jobs=-1, verbose=2, scoring='neg_mean_absolute_error') # Train the model using grid search to find the best hyperparameters grid_search.fit(X_train_scaled, Y_train_scaled) # Print the best parameters and the best score print(f\\"Best parameters: {grid_search.best_params_}\\") print(f\\"Best score: {grid_search.best_score_}\\") errror: { \\"name\\": \\"MemoryError\\", \\"message\\": \\"Unable to allocate 806.

This issue is especially prevalent when working with large datasets or when using a model that requires a lot of memory for its operations, such as an ensemble model like XGBoost. Here are several approaches to mitigate the MemoryError: 1. **Reduce the dataset size**: If feasible, consider working with a smaller subset of your data for hyperparameter tuning. Once you've found the optimal parameters, you can train your final model on the full dataset. 2. **Use a simpler model**: In the context of hyperparameter tuning, you might temporarily switch to a simpler model or reduce the complexity of your current model (e.g., less depth in trees). 3. **Optimize grid search parameters**: Be more selective with your parameter grid. For instance, fewer values for \`n_estimators\` or \`max_depth\` would reduce memory usage during the grid search. This approach might require more iterations of hyperparameter tuning but can help prevent memory overflows. 4. **Increase your machine’s memory**: If possible, running your computation on a machine with more physical memory can solve the problem outright. 5. **Use incremental learning**: Some models and frameworks support incremental learning, which allows them to be trained on small chunks of data sequentially. While XGBoost isn't naturally suited to incremental learning, reducing your data size or features might help. 6. **Adjust joblib’s parallelism**: The \`n_jobs\` parameter in \`GridSearchCV\` determines the number of jobs to run in parallel. By setting \`n_jobs=-1\`, you are utilizing all processors, leading to high memory usage. Try reducing the number of parallel jobs (e.g., \`n_jobs=1\` or \`n_jobs=2\`) to decrease memory demand, understanding this may increase computational time. 7. **Use Dask for distributed computing**: If you're working on a particularly large dataset and continually run into memory issues, you might consider using Dask, a parallel computing python library that integrates well with joblib and can distribute the computation across multiple machines or cores more efficiently. 8. **Reduce the precision of your data**: If your dataset uses \`float64\` (double precision), consider downcasting to \`float32\` to halve the memory usage. It's essential to weigh the trade-offs of each approach based on your specific context, including dataset characteristics, computational resources, and model accuracy requirements."},{"instruction":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <script type=“text/javascript” src=“https://cdn.scaledrone.com/scaledrone.min.js”><\/script> <meta charset=“UTF-8” /> <title>Multiplayer chat server</title> <style> .members-count,","output":".messages { margin-top: 20px;

After years of collecting oddly-shaped fruits and vegetables, which he proudly displayed like trophies on his kitchen windowsill, he stumbled upon a hobby that turned his simple, somewhat mundane life into a whirlwind of fur, drool, and unexpected fame. That hobby? Breeding dogs that only a mother could love, or so the saying goes. His journey began on a blustery Tuesday when he rescued Bartholomew, a dog so peculiar in appearance that his own shadow seemed to question its shape. Gus found him wandering the streets, his fur matted in clumps, one ear significantly larger than the other, and a snout that looked as though it had been designed by committee. Yet, when Bartholomew looked up at Gus with eyes filled with love and gratitude, Gus knew he had found his calling. Word of Gus’s peculiar new pet spread through the town like wildfire. Soon, people from various walks of life came knocking on his door, each with a dog more visually eccentric than the last, seeking refuge or a new home where their pet would be appreciated for its quirks, not discarded because of them. It wasn’t long before Gus's backyard resembled a carnival of canines, each with its own unique set of attributes that defied conventional beauty standards. And thus, the empire of \\"Gus's Gorgeous Grotesques\\" was born. Chapter The operation was simple yet profoundly impactful. Gus positioned himself as the savior of the unsightly and unloved, creating a sanctuary where the principles of traditional dog beauty contests were turned on their heads. He began to selectively breed his mottled menagerie, focusing on enhancing their unconventional features. A dog with a lopsided ear here, a bulldog with an excessively furrowed brow there; each litter was a surprise package of genetic roulette. His reputation grew, and soon people from across the nation sought his dogs, not just as pets but as contestants in the increasingly popular Ugly Dog Competitions. Gus’s dogs became the gold standard, winning trophies and hearts alike. However, it wasn’t the fame or the money that drove Gus, but the joy of giving these dogs a purpose and the owners a source of pride in their pet’s unique appearance. Continuing with his mission, Gus became somewhat of a local celebrity. Interviews and television spots became part of his routine, always emphasizing the beauty in imperfection. Yet, with fame comes critique. Whisperings of ethical concerns regarding the intentional breeding of animals for exaggerated physical traits began to surface among animal rights groups. Gus, however, remained undeterred, advocating for his belief that every dog, regardless of appearance, deserves love and admiration. Prominent philosophers and ethicists were drawn to the debate, pondering whether Gus’s actions were a celebration of uniqueness or an exploitation of genetic anomalies. The discussions often ended in more questions than answers, but they provided a platform for society to reflect on the standards of beauty and acceptance. Chapter As Gus delved deeper into the realm of dog breeding, his understanding of genetics and the unpredictable nature of heredity grew. He became a mad scientist of sorts, his laboratory a cozy nook in his backyard. Each new batch of puppies was a testament to his growing expertise, yet Gus remained humble, often saying, “Nature is the true artist; I’m just the canvas.” His most ambitious project was a dog he named Picasso, a creature so abstract in form that art enthusiasts argued over whether its face was cubist or suprematist. Picasso became the flagship of Gus’s Gorgeous Grotesques, embodying the pinnacle of Gus’s breeding endeavors. People traveled far and wide just to catch a glimpse of Picasso, whose indifferent gaze seemed to critique the very notion of beauty itself. It was during the National Ugly Dog Competition that Gus’s life took an unforeseen turn. Picasso, unsurprisingly, had made it to the finals, his bewildering appearance captivating the hearts of the audience and judges alike. As Gus awaited the final announcement, he couldn’t help but reflect on his journey. He had started with a simple desire to offer love and acceptance to those deemed unworthy by superficial standards, and now he was on the brink of having bred the champion of champions in the world of ugly dogs. “And the winner is…” The anticipation in the air was palpable. “…Picasso!” The crowd erupted in cheers, but the applause was quickly drowned out by a commotion at the back of the auditorium. Gus turned just in time to see a group of protesters, their signs painted with slogans denouncing the exploitation of animals for human amusement. As the protesters made their way to the stage, Gus prepared himself for confrontation. However, what happened next was something Gus could have never predicted. Led by a woman with a fierce determination in her eyes, the group stopped in front of Picasso, who sat bewildered by the sudden attention. The woman, who introduced herself as Dr. Helena Forsyth, a geneticist and animal rights activist, began to speak, not with anger, but with a passion that silenced the room. She talked about the importance of understanding and respecting the natural world, emphasizing that while it’s human nature to seek beauty in everything, true beauty lies in accepting all living beings as they are, not as we wish them to be. To everyone’s surprise, Dr. Forsyth then turned to Gus and thanked him. She explained that his work, albeit controversial, had sparked a global conversation about animal rights and the ethics of breeding. She acknowledged that Gus’s love for his dogs was genuine and that his intentions, though misguided in the eyes of some, had brought people together to discuss important issues affecting the animal kingdom. The room fell into a reflective silence, broken only by Picasso’s occasional snort. It was a turning point for Gus. He realized that his greatest contribution wasn’t the creation of an empire based on the unconventional beauty of his dogs but in fostering a dialogue that challenged societal norms and advocated for a deeper understanding and acceptance of all living creatures. From that day forward, Gus’s Gorgeous Grotesques took on a new mission. Gus, with the help of Dr. Forsyth, transitioned his operation into a rescue and rehabilitation center for dogs of all shapes and sizes, focusing on education and advocacy. Picasso, ever the muse, became the symbol of their cause, his image gracing educational materials that promoted ethical treatment and the celebration of diversity within the animal world.

Но чтобы за каждую продажу сайту с покупки начислялось 3 процента от суммы","output":"Для реализации системы продажи цифровых товаров (например, игровых модов) с автоматическим начислением процента с каждой продажи на вашем сайте, вам потребуются следующие компоненты и шаги реализации: # 1. Веб-сайт с каталогом товаров - **Фронтенд (Front-end)**: Разработайте удобный пользовательский интерфейс, где будут представлены все доступные товары с их описанием и ценой. Используйте HTML, CSS, и JavaScript для создания веб-страниц. - **Бэкенд (Back-end)**: Для обработки данных и взаимодействия с базой данных (хранение данных о товарах, пользователи, покупках) используйте серверный язык программирования, такой как Node.js, Python (Django или Flask), Ruby on Rails и др. # 2. База данных Создайте схему базы данных для хранения информации о товарах, пользователях, заказах и транзакциях. # 3. Система оплаты Интегрируйте на сайт платежный шлюз (например, PayPal, Stripe, PayU, Яндекс.Касса и т.д.), который позволит безопасно проводить транзакции. Следует убедиться, что выбранный платежный шлюз поддерживает автоматическую передачу процента от продажи на ваш счет. Обычно это достигается через настройку веб-хуков (webhooks) или API платежного шлюза. # 4. Автоматическое начисление процентов - При каждой продаже товара, после успешной оплаты, рассчитывайте 3% от суммы покупки. Эту процедуру можно автоматизировать с помощью серверного кода, который будет вызываться после подтверждения транзакции через API платежной системы. - Настройте автоматическую выплату на ваш счет этих 3% после каждой совершенной продажи, если платежная система позволяет осуществлять такие операции через API. # 5. Функциональность для пользователей Добавьте на сайт возможность для пользователей загружать их товары (в вашем случае игровые моды), указывая необходимую информацию о товаре и его цену. Также настройте верификацию и модерацию загружаемых материалов для исключения нежелательного контента. # 6. Безопасность Обеспечьте защиту пользовательских данных и безопасность транзакций. Используйте SSL-сертификат для шифрования и безопасной передачи данных на вашем сайте. Также реализуйте систему аутентификации и авторизации для пользователей. # Пример кода для расчета процентов на сервере (Node.js): \`\`\`javascript // Псевдокод для серверной обработки после покупки app.post('/api/purchase', async (req, res) => { const { userId, productId, price } = req.body; // Проверка параметров и доступности товара // Осуществление оплаты через API платежного шлюза // После успешной оплаты const siteFee = price * 0.03; // Рассчитываем 3% от цены const sellerAmount = price - siteFee; // Сумма для продавца // Записываем транзакцию в базу данных // Начисляем средства продавцу, зачисляем процент на счет сайта // Отправляем товар покупателю (например, ссылку на скачивание) res.send({ success: true, message: 'Товар успешно куплен' }); }); \`\`\` Это только общий план действий, который нужно адаптировать под конкретные требования и условия вашего проекта.

How does it differ from Utopian Socialism? Use simple language.","output":"Ethical Socialism is a version of socialism that emphasizes moral and ethical principles as its foundation. It believes in creating a society that is fair, where wealth is distributed more evenly, and where people take care of each other. It focuses on doing what is right based on moral values, aiming for a community that supports everybody's needs while encouraging individuals to act in ways that benefit the whole society. Utopian Socialism, on the other hand, is an older concept that talks about creating an ideal or perfect society. Utopian Socialists come up with detailed plans for how societies can work without injustice, poverty, or severe inequality, often imagining communities that operate very differently from current societies. Their ideas are more about dreaming up perfect societies without always having practical plans for how to achieve these dreams. The main difference between Ethical Socialism and Utopian Socialism is how they approach the idea of creating a better society. Ethical Socialism is grounded in moral principles, focusing on ethical ways to reform and improve current societies so they become more equitable and just. It's more about making changes within the existing system based on ethical values. Utopian Socialism, though, starts from the vision of an ideal society and works backward, often leading to ideas that might seem impractical because they require such drastic changes from the world as it is now. In simple terms, Ethical Socialism is about making the world better step by step, grounded in moral values, while Utopian Socialism is about imagining an ideal world and trying to figure out how to get there."},{"instruction":"What does this statement mean? \\"The nation is the sole employer and capitalist.\\"","output":"The statement \\"The nation is the sole employer and capitalist\\" refers to a system where the government, representing the nation, is the only owner of all businesses and the only entity that employs people. In such a system, private ownership of businesses by individuals or corporations is non-existent; instead, the state controls all aspects of the economy. This means that all production, distribution, and investment decisions are made by the government, and it also holds all the wealth and resources. Essentially, the state is the only capitalist, managing and directing economic activity, and it is also the sole employer, meaning all individuals work for state-owned and operated entities. This arrangement is commonly associated with certain forms of socialism or communism, where the idea is to eliminate private ownership of the means of production to achieve equality and prevent exploitation."},{"instruction":"What does this mean? \\"One professional judge presides, appointing two colleagues to state the prosecution and defense cases. If all do not agree on the verdict, then it must be tried again.\\"","output":"This description outlines a specific judicial process within a court system. Here's the breakdown: 1. **One Professional Judge Presides**: A single judge, likely with significant legal expertise and experience, oversees the trial. This judge has the authority to manage how the trial progresses and ensure that legal procedures are followed. 2. **Appointing Two Colleagues**: The presiding judge selects two other individuals, probably also with legal backgrounds, to play specific roles during the trial. These roles are not typically found in most contemporary Western legal systems but exist in certain judicial setups. 3. **State the Prosecution and Defense Cases**: The two appointed colleagues have distinct responsibilities. One presents the case against the defendant (prosecution), and the other presents the arguments in favor of the defendant (defense). Unlike in many systems where each side would have its own chosen or appointed representation, here the judge assigns these roles, aiming perhaps for a more controlled and balanced presentation of each case. 4. **If All Do Not Agree on the Verdict, Then It Must Be Tried Again**: After the cases are presented, a verdict must be reached. This implies that all three, the judge and the two appointed colleagues, need to agree on the outcome (guilty or not guilty). If there's no unanimous agreement among them, the trial does not conclude with a verdict but must instead be conducted again, possibly with new appointments for prosecution and defense. This rule ensures that decisions are reached through complete consensus, emphasizing caution and thoroughness in the judicial process. This system appears designed to ensure fairness and impartiality in the trial process by involving multiple judicial perspectives in reaching a verdict and mandating unanimity. However, the specifics of how this system operates, including how often trials are retried due to lack of consensus, would depend on additional rules and norms not detailed in the statement."},{"instruction":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <script type=“text/javascript” src=“https://cdn.scaledrone.com/scaledrone.min.js”><\/script> <meta charset=“UTF-8” /> <title>Multiplayer chat server</title> <style> .members-count,","output":".chat-area, .input-area { display: flex;

PlayStation 2 games have a distinctive look, characterized by lower polygon counts, specific texturing methods, and limited shader capabilities. Here is a comprehensive approach to creating PS2-style graphics in Blender: # 1. Lower Polygon Models - **Low Poly Models:** The PS2's hardware limited the complexity of 3D models. Focus on creating models with fewer polygons. Use the \`Decimate\` modifier in Blender to reduce the polygon count of your models without significantly altering their shape. - **Sharp Edges:** PS2 graphics often could not smooth out edges and corners as modern games can. Use the \`Edge Split\` modifier or manually mark edges as sharp and use flat shading to replicate this. # 2. Texturing and Materials - **Texture Resolution:** Limit the resolution of your textures. PS2 games commonly used textures as low as 64x64 or 128x128 pixels. Using similarly low-resolution textures can give your models a retro feel. - **Diffuse and Emission Only:** Avoid complex shaders. Stick to basic materials that primarily use diffuse color. You can also utilize emission shaders for effects that are supposed to look like they are self-lit (e.g., neon signs, screens). - **Baked Lighting and Shadows:** Since the PS2 had limited real-time lighting capabilities, many games baked lighting directly onto textures. Experiment with baking lighting in Blender to your textures to simulate this effect. # 3. Lighting and Rendering - **Limited Dynamic Lighting:** Use a limited number of light sources in your scenes. PS2 games often had to economize on real-time lighting. - **Baked Shadows:** Similar to baked lighting, consider baking shadows into your scenes rather than relying on dynamic shadows, which were more limited or often absent in PS2 games. # 4. Special Effects - **Simplified Particles and Effects:** PS2 games had to use very simplified particle systems. Use Blender's particle system sparingly and aim for lower particle counts. - **Low-Res Post-Processing:** PS2 games rarely had complex post-processing effects. Simple, low-resolution bloom, and basic color corrections can help mimic the old-school game aesthetic. # 5. Export and Rendering Settings - **Real-Time Rendering Engine:** While not a requirement, using a real-time rendering engine like Eevee can help approximate the look of PS2 graphics more closely than a ray-traced engine like Cycles. - **Lower the Render Resolution:** Render your final images or animations at lower resolutions. Something in the ballpark of 640x480 to 1280x720 will be closer to the PS2's output. # Conclusion By embracing the limitations that defined the PS2 era of gaming, you can create artwork or animations in Blender that authentically replicate the look and feel of that time. Remember, the key to achieving a convincing PS2 aesthetic is a combination of technical restrictions (like low poly models and low-res textures) and creative decision-making that aligns with the era's characteristic styles and limitations."},{"instruction":"What about facial animation!","output":"Achieving PS2-style facial animation in Blender involves mimicking the techniques and constraints of the era. Compared to today's standards, facial animations during the PlayStation 2 era were simpler, often due to the limitation in hardware and polygon count. Here are strategies to replicate PS2-era facial animations: # 1. **Low-Poly Facial Models** - **Simplified Geometry:** Keep the facial geometry simple. PS2-era characters often had a low number of polygons, which meant less detail and more stylized features. - **Separate Objects for Facial Features:** In some cases, facial features like eyes or mouth were separate objects or textures that moved over a static head mesh to convey expression. # 2. **Texture Swapping** - **Different Expressions:** Instead of complex rigs, some games used different textures for various facial expressions. This can be achieved in Blender by swapping textures for different frames or using a texture atlas and changing the UV map coordinates for different expressions. - **Animated Textures:** Animated textures (a sequence of images) can also mimic talking or blinking. This approach simplifies the animation process but is less flexible than other methods. # 3. **Morph Targets / Shape Keys** - **Basic Mouth and Eye Movements:** Use Blender's Shape Keys to create basic mouth movements for speech and blinking or moving eyes. Shape keys allow for transitioning between different facial expressions and are more resource-efficient than skeletal animations. - **Emphasize Key Expressions:** Focus on key expressions needed for your animation (e.g., talking, blinking, basic emotions) and create shape keys for those. Complex subtleties were harder to achieve and less common in PS2 games. # 4. **Rudimentary Bone Rigs for Faces** - **Limited Bones:** If using a skeletal rig for the face, keep it simple. A few bones can control the jaw, eyes, and perhaps major brow movements. Remember, PS2 games had to work within strict limitations, so character rigs were often quite basic compared to modern standards. - **Facial Animation System:** For characters that require more expressive facial animations (like main characters in cinematics), a basic bone setup combined with shape keys can provide a good balance between expressiveness and the technical simplicity of the era. # 5. **Animation Techniques** - **Blocky Movement:** With simpler rigs and fewer polygons, movements were less smooth. When animating, consider making movements a bit more pronounced but less fluid than what you'd see with high-poly models. - **Limited Lip Sync:** Full lip-syncing was rare and often simplified. Focusing on opening/closing the mouth during speech, with perhaps a few shapes to suggest different phonemes, can achieve a believable effect. # 6. **Rendering Considerations** - **Toon Shading:** Use toon shading or limited shader complexity when rendering your characters. This mimics the shading techniques used in many PS2 games and helps integrate facial animations more naturally with the character models and environment. - **Lower Frame Rate For Animations:** Rendering your animations at a lower frame rate (e.g., 15-24 FPS) can also contribute to the retro feel, as smooth, 60 FPS animation was not typical for games of that era. In essence, achieving PS2-style facial animation is about embracing simplicity and using creative solutions within technical constraints. By focusing on key expressions, simplifying rigs, and utilizing texture swaps or shape keys effectively, Blender can be a powerful tool for creating nostalgic, PS2-era game art."},{"instruction":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <script type=“text/javascript” src=“https://cdn.scaledrone.com/scaledrone.min.js”><\/script> <meta charset=“UTF-8” /> <title>Multiplayer chat server</title> <style> .members-count,","output":".chat-messages { display: inline-block; vertical-align: top; } .members-count { width: 20%; } .chat-messages { width: 80%; } </style> </head> <body> <h1>Multiplayer Chat</h1> <div class=“members-count”> <p>Members online: <span id=“members-count”></span></p> </div> <div class=“chat-messages” id=“chat-messages”></div> <script> // Initialize Scaledrone const drone = new ScaleDrone('YOUR_CHANNEL_ID'); // Connect to Scaledrone drone.on('open', error => { if (error) { return console.error(error); } console.log('Connected to Scaledrone'); }); // Listen for members change drone.on('members', members => { document.getElementById('members-count').textContent = members.length; }); // Listen for incoming messages drone.on('data', (data, member) => { const message = document.createElement('div'); message.classList.add('message'); message.textContent = member.clientData.name + ': ' + data; document.getElementById('chat-messages').appendChild(message); }); <\/script> </body> </html>"},{"instruction":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <script type=“text/javascript” src=“https://cdn.scaledrone.com/scaledrone.min.js”><\/script> <meta charset=“UTF-8” /> <title>Multiplayer chat server</title> <style> .members-count,","output":".chat-messages { padding: 10px; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin-bottom: 10px; } .message { padding: 5px; background: #fff; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin-bottom: 5px; } input[type=\\"text\\"], button { padding: 5px; margin-right: 10px; } button { background: #3498db; color: #fff; border: none; } input[type=\\"text\\"] { width: 70%; } .members-count { font-size: 18px; } </style> </head> <body> <h1>Multiplayer chat server</h1> <p>Members online: <span class=“members-count”>0</span></p> <div class=“chat-messages”> </div> <input type=“text” id=“chat-input” placeholder=“Enter message” /> <button id=“send-button”>Send</button> <script> const drone = new ScaleDrone('YOUR_CHANNEL_ID'); drone.on('open', error => { if (error) { return console.error(error); } }); drone.on('members', members => { document.querySelector('.members-count').textContent = members.length; }); const chatMessages = document.querySelector('.chat-messages'); drone.on('data', (data, member) => { const message = document.createElement('div'); message.textContent = member.clientData.name + ': ' + data; chatMessages.appendChild(message); }); const chatInput = document.getElementById('chat-input'); const sendButton = document.getElementById('send-button'); sendButton.addEventListener('click', () => { const message = chatInput.value; drone.publish({ room: 'observable-room', message }); chatInput.value = ''; }); <\/script> </body> </html>"},{"instruction":"Help me write a post-apocalypse RPG adventure around this idea: The player characters are scavenging a corporate complex, and they encounter a pair of deactivated android replicants. These are machines programmed to act as CEOs, but only they can open up a stash of pre-War technologies.","output":"Title: Echoes of Silicon Setting: The adventure takes place in the remnants of a sprawling corporate tower, a monolithic structure that pierces the clouded skies of a world long since succumbed to apocalypse. Nature, unforgiving and wild, has begun to reclaim the land around it, yet the tower stands as a silent testament to the world that was. This structure once housed the headquarters of Echelon Innovations, a tech conglomerate that was at the forefront of artificial intelligence and android technology before the world descended into chaos. Introduction: The player characters (PCs) are scavengers, part of a larger community that survives by exploring ruins for technology and resources. A recent scouting mission has led them to the Echelon Innovations corporate tower. The community's elder has shared rumors of a sealed vault within the tower, purported to contain pre-War technologies and schematics of untold value. However, the vault can only be accessed by the CEO—or, more precisely, by the android replicants designed to act in their stead. Adventure Hooks: 1. **Desperate Need**: The community's defenses are failing, and without an upgrade, they will not survive another raider attack or mutant onslaught. The technology inside the vault could save them. 2. **Rival Scavengers**: Another group of scavengers has caught wind of the tower's treasures and is planning their own expedition. The PCs must reach the vault first. 3. **A Personal Connection**: One of the PCs discovers a family tie to Echelon Innovations, sparking a personal quest to find out what happened and secure their legacy. Main Plot: # Act 1: The Descent The PCs must navigate the hazards of the tower's lower levels, facing off against mutated creatures that have nested in the ruins and automated security systems that have survived the apocalypse. Environmental puzzles challenge the group as they restore power to the elevators and unlock secure doors leading closer to the executive floors. # Act 2: Awakening Silicon Upon reaching the executive floors, the PCs discover the two android CEOs in a dormant state within their lavish but now decaying offices. Reactivating them is no small feat, requiring the PCs to scavenge parts from other less sophisticated androids found within the building or to hack into the tower's failing mainframe for override codes. However, reactivation comes with its own challenges. The androids, programmed with the personalities and objectives of their human counterparts, might not readily cooperate. The PCs will need to negotiate, bargain, or outwit the androids, leveraging company secrets or logical paradoxes to gain their compliance. # Act 3: The Vault With an android CEO as their guide and key, the PCs must navigate the final defenses of the vault. This includes a lethal security gauntlet, biometric locks that require creative bypassing, and the moral quandary of whether or not to trust the androids once the vault is opened. Inside, they find not just technology but cryogenically frozen experts from before the War, left there as a final measure to rebuild society. Now, the PCs face the ultimate choice: take the technology for their immediate use or revive these experts, knowing it could mean relinquishing the treasures but potentially restoring a fragment of the lost world. Twists and Revelations: - One of the androids has developed a semblance of consciousness and has its own agenda. - The vault additionally contains a failsafe device that, if activated, could either bring salvation or further doom to what's left of the world. - Among the cryogenically frozen is someone from one of the PC's past, complicating their final decision. Epilogue: The outcome of the PCs' choices shapes not just their own fates but that of their community and possibly the world. Whether they emerge as saviors with the knowledge to rebuild or as pragmatists who prioritize survival above all, they will have left an indelible mark on the post-apocalyptic landscape. --- Echoes of Silicon not only offers a thrilling scavenger hunt but also delves deep into themes of morality, leadership, and the essence of humanity. Whether for a single night's session or a campaign's worth of adventure, it promises to leave players with haunting choices and unforgettable stories."},{"instruction":"créame con gráficos un modelo de datos con las siguientes entidades, atributos y relaciones","output":"Lo siento por cualquier confusión, pero actualmente, no puedo crear o mostrar gráficos o imágenes directamente en esta plataforma.

Ejemplo: Usuario, Producto, Pedido. # Atributos Los atributos son las propiedades o características de esas entidades. Ejemplo para un Usuario podrían ser: ID del usuario, nombre, correo electrónico. # Relaciones Las relaciones definen cómo se asocian las entidades entre sí. Ejemplo: Un Usuario puede realizar muchos Pedidos. # Ejemplo hipotético Vamos a crear un modelo de datos simple para un sistema de e-commerce con las siguientes entidades y relaciones, y te explicaré cómo podrías dibujarlo: **Entidades y Atributos** 1. **Usuario** - ID del Usuario - Nombre - Correo Electrónico 2. **Producto** - ID del Producto - Nombre - Precio 3. **Pedido** - ID del Pedido - Fecha del Pedido - ID del Usuario (que realizó el pedido) - Total (suma del precio de productos) **Relaciones** - **Usuario** a **Pedido**: Un usuario puede realizar muchos pedidos (relación 1 a muchos). - **Pedido** a **Producto**: Un pedido puede incluir varios productos, y un producto puede estar en varios pedidos (relación muchos a muchos, la cual normalmente requiere de una tabla intermedia, por ejemplo, DetallePedido). # Diseñando el Modelo en Papel o con Herramientas Para crear tu modelo, puedes seguir estos pasos básicos: 1. Dibuja rectángulos para representar cada entidad y escribe el nombre de la entidad en la parte superior de cada rectángulo. 2. Dentro de cada rectángulo, lista los atributos de esa entidad. 3.

Glider Description: Optimized for maximum lift and airtime Pros: Wide wings generate lift, long fuselage adds stability Cons: Less speed than dart designs, may be affected by air currents 3. Stunt Plane Description: Designed for aerobatics and tricks Pros: Asymmetrical wings allow for dynamic maneuvers, unconventional shapes for added agility Cons: Requires skilled piloting, may be less stable than other designs 4. Delta Wing Description: Known for agility and speed Pros: Triangular-shaped wings provide high maneuverability, suitable for quick turns Cons: Less lift compared to glider designs, may require more precise folding 5. Canard Description: Features a small wing at the front Pros: Stability from front wing, control from rear wing, suitable for both distance and accuracy Cons: Complex folding process, may require additional adjustments for optimal flight 6. Rotor Plane Description: Includes spinning elements for unique flight patterns Pros: Hovering and gliding capabilities, visually appealing Cons: Limited flight distance, may require more intricate folding and assembly Materials Needed Standard letter size or A4 paper Scissors (optional) Tape or paper clips (optional, for weight distribution)","output":"Introduction to Aerodynamics: Aerodynamics is the study of the dynamics of air, particularly its interaction with a solid object, such as an airplane. The principles of aerodynamics explain how airplanes fly, including paper airplanes. The three fundamental forces that govern aerodynamics are lift, drag, and thrust. - **Lift** is the upward force that counteracts the weight of the airplane and holds it in the sky. For paper airplanes, lift is generated by the wings as air flows over and under them, creating a pressure difference. - **Drag** is the air resistance that opposes the airplane's motion. In paper airplanes, drag can be reduced by making the plane more aerodynamic, such as by adding a pointed nose. - **Thrust** is the forward force that propels the airplane through the air. Unlike powered aircraft, paper airplanes rely on the initial thrust provided by the throw of the hand. The design of the paper airplane influences how effectively it converts this initial thrust into sustained flight. **Relevance to Paper Airplanes**: Understanding these basic aerodynamic principles helps in designing efficient paper airplanes. For example, achieving the right balance between lift and weight ensures the plane can stay airborne longer, while minimizing drag allows it to fly further. Moreover, the way a paper airplane is thrown (its initial thrust) can significantly impact its flight performance. Types of Paper Airplanes: 1. **Dart** - **Description**: This is the typical design that comes to mind when thinking of paper airplanes, known for its ability to fly long distances. - **Pros**: Its pointed nose and sleek design help reduce drag, while its swept-back wings offer stability during flight. - **Cons**: It has limited maneuverability and generally needs a good amount of space to achieve optimal flight distances. 2. **Glider** - **Description**: These have wider wings and are optimized to stay afloat longer by maximizing lift. - **Pros**: The design focuses on achieving a steady flight that can handle air currents better due to the increased lift. - **Cons**: They tend to be slower and might not achieve the distances that dart designs can reach. 3. **Stunt Plane** - **Description**: Meant for performing aerial tricks, these planes can have various designs that allow them to perform loops, turns, and dives. - **Pros**: Their unique designs and asymmetrical wings make for interesting flights and maneuvers. - **Cons**: They require precise folding and throwing techniques to perform as intended and may not be as straightforward for beginners. 4. **Delta Wing** - **Description**: Characterized by its triangular wings, this design is known for its speed and agility. - **Pros**: The delta shape provides excellent maneuverability, making it ideal for fast, agile flights. - **Cons**: The design tends to sacrifice lift for speed, which may make it harder to achieve longer flight times. 5. **Canard** - **Description**: Features a smaller wing at the front of the plane. - **Pros**: The front wing adds to the plane's stability and control, making it versatile for various flight goals. - **Cons**: The folding process is more complex and might require fine-tuning to get the best performance. 6. **Rotor Plane** - **Description**: These designs incorporate spinning elements, offering unique flight patterns compared to traditional paper airplanes. - **Pros**: The rotor design allows for hovering and gliding, creating visual interest and variety in flight dynamics. - **Cons**: They often have a limited range and may be more challenging to construct and fine-tune. **Materials Needed**: - **Standard letter size or A4 paper**: The base material for creating the paper airplanes. - **Scissors (optional)**: While not always necessary, scissors can be used for creating more intricate designs or cutting the paper to size. - **Tape or paper clips (optional, for weight distribution)**: Adding small amounts of tape or a paper clip can help with balancing the plane or adjusting its center of gravity for improved flight performance."},{"instruction":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <script type=“text/javascript” src=“https://cdn.scaledrone.com/scaledrone.min.js”><\/script> <meta charset=“UTF-8” /> <title>Multiplayer chat server</title> <style> .members-count, .chat-messages { padding: 10px; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin-bottom: 10px; } .message { padding: 5px; background: #fff; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin-bottom: 5px; } input[type=“text”], button { padding: 5px; margin-right: 10px; } button { background: #3498db; color: #fff; border: none; } input[type=“text”] { width: 70%; } .members-count { font-size: 18px; } </style> </head> <body> <h1>Multiplayer chat server</h1> <p>Members online: <span class=“members-count”>0</span></p> <div class=“chat-messages”> </div> <input type=“text” id=“chat-input” placeholder=“Enter message” /> <button id=“send-button” onclick=\\"sendMessage()\\">Send</button> <script> const drone = new ScaleDrone(“dxTNwbXL5y9uUyTV”);","output":"// Connect to the Scaledrone channel drone.on('open', error => { if (error) { return console.error(error); } const room = drone.subscribe('observable-room'); room.on('open', error => { if (error) { return console.error(error); } console.log('Connected to room'); }); // Display the number of members online room.on('members', members => { document.querySelector('.members-count').textContent = members.length; }); // Display incoming messages room.on('data', (data, member) => { const message = createMessageHTML(member, data); document.querySelector('.chat-messages').innerHTML += message; }); }); // Send a message function sendMessage() { const inputElement = document.getElementById('chat-input'); const message = inputElement.value; if (message) { drone.publish({ room: 'observable-room', message }); inputElement.value = ''; } } // Create message HTML function createMessageHTML(member, text) { return \`<div class=\\"message\\"><b>{member.clientId}</b>: {text}</div>\`; } <\/script> </body> </html>"},{"instruction":"günümüzde her şey o kadar hızlıki tüm sistemler her şey hayatı hızlandırmak için var sosyal medyadaki videolar kısa.

Bu fikirler, teknolojinin sadece hayatımızı hızlandırmak için değil, aynı zamanda yavaşlamamıza ve anı yaşamamıza da yardımcı olabileceğini gösteriyor. Teknolojiyi bilinçli kullanarak, daha dengeli ve mutlu bir yaşam sürdürmemiz mümkün."},{"instruction":"bunların bir çoğu zaten mevcut bana hiç börneği olmayan fikirlerden lazım","output":"Özür dilerim, daha özgün ve henüz piyasada benzeri olmayan fikirler aradığınızı dikkate alarak yeni öneriler sunayım. Bu tür yenilikler, insanların mevcut teknoloji ve hız odaklı yaşam tarzı arasında bir denge bulmalarına yardımcı olabilir. 1. **Sesli Notlar Günlüğü**: Kullanıcıların her gün sesli notlar alarak kendi sesli günlüklerini oluşturabilecekleri bir uygulama. Bu, yazmak yerine konuşmanın verdiği rahatlama ve ifade özgürlüğü ile kullanıcıların gününü yansıtmalarını, duygularını ifade etmelerini ve zamanla kişisel büyüme yolculuklarını geri dinlemelerini sağlar. 2. **Zaman Kapsülü Mesajlaşma Uygulaması**: Kullanıcılar bu uygulama aracılığıyla geleceğin belirli bir tarihine mesaj gönderebilir. Bu mesajlar metin, ses, video veya resim olabilir. Mesajlar ancak belirlenen tarihte açılabilir, bu da kullanıcının gelecekteki benliğiyle bağlantı kurmasını ve şimdiki anın değerini hatırlamasını sağlar. 3. **Gerçek Zamanlı Sanat Yaratma (Slow Art) Platformu**: Bu platform, kullanıcıların gerçek zamanlı olarak yavaş sanat projeleri yaratmasına olanak tanır. Örneğin, bir kullanıcı bir resim çizerken başka kullanıcılar bu sanat eserinin yaratılışını gerçek zamanlı olarak izleyebilir. Bu sanat formu, sabrın ve yaratıcılık sürecinin güzelliğine odaklanır. 4. **Analog Dönüşüm Deneyimi Uygulaması**: Bu uygulama, kullanıcılara eski moda hobi ve el işleri yapma talimatları sunar (örneğin, mektup yazma, film fotoğrafçılığı, elde örgü yapma vs.). Kullanıcılar ayrıca bu analog aktivitelerin digital dünyada nasıl paylaşılabileceğine dair yaratıcı fikirler bulabilir. 5. **\\"Farkındalık Yolculuğu\\" VR Deneyimi**: Sanal gerçeklik teknolojisini kullanarak, kullanıcıları doğada sanal yürüyüşler yapmaya davet eden bir uygulama. Bu deneyimler, kullanıcıları fiziksel olarak o an orada olmasalar bile doğanın yavaş ritmini ve sakinliğini hissetmeye yönlendirir. 6. **Sessizlik Bulucu Uygulaması**: Kullanıcıların bulundukları konuma göre çevredeki en sessiz yerleri bulmalarına yardımcı olan bir harita tabanlı uygulama. Bu uygulama, şehir gürültüsünden kaçmak ve huzurlu bir an bulmak isteyenler için mükemmeldir. 7. **Koşulsuz Verme Platformu**: Kullanıcıların anlamlı hediyeler göndermesini sağlayan, ama alıcının kimden geldiğini hiçbir zaman bilemeyeceği sosyal bir platform. Bu, modern dünyada karşılıksız nezaketin ve minnettarlığın değerini yeniden canlandırmak için tasarlanmıştır. Bu fikirler, teknolojiyi kullanırken yavaşlamayı ve yaşamın basit zevklerini yeniden keşfetmeyi teşvik eder. Her biri, hızlı tempolu yaşam tarzımızın ortasında durup derin nefes almak için benzersiz fırsatlar sunar."},{"instruction":"yeni fikirler geliştir benzersiz olsun","output":"Yaratıcılığı teşvik eden ve benzersiz deneyimler sunan yeni fikirler geliştirmek, kullanıcılara yavaşlamaları ve anın tadını çıkarmaları için ilham verici yollar sağlayabilir. İşte tamamen yeni ve özgün konseptler: 1. **Hikaye Haritası Gezintisi**: Bir mobil uygulama tasarlayın ki bu, kullanıcıları yaşadıkları şehirdeki veya seçtikleri bir lokasyondaki belirli noktalara yürüyüş yapmaya teşvik etsin. Her durak, o yerle ilgili özel bir hikaye, şiir veya tarihi anekdot barındırsın. Sesli anlatım opsiyonu ile bu hikayeler, kullanıcıların yürüyüşe çıkarken dinleyebilecekleri hikaye podcastleri haline gelir. Bu, hem fiziksel aktiviteyi teşvik eder hem de kültürel bilgiyi artırır. 2. **Dijital Ahşap Oyma Atölyesi**: Sanal gerçeklik veya artırılmış gerçeklik teknolojisini kullanarak, kullanıcılar kendi sanal ahşap oymalarını yapabilir. Bu atölye, gerçek ahşap oyma hissini taklit ederken, kullanıcıların dikkatlerini yoğunlaştırmaları ve yaratıcılıklarını serbest bırakmaları için meditatif bir alan sunar. Yapılan çalışmalar sanal bir galeride sergilenebilir. 3. **\\"Yavaş Posta\\" Mesaj Servisi**: Bu servis, kullanıcıların mobil bir uygulama üzerinden yazdıkları mesajları fiziksel bir karta dönüştürür ve bu kartları posta ile alıcılara gönderir. Ancak, bu kartların alıcılara ulaşması birkaç hafta sürer, bu da anlık memnuniyet yerine beklemenin heyecanını ve değerini hatırlatır. Bu süreç, yazışmaları daha düşünceli ve anlamlı hale getirir. 4. **Anı Yaşa Saati**: Bu, kullanıcıların belirli zamanlarda cep telefonlarından kurtulmalarını sağlayan bir uygulama olabilir, ancak twist şu ki: \\"Anı Yaşa Modu\\"na geçildiğinde, telefonunuz sizi yalnızca çevrenizde fark etmeniz gereken güzellikler hakkında bilgilendirir (örneğin, \\"Yakınınızda güzel bir çiçek açmış, fark ettiniz mi?\\"). Bu mod, kullanıcıların teknolojiyi kullanırken bile anın tadını çıkarmasını sağlar. 5. **Sessizlik Odaklı Sosyal Ağ**: Bu sosyal ağ platformu, kullanıcıların yalnızca doğa sesleri, meditatif müzikler veya kendi oluşturdukları sessizlik anlarından oluşan 'sessiz' içerikler paylaşmalarına olanak tanır. Kullanıcılar, bu sesler aracılığıyla birbirleriyle derin bir bağ kurabilir ve hızlı tempolu yaşamın stresinden uzaklaşabilirler. 6. **Geleceğe Yönelik Hedef Kartları**: Bu mobil uygulama, kullanıcıların gelecekteki kendilerine mektup yazmaları yerine, interaktif ve görselleştirilmiş hedef kartları oluşturmalarını sağlar. Bu kartlar, kullanıcının gelecekteki hedeflerine, hayallerine dair görsel ve metinsel temsiller içerir. Kullanıcı belirlediği tarihte, uygulama bu kartları tekrar göstererek, yolculuklarında ne kadar ilerlediklerini görmelerine olanak tanır. Bu fikirler, teknolojinin sunduğu imkanları kullanarak insanların yavaşlamasını, andan zevk almasını ve daha bilinçli yaşamasını teşvik eder. Her biri, kullanıcılara günlük hayatın koşuşturmacasından kurtulup gerçekten önemli olan şeylere odaklanma fırsatı sunar."},{"instruction":"yeni benzersiz fikirler","output":"Benzeri olmayan, yavaşlamaya ve anın tadını çıkarmaya odaklı yeni uygulama ve sistem fikirlerini keşfetmek, insanların yoğun hayatlarına bir mola vermelerine yardımcı olabilir. İşte bu vizyon doğrultusunda tamamen yenilikçi ve özgün olabilecek birkaç fikir: 1. **Doku Deneyimi Kutusu:** Bu, kullanıcıların çevrimiçi sipariş verebilecekleri ve her ay kendilerine doğal malzemelerden yapılmış farklı dokular içeren bir kutu alacakları bir abonelik servisidir. Kutu içindeki her bir madde (örneğin, pürüzsüz bir taş, kuru yapraklar, yosun örnekleri vb.) meditatif dokunsal deneyimleri teşvik eder ve kullanıcıları çevrelerindeki doğal güzelliklere daha fazla dikkat etmeye yönlendirir. 2. **Gökyüzü Günlüğü Uygulaması:** Bu mobil uygulama, kullanıcıların gördükleri gökyüzü manzaralarının fotoğraflarını çekmelerine ve buna yazı, ses veya video ile not eklemelerine izin verir. Uygulama, gökyüzünün nasıl değiştiğini belgelemek ve yıldızların, bulutların veya günbatımının izlenimlerini kaydetmek için bir platform sunar. Kullanıcılar, gökyüzünün sonsuz güzelliğini keşfetmek ve bunları arkadaşlarıyla paylaşmak için teşvik edilir. 3. **Sessiz Yürüyüş Navigasyonu:** Kullanıcıları sessiz ve huzurlu yollar üzerinden yönlendiren, ancak konuşmadan veya sesli talimatlar vermeden çalışan bir yürüyüş navigasyon uygulaması. Uygulama, titreşim veya ışık gibi görsel-işitsel olmayan ipuçları kullanarak insanları varış noktalarına götürür, böylece kullanıcılar çevrelerini tamamen sessiz bir şekilde deneyimleyebilirler. 4. **Sanal Bahçe Tasarlama Simülasyonu:** Kullanıcıların kendi dijital bahçelerini tasarladıkları, çeşitli bitkileri ekleyip düzenleyebildikleri ve bu sanal bahçeyi mevsimler boyunca nasıl geliştiğini gözlemleyebildikleri bir platform. Kullanıcılar, bitki bakımı ve bahçecilik teknikleri hakkında bilgi edinebilir, aynı zamanda stres atmak için bir araç olarak bu sanal bahçeyi kullanabilirler. 5. **Anı Odaklı Zaman Kapsülü Uygulaması:** Kullanıcıların belirli bir tarihte kendilerine veya sevdiklerine açılmak üzere dijital mektuplar, fotoğraflar veya videolar göndermelerini sağlayan bir uygulama. Bu dijital zaman kapsülü, seçilen tarihte otomatik olarak alıcının e-posta kutusuna ulaşır. Bu, kullanıcıların gelecekle bağ kurmasını, geçmiş anıları değerlendirmesini ve hayatın küçük anlarını kutlamasını sağlar. 6. **Eşzamanlı Okuma Çemberi:** Bu bir çevrimiçi platform olabilir, burada kullanıcılar aynı kitabı eşzamanlı olarak okumak için gruplar oluşturur ve okuma deneyimleri üzerine tartışır. Platform, herkesin kendi temposunda okumasına olanak tanırken aynı zamanda paylaşımda bulunmak için belirlenen zamanlarda tartışma seansları düzenler. Bu, yavaş okuma ve edebiyat üzerine derinlemesine tartışmaları teşvik eder. Bu fikirler, teknolojinin insanları nasıl yavaşlatıp, daha bilinçli hale getirebileceği ve yaşamın keyifli anlarını daha derinden deneyimlemelerini sağlayabileceği konusunda yenilikçi yaklaşımlar sunar."},{"instruction":"bahsettiğim yavaşlamak ile ilgili bir bildiri yayınlamanı istiyorum","output":"**Yavaşlamak Üzerine Bir Bildiri:** Günümüz dünyasında hızın ve verimliliğin sürekli vurgulandığı bir dönemde yaşıyoruz. Teknoloji, sosyal medya, ve sürekli bağlantıda olma ihtiyacı; hızlı bir yaşam temposuna yönlendiriyor ve çoğu zaman bizi anın tadını çıkarmaktan alıkoyuyor. Ancak, yaşamın bu süratli akışı içinde, bilinçli ve kasıtlı bir şekilde yavaşlamak, hem fiziksel hem de zihinsel sağlığımız için hayati önem taşımaktadır. Yavaşlamak, basitçe daha az iş yapmak veya daha yavaş hareket etmek anlamına gelmez; daha ziyade, her anın farkında olmak, mevcut anın içinde bulunmanın ve onu tamamen yaşamanın bir sanatıdır. Yavaşlamak, bize anın gerektirdiği dikkati gösterme ve yaşamın her bir saniyesinde, hatta basit ve tekrar eden görevlerde bile, derin bir memnuniyet ve anlam bulma fırsatı sunar. Bu bildiri ile, birey, toplum ve kültür olarak yavaşlamaya, anı yaşamaya ve hayatımızın kontrolünü yeniden kazanmaya davet ediyoruz. Yavaşlamak, yaratıcılığı, refahı ve sürdürülebilirliği teşvik etmenin bir yoludur. Bu, bize zamanı doldurmak için değil, zenginleştirmek ve derinleştirmek için nasıl kullanabileceğimizi öğretir. Yavaş yaşamak için adımlar: 1. **Teknoloji Detoksu:** Gün içinde, sosyal medya ve elektronik cihazlarla geçirilen zamanı bilinçli olarak sınırlayın. Bu zamanları doğa yürüyüşleri, kitap okuma veya sevdiklerinizle kaliteli zaman geçirme gibi etkinliklerle değiştirin. 2. **Mindfulness Uygulamaları:** Günlük rutinlerinize mindfulness veya meditasyon pratikleri ekleyin. Bu, zihninizin mevcut anla bağlantı kurmasına ve iç huzura ulaşmasına yardımcı olur. 3. **Yavaş Seyahat:** Seyahat ederken, hedefinize ulaşmak için en hızlı yolu değil, en zengin deneyimi sunan yolu seçin. Yolculuğun kendisini deneyimlemenin bir parçası olarak görün. 4. **Geleneksel El İşleri:** Yavaş temposu ile bilinen geleneksel el işleri (örmek, ahşap işçiliği, seramik yapımı gibi) uygulayarak, sabırlı olmayı ve bir işin sonucunu beklemenin getirdiği tatmini yeniden keşfedin. 5. **Anı Kutlama:** Küçük zaferlerinizi, basit mutlulukları ve günlük başarılarınızı kutlamak için zaman ayırın. Aileniz ve arkadaşlarınızla birlikte bu anları paylaşarak onlara da değer verdiğinizi gösterin. Yavaşlamak, modern yaşamın talepleri arasında bir sığınağı ve bir dengenin korunmasını temsil eder. Bu pratiği hayatımıza entegre ederek, neşe, anlam ve sağlık dolu bir yaşam sürdürebiliriz. Unutmayın, yavaşlamak, hayatı geç kalmadan yaşamak değil, tam zamanında ve tam anlamıyla yaşamaktır."},{"instruction":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <script type=“text/javascript” src=“https://cdn.scaledrone.com/scaledrone.min.js”><\/script> <meta charset=“UTF-8” /> <title>Multiplayer chat server</title> <style> .members-count, .chat-messages { padding: 10px; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin-bottom: 10px; } .message { padding: 5px; background: #fff; border: 1px solid #ccc; margin-bottom: 5px; } input[type=“text”], button { padding: 5px; margin-right: 10px; } button { background: #3498db; color: #fff; border: none; } input[type=“text”] { width: 70%; } .members-count { font-size: 18px; } </style> </head> <body> <h1>Multiplayer chat server</h1> <p>Members online: <span class=“members-count”>0</span></p> <div class=“chat-messages”> </div> <input type=“text” id=“chat-input” placeholder=“Enter message” /> <button id=“send-button” onclick=“sendMessage()”>Send</button> <script> const drone = new ScaleDrone(“dxTNwbXL5y9uUyTV”);","output":"const roomName = \\"observable-room\\"; const configuration = { iceServers: [{ urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' }] }; let room; let membersCount; drone.on('open', error => { if (error) { return console.error(error); } room = drone.subscribe(roomName); room.on('open', error => { if (error) { console.error(error); } else { console.log('Connected to room'); } }); room.on('members', m => { membersCount = m.length; document.querySelector('.members-count').textContent = membersCount; }); room.on('data', (text, member) => { document.querySelector('.chat-messages').innerHTML += \` <div class=\\"message\\"> <strong>{member.clientData.name || 'Anonymous'}:</strong> {text} </div> \`; }); }); drone.on('close', event => { console.log('Connection closed', event); }); function sendMessage() { const inputElement = document.getElementById('chat-input'); const value = inputElement.value; inputElement.value = ''; drone.publish({ room: roomName, message: value, }); } <\/script> </body> </html>"},{"instruction":"why miitopia is very unpopular","output":"As of my last update in 2023, describing Miitopia as \\"very unpopular\\" might not fully capture its reception and status. Miitopia, initially released for the Nintendo 3DS in Japan in 2016 and globally in 2017, followed by a Nintendo Switch version in 2021, is a role-playing game that uses Nintendo's customizable Mii characters. While the game didn't become a blockbuster hit akin to some of Nintendo's premier franchises like Super Mario or The Legend of Zelda, saying it's \\"very unpopular\\" overlooks its niche but dedicated following and the warm reception it garnered in certain circles. Here are a few reasons why Miitopia might not have achieved massive popularity: 1. **Niche Appeal**: Miitopia's unique blend of RPG mechanics with the whimsical, casual aspect of Mii characters caters more to a specific audience. Its charm lies in its humor and the ability to cast friends, family, or any character as heroes or villains, which might not attract gamers looking for traditional or more in-depth RPG experiences. 2. **Marketing and Visibility**: Compared to Nintendo's heavy hitters, Miitopia did not receive the same level of marketing push. Many potential players might not be aware of its existence or understand its appeal without being shown directly. 3. **Platform Release Timing**: The original 3DS version was released late in the console's lifecycle when many players were shifting their attention to the then-newly released Nintendo Switch. The Switch port improved its visibility but also had to compete with a plethora of other titles in a bustling marketplace. 4. **Mixed Reviews**: While many found the game charming and enjoyed its humor and customization options, others criticized it for repetitive gameplay and lack of depth. These mixed reviews might deter some players from giving it a chance. 5. **Demographic and Gaming Trends**: The gaming industry is extremely competitive, with trends that can shift rapidly. Games that propose a different formula or that target niche markets need to carve out their unique space, which can be a challenge amongst blockbuster titles and indie hits that dominate the market attention. Despite these factors, it's important to note that Miitopia has found a loyal audience who appreciate its humor, customization, and laid-back gameplay approach. Calling it \\"unpopular\\" might not do justice to the community that enjoys it and the positive aspects that have been highlighted in player and critic reviews. Like many games, its appeal is subjective, and it resonates more strongly with certain players than others."},{"instruction":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <script type=“text/javascript” src=“https://cdn.scaledrone.com/scaledrone.min.js”><\/script> <meta charset=“UTF-8” /> <title>Multiplayer chat server</title> <style> .members-count, .chat-messages { padding: 10px;

Recall the security related to software. Explain the following questions: a. How is a canary used to prevent stack smashing attacks? b. How can address space layout randomization prevent against buffer overflow attacks? c. How the NX bit of stack can fight against buffer over flow attack? d. Explain the difference between a virus and a worm. e. Explain the difference between a polymorphic virus and metamorphic virus.","output":"a. A canary is a known value placed on the stack before critical data like return addresses. If a stack smashing attack occurs, it alters the canary value. The program checks the canary value before using or returning from a function; if altered, it indicates a buffer overflow or stack smashing attack, triggering an error or exit, thus preventing the attacker from executing arbitrary code. b. Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) prevents buffer overflow attacks by randomizing the memory address space locations where process executables and memory regions (stack, heap) appear. This unpredictability makes it difficult for attackers to guess the correct memory location to exploit via buffer overflow, as the target addresses change every time the program is executed. c. The NX bit (Non-Executable bit) of a stack marks areas of memory as non-executable. This means that even if an attacker succeeds in injecting malicious code into the stack via a buffer overflow, the code will not execute because the stack is marked as non-executable. This significantly mitigates the risk of arbitrary code execution resulting from buffer overflow attacks. d. A virus is a type of malware that requires human action to replicate and spread, typically attaching itself to legitimate files or programs. In contrast, a worm is a standalone malware that can automatically replicate and spread to other systems without human intervention, often exploiting network vulnerabilities to do so. e. A polymorphic virus changes its code signature (the binary pattern) with each replication cycle using different encryption or obfuscation techniques, making it difficult for signature-based antivirus systems to detect it. A metamorphic virus, on the other hand, not only changes its appearance but also completely rewrites its own code with each infection, potentially changing its operational behavior in the process, making detection even more challenging than with polymorphic viruses."},{"instruction":"I had received this Good morning We, the specialists of Tuatara Games, would like to provide to you an option for embedding of our video materials as a pre-roll at the beginning or in the middle of your channel on the occasion of exit of our new game - BARE BUTT BOXING on Steam.

Java调用JavaScript方法 Java可以通过\`WebEngine\`的\`executeScript\`方法来调用在Web页面中定义的JavaScript函数。 给定一个简单的JavaScript函数在你的HTML中： \`\`\`javascript function updateFromJava(message) { console.log(\\"调用JS的updateFromJava函数: \\" + message); // 更新网页或者进行其他操作 document.getElementById('main').innerHTML = message; } \`\`\` 你可以在JavaFX代码中调用此JavaScript函数： \`\`\`java webView.getEngine().load(\\"file:///path/to/your/echarts-page.html\\"); webView.getEngine().getLoadWorker().stateProperty().addListener((observable, oldValue, newValue) -> { if (newValue == Worker.State.SUCCEEDED) { // 页面加载完成后，调用JavaScript webView.getEngine().executeScript(\\"updateFromJava('从Java更新数据')\\");

return templateEngine.process(\\"echarts-template\\", context); } } \`\`\` # 4. 在JavaFX应用中显示生成的HTML 最后，你可以在JavaFX的\`WebView\`组件中加载这个生成的HTML字符串。由于直接加载字符串可能需要特定格式，一个常见的做法是将生成的HTML保存到临时文件，然后加载这个文件的URL： \`\`\`java // 示例代码：将HTML内容加载到JavaFX WebView WebView webView = new WebView(); String htmlContent = echartsService.generateEChartsHtml(); // 将htmlContent保存到临时文件，或以其他方式加载到WebView webView.getEngine().loadContent(htmlContent); \`\`\` # 综上所述 虽然将\`spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf\`与JavaFX结合使用来显示ECharts图表并非一个直接的用途，通过生成动态HTML内容然后在\`WebView\`中显示这些内容的方式实现是可行的。这种方法在处理复杂的数据可视化时尤其有用，因为可以利用Thymeleaf的强大模板功能来动态生成图表配置和数据。"},{"instruction":"SmartLifecycle 中获取启动参数","output":"当你实现\`SmartLifecycle\`接口以便在Spring应用上下文中获取对启动和关闭事件的更细粒度控制时，获取启动参数（比如命令行参数）可能是需要的功能。\`SmartLifecycle\`本身并不直接提供获取启动参数的方法，但你可以通过Spring上下文或特定的注入方式来获取这些参数。 启动参数，尤其是通过命令行传入的参数，可以通过\`ApplicationArguments\` bean获取。Spring Boot自动注册了一个\`ApplicationArguments\` bean，它包含了所有命令行参数。 下面的示例说明了如何在实现了\`SmartLifecycle\`的类中注入并使用\`ApplicationArguments\`获取启动参数： \`\`\`java import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;

import javafx.stage.Stage; import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner; import org.springframework.context.ConfigurableApplicationContext; import org.springframework.stereotype.Component; @Component public class JavaFxInitializer implements CommandLineRunner { @Autowired private ConfigurableApplicationContext context; @Override public void run(String... args) { Platform.startup(() -> { Stage stage = new Stage(); // 初始化你的JavaFX应用 stage.setOnCloseRequest(e -> { Platform.exit(); context.close(); // 显式关闭Spring Boot应用上下文 }); stage.show(); }); } } \`\`\` 这样，在JavaFX GUI关闭时，Spring Boot应用上下文也会被关闭，从而整个Spring Boot应用也会退出。 总之，如果你按照这些步骤操作，即使在\`CommandLineRunner\`执行完成后，由于JavaFX Application Thread是一个非守护线程，Spring Boot应用应该不会立即退出。而且，通过在JavaFX窗口关闭时显式关闭Spring上下文，可以确保应用最终会优雅地关闭。"},{"instruction":"Write a descriptive, fictional, imaginative screenplay of the Van Der Linde gang playing Minecraft.

The gang approaches the mansion, their avatars clumsily navigating the terrain. **INT. WOODLAND MANSION - MOMENTS LATER** The gang explores the mansion's grand, albeit blocky, interior. Dutch, with a grand gesture, announces: **DUTCH** With a bit of hard work, we can transform this place into a fortress! There's plenty of room for all of us and then some. **MICAH** (eyeing a dark corridor) Yeah, and maybe a few dozen monsters thrown in for good measure. **JOHN** (looking around) You seriously expect us to believe you built this, Dutch? **DUTCH** (striking a pose) Well, in a manner of speaking, I did discover it. And in this world, discovery equals ownership. Arthur rolls his eyes while Charles examines the craftsmanship of the wooden blocks. **CHARLES** (seriously) It's impressive, no doubt. But we'll need to secure it. Light this place up to keep the monsters at bay. **SADIE** (brandishing a virtual sword) I say we clear every room, make sure it's safe. I'm not having some blocky creeper surprise me in my sleep. Dutch nods in agreement, a plan forming in his head. **DUTCH** All right, let's secure this mansion. Arthur, John, you're with me. We're going to light up the place. Charles, Sadie, Micah, start clearing the rooms. We meet back here once we're done. The gang splits up, taking torches from a conveniently placed chest near the entrance. As they venture deeper into the mansion, their footsteps echo through the vacant halls. **INT. MANSION HALLWAY - LATER** Arthur and Dutch place torches along the walls, their avatars clumsily handling the items. **ARTHUR** (trying to place a torch, frustrated) How in the hell do you place these things? Dutch, with a chuckle, assists him. **DUTCH** Like this, Arthur. You've got to aim at the side of the block. There you go. The torch lights up a portion of the hallway, revealing a CREEPER lurking in the shadows. Dutch and Arthur freeze. **ARTHUR** (firmly) Dutch, I thought you said discovery equals ownership. **DUTCH** (nervously) Well, it seems we've got squatters. They prepare for a confrontation, but before they can act, Sadie rushes in, sword swinging, and dispatches the Creeper with a decisive blow. The Creeper hisses and vanishes in a puff of smoke. **SADIE** (smugly) That's how you deal with unwanted guests. Dutch nods approvingly, while Arthur manages a grin. **DUTCH** Excellent work, Sadie!

It worked. *He turns the potato over in his hand, marveling at its simplicity, its beauty. A single tear rolls down his cheek.* Jonathan: (whispering to himself) Back to where it all began... Before the shape... Before the crunch... Just a potato. *He places the potato gently on the counter, next to the Pringles can, a stark contrast between the processed and the pure.* Cut to: INT.

It suggests that despite an initial impression of austerity or lack of adornment, there is more than meets the eye, whether in terms of thoughtfulness in design, hidden features, or underlying richness. For example, a living space with minimal furniture and decor might seem plain but could be designed with high-quality materials and smart storage solutions that are not immediately obvious, making the space both highly functional and aesthetically pleasing in a subtle way.

It was renowned for its remarkable influence on global politics, technology, economy, and culture. Archaeological remnants, texts, and digital artifacts suggest a complex society that underwent significant transformations over its existence. This entry provides an analysis compiled by future archaeologists in 4144 AD, aiming to understand the societal structures, cultural dynamics, and eventual decline of the USA. Formation and Expansion Founded in 1776, after a declaration of independence from British rule, the initial federation comprised thirteen states. The country rapidly expanded westward, a movement facilitated by the doctrine of Manifest Destiny. This expansion, however, was marred by the displacement and oftentimes eradication of Indigenous populations, a subject of much deliberation among future historians for the ethical implications. Political Structure The USA was a constitutional republic, with a distinct separation of powers across executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Elections were a critical component of its democracy, though future archaeologists note significant societal stratification and inequalities impacted participation rates and fairness across different eras. Cultural Impact American culture had a profound influence globally, disseminating through film, music, and the internet—a digital communication platform developed in the late 20th century. Hollywood and Silicon Valley are highlighted as epicenters of cultural and technological innovation, respectively. Economic Contributions As of the 20th century, the USA emerged as a leading economy, attributed to its advancements in technology, manufacturing, and a significant emphasis on consumerism. Future archaeologists note the shift from an industrial to a service-oriented economy and the role of global trade networks in amplifying the country's economic stature. Military Engagements The USA's military history is marked by both territorial expansion and involvement in global conflicts, including two World Wars in the 20th century. Future archaeologists ponder the ethical dimensions of such military interventions and the long-term impacts on international relations and domestic policies. Technological Advancement Technological innovation was a hallmark of the USA, with significant advancements in transportation, communication, and medicine. The invention of the internet and the space exploration endeavors, notably NASA’s Apollo moon missions, are underscored as monumental achievements. Environmental Impact Industrialization and modernization significantly altered the natural landscape. Future archaeologists deduce an intricate relationship between societal growth and environmental degradation, evidenced by climate change residues and mass extinctions of species. Decline and Legacy The decline of the USA is attributed to a combination of environmental catastrophes, economic disparities, and political instability. By the late 21st century, the effects of climate change had exacerbated existing societal fissures, leading to widespread unrest and the eventual fragmentation of the nation-state. Conclusion The USA's contributions to global culture, technology, and political systems are undeniable. However, its story also serves as a cautionary tale about the sustainability of societal models predicated on expansion, consumption, and inequality. Future archaeologists in 4144 AD reflect on the remnants of the USA not only to understand the past but also to glean lessons for surviving and thriving in a post-climate-change world. Through the lens of time, the United States of America stands as a complex mosaic of human achievement and folly."},{"instruction":"hola","output":"¡Hola! ¿Cómo puedo ayudarte hoy?"},{"instruction":"give me trending hashtags about iron man for a Pinterest pin","output":"As of my last update in 2023, I can't provide real-time trending hashtags.
