A few days later we were supposed to go out again and she texted me earlier in the day and said that she was busy and had tons of homework but again suggested another day. Third times the charm right? Wrong. She cancels our date for the third time but says she feels super bad and says we can hang out the next day.

He was the second child of Eula (nee Wade) and Isaac Hayes, Sr. After his mother died young and his father abandoned his family, Isaac, Jr., was raised by his maternal grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. Willie Wade, Sr. The child of a sharecropper family, he grew up working on farms in Shelby County, Tennessee, and in Tipton County. By 1974, Stax Records was having serious financial problems, stemming from problems with overextension and limited record sales and distribution. Hayes himself was deep in debt to Union Planters Bank, which administered loans for the Stax label and many of its other key employees. In September of that year, Hayes sued Stax for 5.3 million. As Stax was in deep debt and could not pay, the label made an arrangement with Hayes and Union Planters: Stax released Hayes from his recording and production contracts, and Union Planters would collect all of Hayes's income and apply it towards his debts. Hayes formed his own label, Hot Buttered Soul, which released its product through ABC Records.  His new album, 1975's Chocolate Chip, saw Hayes embrace the disco sound with the title track and lead single. \\"I Can't Turn Around\\" would prove a popular song as time went on. This would be Hayes's last album to chart in the top 40 for many years. Later in the year, the all-instrumental Disco Connection album fully embraced disco.  In 1976, the album cover of Juicy Fruit featured Hayes in a pool with naked women, and spawned the title track single and the classic \\"Storm Is Over\\". Later the same year the Groove-A-Thon album featured the singles \\"Rock Me Easy Baby\\" and the title track. However, while all these albums were regarded as solid efforts, Hayes was no longer selling large numbers. He and his wife were forced into bankruptcy in 1976, as they owed over 6 million.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please briefly summarize this news article: Senator Rubio Makes Life Tough for Small Insurers Senator Marco Rubio of Florida is boasting about his efforts to sabotage a program intended to keep health insurance markets stable and premiums low during the start-up years of the Affordable Care Act. He claims to be the only Republican presidential candidate who has scored a victory over Obamacare. There is a smidgen of truth to that — his sabotage effort actually became law and was not just a symbolic vote to “repeal Obamacare.” His blow will cause temporary inconvenience for hundreds of thousands of people covered by small insurers. Fortunately, it will not undermine the viability of health insurance markets for the long haul. Mr. Rubio’s target is the “risk corridor” program, the smallest of three programs designed to protect insurance companies from unexpectedly high losses and thus encourage them to offer policies to individuals and families on the new health insurance exchanges. Insurers that suffered losses because they ended up with a mix of enrollees that proved costlier than they had predicted — with more sick people and not enough young and healthy people — would be compensated under the program by insurers that did better than predicted. The three-year program, which began last year, was supposed to be financed entirely by these transfers among insurers and not cost the taxpayers anything. Unfortunately, the first-year losses greatly exceeded the money to cover them. Insurers that suffered losses asked for almost 2.9 billion in compensation, but the insurers that did better than expected had put in less than 400 million under the program’s formulas, or just 12.6 percent of the money requested. Mr. Rubio attached a rider to a 2015 spending bill that prevented the administration from shuffling money around to cover the 2014 shortfall, and he proposes to do the same thing in next year’s spending bill. To put the problem in perspective, the 2.5 billion shortfall in 2014 is a small part of the tens of billions in total premiums collected on the exchanges and a minuscule part of the hundreds of billions of dollars collected for all health insurance premiums in 2014. Large companies that predicted their mix of patients well or have diverse businesses to offset initial losses on the exchanges have weathered the storm. Aetna and Anthem will stay in the exchanges, for example. But UnitedHealth Group, a major provider of employer-based insurance, said it is suffering big losses in the exchanges this year and will consider dropping out of them in 2017. The big losers were small insurers without ample reserves. More than a dozen nonprofit cooperatives that were new to the business have closed or soon will, in part, some of them say, because the government provided less money than they were counting on, and some small for-profit insurers have closed as well. This has left hundreds of thousands of consumers scrambling to pick other plans. Mr. Rubio brags that he saved the taxpayers 2.5 billion that would have been used to “bail out” insurers, but that is a bizarre way to characterize the way he disrupted a careful plan to smooth the transition to health care reform for businesses and individuals. His riders will benefit big insurers by driving out their smaller competitors. They could also drive up premiums for some people, as insurers try to recoup early losses or replenish their reserves. The Senate should block his new rider and find other sources of funds to pay companies what they were promised. A version of this editorial appears in print on December 14, 2015, on page A22 of the New York edition with the headline: Mr. Rubio Undermines Small Insurers. Today's Paper|Subscribe","output":"Senator Marco Rubio from Florida has taken steps to sabotage a program intended to maintain stability in health insurance markets and keep premiums low during the early years of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Rubio attached a rider to a 2015 spending bill that stopped the administration from using money to cover a shortfall in 2014, and he plans to do the same in next year's bill. This legislation will cause temporary issues for smaller insurers and the hundreds of thousands of people they cover. However, it will not affect the long-term stability of health insurance markets. Rubio’s focus is on the \\"risk corridor\\" program, which aims to protect insurance companies from unusually high losses and encourage them to offer policies to individuals and families on new health insurance exchanges. The program, which started in 2014, was designed to be funded by transferring money among insurers without costing taxpayers. Unfortunately, first-year losses far exceeded the available funds to cover them. The 2014 shortfall of 2.5 billion is a small fraction of the total premiums collected on exchanges and an even smaller part of the overall health insurance premiums collected that year. Large companies, like Aetna and Anthem, have managed to withstand the storm, as their businesses are diverse enough to offset initial losses on exchanges. However, smaller insurers lacking sufficient reserves have struggled. As a result, over a dozen nonprofit cooperatives have closed or will close, and some small for-profit insurers have shut down as well. This leaves consumers scrambling to find alternative plans. Rubio claims to have saved taxpayers 2.5 billion by stopping insurer \\"bailouts\\", but his actions have disrupted a carefully planned transition to healthcare reform for businesses and individuals. His measures may benefit large insurers by eliminating smaller competitors and potentially driving up premiums for some people.

Its entry in the ICTV database indicates this virus is a Sadwavirus but current literature indicates that it may be a Cheravirus .  - Juice is a beverage made from the extraction or pressing out of the natural liquid contained in fruit and vegetables. It can also refer to liquids that are flavored with these or other biological food sources such as meat and seafood (e.g., clam juice). Juice is commonly consumed as a beverage or used as an ingredient or flavoring in foods or other beverages, such as smoothies. Juice emerged as a popular beverage choice after the development of pasteurization methods allowed for its preservation without using fermentation (the approach used with wine production). The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimated the total world production of citrus fruit juices to be 12,840,318 tonnes in 2012. The largest fruit juice consumers are New Zealand (nearly a cup, or 8 ounces, each day) and Colombia (more than three quarters of a cup each day). Fruit juice consumption on average increased with country income level.  - In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.  - The Picornavirales are an order of viruses with vertebrate, insect, and plant hosts. This group consists of viruses which have positive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes.  - Cheravirus is a genus of viruses in the order Picornavirales, in the family Secoviridae. Plants serve as natural hosts. There are currently four species in this genus including the type species Cherry rasp leaf virus.  - An accessory fruit (sometimes called \\"false fruit\\", \\"spurious fruit\\", \\"pseudofruit\\", or \\"pseudocarp\\") is a fruit in which some of the flesh is derived not from the ovary but from some adjacent tissue exterior to the carpel. Examples of accessory tissue are the receptacle of the strawberry, pineapple, common fig, and mulberry, and the calyx of \\"Gaultheria procumbens\\" or \\"Syzygium jambos\\". Pomes, such as apples and pears, are also accessory fruits, with much of the fruit flesh derived from a hypanthium. Other example could be the \\"anthocarps\\" specific to the family Nyctaginaceae, where most of the fruit comes from the perianth (floral whorls).  - \\"Perfume\\" is a mixture of fragrant essential oils or aroma compounds, fixatives and solvents - used to give the human body, animals, food, objects, and living-spaces \\"a pleasant scent\\".  - Cherry rasp leaf virus (CRLV) is a plant pathogenic virus of the order Picornavirales, family Secoviridae, subfamily Comovirinae, genus Cheravirus.  - The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa) is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus \\"Fragaria\\" (collectively known as the strawberries). It is cultivated worldwide for its fruit. The fruit (which is not a botanical berry, but an aggregate accessory fruit) is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as preserves, fruit juice, pies, ice creams, milkshakes, and chocolates. Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in many products like lip gloss, candy, hand sanitizers, perfume, and many others.  - Secoviridae is a family of viruses in the order Picornavirales. Plants serve as natural hosts. There are currently 73 species in this family, divided among 11 genera.  - Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown food preparation of \\"Theobroma cacao\\" seeds, roasted and ground, and often flavored with vanilla. It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Mokaya (Mexico and Guatemala), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 1900 BCE. In fact, the majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as \\"xocoltl\\" , a Nahuatl word meaning \\"bitter water\\". The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor.  - Sadwavirus is a genus of viruses in the order Picornavirales, in the family Secoviridae. Plants (specifically Satsuma mandarin trees) serve as natural hosts. There is currently only one species in this genus: the type species \\"Satsuma dwarf virus\\". Diseases associated with this genus include: satsuma dwarf virus disease which causes spoon-shaped leaves on citrus tree. Symptoms are enations, multiple flushing, stunting or dwarfing, reduction in number and size of leaves and fruits. The name of this genus comes from its type species: Satsuma dwarf virus.  - Fragaria is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family, Rosaceae, commonly known as strawberries for their edible fruits. There are more than 20 described species and many hybrids and cultivars. The most common strawberries grown commercially are cultivars of the garden strawberry, a hybrid known as \\"Fragaria\\" × \\"ananassa\\". Strawberries have a taste that varies by cultivar, and ranges from quite sweet to rather tart. Strawberries are an important commercial fruit crop, widely grown in all temperate regions of the world.    What is the relationship between 'strawberry latent ringspot virus' and 'secoviridae'? A:","output":"Strawberry latent ringspot virus (SLRSV) is a plant pathogenic virus.

We want to find the value of 'h'. We have -75 * h - 89 * h = -126 * h + 646 First, let's look at the side with the minus signs: -75 * h - 89 * h. We can put these two h's together, like when we add apples and apples. So we have: -75 * h + (- 89 * h) = -164*h Now, our equation becomes: -164 * h = -126 * h + 646 Now let's try to get all the h's on one side and the other numbers on the other side. We can add 126 * h to both sides. That means our equation will now be: -164 * h + 126 * h = 646 When we put these two h's together, we get: -38 * h = 646 Now we want to find the value of h, so we need to get rid of the -38 in front of it. Since it's multiplied by h, we can get h alone by dividing by -38: h = 646 / -38 When we divide 646 by -38, we get: h = -17 So, our final answer is h = -17. Yay!

Summarize this article: The move follows an investigation into Indonesian abattoirs by Australia's ABC broadcaster, which showed graphic footage of animals being mistreated. It prompted a public outcry and demands for the government to act. Last week, Canberra suspended exports to abattoirs shown in the programme, but now it has issued a blanket ban. Indonesian officials have rebuffed claims of widespread animal cruelty in their abattoirs. Bayu Krisnamurti, the Vice Minister of Agriculture, told the BBC that the coverage had created a negative perception of Indonesia overseas. \\"I think ABC practised unfair journalism, only the bad practices were portrayed. We see this as an isolated incident. \\"It's against the law in Indonesia to be so harsh and cruel to animals. Indonesian regulations explicity say we must practise animal welfare in handling animals in the slaughterhouse.\\" He acknowledged that it could hurt the country's ability to procure cattle. He said that New Zealand and the US were being looked at as possible alternative suppliers, but Jakarta had not yet contacted either. The ban is the result of public revulsion and outrage at the gruesome footage from Indonesia's abattoirs that was broadcast last week in an ABC TV documentary, says the BBC's Nick Bryant in Sydney. It showed steers being whipped, beaten and slashed repeatedly, and suffering terrible pain before they are slaughtered. Read more from Nick Bryant's blog Australia first announced a ban on live exports to the 12 abattoirs featured in the programme. But the public demanded more, signing online petitions to halt the trade with Indonesia and pressing lawmakers in Canberra to bring in a complete ban, our correspondent says. Australia's Agriculture Minister Joe Ludwig said Canberra would impose a six-month initial suspension on shipments to Indonesia. \\"A sustainable live cattle export industry must be built on the ability to safeguard the welfare of the animals. The trade to Indonesia will only recommence when we are certain industry is able to comply with that.\\" Lyn White, who filmed the graphic images, and is the campaign director for Animals Australia, welcomed the move. \\"There has been an extraordinary outpouring of rage that our cattle have been treated like this and have been supplied for such treatment. So this is a first step,\\" she told Australian television. An early indication that a blanket ban was about to come into effect came on Tuesday, when about 2,000 cattle were not allowed to board a ship in Western Australia that was about to set sail for Indonesia. Australia exports more than 700,000 cattle each year - the vast majority to Indonesia. Australian farmers have warned that a ban would destroy many rural livelihoods. Butchers have already reported that beef sales are down by up to 15%. But Luke Bowen from the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association said he accepted the government's action, even though it would prove costly. \\"It is going to hurt, we know that,\\" he said. \\"There's tens of thousands of cattle in the supply chains now. But we have to stay focused on the animal welfare outcome, and we're very encouraged by the government's commitment to the trade in the long term.\\" Summary:","output":"An Australian TV channel showed a video of animals being mistreated in Indonesian abattoirs, which made a lot of people upset. Because of this, the Australian government has stopped sending animals to those places in Indonesia for six months. They will only start sending animals again when they are sure the animals will be treated better. Australia sends over 700,000 cattle to Indonesia each year, so this will have a big impact on both countries. Some people in Australia are worried about how this will affect their jobs, but they know it is important to take care of the animals."},{"instruction":"Title: I woundn't Die Review: I wish everyone with such an interesting life story would publish a book.

Given the following passage  \\"During the 1760s and early 1770s, relations between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily because of resentment of the British Parliament's attempts to govern and tax American colonists without their consent. This was summarised at the time by the slogan \\"No taxation without representation\\", a perceived violation of the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen. The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government. In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775. The following year, in 1776, the United States declared independence. The entry of France to the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms.

The town hires lawman and peacekeeper Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and his deputy Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) to protect and regain control of the town. The pair agree on one condition: that the town follow Cole's law and essentially cede control to him. The lawmen begin by confronting four of Bragg's men who are causing a disturbance in the saloon. Three men refuse to allow themselves to be arrested, forcing Cole and Hitch to kill them. The fourth man surrenders and leaves the saloon. Bragg has a meeting with Cole and Hitch, initiating a standoff. Cole meets a new arrival to the town, the recently widowed Allie French (RenÃ©e Zellweger), who has traveled west to find a new life. The two start a romantic relationship, and soon buy a house together. However, Allie is revealed to be promiscuous and attempts to seduce Hitch when they are alone. Despite having shown previous interest in her, Hitch refuses her advances out of loyalty to Cole. When one of Bragg's men tells Cole and Hitch he will testify that he witnessed Bragg gun down the marshal, Bragg is tried, convicted and sentenced to hang.

Women work harder than men at university and get better degrees as a result, according to a study at Brunel University. The research, which followed 200 students for four years, found that women consistently outperformed men in their studies even though they had started their courses with almost identical A-level grades. An analysis of the results showed that while 65 percent of female graduates were awarded, only 35 percent of male graduates did as well. Girls are known to outperform boys at school, but this research showed that trend continued at university. Fiona Smith, who led the research, said, \\"The research shows that the difference has something to do with schools in general.\\" \\"It also shows something about the inequality for working women in terms of pay and promotion. Women work harder at school, harder at university, and do better at both, but they still receive less pay.\\" The research found that female students were more faithful, less likely to miss lectures, and more likely to believe that their marks reflected their abilities than male students. Female students were also more likely to ask for and receive support from their professors. Women were also more likely to choose their universities because they liked the courses offered. In contrast, men were more likely than women to miss lectures due to \\"other affairs\\" and \\"laziness\\", and to believe that playing sports was an important part of university life. Generally, people think that women's success comes from more emphasis on coursework, but the research showed that female geographers at Brunel did better in their exams than in their coursework. Dr Smith said, \\"Most women feel that getting good grades is the most important part of university life.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) As an old man, Adso, son of the Baron of Melk recounts how, as a young novice in 1327, he joined his mentor, Franciscan friar William of Baskerville on a journey to a Benedictine abbey in Northern Italy where the Franciscans were to debate with Papal emissaries the poverty of Christ. The abbey also boasts a famed scriptorium where scribes copy, translate or illuminate books. The suspicious recent death of the monk Adelmo of Otranto âa young but famous manuscript illuminatorâ has stirred fears among the abbey's inhabitants. The Abbot seeks help from William, known for his deductive powers. Adelmo's death cannot be a suicide because his body was found below a tower with only a window which cannot be opened. William is reluctant, but also drawn by the intellectual challenge and his desire to disprove fears of a demonic culprit. William also fears the abbot will summon officials of the Inquisition if the mystery remains unsolved. William soon concludes that Adelmo's death was indeed suicide; he fell from a different tower. Nevertheless, Venantius, a Greek translator âand the last to speak with Adelmoâ is found dead in a vat filled with the blood of slaughtered pigs.

Această amenințare nu numai că pune în pericol stabilitatea și siguranța forței de muncă din Europa, dar compromite și idealurile de solidaritate și coeziune socială care stau la baza construcției europene. Provocările pe care le întâmpinăm în domeniul muncii și al drepturilor sociale sunt multiple și complexe, însă este esențial să luăm măsuri adecvate pentru a proteja și consolida realizările noastre în aceste domenii. Unul dintre aspectele critice ale acestei situații îl reprezintă faptul că numeroase guverne europene au aplicat politici de austeritate și reduceri bugetare drastice, care au avut ca rezultat slăbirea sistemelor de protecție socială și precarizarea condițiilor de muncă. În același timp, avansul tehnologic și proliferarea formelor atipice de muncă, cum ar fi munca temporară sau pe platforme digitale, au generat noi provocări în ceea ce privește reglementarea pieței muncii și acordarea de drepturi și protecție adecvată lucrătorilor. În acest context, este vital ca instituțiile și statele membre ale Uniunii Europene să colaboreze îndeaproape, pentru a elabora strategii comune și a implementa reforme menite să garanteze drepturile fundamentale ale cetățenilor și să protejeze valorile de bază ale democrației și statului de drept. Printre aceste obiective ar trebui să se numere promovarea unui dialog social constructiv între partenerii sociali la toate nivelurile, combaterea discriminării și a inegalităților pe piața muncii, precum și consolidarea mecanismelor de protecție socială și susținerea investițiilor în educație, sănătate și infrastructură. De asemenea, este esențial să depunem eforturi concertate pentru a combate evaziunea fiscală și frauda, astfel încât resursele necesare finanțării sistemelor de protecție socială și dezvoltării economice să nu fie deturnate în folosul unor interese private sau al unor grupuri de presiune. Prin intermediul unor politici fiscale responsabile și echitabile, putem asigura creșterea economică și realizarea unei distribuții juste a bunăstării în cadrul societății. În concluzie, amenințarea la adresa drepturilor lucrătorilor și cetățenilor europeni reprezintă o problemă gravă și complexă, care necesită o abordare eficientă și coordonată din partea instituțiilor și statelor membre ale Uniunii Europene. Prin construirea unei Europe unite, solidare și incluzive, vom fi capabili să răspundem în mod adecvat acestor provocări și să asigurăm un viitor prosper și echitabil pentru toți cetățenii noștri."},{"instruction":"Question: The trees seem just like ordinary trees to whom If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\".

Instead Lynch, a captain with the Evanston Fire Department, pulled off of the Edens Expressway and assisted as his wife gave birth to their fifth child, Mary Margaret Lynch, in their car.      Daniel and Elizabeth Lynch with their new daughter, Mary Margaret. NorthShore University HealthSystem NorthShore University HealthSystem      Dan Lynch said his wife had started feeling strong contractions Thursday night and he had called his mother to come look after their other four children in their Edison Park home.      But then the contractions subsided, he said, so Elizabeth decided to rest for a while.      When she woke up and said she thought the baby was coming soon, the couple headed for the hospital but only got as far as the Touhy Avenue exit on the expressway. Dan Lynch called 911 and pulled over onto the shoulder.      “That was pretty much it. That baby was ready to go there,” said Dan Lynch, 32. “I opened the door for some light because it was pretty dark out. It was a good catch.”      He has never delivered a baby before but has had some training on it.      “I just focused on what I had to do, I guess,” he said. Baby and mother were taken to Evanston NorthShore Hospital.      “Me and my wife got very lucky, but everybody’s doing fine,” Lynch added. “It’s not the most ideal circumstances, but it turned out great. I’m glad to have my fifth child healthy. I have five healthy children now and we’ve decided not to have any more.

One of the many things Daniel Lynch learned while training to be a firefighter and paramedic was how to deliver a baby, but the closest he ever came was watching a doctor in a hospital perform the job.That all changed in dramatic fashion Friday. In a minivan on the side of an expressway, Lynch unexpectedly brought a newborn into the world – his own.\\"It's the first time I did it myself,\\" he told PEOPLE. In fact, apart from his other four children, he said he's never even seen a baby being born.It's not exactly how Lynch, 32, a captain with the Evanston, Illinois, fire department, and his wife, Elizabeth, 32, planned to welcome their new daughter.They knew the time was approaching, though, when Elizabeth, who was three days past her due date, started feeling intense contractions about midnight at their Chicago home. But the contractions suddenly stopped and she was able to fall asleep for a few hours.At about 4:25 a.m., though, she awoke with very intense contractions and she and her husband decided to get into their Honda Odyssey and head for Evanston Hospital, about 15 minutes away, leaving the other kids home with his mother.Elizabeth called ahead to her midwife and planned to meet her at the hospital, but just as Lynch got onto the Edens Expressway a few minutes from their home, Elizabeth knew she wouldn't make it.\\"I told him to pull over,\\" she told PEOPLE from her hospital bed.Lynch called 911, then ran to the passenger side and helped guide his new baby girl into the world. \\"The baby's head was already halfway out,\\" he said. \\"I said, 'Push.' \\"A few minutes later, Mary Margaret Lynch made her debut, at 4:45 a.m., before police or firefighters had a chance to get there.

I just trusted Dan though.\\"Lynch wrapped his new bundle of joy in a blanket, then drove his wife and newborn the rest of the way to the hospital.In his eight years as a firefighter and paramedic, Lynch has been more used to fighting fires, tending patients experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath and trauma, saving people trapped in cars and helping out with water rescues from Lake Michigan. \\"You really really don't expect to deliver children,\\" he said.Still, he and his fellow paramedics did learn a thing or two about delivering babies in class. \\"We paid attention,\\" he said.Mary Margaret joins siblings Madeline, 6, Tommy, 5, Hank, 3 and Charlie, 18 months, who all were born in more traditional fashion in the hospital.\\"It's our fifth,\\" said the proud papa. \\"And last.\\"Elizabeth agreed. \\"We went out,\\" she said, \\"with a bang.\\" ||||| Summary:","output":"A mommy named Elizabeth was going to have her fifth baby.

Paragraph: Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.  Question: \\"When was Mohammad Atta born and when did he move to Germany?\\" Answer: \\"1992\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, the answer is not correct. According to the paragraph, Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, and he moved to Germany for the first time in July 1992. Therefore, the correct answer should be \\"Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, and moved to Germany in July 1992\\".

Kelley claims that she and her husband were unwillingly dragged into the scandal after complaining about cyberstalking. This led to her becoming \\"an object of ridicule, moral opprobrium, scorn, and derision, causing her shame, public notoriety, egregious loss of privacy and security,\\" according to CBS. The ordeal began when Kelley received a series of anonymous, threatening emails. She reached out to the FBI, which traced the emails back to Broadwell, revealing the affair between her and Petraeus. The investigation into the emails quickly snowballed into a full-blown scandal, exposing the affair and resulting in the resignation of Petraeus from his post as CIA Director. Kelley alleges that the FBI and the Department of Defense violated her privacy by leaking her name to the press, and that high-level government officials spread false and defamatory information about her. She believes these actions led to irreparable damage to her reputation and a significant invasion of her privacy, as well as that of her family. After the incident, Kelley became an advocate for the reform of privacy laws, according to Politico. In a statement, she said, \\"Today is an unforgettable day because one year ago threatening emails shook my life, and ultimately changed our country’s leadership.\\" She went on to describe how, when she sought protection for her family, they \\"did not receive confidentiality and protection.

Based on this description, the most logical next event would be the continued progression of the Zumba class. In more detail, after everyone has started the Zumba exercise, it's logical to anticipate the following events: 1. Warm-Up Phase: The instructor may start with some basic movements and easy-to-follow exercises to get everyone's heart rate up and their muscles warmed up. This could involve a mixture of dance moves and stretches, set to a lively, upbeat Latin soundtrack. 2. Introduction to the Dance Routine: Following the warm-up, it stands to reason that the instructor would then guide the class through the planned routine step-by-step. The participants are likely to stumble through this first run-through, but the idea is to get them familiar with the moves. 3. Progression of Dance Routine: After the introduction, the logical next phase would be for the instructor to slowly build on these moves, to increase the intensity and complexity of the dance routine. This will help to challenge everyone in the class, keeping them interested and involved.  4. High-Intensity Segment: The class will likely reach a point of high-intensity exercise. This could involve fast-paced dancing combined with aerobic movements for an energetic and fun workout. The group should be fully engaged, sweating, and potentially even laughing as they follow along. 5. Slowing Down and Cooling Down: As the class moves towards its conclusion, the instructor will logically begin to slow the pace, perhaps shifting to easier routines or slower music. This would lead to a cool-down period, where participants would gradually lower their heart rate with slower dance steps combined with static stretching. 6. Conclusion of the Class: Finally, the class would reach its conclusion. The instructor could thank the participants, reiterate any important instructions for after-class care (such as hydration and rest), and potentially announce the time of the next class. It's important to note that nuances could vary based on the style and approach of the Zumba instructor. They might take moments to instruct the group on certain movements, give encouraging comments, or personalize the class according to the group's performance and energy level. Regardless of the specifics, the backbone of most organized exercise classes remains the same: warm-up, workout progression, high-intensity interval, cooling down, and closure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive.  and a hint : Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere.  Please answer this question : Which car would emit less unburned hydrocarbons, car A or car B?","output":"Car A would emit less unburned hydrocarbons.

Lila's brother (and Ann's college friend) Buddy (Hugh Dancy) introduces her to Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson), a young doctor and the son of a former family servant.

The answer is:","output":"The 5,000-acre estate of Thomas Jefferson, known as Monticello, was primarily managed by Jefferson himself. However, he relied on several overseers and skilled workers to help run the plantation and maintain its various operations. During his lifetime, Jefferson employed numerous overseers, both white and enslaved, to supervise the day-to-day operations and agricultural activities on his estate. Two important overseers at Monticello were William Page, who served from 1793 to 1798, and Edmund Bacon, who served from 1806 to 1822. In addition to overseers, enslaved workers played a significant role in managing Monticello's operations. As skilled artisans, they contributed vital expertise to the plantation's success. Key individuals included Mulberry Row's head gardener Wormley Hughes, blacksmith Joseph Fossett, and joiners John Hemings and Isaac Granger Jefferson. Sally Hemings, an enslaved woman who had a long and complex relationship with Jefferson, managed the domestic sphere of the estate, working in and overseeing the house staff. So, while Thomas Jefferson was the primary figure responsible for managing Monticello, the actual management of the plantation involved the efforts of several overseers and skilled enslaved workers, who contributed to the success and functioning of the estate throughout Jefferson's life and beyond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But she is remembered as much for her help as for her acting. Born in Belgium in 1929, Audrey's father was British and her mother was Dutch. Audrey was sent to live at a British school for part of her childhood. During World war II, she lived and studied in the Netherlands. Her mother thought it would be safe from German attacks. Audrey studied dance as a teenager and during college. But when she returned to London after the war she realized she wasn't going to be a ballet dancer. So she began taking acting parts in stage shows. Later she began to get small parts in movies. But it was Audrey Hepburn's move to America that made her truly famous. In 1951 she played the character \\"Gigi\\" in the Broadway play Gigi and won popular praise. Two years later, Roman Holiday made her a star at the age of 24. Audrey made more than 25 movies. Among her most popular roles was \\"Hoolly Golinghtly\\" in Breakfast at Tiffany's in 1961. Three years later she played \\"Eliza Doolittle\\" in My Fair Lady. She was married twice.

In this spirit, a provincial Roman citizen who made the long journey from Bordeaux to Italy to consult the Sibyl at Tibur did not neglect his devotion to his own goddess from home: What type of religious practices outnumbered the state observances?","output":"In everyday Roman life, the religious practices that vastly outnumbered the state observances were those associated with domestic and personal deities, patron divinities of local neighborhoods and communities, as well as the often idiosyncratic blends of official, unofficial, local, and personal cults that characterized lawful Roman religion. Domestic and personal deities played an integral role in the daily lives of Roman citizens. Each household typically had its own set of deities, known as Lares and Penates, who were believed to protect the home and its inhabitants. Family members would often perform daily rituals, such as offering prayers, incense, or food, to honor and seek the favor of these deities. Furthermore, Rome's various neighborhoods and communities had their own patron divinities that served as protectors and symbols of unity for the local people. Worshipping these deities was an important aspect of community life, with shared rituals, feasts, and festivals promoting a sense of belonging and cooperation among the residents. Additionally, the blending of official, unofficial, local, and personal cults resulted in a diverse and complex religious landscape that played a significant role in the daily lives of Roman citizens. People practiced their faith in various ways, incorporating state religion, local customs, and personal beliefs, often resulting in unique and personalized forms of worship. For instance, a provincial Roman citizen might make a long journey, such as traveling from Bordeaux to Italy to consult the Sibyl at Tibur, yet still maintain devotion to his own goddess from his hometown. This demonstrates how Roman religious practices were not just centralized around state deities and rituals but also deeply intertwined with personal faith and local traditions. In summary, the religious practices that outnumbered state observances in everyday Roman life were primarily centered around domestic and personal deities, patron divinities of local neighborhoods and communities, and the unique blend of official, unofficial, local, and personal cults that embodied lawful Roman religion. These practices served to connect Romans to their homes, communities, and individual beliefs, fostering a deeply rooted and diverse religious culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.

Planet A emitted a lot of air pollution, destroying its ozone layer, while Planet B respected the environment and used ecological products.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which planet used fewer chlorine gasses? The answer to this question is:","output":"Planet B used fewer chlorine gases. As mentioned in the background article, the destruction of the ozone layer can be attributed to air pollution from chlorine and bromine gases. These harmful gases are released from aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. In the new situation with the two neighboring planets, Planet A emitted a lot of air pollution, which led to the destruction of its ozone layer. On the other hand, Planet B was environmentally conscious and used ecological products. It can be deduced that Planet B used fewer chlorine gases because their approach to preserving the environment included minimizing the use of products that release harmful chemicals. By using products with fewer chlorine and bromine content, Planet B reduced its contribution to the depletion of the ozone layer, maintaining a healthier atmosphere when compared to Planet A. Planet B's environmentally friendly approach has likely resulted in lower levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching its surface. This in turn supports a healthier way of life for its inhabitants and the ecosystem compared to Planet A. In Planet A, depletion of the ozone layer would have led to higher levels of UV radiation reaching the planet's surface, causing negative effects on human health and the environment, like increased skin cancers and eye cataracts, disruption of the nitrogen cycle, death of plankton, and disturbances in the ocean food webs. Overall, Planet B's choice to use fewer chlorine and bromine gases and adopt ecological products demonstrates a commitment to environmental responsibility and preservation of the ozone layer, leading to a healthier environment and better living conditions for its inhabitants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Tremolite forms a series with actinolite and ferro-actinolite. Pure magnesium tremolite is creamy white, but the color grades to dark green with increasing iron content. It has a hardness on Mohs scale of 5 to 6. Nephrite, one of the two minerals of the gemstone jade, is a green variety of tremolite.  - Epidote is a calcium aluminium iron sorosilicate mineral. Description. Well developed crystals of epidote, CaAl(Fe;Al)(SiO)(SiO)O(OH), crystallizing in the monoclinic system, are of frequent occurrence: they are commonly prismatic in habit, the direction of elongation being perpendicular to the single plane of symmetry. The faces are often deeply striated and crystals are often twinned. Many of the characters of the mineral vary with the amount of iron present for instance, the color, the optical constants, and the specific gravity. The color is green, grey, brown or nearly black, but usually a characteristic shade of yellowish-green or pistachio-green. It displays strong pleochroism, the pleochroic colors being usually green, yellow and brown. Clinozoisite is green, white or pale rose-red group species containing very little iron, thus having the same chemical composition as the orthorhombic mineral zoisite. The name, due to Haüy, is derived from the Greek word \\"epidosis\\" () which means \\"addition\\" in allusion to one side of the ideal prism being longer than the other.  - Vesuvianite, also known as idocrase, is a green, brown, yellow, or blue silicate mineral. Vesuvianite occurs as tetragonal crystals in skarn deposits and limestones that have been subjected to contact metamorphism. It was first discovered within included blocks or adjacent to lavas on Mount Vesuvius, hence its name. Attractive-looking crystals are sometimes cut as gemstones. Localities which have yielded fine crystallized specimens include Mount Vesuvius and the Ala Valley near Turin, Piedmont.  - Calcium is a chemical element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. Calcium is a soft gray Group 2 alkaline earth metal, fifth-most-abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust. The ion Ca is also the fifth-most-abundant dissolved ion in seawater by both molarity and mass, after sodium, chloride, magnesium, and sulfate. Free calcium metal is too reactive to occur in nature. Calcium is produced in supernova nucleosynthesis.  - Limestone is a sedimentary rock, composed mainly of skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral, forams and molluscs. Its major materials are the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO).  - Magnesium is a chemical element with symbol Mg and atomic number 12. It is a shiny gray solid which bears a close physical resemblance to the other five elements in the second column (Group 2, or alkaline earth metals) of the periodic table: all Group 2 elements have the same electron configuration in the outer electron shell and a similar crystal structure.  - Diopside is a monoclinic pyroxene mineral with composition MgCaSiO. It forms complete solid solution series with hedenbergite (FeCaSiO) and augite, and partial solid solutions with orthopyroxene and pigeonite. It forms variably colored, but typically dull green crystals in the monoclinic prismatic class. It has two distinct prismatic cleavages at 87 and 93° typical of the pyroxene series. It has a Mohs hardness of six, a Vickers hardness of 7.7 GPa at a load of 0.98 N, and a specific gravity of 3.25 to 3.55. It is transparent to translucent with indices of refraction of n=1.6631.699, n=1.6711.705, and n=1.6931.728. The optic angle is 58° to 63°.  - Wollastonite is a calcium inosilicate mineral (CaSiO) that may contain small amounts of iron, magnesium, and manganese substituting for calcium. It is usually white. It forms when impure limestone or dolostone is subjected to high temperature and pressure sometimes in the presence of silica-bearing fluids as in skarns or contact metamorphic rocks. Associated minerals include garnets, vesuvianite, diopside, tremolite, epidote, plagioclase feldspar, pyroxene and calcite. It is named after the English chemist and mineralogist William Hyde Wollaston (17661828).  - Pseudowollastonite is a high - temperature mineral phase of CaSiO3 and is polymorphous with wollastonite . Its formula can alternatively be written as Ca3Si3O9 . Other names include wollastonite 7T , ß - Wollastonite , and cyclowollastonite . It occurs in high temperature ( pyrometamorphic ) environments such as the Hatrurim Formation of the Negev Desert and the graphite mine at Pfaffenrenth near Hauzenberg , Bavaria . It also occurs in slags and cement .    Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'color' with the subject 'pseudowollastonite'.

The 31-year-old councillor, who is married to Labour MP Simon Danczuk, has promised to go on a date with 'one lucky person' to raise money for charity. Just minutes after she launched the online auction, bids started flooding in, with someone already promising to pay £10,300 for the privilege. Selfie-loving councillor Karen Danczuk (left and right), who is married to Labour MP Simon Danczuk, has offered herself up for a Valentine's night out - and bidding has already topped £10,000. The 31-year-old councillor, who is married to Labour MP Simon Danczuk, has promised to go on a date with 'one lucky person' in aid of two charities, Key 103 Cash for Kids in Manchester and the Rochdale RSPCA. Mrs Danczuk, who shot to fame after posting a series of racy selfies online, also told MailOnline that Manchester restaurant Tertutti has now agreed to host the date for her and her winner. Her husband, who now faces spending Valentine's night on his own, has also launched his own mini campaign, asking his Twitter followers to find him a date for the same night. She told MailOnline: 'I had had so many offers from people asking to take me out on a date for Valentine's, so I just thought I might as well make something out of it and raise money for charity. I do a lot for charity anyway. 'There were two people who bid £10,000 so I had to tell them that one had to go higher. It then went to £10,300. 'The cut off isn't until Friday at 12pm, so it could go higher, but I'm just a bit nervous the person won't pay now. Even if they don't, the next biggest offer was £2,000 which is still amazing for those two charities.' She added: 'Simon thinks it's great, he knows it's for charity. He's even trying to get a date of his own now!' The mother-of-two made the announcement to her 37,000 Twitter followers yesterday, saying she was holding an online auction for Saturday's date. Mrs Danczuk, who shot to fame after posting as series of racy selfies online, said that Manchester restaurant Tertutti has agreed to lay out a special meal for her and her lucky winner. She tweeted: 'Just realised its Valentines Day Saturday! Hmmmm should I offer one lucky person a night out for charity?? KD.' It prompted a deluge of responses from fans, with Bryn Smith posting: 'Yessss you should defo do this, I can feel a Twitter meltdown coming.' Andy Hudson tweeted: 'Sounds like a great idea, and for a good cause as well.' While Andy Futers said: 'Meee, but can I leave the wife at home and we can send a selfie of us to her.' Andrew Meaden posted: 'I'm starting with £200', while another anonymous user offered £2,000. Mrs Danczuk later added: 'Want to take me out for Valentines & raise money for charity? Email me your secret bid. Highest bidder wins! karendanczuk@hotmail.com KD.' The mother-of-two (left) said her husband Simon (right), the MP for Rochdale, has now launched his own campaign to find a date for Saturday night. The MP tweeted his followers asking for 'offers, suggestions or ideas' in light of his wife's charity campaign. Presumably inundated with offers from men, she then tweeted: 'My Charity Valentines Dinner doesn't just have to be male, females are just as welcome! KD.' The mother-of-two, who has represented the Kingsway ward on Rochdale council since 2011, announced last month that she was standing down as a councillor at the next election to pursue other opportunities. She's already hired London-based agent Ginger Comms and is understood to be interested in pursuing TV work. Mrs Danczuk also hit the headlines last year when she started selling signed pictures of herself posing in a bikini on eBay. But the £10 pictures were criticised by many buyers for being poor quality. In August, former Conservative MP Louise Mensch described her as 'Westminster's most embarrassing wife' and claimed she was cheapening politics for constantly posting pictures of her cleavage. She later went on to ITV's Loose Women show to defend herself against the accusations, where panelist Janet Street-Porter said she was a poor model for young girls in Rochdale. The date is raising money for Key 103 Cash For Kids, based in Manchester, and Rochdale RSPCA.

Troubleshooting is one of the most important skills to have in the IT industry.When you’re experiencing a computer issue, start by figuring out what exactly is going on. Defining the problem as “The mouse doesn’t work” is too broad—narrow it down to the precise behavior or error message, such as “When I connect the mouse to the USB port, I see a message that says ‘This IRQ is assigned to the keyboard.” One of the most important skills a genius-in-the-making must learn is how to find information. There’s an art to getting accurate information about computer problems with Google.  Use quotes (“) around exact words and phrases (“this IRQ is assigned to the keyboard” instead of irq assigned to keyboard) to make sure your results match what you are looking for.  Using Google to search a single site. If you’re looking for information about wireless networking and prefer your results be from Microsoft.com, type mouse problems site:microsoft.com instead of mouse problems microsoft. Filter results by date (often relevant, as computers are always changing) by clicking “Search Tools” at the top of the search results, then change “Any time” to a different time range. While the manufacturer’s product pages may be among the first search results, some of the best troubleshooting information will come from user forums. It will not take you long to figure out which sites return good search results and which should be avoided. If your search for information brings you to a page that seemingly has little to do with what you searched, that source will not be useful to you. Don’t be afraid to ask questions—but before you do, try using the forum’s “search” feature to reduce the possibility of duplicating an already-resolved thread. Many online forums will not allow you to search their content until you register for an account. Now that you’ve been practicing your troubleshooting skills, find opportunities to get hands-on experience. Ask people you know if they are having trouble with their computers, and then offer to fix them. Use your new skills to find other people online who’ve experienced similar issues and try implementing suggested fixes. Computer geniuses learn how to troubleshoot by breaking things.

Nadir was jailed for 10 years in August after being found guilty of stealing £28.8 million. The disgraced tycoon thanked the judge when leaving the dock. Article:","output":"Title: The Fall Of A Leading Stock Exchange Conglomerate: A Look Back At The Scandal That Shook The Business World Introduction The collapse of a leading stock exchange conglomerate in 1990 marked a significant turning point in the business world, exposing the vulnerabilities and pitfalls of unchecked ambition and greed. This scandal centered around the disgraced tycoon, Nadir, who was sentenced to 10 years in jail in August after being found guilty of stealing a staggering £28.8 million. As he left the dock, the humbled tycoon expressed gratitude to the judge, a poignant moment highlighting the end of an era characterized by arrogance, opulence, and criminality. The Rise and Fall of The Conglomerate In its heyday, the leading stock exchange conglomerate was a symbol of success and a benchmark for businesses worldwide. The rise of the group was meteoric, fueled by aggressive acquisitions and relentless expansion, transforming it into a business empire. Millions of dollars in investments poured in, attracted by the seemingly untouchable and prosperous machine that Nadir had built. However, as the years went by, signs of trouble began to emerge. Allegations of irregularities in the company's accounts surfaced, prompting an investigation by financial watchdogs. It became apparent that behind the veneer of success, the conglomerate was riddled with corruption and malfeasance. The unraveling of the truth shook the business world, as the conglomerate's fall from grace unfolded like a slow-motion car crash. Stocks plummeted, assets were liquidated, and thousands of investors and employees were left reeling from the devastating blow dealt to their lives and livelihoods. Nadir's Conviction and Sentencing Following the collapse of the conglomerate, a manhunt involving multiple law enforcement agencies ensued. Nadir was eventually captured and brought to justice, setting the stage for a high-profile trial filled with drama, intrigue, and scandal. Many watched in disbelief as the once-revered tycoon was now at the center of one of the most significant financial trials in history. The trial unearthed a slew of shocking revelations, uncovering a web of deceit and embezzlement. Ultimately, the jury found Nadir guilty of stealing £28.8 million, and in August, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison. As he left the courtroom dock, the disgraced tycoon thanked the judge, perhaps acknowledging the end of his reign of infamy. Lessons Learned The scandal that unfolded around the leading stock exchange conglomerate is an essential lesson in the perils of unchecked ambition and greed. It serves as a cautionary tale for businesses and leaders to prioritize transparent and ethical practices to foster long-standing success. In the aftermath of the conglomerate's collapse, regulatory bodies worldwide have tightened their financial oversight to protect investors from similar incidents. Meanwhile, accountability and corporate responsibility have come to the forefront of the business world, forcing companies to reevaluate their operations and embrace transparency. Conclusion The story of the leading stock exchange conglomerate's collapse is a stark reminder of the fragile line between success and failure in the world of business. The scandal involving the disgraced tycoon Nadir teaches us the importance of transparency in corporate governance and the need for vigilance in identifying dangers lurking beneath the surface. As we reflect on this dark chapter in business history, it is crucial to learn from the past in order to tread more cautiously into the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Math problem: Solve 28*u = -403*u + 82*u + 2443 for u. What is the solution?","output":"First, let's simplify the equation by combining like terms, specifically the terms involving the variable u: 28*u = -403*u + 82*u + 2443 Now, let's add 403*u to both sides to eliminate -403*u on the right side: 28*u + 403*u = -403*u + 403*u + 82*u + 2443 Combine the terms on the left side: 431*u = 82*u + 2443 Now, we want to get all the terms involving u on the left side, and constants on the right side. To do this, let's subtract 82*u from both sides: 431*u - 82*u = 82*u - 82*u + 2443 Combine the terms on the left side: 349*u = 2443 Now, to solve for u, we need to isolate the variable by dividing both sides by 349: 349*u / 349 = 2443 / 349 u = 7 So, the solution for the equation 28*u = -403*u + 82*u + 2443 is u = 7."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: The Prussian Army, under the terms of the armistice, held a brief victory parade in Paris on 17 February; the city was silent and draped with black and the Germans quickly withdrew.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Yes, the question was answered briefly and precisely, but a more detailed response could add more context to the event. Here's a longer explanation: On 17 February 1871, following the Franco-Prussian War, the Prussian Army held a victory parade in Paris, the capital of France - the nation it had just defeated. This was a significant event, as it symbolized the shifting balance of power in Europe at the time. The Franco-Prussian War was fought from 19 July 1870 to 28 January 1871. It was a conflict between the Second French Empire of Napoleon III and the German states of the North German Confederation led by the Kingdom of Prussia. The major cause of the Franco-Prussian War was the desire of the Prussian statesman Otto von Bismarck to unify the northern German states under Prussian control and, in effect, build a strong German Empire. France was strongly opposed to this unification due to fear of a powerful Germany. The Prussian victory in this war led to the establishment of the German Empire. The triumph also significantly affected the balance of power in Europe, signaling the rise of Germany as a key global player. Prussia's victory set the stage for a period of German dominance over Europe, which remained essentially unchallenged until the outbreak of World War I. On 17 February 1871, as a part of the armistice, a Prussian victory parade was held in Paris. This was not well received by the Parisians. The French capital was filled with an air of melancholy and defeat. Buildings in Paris were draped in black as an expression of collective mourning and silent protest against the Prussian presence. However, the victorious Prussian forces did not occupy Paris for long. Respecting the terms of the armistice, they soon withdrew after their brief display of power. Despite the bitterness and the humiliation of defeat, this move helped pave the way for a period of healing and reconstruction in France. In sum, the Prussian victory parade in Paris on 17 February 1871 marked a crucial turning point in European history - symbolizing the ascent of a unified Germany and the commencement of a new power equation in the continent. Despite the painful memories of the event for the French, it also led to the evolution of a more resilient and unified France in subsequent years."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? There is no great mystery to talking to women. Women are just people and the most comfortable way for you to talk to them, as well as the way that makes them the most receptive, is for you to talk to them the same way you'd talk to anyone else. By just practicing and learning to talk to strangers in general, you'll build up pretty much all of the skills that you need to approach and talk to women successfully. The more you talk to random strangers, the less anxiety you will experience and soon you will realize \\"Hey, it's not a big deal!\\" A lot of guys (and even some women) will make it out that you need to use particular phrases, tricks, or manipulative behaviors in order to talk to and get women, but what they're prescribing only gets the attention of weird women that you don't want to deal with anyway. You don't have to be or make yourself 'traditionally attractive'. The thing is, when you wear clothes that look bad on you when you don't shower or wear deodorant, when you don't take care of your body, you communicate to other people (women especially!) that you don't think you're worth taking care of or putting effort into. If you don't think you're worth loving, then why should she, you know? Smell is especially important. A guy that smells off can quickly take on a creeper vibe. Wear good deodorant, clean clothes, and a very mild cologne or body spray. If you want to increase your chances of talking to her successfully, it's a good idea to watch her for a little while and use some careful analysis to figure out how you should and shouldn't talk to her. See what you can figure out about her by looking at her.  Is she wearing a particularly nice item or one that looks handmade? It might make a good source for a compliment. Is she dressed very conservatively? She may be trying to reduce the chances of a guy flirting with her, so be more subtle in your approach. Once she notices you looking, you’re either going to be “confident” or “creepy,” so be confident and approach her or find a way to buy yourself time without building your creep factor.  If she sees you but you're not ready to go over, give her a smile (maybe a wink), and look away bashfully. She'll know you think she's cute, but she won't think you're weird.    {\\"smallUrl\\":\\"https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/b/b1/Approach-Women-Anywhere-Step-3Bullet2.jpg/v4-460px-Approach-Women-Anywhere-Step-3Bullet2.jpg\\",\\"bigUrl\\":\\"/images/thumb/b/b1/Approach-Women-Anywhere-Step-3Bullet2.jpg/aid947901-v4-728px-Approach-Women-Anywhere-Step-3Bullet2.jpg\\",\\"smallWidth\\":460,\\"smallHeight\\":345,\\"bigWidth\\":\\"728\\",\\"bigHeight\\":\\"546\\",\\"licensing\\":\\"<div class=\\"mw-parser-output\\"><p>License: <a rel=\\"nofollow\\" class=\\"external text\\" href=\\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\\">Creative Commons</a><br>n</p><p><br />n</p></div>\\"} Certain situations just won't be conducive to getting a woman interested in you (serious settings, like business meetings). Others will get you treated as a creeper by default (public transport). Go for areas which are in public and as open as possible. If a lady is too busy feeling cornered and trapped, she's just not going to be open to how charming you really are. Few things shout, \\"I pick up any woman I can\\" quite like a wing man. If a woman feels like you're just taking any fish that will bite, she won't be interested because she won't feel special. Go in alone. This act of bravery shows that you are interested enough in her specifically to tough it out. Don't be intimidated by a woman that's out with her friends. Being nice and chatty with her friends but clearly interested in her will be flattering. You want to date a woman with good friends, and good friends will always want to see their friend get with a nice guy. Summary:","output":"To talk to women, treat them like regular people, take care of your appearance, be confident, and approach them in open public places."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

New York is an American biweekly magazine concerned with life, culture, politics, and style generally, and with a particular emphasis on New York City. Founded by Milton Glaser and Clay Felker in 1968 as a competitor to \\"The New Yorker\\", it was brasher and less polite, and established itself as a cradle of New Journalism. Over time, it became more national in scope, publishing many noteworthy articles on American culture by writers such as Tom Wolfe, Jimmy Breslin, Nora Ephron, John Heilemann, Frank Rich, and Rebecca Traister.

Write some highlights for the following article: Five-time winners Brazil opened their World Cup campaign with a nervy 2-1 victory over a spirited North Korea in Johannesburg after the Ivory Coast and Portugal had played out a 0-0 draw in Tuesday's other Group G match. In a contest between the tournament's highest and lowest ranked teams, Brazil were unable to break down the Asian side in a goalless first half, but defender Maicon settled their nerves with a ferocious strike from a tight angle. Elano's crisp finish from a defense-splitting Robinho pass gave the South Americans a 2-0 lead but Ji Yun-nam fired past Julio Cesar to give North Korea a deserved consolation goal. Earlier in Port Elizabeth, Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo struck the post with a 30-yard drive in the first-half of a cagey match, before Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba -- playing 11 days after breaking his elbow -- wasted an opportunity to win the game when he dragged his shot wide in stoppage-time. Inside North Korea's World Cup squad. Brazil 2-1 North Korea. Brazil, seeking a record-extending sixth title, were expected to win with ease against a side making their first appearance in the tournament since 1966, but the North Koreans made life difficult for their illustrious opponents. The first half was a story of resolute defending by the Asians in the face of wave after wave of Brazil attacks. Brazil struggled to get behind the Korean defense and most of their shots came from outside the area with both Elano and Robinho wayward with early efforts. On the few occasions that Brazilian players did make it to the byline, their crosses were blocked by committed and skilful pieces of defending. The second period started in similar fashion, with Robinho and Michel Bastos both missing from range before the opening goal finally arrived in the 55th minute. Kaka picked out the overlapping run of Maicon and the right-back slashed a swerving shot inside the goalkeeper's near post. Brazil's second goal owed everything to a perfectly measured pass through the defense by Robinho to his former Manchester City teammate Elano, who produced a crisp side-footed finish into the far corner. Dunga's men were given a late scare when North Korea crafted a fine goal. A long ball was headed into the path of Ji Yun-nam, who raced into the area and lashed a shot past Julio Cesar. \\"I believe the first match is always trying, there was a lot of nervousness, and anxiety,\\" Brazil coach Dunga told AFP. \\"We all want to score and not concede any goals. I am not entirely happy with the result, we weren't passing as quickly as I would have liked. But the spirit of these players is strong and they are willing to learn.\\" North Korea coach Kim Jong Hun was proud of his players and saw reason for encouragement ahead of their remaining games against Portugal and Ivory Coast. \\"We managed to fend them off whether they were attacking down the wings or through the middle,\\" he said. \\"We didn't win, but we have picked up some confidence and I think we will do well in the next two games.\\" New Zealand snatch historic first World Cup point. Ivory Coast 0-0 Portugal. One of the most eagerly-anticipated games of the tournament featured little goalmouth action, with the exception of a moment of magic from the world's most expensive player. After 10 minutes, Ronaldo, who has not scored for his country in 16 months, made space for himself with a sharp turn and curled a right-footed shot from 25 yards which had goalkeeper Boubacar Barry well-beaten but cannoned back off the post. It was the only noteworthy moment of an otherwise dull first half, which featured plenty of probing from both sides but very little goalmouth incident. Ronaldo was shown a yellow card after 20 minutes when he failed to win a free-kick and was involved in a spat with Ivory Coast defender Guy Demel, who was also booked. The Africans saw plenty of the ball but did not create their first real opening until a minute after halftime when the lively Gervinho raced down the left and fired a powerful shot, which Eduardo tipped around the post. With the game starting to open up, Ivory Coast winger Salomon Kalou found space in the area but fired his shot straight at Eduardo before Liedson's header from Deco's cross at the other end was easily held by Barry. Drogba entered the fray after 65 minutes but saw little of the ball until the 92nd minute when Abdelkader Keita slid him clear, only for the striker to screw his shot wastefully across the face of goal. Highlights:","output":"1. Brazil secured a 2-1 victory against North Korea in their World Cup campaign, with a goalless first half reflecting North Korea's solid defending strategy. 2.

Q: I saw one last night on an episode of Designated Survivor. To qualify this, I’m not normally bothered by product placements. Sometimes they can even add to the scene. But this one was bad, really bad. Agent is busy hunting for baddies. Finishes questioning one naughty person who climbs in his Ford F150 and speeds off. So far, so good - it is the sort of vehicle a country-living billionaire bad-guy would drive. The agent then pulls out her phone and… Move to close up of phone screen showing Ford app already loaded (and screen unlocked!). Agent slowly moves finger to app. Does something. Pause as app does fancy graphics. Cut to car interior. Shot of dash, showing Ford logo on steering wheel. It’s bright blue - are they not normally grey or more subtle? Pause for a second… Zoom in on dash. Dash light up. Car starts. Show pretty dash lights for a second or so. Cut to agent Agent walks to car, gets in drives off. Lingering shot of rear of car. It was just so clumsy. Massive halt to the flow of the scene to show it. In most films you never see anyone starting cars, putting on seatbelts or similar unless this is part of the plot because it’s unnecessary and not interesting to watch. I sort of expected the remote start function to have some sort of relevance later… but no, it was totally ignored. Added to that: There was no password or security on her phone - and this is an agent investigating super secret stuff. If you don’t show her unlocking the phone, why show her lovingly prodding the app? They are as relevant. She unlocked and started the car while she was 20–30 paces away, on the grounds of a suspect ranch. Someone could easily have jumped in the car. Not very security conscious.

To start, add 199v to both sides to move the 'v' terms to one side: -20v +199v -9358 = -199v +199v +4783 179v -9358 = 4783 Next, add 9358 to both sides in order to isolate the 'v' term on one side: 179v = 4783 + 9358 179v = 14141 Step 2: Solve for v.  Once all the 'v' terms are on one side and the constants are on the other, you can solve for 'v' by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the 'v' term. 179v/179 = 14141/179 v = 79 So, the solution to the equation -20*v - 9358 = -199*v + 4783 is v = 79."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is The next major drop in price came about with the incandescent light bulb powered by electricity. a good answer to this question?","output":"While the statement you provided does touch upon a significant development in electric lighting, it does not provide a comprehensive answer to your question. Let me provide a more detailed and long answer to your question that explains the kinds of lighting powered by electricity. One of the earliest types of electric lighting was the arc lamp, which was invented in the early 1800s. This consisted of two carbon electrodes separated by a narrow gap. When a voltage was applied across the electrodes, a high-temperature arc was generated that produced a bright light. Arc lamps marked the beginning of electric lighting, but they were mostly used for outdoor or street lighting due to their intense brightness and the need for constant maintenance. The incandescent light bulb, as you have mentioned, was the next major development in electric lighting. Invented by Sir Hiram Maxim and Sir Joseph Swan, and later improved by Thomas Edison, the incandescent light bulb is powered by electricity that flows through a thin filament, generally made of tungsten. This filament, housed in a glass bulb filled with inert gas, heats up and emits visible light as a result of its resistance to the electric current. The incandescent light bulb became popular because it provided a more practical and efficient source of light for indoor spaces. Its widespread adoption also contributed to the significant drop in the price of electric lighting. Later on, fluorescent lighting and compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) became popular electric lighting options. Fluorescent lighting utilizes a gas discharge process that involves exciting mercury vapor, thereby producing ultraviolet (UV) light. This UV light interacts with the phosphor coating inside the glass tube, emitting visible light. Compared to incandescent bulbs, fluorescent lights are more energy-efficient and longer-lasting, making them an eco-friendly option. Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) have emerged as the most advanced form of electric lighting in recent years. LEDs work by passing an electric current through a semiconductor material, which then emits light in the form of photons. The biggest advantage of LEDs is their high energy efficiency, long lifespan, and ability to produce a variety of colors without the need for filters. These benefits have led to the widespread adoption of LED lighting for various applications, including residential, commercial, industrial, and outdoor lighting. To sum up, various types of lighting are powered by electricity, including arc lamps, incandescent light bulbs, fluorescent lights, and LEDs. Each of these options has played a significant role in the history and evolution of electric lighting, with advancements in technology leading to improved efficiency and versatility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

William Ben Hogan (August 13, 1912 - July 25, 1997) was an American professional golfer who is generally considered to be one of the greatest players in the history of the game. He was born within six months of Sam Snead and Byron Nelson, who were two other acknowledged golf greats of the 20th century. Hogan is notable for his profound influence on golf swing theory and his legendary ball-striking ability. His nine career professional major championships tie him with Gary Player for fourth all-time, trailing only Jack Nicklaus (18), Tiger Woods (14) and Walter Hagen (11). The right stance not only allows for proper alignment, but also for a balanced swing, prepared usage of the proper muscles, and the maximum strength and control over your swing. We align our body to the target only after we have aligned the club head to the target.  A proper stance starts with your feet being aligned at the target, followed by your knees, hips and shoulders. Your feet should be shoulder width apart, your front foot should be slightly opened towards the target and your back foot should be perpendicular to the target. As you increase in club, your stance should widen for further stability. Your shoulders will be naturally open to the target line because your arms are not at equal length while holding the club. Make sure to close your shoulders slightly to stay aligned with the target line. The proper stance affects how controlled the backswing is, governs the amount of hip turn in the backswing, and allows for the hips to clear through the downswing. Your front arm should be extended at all times to allow the club to travel in its maximum arc.  \\"The elbows should be tucked in, not stuck out from the body. At address, the left elbow should point directly at the left hipbone and the right elbow should point directly at the right hipbone. Furthermore, there should be a sense of fixed jointness between the two forearms and the wrists, and it should be maintained throughout the swing.\\"  \\"You should bend your knees from the thighs down. As your knees bend, the upper part of the trunk remains normally erect, just as it does when you sit down in a chair.

The secret police force created by Papa Doc Duvalier, the Tonton Macoute terrorized the citizens of what country?","output":"The Tonton Macoute, the secret police force created by François \\"Papa Doc\\" Duvalier, terrorized the citizens of Haiti. The group was officially known as the Milice de Volontaires de la Sécurité Nationale (MVSN) or Volunteers for National Security, but they came to be more familiarly known as the Tonton Macoute, drawing their name from the Haitian voodoo folklore \\"Tonton Macoute\\" or the \\"bogeyman\\". The Tonton Macoute was created in 1959, soon after Duvalier took power in 1957. Under the rule of Papa Doc Duvalier, the Tonton Macoute played a significant role in suppressing opposition and maintaining the control of the Duvalier regime. They became infamous for their brutal tactics; they were notorious for their use of violence, intimidation, extortion, and even murder against opponents of the regime or those suspected of disloyalty. Haitian citizens lived in constant fear and uncertainty during the reign of the Tonton Macoute. Members of the Tonton Macoute were typically recruited from the lower segments of Haitian society, providing them with social and economic mobility due to their loyalty to Duvalier. These individuals wielded immense power, as they were allowed to arrest, torture, or kill anyone they perceived as a threat to the Duvalier government. This absolute power and lack of accountability led to systemic abuse and extreme brutality. The Tonton Macoute also played a role in suppressing any attempts at political change or opposition. They infiltrated and eliminated political parties, unions, and other groups that might challenge Duvalier's rule. The fear they instilled created a climate of repression and stifled political dissent throughout the country. The Tonton Macoute was not only a tool for Duvalier to maintain control over the population of Haiti, but it also served as a mechanism to consolidate wealth for the regime. The group was involved in various criminal activities such as smuggling and extortion, enabling Duvalier to accumulate wealth, which further solidified his grip on power. After Papa Doc Duvalier's death in 1971, his son, Jean-Claude \\"Baby Doc\\" Duvalier, took over as president and continued to deploy the Tonton Macoute to maintain control. However, the organization began to lose some of its influence and power as political instability and pressure from international actors mounted against the Baby Doc regime. In 1986, Jean-Claude Duvalier was ousted from power, and the Tonton Macoute was officially disbanded. While the Tonton Macoute no longer exists as an official organization, the impacts of its terror are deeply entrenched in the country's history and persist in various forms today. This secret police force left a lasting scar on Haiti's political, social, and cultural landscape, serving as a somber reminder of the costs and consequences of unchecked power and political repression."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.

Without a challenge, the child will be removed from April Hoagland and Beckie Peirce's care within a week. The decision, made by Judge Scott Johansen in the town of Price, has been criticised by gay rights groups. In an interview with a local television news station, the couple said that the judge referred to research that children are better off when they are raised by heterosexual parents. \\"We are shattered,\\" Ms Hoagland told the station. \\"It hurts me really badly because I haven't done anything wrong.\\" The two are part of a group of same-sex married couples who the state of Utah has allowed to become foster parents in the wake of last summer's US Supreme Court ruling that made gay marriage legal across the US. While they do not keep count, officials in Utah estimate that there are at least a dozen foster parents in the state who are married same-sex couples. The decision to remove the child that the lesbian couple had been raising for three months, has drawn heavy criticism from gay rights groups. \\"Removing a child from a loving home simply because the parents are LGBT is outrageous, shocking, and unjust,\\" said president of the Human Rights Campaign, Chad Griffin. \\"All major studies on the matter show that parents' sexual orientation is not related to a child's mental health and social development.\\" This is not the first time that Judge Johansen's decision have come under scrutiny. In 1997, he was reprimanded for slapping a 16-year-old in the face at a courthouse in Price. And in 2012, he drew attention for ordering a 13-year-old girl's hair cut in exchange for a lighter sentence.  The girl was being prosecuted for cutting the hair of another, younger girl. That same year, he was criticised for sending a teenage boy on probation to jail after he received a poor school report. Teen was on probation for shoplifting a pack of gum. The foster agency has said that it is unaware of any issues with Ms Hoagland and Ms Peirce's performance as foster parents. The agency's attorneys are now reviewing the decision to see what challenges might be mounted. \\"We just want sharing, loving families for these kids,\\" Sumner said. \\"We don't really care what that looks like.\\" The agency is tasked with keeping children in one foster home for as long as possible, on the condition that the parents - who are all screened before becoming foster parents - are providing adequate care.

Although he initially has no idea how he got there, he starts to piece together what has happened to him. He remembers that his and several other trucks were ambushed by terrorists, who killed his colleagues; he was hit by a rock and passed out. He receives a call from his kidnapper, Jabir, demanding that he pay a ransom of 5 million by 9PM or he will be left in the coffin to die. Conroy calls the State Department, which tells him that due to the government policy of not negotiating with terrorists, it will not pay the ransom but will try to rescue him. They connect him with Dan Brenner, head of the Hostage Working Group, who tells Conroy they are doing their best to find him. His kidnapper calls Conroy and demands he make a ransom video, threatening to execute one of his colleagues who survived the attack. Conroy insists that no one will pay 5 million, so the kidnapper drops the amount to 1 million. Despite his compliance in making a video, the kidnappers execute his colleague and send him the recording of it, which he watches in horror. Shortly afterwards, distant explosions shake the area, damaging his coffin, which begins to slowly fill with sand. Conroy continues sporadic phone calls with Brenner, skeptical of the man's promises of help. To reaffirm his wholehearted intentions, Brenner tells Conroy about a 26-year-old named Mark White who was rescued from a similar situation three weeks previously, telling him that the kid is home with his family and happy. Later on, Conroy receives a phone call from his employers, who inform him that he was fired from his job due to an alleged prohibited relationship with a colleague (the one who was executed), and thus he and his family will not be entitled to any benefits or pension he earned during his time with the company.

Write a text based on this summary: oil prices weigh heavily on stocks Text:","output":"The global financial market is experiencing significant fluctuation as oil prices continue to cast a heavy burden on stocks. Market participants pinpoint the escalating oil prices as the main culprit for the recent downturn in the stock markets.  Fuel rates are driven by a multitude of factors - including geopolitical events, natural calamities, climate change, government policies, and market conditions - reflecting directly on the stock market, often times unsettling it. When oil prices surge, it tends to increase operational expenses of companies across various sectors - particularly those directly linked to fuel - resulting in decreased earnings and subsequently, a drop in share values.  This symbiotic relationship between oil prices and stock markets is a recurrent theme that extends to every corner of the globe. Oil, being a key input in economies, plays a crucial role in determining the health of the stock markets, thus making it one of the cornerstones of overall economic stability.  In the current landscape, the steady climb of oil prices is putting extraordinary pressure on stock prices. As a result, investors are in a state of apprehension, witnessing destabilization in their stock portfolios. Market experts suggest that unless there is a significant reduction in oil prices, or economies adapt to the escalating costs, stock markets might continue to bear the weight. As such, the pertinent issue of escalating oil prices and their impact on stocks has transformed into a global concern. It's a crucial reminder that the condition of our stock market is not only determined by internal business dynamics but is also influenced heavily by global commodity prices, particularly oil. Thus, the trajectory of oil prices is looked upon with apprehension and caution by investors worldwide. It's a tale of economic interdependence that underlines the power of oil prices in swaying economies and the fragility of stock markets in the face of external pressures. This scenario truly emphasizes how oil prices weigh heavily on stocks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

It agrees with the noun it modifies in gender, number, and case. In this context, \\"pevné\\" is used in the plural, accusative form since it's describing \\"hands\\". 3. \\"hands\\" is translated to \\"ruce\\", which is a plural noun in Czech.

Plot title: John Carpenter presents Body Bags Movie plot: Prologue A creepy-looking coroner introduces three different horror tales involving his current work on cadavers in \\"body bags\\". \\"The Gas Station\\"[edit] Anne is a young college student who arrives for her first job working the night shift at an all-night filling station near Haddonfield, Illinois (a reference to the setting of Carpenter's two Halloween films). The attending worker, Bill, tells her that a serial killer has broken out of a mental hospital, and cautions her not to leave the booth at the station without the keys because the door locks automatically. After Bill leaves, Anne is alone and the tension mounts as she deals with various late-night customers seeking to buy gas for a quick fill-up, purchase cigarettes or just use the restroom key, unsure whether any of them might be the escaped maniac. Eventually, when Anne suspects that the escaped killer is lurking around the gas station, she tries to call the police, only to find that the phone line is dead. Soon after that, she finds an elaborately grotesque drawing in the Restroom and then the dead body of a transient sitting in a pickup truck on the lift in one of the garage bays. She makes a phone call for help which results in her realization that \\"Bill\\", the attending worker she met earlier, is in fact the escaped killer, who has killed the real Bill and is killing numerous passers-by. She finds the real Bill's dead body in one of the lockers. Serial Killer \\"Bill\\" then reappears and attempts to kill Anne with a machete, breaking into the locked booth by smashing out the glass with a sledgehammer and then chasing her around the deserted garage. Just as he is about to kill her, a customer returns, having forgotten his credit card, and he wrestles the killer, giving Anne time to crush him under the vehicle lift. \\"Hair\\"[edit] Richard Coberts is a middle-aged businessman who is very self-conscious about his thinning hair.

If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts. Although there are a few parts of the site I'm still a bit proud of, the majority of it was, I freely admit, satire of the lowest order.

Premise: \\"nah so it's sort of an old wife or common folk tales about you know if you're going to have a cat spayed let it go through heat first not true because when they go into heat their uh genetic parts swell up and expand and everything and then once you do take them into surgery it's a little more difficult easier to have them spayed before they even go into heat\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"You should always wait for heat to happen then spay.\\"?","output":"If the premise is true, it suggests that the folk tale or old wives' tale, which advises letting a cat go through heat before spaying, is inaccurate and even counterproductive. In this scenario, the hypothesis \\"You should always wait for heat to happen then spay\\" would be false and not recommended for the best interest of the cat and its health. To better understand this, let's break down the components of the premise. It describes that when a cat goes into heat, their reproductive parts swell up and expand. This can make the process of spaying the cat more difficult, as dealing with swollen and expanded tissue is often more complicated for the veterinary surgeon performing the procedure. This could increase the risks associated with the surgery and prolong the recovery time for the cat. In contrast, spaying a cat before it goes into heat would allow the veterinary surgeon to work with normal-sized reproductive organs, making the procedure easier, less risky, and possibly reducing the recovery time for the cat. Additionally, spaying a cat before its first heat cycle has health benefits, such as significantly decreasing its risk of mammary cancer, a common problem in female cats. Moreover, the younger the cat, the faster it can recover from surgery, which also supports the idea of spaying them earlier rather than waiting for heat.  Furthermore, allowing a cat to go through heat without being spayed can lead to unwanted behaviors and complications. Female cats in heat can be quite vocal, restless, and may even urinate inappropriately to attract a mate. Furthermore, if a cat goes into heat and becomes pregnant, it adds the issue of dealing with an unintended litter, contributing to the challenges of pet overpopulation and finding suitable homes for all the kittens. Therefore, if the premise holds true, it refutes the hypothesis \\"You should always wait for heat to happen then spay\\" and instead advocates for spaying a cat before it goes into heat for better health, comfort, and safety outcomes. As a responsible pet owner, it's essential to consult with a veterinarian on the best course of action for your cat, discuss the appropriate age for spaying, and ensure that the procedure is carried out in a safe and timely manner to promote the cat's well-being and overall health."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Who is unimpressed by a magic trick?

Q: Q: Because dizygotic twins develop from two eggs fertilized by two sperm, they are no more identical than siblings born at what?   A: The answer is:","output":"Dizygotic twins, also known as fraternal or non-identical twins, develop from two eggs fertilized by two sperm. As a result, they are no more identical than siblings born at separate times. The level of genetic similarity between dizygotic twins is just like the genetic similarity between siblings who are not twins, because both inherit half of their DNA from their mother and half from their father. Sibling relationships can be characterized by a degree of genetic similarity, which is determined by the proportion of shared genes between individuals. In the case of dizygotic twins or regular siblings born at different times, the genetic similarity is approximately 50%. This is due to the combination of chromosomes each sibling receives from their parents, which occurs through a random process known as recombination. Recombination involves the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during the formation of eggs and sperm, which ultimately produces a unique blend of parental DNA in each offspring. Dizygotic twins have some similarities that siblings born at separate times may not share, such as the same prenatal environment and being born at the same time. These common factors can result in dizygotic twins appearing more similar to each other than siblings born at separate times. However, in terms of their genetic makeup, dizygotic twins are no more identical than non-twin siblings. In contrast, monozygotic twins, or identical twins, are formed from a single fertilized egg that splits into two separate embryos. As a result, monozygotic twins share nearly 100% of their genetic material, making them much more similar to each other than dizygotic twins or non-twin siblings. In summary, dizygotic twins are no more identical than siblings born at separate times in regard to their genetic makeup.

Here are possible answers to this question: - haystack - spool of thread - hospital - box of needles - doctor's office  I believe the correct choice is \\"haystack\\", here's why: A:","output":"Haystack Indeed, among the options given, the correct choice would be \\"haystack.\\" The expression \\"finding a needle in a haystack\\" is often used to describe a daunting and nearly impossible task due to the difficulty of locating a small, slender object such as a needle amidst a massive pile of hay. The reasons behind this being improbable are numerous, and we will delve into them below: 1. Size discrepancy: A typical needle is only a few centimeters long and extremely thin, while a haystack can consist of hundreds or even thousands of kilograms of hay. This vast size difference makes it incredibly challenging to locate a tiny needle within such an immense haystack, as it can easily become concealed or buried among the hay. 2. Similar appearance: Both needles and hay are elongated and fibrous. The similarity in their appearance adds to the difficulty of finding a needle amidst hay, as it can blend in effortlessly with the surrounding hay even if it is visible. 3. Lack of efficient equipment or technology: While metal detectors or x-ray machines might help locate a needle in a haystack, such technologies are not always available or feasible to use in this context. Moreover, separating the hay can be labor-intensive and time-consuming. 4. Unusual circumstance: People do not ordinarily store needles within haystacks, as there are much more practical and organized methods for needle storage. As such, locating a needle in a haystack is improbable because the occurrence itself is rare and unlikely. On the other hand, the remaining possible answers all involve places where needles are more commonly found: - Spool of thread: Needles and thread are often used together in sewing, embroidery, and other crafting activities. It is not unusual to find a needle stored near a spool of thread. - Hospital: Needles have various medical uses, such as administering injections, drawing blood samples, and suturing wounds. A hospital is a place where medical professionals frequently utilize needles, making it a more likely location to find one. - Box of needles: This option is self-explanatory. A box designated specifically for needle storage is naturally a place where one would anticipate finding a needle. - Doctor's office: Similar to a hospital, a doctor's office is a medical setting where needles are commonly used and can readily be found. In conclusion, the most unlikely place to find a needle among the given options is a haystack. The sheer size of a haystack, the similarity in appearance between needles and hay, the impracticality of searching, and the unlikelihood of needles being purposely placed in haystacks make it a challenging and improbable task. Meanwhile, the other options all present more plausible and familiar environments for finding a needle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Expression of emotion (4/5): The reviewer uses strong language in describing their frustration with the app. They effectively convey their disappointment, using terms like \\"pretty much done with this garbage.\\" This makes it clear that they had a negative experience with the app, which is valuable information for prospective users. 2. Description of the problem (4/5): The reviewer explains the main issue they faced while using the app: planets disappearing from the screen every other day. This description is specific enough to inform potential users of a potentially recurring problem. Although the issue could be elaborated further or given more context, the reviewer does offer a clear summary of the technical issue. 3. Clarity (3/5): The review is easy to understand and gets to the point quickly. However, the choice of words could be improved. The initial statement \\"Was cool\\" could be confusing to some readers, especially when contrasted with the overall negative sentiment expressed in the review. Additionally, the reviewer does not clarify what \\"every other day\\" refers to—it could mean every two days or an inconsistent time period. Lastly, the term \\"garbage\\" is quite strong and might be overly negative, given that they did not discuss any other aspects of the app. 4. Overall impression (2/5): While the review successfully points out a recurring technical issue, it lacks any discussion of the positive features that initially drew the reviewer to the app. In the context of a 1-5 rating scale, it is important to identify any redeeming qualities to provide a balanced evaluation. A more comprehensive review would consider both the strengths and weaknesses of the app, allowing potential users to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of downloading it. Taking the above analysis into account, I would rate this review a 3.25 out of 5.

Hypothesis: Rafts certainly are not something that exist.","output":"The hypothesis \\"rafts certainly are not something that exists\\" is false. In the given paragraph, it states that Alfred Nobel was experimenting on a raft anchored on the river Elbe. Rafts do exist, and they have been an essential part of human history for transportation, fishing, and various other purposes for thousands of years. A raft is a flat structure made of materials such as logs or planks, often lashed together with rope, to create a buoyant device that can float on water. It can be powered by paddles, poles, or sails, depending on its intended use and available materials. Rafts come in different shapes and sizes, and their designs may vary across cultures and geographical locations. Rafts have been mentioned in various historical texts and literature. For example, in ancient Egypt, rafts were used to transport heavy stones during the construction of monuments and buildings. Similarly, rafts have been an essential part of daily life for indigenous people living along the Amazon River in South America. Additionally, the well-known account of Huckleberry Finn and Jim's journey down the Mississippi River, which can be found in Mark Twain's novel \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\\" involves a raft as their mode of transportation. The paragraph also indicates that Alfred Nobel used a raft as a platform for his experiments on making nitroglycerine safer to handle. Nobel was a Swedish scientist, engineer, and inventor, known for various achievements, including the invention of dynamite, mentioned in the paragraph. His work on a raft allowed him to conduct these experiments safely and without fear of causing damage to other structures or the surrounding environment. Since the paragraph contains information about experimenting on a raft and we can also find historical evidence of their existence, it is safe to conclude that the hypothesis \\"rafts certainly are not something that exists\\" is incorrect and needs revision. Rafts most certainly exist and have played an essential role in different aspects of human life throughout history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: KIEV, Ukraine — In an effort to stabilize Ukraine and extend its authority, the interim government has set a deadline of Friday for turning in the illegal firearms that are now carried openly by so-called self-defense groups in Independence Square, the politically important plaza in the center of the capital.      The order was seconded on Thursday by the French ambassador to Ukraine, Alain Rémy, who said the disarmament of the militias that helped overthrow the former government is a central requirement for the European Union to begin disbursing financial aid, along with the government fighting corruption.      Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk, who was a staunch supporter of the protesters but never condoned violent tactics, set the deadline for Friday, the day Ukraine is scheduled to sign the political articles of an association agreement with the European Union.      “For those who want to defend their country with an assault rifle in their hands, welcome to the National Guard or the Army,” Mr. Yatsenyuk said in a speech this week.      Photo      Members of the self-organized defense groups that formed to defend Independence Square and other protest sites during the uprising have been reluctant to comply. Like gun owners in countries like the United States and Switzerland where ownership of firearms is widespread, they contend that the weapons are needed to defend the country against a possible foreign invasion and to defend their freedoms from potential government abuse.      “It’s not normal to ask people to hand in their weapons in the situation we have now,” Dmytro Yarosh, the leader of a right-wing paramilitary group, Right Sector, said in an interview this week. His organization opposes the request to surrender its weapons, but will comply with the law, he said.      Mr. Yarosh said lawyers with his group were drafting a bill for consideration in Parliament that was modeled on Swiss notions of firearms possession, in which an armed population is seen as a quick deterrent against a foreign invasion.      “Allow people to keep weapons at home,” Mr. Yarosh said, describing the logic of gun ownership in the context of Ukraine. “Then, when the enemy walks down the streets of your country, you can shoot him right from your own window.”      Members of Right Sector have not just hunting rifles but also military weapons that were seized from an Interior Ministry arsenal in western Ukraine in the final days of the uprising.      The hunting weapons are legal, if the owner has a permit. In Ukraine, people 21 and older may apply for a license to own a shotgun for hunting, and those 25 and older may apply for a permit to own a rifle.      Pistols that fire nonlethal plastic or rubber bullets are also legal for citizens who can demonstrate a risk of assault because of their profession, which in Ukraine can include law enforcement officers for off-duty use, civil servants and journalists.      The self-defense units have been reluctant to describe in detail the seized military weapons, which were from an arsenal outside the city of Lviv. Mr. Yarosh said Right Sector helped move the weapons to the capital in late February. Today, he said of his supporters, “in part they handed in these weapons, in part they keep them.”      The military weapons reached the capital too late to play a role in the street fighting, protest leaders have said.      Continue reading the main story Advertisement      Most of the opposition street fighters who clashed with the police in Kiev in February carried only baseball bats and other improvised bludgeons, like lead pipes or table legs with nails driven through the ends. But analysts said it was the size of the crowds, rather than weaponry, that was the pivotal political factor.      The interim government is now seeking to integrate the loosely organized militias into a newly formed national guard, though several hard-line groups, including Right Sector, have declined to join.      At the group’s headquarters in the Dnipro Hotel here, where men in jeans and military fatigues guarded the hallways this week, some of them with black-and-red bandannas over their faces, a man with a submachine gun stood guard outside the office of Mr. Yarosh.      “We are ready to become partisans, and are preparing for this role,” Mr. Yarosh said. “Patriots with guns are the best protection.”      Hryhoriy Nemyria, a Parliament member and a former deputy prime minister who supports the government’s position on collecting firearms, said in an interview that far from discouraging a Russian intervention, the widespread distribution of illegal firearms could just as easily be used to justify one.      “Arms out of control of the state are of course a factor in instability, and should not be allowed to drift by inertia,” he said. “In the context of Russian agents crossing the border, the guns are a catalyst for disorder. Arming the population is not our policy.” ||||| MOSCOW (AP) — President Vladimir Putin has signed bills making Crimea part of Russia, completing the annexation from Ukraine.

BRUSSELS The European Union and Ukraine signed the core elements of a political association agreement on Friday, committing to the same deal former president Viktor Yanukovich rejected last November, a move which led to his overthrow.      Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk, EU leaders Herman Van Rompuy and Jose Manuel Barroso, and the leaders of the bloc's 28 nations signed the core chapters of the Association Agreement on the sidelines of an EU summit in Brussels.      The deal commits Ukraine and the EU to closer political and economic cooperation, although more substantial parts of the agreement concerning free trade will only be signed after Ukraine has held new presidential elections in May.      Van Rompuy, the European Council president, said the agreement would bring Ukraine and its 46 million people closer to the heart of Europe and a \\"European way of life\\".      \\"(This) recognizes the aspirations of the people of Ukraine to live in a country governed by values, by democracy and the rule of law, where all citizens have a stake in national prosperity,\\" he said.      Two sets of the documents were passed around the table for the EU's leaders and Yatseniuk to sign in a solemn atmosphere. Van Rompuy and Yatseniuk then shook hands and exchanged the documents to applause, witnesses said.      Coinciding with the signing in Brussels, Russia's upper house of parliament unanimously approved a treaty annexing Ukraine's Crimea region, clearing the way for President Vladimir Putin to sign it into law.      Yanukovich turned his back on signing the EU agreement last November in favor of closer ties with Moscow, prompting months of street protests that eventually led to his fleeing the country. Soon afterwards, Russian forces occupied Crimea, drawing outrage and sanctions from the United States and EU.      As well as the closer political ties, the European Commission has agreed to extend nearly 500 million euros worth of trade benefits to Ukraine, removing customs duties on a wide range of agricultural goods, textiles and other imports.      Once Ukraine has held presidential elections on May 25 and a new administration is in place, the EU plans to move ahead with signing a free-trade agreement with Ukraine, giving the country unfettered access to the EU's market of 500 million consumers.      That has far more potential to strengthen Ukraine's shattered economy, but also runs the risk of provoking retaliatory steps from Russia, which has already imposed stricter customs checks on trade with Ukraine.      The other burden for Kiev is meeting the obligations that come with EU political association, including instituting changes to the rule of law and justice, and adopting business and environmental standards that will require hard work and long-term investment to meet.      (Reporting by Adrian Croft and Luke Baker; editing by Luke Baker) ||||| Vladimir Putin has mocked US sanctions imposed on Russia, saying he will open an account at US-sanctioned Rossiya Bank. During a meeting with the country's senior security officials he added that he won’t introduce a visa regime with Ukraine.      Putin treated with irony the recent sanctions imposed on certain Russian lawmakers.      “Yes, these are those so-called ‘polite people in camouflage with guns’,” ironically said Putin hinting at Western accusations that Russian soldiers have taken bases in Crimea.      “Look at them, typical Moskals [pejorative term for Russians – ED.],” he added, pointing at US sanctioned prominent businessmen Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, Gennady Timchenko, head of the Volga Group and Yury Kovalchuk, the owner of Rossiya Bank. “I need to avoid these citizens as they are ‘compromising the country’.”      On Thursday the US expanded its sanctions list by adding 20 more names. US President Barack Obama announced a new executive order imposing further sanctions on top Russian officials and businessmen.      Aleksey Gromov, First Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration; Sergey Ivanov, Chief of Staff of the Presidential Executive Office; and Sergey Naryshkin, Speaker of the State Duma, the lower chamber of the Russian Parliament, are among those mentioned. Russian Railways President Vladimir Yakunin is also on the list.      The order also allows for measures against Russian energy, mining, defense, and engineering sectors.      Putin also commented on the latest sanction of the US authorities that concerned Russia’s Rossiya Bank, to which international payment systems Visa and MasterCard stopped serving clients on Friday.      The Russian president said he will get his salary via the sanctioned bank.      “I’ve already said that I was going to open an account in this bank, more than that I asked for my salary to be transferred to this account,” he said.      Putin added that Russian authorities should provide any possible support for the clients of the blocked Rossiya Bank, as this “finance establishment has nothing to do with Ukraine crisis.”      “The clients of the bank must be taken under our protection. We also should make sure that neither clients nor the bank will sustain any negative outcome from this situation,” he added.      Putin assured that Russia will refrain from retaliatory sanctions against the US and introducing a visa regime with Ukraine.      Putin believes that millions of innocent Ukrainian would suffer should Russia introduce a visa regime with Ukraine.      “These people are not rich. They work in Russia to provide for their families. We shouldn’t do this,” he added.      Putin also said Russia will continue leading a project to repair helicopters in Afghanistan, which is run by NATO and Russia.      “We should continue this cooperation despite our NATO partners vow to freeze our partnership,” he said.      The so-called helicopter project, financed by both Russia and Western countries, aims at helping Afghanistan repair helicopter equipment produced in Russia and training special personnel to operate this equipment.      Putin’s statement about the visa regime came after reports this week that Ukraine might introduce a visa regime for Russians, but Ukraine’s coup-appointed PM, Arseny Yatsenuk, said the authorities are in no hurry to impose it. ||||| Story highlights \\"Russia needs Europe more than Europe needs Russia,\\" Cameron says      Russia's President Vladimir Putin signs law allowing joining of Crimea to Russia      EU leaders and Ukraine's PM sign the political part of a Ukraine-EU trade deal      Tough U.S. and EU sanctions have been imposed on members of Putin's inner circle      Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk signed the political elements of a trade pact with the European Union on Friday, even as Russian lawmakers finalized annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region.      The signing in Brussels signals Europe's solidarity with Ukraine -- and carries additional symbolic force because it was the decision by Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in November to ditch the trade pact in favor of closer ties with Russia that triggered the protests that led to his ouster in February and spiraled into the current crisis.      It also comes a day after the European Union and the United States slapped sanctions on Russian lawmakers and businessmen; Russia responded with its own list of sanctions against a number of U.S. lawmakers and officials.      In another sign of defiance, Russian President Vladimir Putin, flanked by the speakers of both houses of Parliament, signed a treaty Friday finalizing the accession to Russia of the Crimea region and its port city of Sevastopol.

The political crisis has been the biggest blow to Russia's relations with the West since the Cold War.      In a sign that Western sanctions are already weighing on Russian authorities, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Friday in Moscow that the government will have to pay more to borrow money, state news agency ITAR-Tass said.      Russia \\"will look at our oil and gas revenues. If the situation is like it is now, we will probably have to give up external borrowings and cut domestic ones,\\" Siluanov said.      Yatsenyuk: EU speaking in one voice      Moscow has doggedly pursued its own course even as Western leaders have denounced its actions as violations of Ukraine's sovereignty and a breach of international law.      Though Russia insists that its actions are legitimate, Ukraine's interim government has said Kiev will never stop fighting for Crimea.      Human Rights Watch said in a statement Friday that it has concluded that the international law of occupation applies to Russian forces in Crimea. \\"The occupying party is ultimately responsible for violations of international law committed by local authorities or proxy forces,\\" it said.      While in Brussels, Yatsenyuk held talks with European Council President Herman Van Rompuy and European Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso.      He said Russia's ratification of the treaty annexing Crimea is less important than the EU trade pact he has signed with EU leaders.      \\"Frankly speaking, I don't care about Russia signing this deal; I care about Ukraine, Ukrainians and our European future,\\" he said. \\"This deal covers more existential and most important issues, mainly security and defense cooperation.\\"      Yatsenyuk said the European Union would \\"speak in one single and strong voice\\" to protect its values and defend Ukraine's territorial integrity.      Van Rompuy said the deal \\"shows our steadfast support for the course the people of Ukraine have courageously pursued.\\"      EU travel bans, asset freezes      The European Union confirmed details of the sanctions against 12 Russian officials agreed to late Thursday at the EU Heads of State or Government summit.      Those targeted with travel bans and asset freezes include Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, as well as the chairwoman of the Russian upper house, Valentina Matvienko, and two Putin advisers.      \\"Sanctions are not a question of retaliation; they are a foreign policy tool,\\" Van Rompuy said. \\"Our goal is to stop Russian action against Ukraine, to restore Ukraine's sovereignty, and to achieve this, we need a negotiated solution.\\"      He said the European Union expected soon to finalize approval of the remaining parts of the deal, particularly its economic provisions.      British Prime Minister David Cameron said the European Commission will draw up further sanctions -- in finance, military and energy -- for use if the situation escalates.      \\"Europe is, I think, 25% or so reliant on Russian gas,\\" he said. \\"But if you look at Gazprom's revenues, something like 50% of them come from Europe. So, you know, Russia needs Europe more than Europe needs Russia.\\"      Cameron said the measures agreed to in Brussels will carry a cost for Crimea, whose goods would face heavy penalties and tariffs in Europe if they are shipped through Russia, not Ukraine.      EU leaders want to see an international observer mission in Crimea, preferably under the aegis of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe but, if not, sent by the European Union, Cameron said.      Ban: 'Deeply concerned'      A day after speaking with Putin in Moscow, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon met Friday in Kiev with acting President Oleksandr Turchynov, then told reporters he was \\"very deeply concerned\\" by the tensions in parts of Ukraine and between Kiev and Moscow. \\"These are some of the most traumatic and difficult times in the history of Ukraine,\\" he said.      Ban urged a peaceful, diplomatic resolution to the crisis and said all parties should refrain from inflammatory actions and rhetoric.      U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights Ivan Simonovic arrived Friday in Crimea for a two-day visit aimed at laying the groundwork for a U.N. human rights monitoring mission, the United Nations said.      He and a team were to meet with Crimean leaders, the head of the Crimean Tatar minority and others, including the families of Ukrainian servicemen, the United Nations said.      The United Nations and other organizations stand ready to assist with the country's elections, slated to be held May 25, Ban said. While in Kiev, he was also planning to meet with Yatsenyuk and other ministers and lawmakers.      In another sign of solidarity with Ukraine, France is offering to strengthen a NATO air-policing mission in the Baltic area by sending four jets, a Defense Ministry spokesman said Friday.      The offer, accepted by the Baltic states, was extended Friday as French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian traveled to Lithuania, Estonia and Poland, said Sacha Mandel, the minister's communication adviser.      His trip followed a visit to the Baltics this week by Vice President Joe Biden.      Putin's inner circle      JUST WATCHED The deadly day that changed Kiev Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The deadly day that changed Kiev 03:35      The U.S. sanctions announced Thursday target 20 people seen as close to Putin, as well as a bank, Rossiya, believed to serve the President and senior Russian officials.      Putin rejected the putative link. \\"I personally didn't have an account there, but I'll definitely open it on Monday,\\" he said Friday, according to the Kremlin.      The individuals named by the U.S. Treasury include Putin allies in the Kremlin and in business. Among the 16 government officials are Putin's chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov; the speaker of the State Duma, Sergey Naryshkin; and Viktor Ozerov, chairman of the Security and Defense Committee of the Russian Parliament's upper house.      Four others were named as members of the government's inner circle. They are financier Yuri Kovalchuk, labeled Putin's personal banker by a senior U.S. administration official; magnate Gennady Timchenko, whose activities in the energy sector have been directly linked to Putin, according to the Treasury; and businessmen Arkady and Boris Rotenberg.      Washington aid      In Washington, the House Foreign Affairs Committee introduced a bill Friday that provides aid to Ukraine.      \\"The United States must stand with the people of Ukraine in the wake of Russia's attack on and occupation of Crimea,\\" said ranking member Eliot Engel, D-New York, in a statement. \\"It sends a clear message to President Putin and his corrupt cronies that we will not tolerate Russian aggression.\\"      The House had passed a loan-guarantee bill and a non-binding resolution calling for sanctions, but Friday's legislation proposes statutory language to put those sanctions into law.      President Barack Obama is to meet next week with other leaders of the so-called G7 group of industrialized nations, on the sidelines of a nuclear summit in the Netherlands. Russia has been excluded from the talks.      Obama signed an executive order that authorizes further sanctions on key sectors of the Russian economy if Moscow does not act to deescalate the situation.      Sanctions affect Russian markets      Washington had already announced sanctions Monday on 11 individuals; the European Union had imposed travel bans and asset freezes on 21 people.      Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that the new round of U.S. sanctions would be \\"significantly more powerful than the first one.\\"      The latest round \\"hits significant economic interests that are fairly close to the ruling circles in Moscow,\\" he said. \\"It will be noticed.\\"      Markets were down Friday in Moscow, amid uncertainty in the business community.      The Moscow Interbank Curency Exchange, or MICEX index, fell more than 2% -- bringing its 2014 losses to 14%. The ruble rebounded after falling early in the day; it has lost about 10% since the start of the year.      In contrast, the markets and ruble had risen Monday, when the first round of sanctions was announced and did not appear to target those in Putin's inner circle.      The business community now appears to fear that Putin is on a collision course with the West, and that that could undermine its interests.      Russia's Foreign Ministry said Friday that it had asked Putin to draft countermeasures in response to the expanded Western sanctions.      On Thursday, Moscow imposed measures against nine U.S. officials and lawmakers, including House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Sens. John McCain, Robert Menendez, Daniel Coats and Mary Landrieu, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry. ||||| SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) — Ukraine has joined two weeks of multinational military exercises that involve troops from 12 NATO member and partner nations, and demonstrate that cooperation continues between the alliance and the crisis-torn former Soviet republic.

Do you like football? You do? Well, that's fabulous! But sometimes, my dear friends, football is not just about scoring touchdowns on the field. There are things that are happening off the field too, just like in the case of a special player named Terrell.  Terrell is very good at playing football. He can run fast, dodge other players, and even catch the ball while leaping high in the air. Because of his amazing skills, a lot of people thinks he should get a special reward, something we call being part of the 'Hall of Fame'. The Hall of Fame is where we honour really good football players, kind of like how your school rewards you with a gold star for being nice or doing well on a test. But, there's a but, buddy! Even if someone is really good at something, they also need to be good at behaving, just like how you're expected to behave in school. Terrell sometimes does things off the field, when he's not playing football, that are not very nice - we call these 'antics'. Think of it like this: if you did really well on a test, but were mean to your classmates, you wouldn't get a gold star, right? Mr. Myers, an important man who talks about football, believes that Terrell's not-so-good antics are keeping him out of the Hall of Fame. That means, because of his behavior, he's not getting the special reward, even though he is a great player. But - don't worry - this is only 'for now'. That means that if Terrell starts to behave better, he might just get into the Hall of Fame soon enough. Just like you, buddy, could still get your gold star by being kind to your classmates. So, the next time you think about how well you're playing, also remember to think about how well you're behaving. After all, both are important. Football and life is not just about winning games or getting the highest score, it is also about how you act and behave along the way."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Doctors fighting malaria---one of the deadliest diseases on the planet--- may soon have a new affordable weapon in their smart phones. Researchers have found a way to use the phone's camera to detect the microorganism in the patient's blood that causes the disease. According to the World Health Organization, almost 600,000 people died of malaria in 2013, making this mosquito-borne disease one of the deadliest in the world. The saddest aspect of this calamity  is that it affects mostly young children. Early detection of the infection is important for successful treatment. But since the first symptoms resemble ordinary flu, a microbiologist must look at a drop of a patient's blood under a microscope for a proper diagnosis. Scientists in Britain have now developed a smart phone attachment called Xrapid, that turns the phone into a 200-power microscope, while the attached app---based on facial recognition software - quickly detects the parasitic protozoa in the blood smear . Jean Viry-Babel is the CEO of IanXen, the company that developed the app. He says it is cheap and works on the spot. \\"So we take a high-definition picture of a sample of blood. We separate the red blood cells from the rest---the white blood cells, the platelets ---and we start looking at each of the red blood cells individually,\\" said Viry-Babel. Viry-Babel says the app is affordable, easy to use and provides reliability of up to 98 percent. The only additional equipment required is an ordinary glass lab slide - called a \\"slate.\\" \\"There's only one button, which is called \\"Diagnose\\". So you put it on the slate and you put it on the dried blood, and you press diagnose and it tells you yes or no,\\" he said. Researchers say the field-testing of the device will begin in January and February in Tanzania, Benin and Indonesia --- while commercial use is scheduled to start by the end of March. They also plan to expand the versatility of the new device---teaching it to recognize other diseases, such as tuberculosis and Lyme Disease. Question: What can we learn from Viry-Babel? Yes or no, is the answer \\"The accuracy of the app is nearly a hundred percent.\\"?","output":"From Jean Viry-Babel, the CEO of IanXen, the company that developed the Xrapid app, we can learn that this innovative solution could revolutionize the early detection and treatment of malaria using a smartphone's camera. By taking a high-definition picture of a blood sample, the app can separate red blood cells from other components and examine them individually for the presence of the parasitic protozoa that causes malaria. Regarding the question's statement about accuracy, while the answer is not an exact \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\", it is important to note that Viry-Babel claims the app's reliability is up to 98 percent. Thus, one could infer that the app's accuracy is nearly one hundred percent, although it is not quite perfect.  The Xrapid app is affordable, easy to use, and only requires an ordinary glass lab slide, or \\"slate,\\" as additional equipment. With a simple \\"diagnose\\" button, users can capture a blood sample image and receive a positive or negative result for the presence of malaria in the patient's blood. Field-testing for the device is set to begin in countries like Tanzania, Benin, and Indonesia, with commercial use scheduled to start by the end of March.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The highest point of a wave is the crest. The lowest point is the trough. The vertical distance between a crest and a trough is the height of the wave. Wave height is also called amplitude. The horizontal distance between two crests is the wavelength. Both amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size. The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. Some of the biggest waves occur with hurricanes. A hurricane is a storm that forms over the ocean. Its winds may blow more than 150 miles per hour! The winds also travel over long distances and may last for many days.  After reading the above, is \\"While swimming\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How do you calculate the height of a wave?\\"?","output":"No, \\"while swimming\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"How do you calculate the height of a wave?\\". Instead, you calculate the height of a wave by measuring the vertical distance between the crest and the trough of the wave, which is also referred to as the amplitude. This can be done through various methods such as using visual observations, wave-measuring instruments, or remote sensing techniques. One common method of measuring wave height is by using a wave sensor or a wave buoy. These devices typically contain an accelerometer or another sensitive instrument that can detect changes in the water's surface level as a wave passes by. The data collected by the device can then be analyzed to determine the height of the waves. Another method for measuring wave height is by using remote sensing technologies. Satellites and radar systems can provide valuable information about the size and shape of ocean waves. They detect the changes in the water's surface from a distance, and then use algorithms to calculate the wave height based on the observations. In addition, researchers and oceanographers can also estimate wave heights based on visual observations. This can be done by comparing the wave height to known markers or objects in the water, such as buoys or other floating items. However, this method can be less accurate than using instruments or remote sensing techniques. It is important to note that the size of a wave depends on several factors such as wind speed and duration, fetch (the distance over which the wind blows), and the depth of the water. Larger waves typically result from stronger winds, longer durations, and larger fetches."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Broadcasting is the distribution of audio and/or video content or other messages to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium, but typically one using the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves), in a one-to-many model. Broadcasting began with AM radio, which came into popular use around 1920 with the spread of vacuum tube radio transmitters and receivers. Before this, all forms of electronic communication (early radio, telephone, and telegraph) were one-to-one, with the message intended for a single recipient. The term \\"broadcasting\\", borrowed from the agricultural method of sowing seeds in a field by casting them broadly about, was coined by either KDKA manager Frank Conrad or RCA historian George Clark around 1920 to distinguish this new activity of \\"one-to-many\\" communication; a single radio station transmitting to multiple listeners.  - Radio frequency (RF) is any of the electromagnetic wave frequencies that lie in the range extending from around to , which include those frequencies used for communications or radar signals.

Context: The aircraft carrier dramatically changed naval combat in World War II, because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare. The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. They had higher range and precision than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto, signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships during the Norwegian campaign in 1940. Answer:","output":"An aircraft carrier was sunk during the Norwegian campaign in 1940."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Grace Beverly Jones (born 19 May 1948) is a Jamaican singer, songwriter, supermodel, record producer, and actress. Born in Jamaica, she moved when she was 13, along with her siblings, to live with her parents in Syracuse, New York. Jones began her modelling career in New York state, then in Paris, working for fashion houses such as Yves St. Laurent and Kenzo, and appearing on the covers of Elle and Vogue. She worked with photographers such as Jean-Paul Goude, Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin, and Hans Feurer, and became known for her distinctive androgynous appearance and bold features. Jones was signed by Island Records, who put her in the studio with disco record producer, Tom Moulton. Moulton worked at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, and Portfolio, was released in 1977. The album featured three songs from Broadway musicals, \\"Send in the Clowns\\" by Stephen Sondheim from A Little Night Music, \\"What I Did for Love\\" from A Chorus Line and \\"Tomorrow\\" from Annie. The second side of the album opens up with a seven-minute reinterpretation of Edith Piaf's \\"La Vie en rose\\" followed by three new recordings, two of which were co-written by Jones, \\"Sorry\\", and \\"That's the Trouble\\". The album finished with \\"I Need a Man\\", Jones' first club hit. The artwork to the album was designed by Richard Bernstein, an artist for Interview.  In 1978, Jones and Moulton made Fame, an immediate follow-up to Portfolio, also recorded at Sigma Sound Studios. The album featured another reinterpretation of a French classic, \\"Autumn Leaves\\" by Jacques Prevert. The Canadian edition of the vinyl album included another French language track, \\"Comme un oiseau qui s'envole\\", which replaced \\"All on a Summers Night\\"; in most locations this song served as the B-side of the single \\"Do or Die\\". In the North American club scene, Fame was a hit album and the \\"Do or Die\\"/\\"Pride\\"/\\"Fame\\" side reached top 10 on both the US Hot Dance Club Play and Canadian Dance/Urban charts. The album was released on compact disc in the early 1990s, but soon went out of print. In 2011, it was released and remastered by Gold Legion, a record company that specialises in reissuing classic disco albums on CD. Jones' live shows were highly sexualized and flamboyant, leading her to be called \\"Queen of the Gay Discos.\\"  Muse was the last of Jones' disco albums. The album features a re-recorded version \\"I'll Find My Way to You\\", which Jones released three years prior to Muse. Originally appearing in the 1976 Italian film, Colt 38 Special Squad in which Jones had a role as a club singer, Jones also recorded a song called \\"Again and Again\\" that was featured in the film. Both songs were produced by composer Stelvio Cipriani. Icelandic keyboardist Thor Baldursson arranged most of the album and also sang duet with Jones on the track \\"Suffer\\". Like the last two albums, the cover art is by Richard Bernstein. Like Fame, Muse was later released by Gold Legion.

Short general knowledge question: what state was ronald reagan governor of?","output":"Ronald Reagan was the governor of California before becoming the President of the United States. He served as governor from January 2, 1967, to January 6, 1975. Born in Tampico, Illinois, in 1911, Reagan started his career as a radio announcer before transitioning into acting, where he appeared in more than 50 films. His interest in politics grew during his time as the president of the Screen Actors Guild and as a spokesperson for the General Electric company. It was during this time that he evolved from being a supporter of the Democratic party to a conservative Republican. As the governor of California, Reagan implemented budget cuts, especially in areas concerning welfare and education, while striving to control government spending and consolidate the state's budget. Additionally, he pushed for tax reforms and began developing his anti-Communist stance, which became central to his political career later on. Reagan's tenure as California's governor was marked by both support and opposition, particularly in response to his budgetary decisions. He was known for his pro-business approach and belief in limited government intervention in social matters. Following his time as governor, Reagan made two unsuccessful bids for the Republican nomination for president in 1968 and 1976. However, he eventually secured the nomination in 1980 and went on to defeat incumbent President Jimmy Carter. Reagan was elected the 40th President of the United States and served two consecutive terms from January 20, 1981, to January 20, 1989. Throughout his presidency, Reagan implemented economic policies dubbed \\"Reaganomics,\\" which promoted free-market capitalism, deregulation, and reductions in tax rates. He is also remembered for his staunch anti-communist stance and efforts to end the Cold War, including the famous \\"Tear down this wall!\\" speech in Berlin in 1987. His presidency was marked by major events such as the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster (1986), the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (1987), and the Iran-Contra affair (1985-1987). After leaving office in 1989, Reagan retired to his home in California and announced in 1994 that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. He passed away on June 5, 2004, and his legacy in American politics continues to influence both the Republican party and the broader political landscape in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Passage:Bathurst had been the location of the annual Mi'kmaq summer coastal community of Nepisiguit prior to European settlement. Europeans first reached the shores of the Baie des Chaleurs when in 1534 it was named by Jacques Cartier. Early settlers from France came to the area in the 17th century in what became part of the colony of Acadia. In 1607 Samuel de Champlain sailed into the Miramichi, and in 1636, Nicolas Denys was granted a seignory by the French crown, apparently the third grant in the colony of Acadie. Jean Jacques Enaud, who hailed from the French Basque Country, was granted in 1638 the seignory at the southeastern gap of the harbor later named Alston Point. Remark is made on William Francis Ganong's map of Bathurst Harbour, depicted here at left, of the residence of Nicolas Denys and the seignory of Gobin.  Links: a. Nicolas Denys b. Miꞌkmaq c. Jacques Cartier d. Nicolas Denys A:","output":"Before answering the question, I will look up more information on each of the four provided terms and determine which one is the most relevant to answer the question: a. Nicolas Denys - A French explorer, trader, and colonist in the 17th century in Acadia. He doesn't seem directly connected to the naming of Baie des Chaleurs. b. Mi'kmaq - An indigenous people in the northeastern region of North America. They might have been around when Jacques Cartier named Baie des Chaleurs, but the term doesn't help in answering the question about his age. c. Jacques Cartier - A French explorer who named Baie des Chaleurs and explored the region in 1534. This term seems relevant to answer the question about his age. d. Nicolas Denys - This term is repeated and doesn't provide any additional information beyond what was mentioned in option 'a.' After reviewing the four provided terms, it seems that term 'c.

A: Select from: [+] digestion system; [+] nervous system; [+] respiratory system; [+] immune system; Answer:","output":"The immune system is the organ system responsible for defending the body from pathogens and other causes of disease. The immune system is a complex and multifaceted system that plays a crucial role in maintaining the overall health and well-being of an individual. Many organs, tissues, and cells work together to protect the body from foreign invaders, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other harmful substances. The immune system includes various components, such as the white blood cells (leukocytes), bone marrow, lymph nodes, thymus, and spleen. These components function together to identify and neutralize threats, helping to prevent infections and diseases. White blood cells (leukocytes) are a key part of the immune system. They can be divided into two groups: phagocytes and lymphocytes. Phagocytes, such as macrophages and neutrophils, are responsible for engulfing and destroying pathogens, whereas lymphocytes, such as B-cells and T-cells, play a crucial role in immune response, including antibody production, antigen recognition, and cell-mediated immunity. The bone marrow is the site of white blood cell production in the body. It contains hematopoietic stem cells, which can differentiate into various blood cell types, including immune cells. These cells are then released into the bloodstream, where they can migrate to the sites of infection or injury to perform their protective functions. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped structures that are part of the lymphatic system. They serve as a filtration system, trapping foreign particles such as bacteria and viruses, and allowing the immune cells to destroy them. When an infection occurs, the lymph nodes may swell as they work to contain and fight off the pathogens. The thymus is an immune organ located behind the breastbone and serves as a site for T-cell maturation and differentiation. Developing T-cells migrate to the thymus, where they undergo a process of maturation and selection, ensuring that they can recognize and respond to foreign antigens and pathogens. The spleen is another important organ in the immune system, located on the left side of the abdomen. Its main function is to filter and purify the blood and remove old or damaged blood cells. In addition, the spleen contains a high concentration of white blood cells, which can identify and destroy pathogens that have entered the bloodstream. All these components work in harmony to ensure that the immune system can adapt and respond to a wide range of threats. The immune system has both innate and adaptive components, allowing it to provide a rapid and non-specific response to pathogens while also developing a more targeted and long-lasting defense through the production of specific antibodies and memory cells. In this way, the immune system is uniquely equipped to protect the body from a diverse array of harmful substances, ensuring that we remain healthy and resistant to disease."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Proud of her job: Rebekah Brooks leaving the Phone Hacking trial at the Old Bailey in London. Rebekah Brooks spent £159,000 to buy the story of a prostitute caught performing a sex act on Hugh Grant, the phone-hacking trial heard yesterday. Divine Brown was paid 100,000 (£64,000) directly by the News of the World for her sordid story and the tabloid lavished another £95,000 flying her and her entire family by private jet to a luxury resort in the Nevada desert. Brooks, then the features editor, said this was to prevent rival newspapers spoiling their exclusive story about Grant. But she denied there was a ‘dark arts department’ for phone hacking at the News of the World, which she later edited. Brooks, 45, told the Old Bailey she knew nothing of the illegal interception of voicemails by the tabloid’s private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and had never heard his name mentioned when she was editor. It was her first chance to defend herself after four months of prosecution claims that she was central in a conspiracy at the News of the World and The Sun to hack phones and to corrupt public officials. While recounting her rapid rise through the ‘old school misogyny’ of the newspaper world, Brooks told how as the News of the World’s features editor, her speciality was buying up celebrities for exclusive stories. When Four Weddings And A Funeral star Grant was arrested with Miss Brown in a car on Hollywood’s Sunset Boulevard in June 1995, the paper’s US editor and a colleague managed to track down the prostitute after she was released from custody. Brooks said she spent her entire weekly budget of £60,000 chartering a plane for Miss Brown – real name Estella Marie Thompson – and her family. ‘Miss Brown had been traced to her family home by one of the paper’s reporters, a former private investigator, after her arrest with Mr Grant in Los Angeles. Divine Brown: Flown into hiding. Hugh Grant: Arrested in LA in 1995. ‘We flew them to a place in Nevada – the desert’, she added, breaking into laughter. ‘It seems silly now, but it was really important. ‘She was very smart. She wanted all her family relocated so we had to hire a plane because there were so many of them... it ended up costing around 200,000... 250,000. It was probably one of the biggest expenses I had done, which is why I have a relatively clear memory of it.’ She later had to explain the ‘huge cost’ to the paper’s editor and managing editor. Brooks moved to The Sun in January 1998 and said she brought her contacts with her. One was Spurs footballer Paul Gascoigne, whom she paid £50,000 to £80,000 for an exclusive interview about his domestic violence towards his former wife Sheryl. She also ‘dealt a lot’ with PR guru Max Clifford, who ‘brokered stories’ to her. Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks and her husband Charlie Brooks leave the court. Brooks – one of the most influential women in Britain until her arrest over the hacking allegations – had smiled as she entered the witness box, moments after hearing one of the charges against her had been dropped. Dressed in a demure cream cardigan with pearl buttons and a knee-length royal blue shift dress, and with her red curls pinned back off her face, she spoke softly and hesitantly of how her career began sweeping newsroom floors and making tea but took her into the corridors of power by the age of 29. It included meetings with Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson before they entered Government and careers advice from Rupert Murdoch. The media tycoon entered her office when she was appointed deputy editor at the News of the World and told her: ‘You’ve got a long career ahead, take your time and learn on the job.’ He told her to avoid publicity and that he did not want her ‘spouting forth opinions’ on current affairs programmes. She said: ‘He gave good advice – you are a newspaper executive, it’s hard work, keep your head down.’ Initially faltering and hesitant, Brooks had been warned she was likely to spend a long time in the witness box. She appeared to grow in composure as she was challenged directly about the phone-hacking allegations. The jury has heard that Mulcaire has admitted targeting dozens of celebrities on the orders of former News of the World journalists Greg Miskiw and Neville Thurlbeck. The three have admitted conspiring to hack phones. Jonathan Laidlaw QC, for Brooks, asked her if she had ever heard any of her journalists talk about Mulcaire while she was editor, between May 2000 and January 2003. ‘No,’ she answered immediately. She said she had known the tabloid used private detectives – as did  other newspapers, City firms and lawyers – but insisted she had never heard Mulcaire’s name mentioned, nor had any knowledge of his involvement in phone hacking. Mr Laidlaw said the prosecution had alleged she had established an investigations unit dubbed the ‘dark arts department’ specifically to hack phones. ‘That’s not true,’ Brooks replied, adding: ‘I don’t recognise that description.’ Brooks said she was proud of the undercover work carried out by the News of the World, which had been in the public interest. She told the jury it was ‘impossible’ for an editor to know the source for every article in their newspaper. She described the ‘incredibly competitive’ atmosphere inside the tabloid – once Britain’s best-selling newspaper – and said her rapid promotion had exposed her to sexist jibes. ‘There was probably a bit of old school misogyny added into the competition there would have been if I was a bloke,’ she said. ‘The competitiveness was engrained into the News of the World... It was a tough world.’ Brooks denies four charges of conspiring to hack phones, commit misconduct and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Her husband, racehorse trainer Charlie Brooks, and her former lover, ex-News of the World Andy Coulson, watched from the dock as she gave her evidence. They also deny all the charges against them.

Then we asked his mother to look after our two children and started off. During the week's time, we visited London and Paris--as much as we could, Big Ben, the Eiffel Tower and so on. All these were beautiful places we expected to see before. We really had a fantastic time. On our last night in Paris, after we enjoyed the night sight of the Eiffel Tower, my husband called home. His mother answered the phone. In a second, my husband's face fell and looked so worried. I could feel there was something bad. \\"What's wrong?\\" I asked. He didn't answer and went on to listen. A few minutes later, he said sadly to me that Tony, our seven-year-old son, fell down from his bike and broke his leg. He must be sent to hospital at once. At that moment, Paris suddenly lost its charm . \\"I don't want to be here! I shouldn't be here! I should be home with my kids!\\" We hurried back to our hotel and then to the airport...

Based on the choices provided, both options [a] and [b] can be effective in turning on a ceiling fan. Here is a detailed explanation of the steps and potential scenarios surrounding the two methods: [a] Make sure the buttons on the fan and related wall outlets are on: 1. First and foremost, ensure that the ceiling fan is properly installed, and the power supply is connected accurately. This involves checking the wiring as well as confirming that the circuit breaker or fuse is intact. 2. If the ceiling fan has an associated button or switch on its body, turn it on. This button is typically located on the side or bottom part of the fan motor housing. 3. Next, locate the wall outlet or switch that is designated to control the fan. In some cases, there might be a single switch that controls both the fan and the light, while in other cases, they may be controlled separately. Turn the switch or switches on. 4. If the fan still does not operate even after switching on both the fan and the outlet, check for potential issues -- such as damage to the outlet, loose wiring connections in the fan or the switch, or a burnt motor. In such cases, consider consulting an electrician for further assistance. [b] Make sure the pull string on the fan and related wall switches are on: 1. As previously mentioned, confirm that the ceiling fan is properly installed, and the power supply is connected, including checking the wiring and ensuring the circuit breaker or fuse is functioning correctly. 2. If your ceiling fan uses a pull string mechanism, locate the pull string on the fan, which is usually hanging from the motor housing or the bottom part of the fan. Pull the string gently to turn the fan on. Note that pull chains are often used to control both the fan speed and light, so pulling the chain multiple times may be necessary to achieve the desired speed setting. 3. Similar to the first method, locate the wall switch or switches designated to control the fan and turn them on. 4. If the fan still does not operate, evaluate the potential issues mentioned in the first method, and consider consulting an electrician for further assistance. In conclusion, both methods [a] and [b] can be effective strategies for turning on a ceiling fan; however, it will typically depend on the specific design and features of the fan being used. Remember to follow the manufacturer's instructions for proper operation and consult with a professional electrician for any electrical or installation concerns to ensure safety."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Traditional Japanese food is surely one of the healthiest and most delicious in the world, and _ , foods like tofu, sushi and even green tea are now familiar and can be found easily out of Japan. As a national cuisine , thanks to many social as well as political changes, Japanese food has greatly developed over the past few centuries. In ancient times, when much of the traditional cuisine was influenced by Korean and Chinese cultures, Japanese cuisine slowly changed with the start of the medieval period, which brought along with it new tastes. With the coming of the modern age, a great many changes took place and the Japanese cuisine was influenced greatly by Western culture. However, the traditional Japanese food of today is still very like what existed toward the end of the 19th century. This would mean that a large part of the Japanese cuisine includes those foods whose cooking methods and ingredients have been introduced from other cultures, but which have since then been experimented with and developed by the Japanese themselves. The thing about Japanese food is that you either will love it or will completely look down upon it. With traditional Japanese food, there is no such thing as an in-between.

Article: Baked beans have a long and storied history - Native Americans cooked dishes resembling modern baked beans in New England before the arrival of European colonists. Early baked bean recipes in the United States often used salt pork  - then a commonly-used ingredient - instead of bacon. Salt pork, like bacon, is derived from the fatty portions of the pig.  To give your baked beans an old-fashioned touch, prepare your salt pork by briefly boiling it to remove some of its salt, then fry in a pan until crispy, like bacon. Next, simply substitute your salt pork for bacon! For a truly authentic Native American baked bean dish, use dear (or even bear) instead of pork products and use maple syrup instead of molasses. One great way to give your baked beans a good \\"kick\\" is to chop up a jalapeño pepper or two when sauteing your onions and bell peppers.

Please answer this question: who does ryan end up with in the office?","output":"In the American television series \\"The Office,\\" which is an adaptation of the British show of the same name, Ryan Howard is a character played by B.J. Novak. Ryan's romantic relationships are rather tumultuous, but there are two primary relationships he engages in throughout the show's run.  The first significant relationship Ryan has is with Kelly Kapoor, portrayed by Mindy Kaling. Their on-again, off-again relationship spans a significant portion of the series. Ryan and Kelly's dynamic is marked by constant drama, breakups, and reconciliations. Despite their challenges, they share an undeniable chemistry and are frequently drawn back together. Even while they are dating other people, there's an underlying tension that suggests they are never truly over each other. In Season 9, Ryan starts a relationship with a character named Julia, played by Julianna Guill. Ryan makes it clear that he has moved on from Kelly, and he seems to be trying to build a serious relationship with Julia. However, as with most things in Ryan's life, this relationship is also marked by immaturity and self-sabotaging behavior. Ryan ultimately harms any chance of a future with Julia when he lies about being a single father in an attempt to impress her. The ending of \\"The Office\\" suggests a reunion between Ryan and Kelly. In the series finale, Ryan resurfaces at Dwight and Angela's wedding. There, he not only reconnects with Kelly, but also stages an elaborate scheme to win her back. Ryan fakes an allergic reaction, leaving his supposed child (actually his friend's) behind, trusting that Kelly's fiance, Ravi, who is a pediatrician, will take care of the child. Seizing this opportunity, Ryan and Kelly run away together, signifying that they will likely continue their dramatic and tumultuous relationship. Although \\"The Office\\" does not provide a definitive answer about the fate of their relationship, the show's conclusion implies that Ryan ends up with Kelly Kapoor, at least for the moment. They share an intense emotional connection, albeit a dysfunctional one, and it seems that their story is one of constant rekindling and breaking away from one another."},{"instruction":"Question: \\"The openings of \\"O Fortuna\\", \\"Also sprach Zarathustra\\", and this other opening are often used commercially.\\"  Context: \\"Certain staples of classical music are often used commercially (either in advertising or in movie soundtracks).

On December 5 the Armenian Revolutionary Committee , made up of mostly Armenians from Azerbaijan, also entered the city. Finally, on the following day, December 6, Felix Dzerzhinsky's dreaded secret police, the Cheka, entered Yerevan, thus effectively ending all existence of the First Republic of Armenia. The Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic was then proclaimed, under the leadership of Gevork Atarbekyan. On February 18, 1921, a national revolt against Bolsheviks started. Gen. Garegin Nzhdeh, commander Garo Sasouni and the last Prime Minister of independent Armenia Simon Vratsyan took the lead of the anti-Bolshevik rebellion and forced out the Bolsheviks from Yerevan and other places. By April the Red Army reconquered most part of Armenia. However, Atarbekyan was dismissed and Aleksandr Miasnikyan, an Armenian high-ranking Red Army commander, replaced him. Garegin Nzhdeh left the Zangezur mountains after the Sovietization of Armenia was finalized in July 1921, leaving Azeri-populated villages cleansed of their population.

Question: Jesse talked to Casey about what they were going to do for Halloween that year.  Given the context: What will happen to Jesse?  Possible answers: go to bed, watch a movie, find a costume Answer:","output":"Given the context, it appears that Jesse and Casey will discuss their plans for Halloween and decide on what activities they would like to partake in during the holiday. As Halloween approaches, Jesse will likely collaborate with Casey to find the best possible ways to celebrate and have fun together. One of the possible answers provided is that Jesse will \\"find a costume.\\" This is a likely outcome as costumes are an essential part of Halloween celebrations. Jesse and Casey may search for creative and unique costumes that they could wear to a party or while trick-or-treating. They could visit local costume stores or shop online for the perfect outfits. Additionally, they may also consider creating their own costumes from everyday items or crafting materials as a fun and budget-friendly alternative. Another possible answer is that Jesse will \\"watch a movie.\\" This is also a plausible scenario, as watching Halloween-themed movies is a popular way to enjoy the spooky spirit of the holiday. Jesse and Casey might make a list of classic horror films, family-friendly Halloween movies, or other films that are fitting for the occasion. They can spend the evening together, hosting a movie marathon, perhaps with delicious themed snacks and beverages, adding to the festive atmosphere. The final potential answer, \\"go to bed,\\" seems like an unlikely outcome for Jesse on Halloween night. However, it is possible that after Jesse has spent the evening participating in festive events like costume finding, trick-or-treating, or attending a Halloween party with Casey, they may be tired and decide to call it a night, heading to bed to rest. In conclusion, the most probable outcomes for Jesse are to either find a costume for Halloween or watch a movie with Casey to celebrate the holiday. While going to bed is possible, it is less likely to be the primary focus of their Halloween plans, as it does not directly relate to the festive activities commonly associated with the celebration."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He gave Snow his dagger, and rode off into the woods, and was never seen again. Snow White searched for him, devastated that he wasn't found. Now she is at the mercy of the Queen.Present time. Ten years after the King vanished in the Dark Woods without a trace, Snow White (Lily Collins) talks to and plays with the birds. She has never left the castle. Downstairs she hears music. The Queen is sitting on her throne, and it looks like shes playing chess with her servants by using them as human pawns and she is playing with her top minister known only as the Barton (Michael Lerner).

Middle Ages During the later Roman Empire, the principal military developments were attempts to create an effective cavalry force as well as the continued development of highly specialised types of troops. The creation of heavily armoured cataphract-type soldiers as cavalry was an important feature of the 5th-century Roman military. The various invading tribes had differing emphasis on types of soldiers—ranging from the primarily infantry Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain to the Vandals and Visigoths, who had a high proportion of cavalry in their armies. During the early invasion period, the stirrup had not been introduced into warfare, which limited the usefulness of cavalry as shock troops because it was not possible to put the full force of the horse and rider behind blows struck by the rider. The greatest change in military affairs during the invasion period was the adoption of the Hunnic composite bow in place of the earlier, and weaker, Scythian composite bow. Another development was the increasing use of longswords and the progressive replacement of scale armour by mail armour and lamellar armour.

Step 2: Apply the given fact to Jonah's family situation In the question, it is mentioned that Jonah's family was barely getting any food when they plowed the field by hand. This indicates that their farming technique (plowing by hand) was not efficient in providing enough food for the family. Step 3: Consider the effects of using machines in Jonah's family's case When Jonah's family got machines to help with the farming, their situation should change according to the given fact. Since using machines leads to an increase in food supply, it is reasonable to assume that Jonah's family also experienced an increase in food supply after getting the machines to help in their farming activities.

Other scientists were skeptical, to say the least. And now the researchers' sample has apparently disappeared, which Gizmodo finds awfully \\"convenient.\\" Scientists have been trying to create metallic hydrogen for 80 years, the Christian Science Monitor reports. Isaac Silvera, whose team claimed to have finally created it, tells the Harvard Gazette metallic hydrogen is \\"the Holy Grail of high-pressure physics.\\" One reason: It could be used to create \\"the most powerful rocket propellant known to man,\\" opening up further reaches of the cosmos. Silvera's team created its sample by subjecting hydrogen to extremely low temperatures and high pressures. The sample—one-fifth the diameter of a single human hair—was stored at -316 degrees Fahrenheit between two diamonds exerting 4 million times the pressure of Earth's atmosphere at sea level, Science Alert reports. On Feb. 11, researchers were preparing to ship the sample to Chicago for further tests—they hadn't even confirmed if hydrogen was present or if the sample was a solid (hence all the skepticism)—when the diamonds broke. Researchers say the sample either turned back into a gas or is lying around somewhere too small to see. Silvera's team is hoping to recreate metallic hydrogen in the coming months and is encouraging its skeptics to try to do the same. (Scientists haven't solved the Tully monster mystery after all.)

When I was a patrolman working the 11PM to 7AM shift we received a phone call from a police department about 200 miles away in a neighboring state. It seems that department was holding one of our elderly residents who suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. Earlier in the day this gentlemen got the keys to his wife’s car and went for a ride. He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife. I just got back into town about an hour ago, so I changed into my uniform, and I’m here for my shift! I learned later that this patrolman had taken it upon himself to contact the man’s wife and the only vehicle they owned was out of gas 200 miles away. So this officer stayed up all day after a working the midnight shift and used his own car for the 400 mile trip. The officer said when he picked the man up at the station; he looked at the officer and smiled. He recognized his neighbor. This frail elderly man surely did not remember this selfless act of kindness. But it made a lasting impression on me, and on what it means to be a good cop.

Options: (a). negative (b). positive","output":"Based on the given information from the movie review, which mentions a \\"certain charm\\", it seems that the movie was seen positively. In the context of a movie review, charm typically refers to an attractive or pleasing quality that a film possesses. The term is generally used to highlight the enjoyable aspects of the film such as its charm, warmth, or likability. Thus, the answer to the question of whether the movie was seen positively or negatively would be: (b). positive The use of the phrase \\"certain charm\\" implies that there are elements of the film that the reviewer found appealing and pleasurable. It suggests that the movie was engaging and enjoyable, which are qualities generally associated with positive reviews. While the film's charm may not necessarily win over every viewer, the term indicates that there is a level of appeal that some viewers might appreciate and connect with on a personal level. It is essential to bear in mind that movie reviews are subjective opinions of the reviewer. What one person might find charming, others may not. However, given the context and the wording of the sentence, it can be safely concluded that the movie reviewer perceived the film positively, although we cannot determine the extent of the reviewer's appreciation for the movie based solely on this one phrase.

A defense for Thanksgiving “I think we have a sort of Norman Rockwell view of Thanksgiving,” said Kit Yarrow, head of the psychology department at Golden Gate University in San Francisco. “It’s not really linked to reality for most Americans.” Thanksgiving has long been in danger of getting subsumed by Christmas. Every year, Americans bemoan the encroachment of pine trees and presents on pilgrims and pumpkin pie, a phenomenon the retail industry calls “Christmas creep.” But for many, a line seems to have been crossed. “RESPECT THE BIRD!!!” Doug Matthews, 49, an avid amateur chef from New Jersey, proclaimed in a blog post. Matthews said he penned the diatribe last year when he spied Christmas candy on the shelf at a grocery store before the Halloween treats had been discounted. He took his rant to the social cooking site Allrecipes.com, where he had been posting recipes for corn muffins, carrot salad and other dishes for nearly 15 years. The response, he said, blew him away. It spawned a Respect the Bird campaign on Facebook, and more than 2,500 have pledged this year “to not let Black Friday shopping gobble up my Thanksgiving.” Matthews said even his 6-year-old son is on board, leaning out of the family’s car window to yell “Respect the Bird!” at homes that already have their Christmas lights up. “It was a little like Thanksgiving was getting occupied by Christmas,” Matthews said. “I didn’t want it getting overlooked.” Angie Seaman, 42, of Hagerstown, Md., took the pledge last month. She said the campaign resonated with her because she had to work on Thanksgiving five years in a row as a manager at a craft store. This year, she plans to cook a turkey dinner, complete with stuffing and potatoes, at her home with friends. “Every single year that I worked, people would come in and shop, and everyone would say, ‘I can’t believe you’re open on Thanksgiving,’ ” she said. “Well, we wouldn’t be open on Thanksgiving if you didn’t shop.” Resisting the lure of Christmas bargains may be harder this year as such retailers as Wal-Mart, Toys R Us and Kohl’s open for business on Thanksgiving for the first time. Other stores, such as Macy’s, Best Buy and Target, plan to kick off the season at midnight. For customers lining up early for deals, Best Buy is planning an outdoor screening of the latest Harry Potter movie at 9 p.m. Thursday at about 120 stores nationwide, including those in Laurel and Fairfax. But some retailers are playing defense. Photos of a sign that Nordstrom posts annually explaining why the upscale department store has yet to unveil its holiday decor went viral this year. “We just like the idea of celebrating one holiday at a time,” it reads. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses the increasing encroachment of Christmas celebrations and shopping on the Thanksgiving holiday, a phenomenon known as \\"Christmas creep.\\" Many Americans feel that Thanksgiving is being overshadowed and call for respecting the holiday.

Current customers will be offered a complimentary one month extension of their existing Technical Support contract, and customers who do not currently have a Technical Support contract will be offered a one month trial of RIM's BlackBerry Technical Support Services - Enhanced Support, free of charge. Additional details about the program and information about how to register will be available at www.blackberry.com/enterpriseoffer.            \\"We are grateful to our loyal BlackBerry customers for their patience,\\" added Lazaridis. \\"We have apologized to our customers and we will work tirelessly to restore their confidence.

RIM declined to say if it would need to amend its earnings forecasts to account for the cost of its promise to give 100 of free apps to every BlackBerry smartphone user.      RIM is also offering a period of free technical support to businesses that use the gadget, which has steadily lost market share to Apple's sleeker, sexier iPhone. RIM's stock has dropped 60 percent over the past year.      \\"RIM has responded swiftly but this won't undo the damage done to its reputation,\\" analyst Geoff Blaber at CCS Insight told Reuters earlier on Monday. \\"This may go some way to appeasing customers but what's critical is that the problem does not repeat itself.\\"      Highlighting the challenges, Apple said it sold 4 million of its new iPhone 4S in the three days after its launch last week.      Tens of millions of BlackBerry users were left without mobile email and other messaging for up to four days last week after a failure at a RIM data center in England triggered a service disruption across five continents.      DEVELOPERS CONFERENCE      RIM may reveal more about its strategy for countering the competitive challenge at a conference for application developers in San Francisco that begins Tuesday.      RIM executives there are expected to unveil a major software upgrade for the PlayBook tablet computer. RIM may also provide a glimpse at next-generation smartphones using its QNX software, which already powers the PlayBook.      Long before last week's disruption, investor dissatisfaction with the management of co-chief executives Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie had led a wave of speculation about the future of the company.      Activist investor Carl Icahn squelched one of those rumors on Monday when he told broadcaster CNBC that RIM is not on his radar screen. Last month RIM's shares rose on speculation Icahn would buy into RIM and agitate for change.      Even so, a smaller activist firm, Jaguar Financial Corp, has said it is gathering the support of large RIM shareholders to push the board to look at strategic options, including a sale or split-up of RIM.      \\"DEEPLY GRATEFUL\\"      Last week's outage intensified criticism of the chief executives, who were accused of responding slowly to the crisis and communicating poorly.      On Monday Balsillie told Reuters the company wanted to make amends with customers.      \\"This is our way of expressing appreciation for their patience during the recent service disruptions and a tangible way of telling them how deeply grateful we are for their continued business,\\" he said in a phone interview.      Balsillie declined to estimate how much the offer would cost RIM and said he was unable to say whether RIM might have to revise its earnings forecast for the current quarter, which ends in late November.      The financial impact could prove sizable if a sizable number of RIM's more than 70 million subscribers take up the offers.      Analysts have said compensation costs could reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars. If RIM were to pay back all carriers and customers for lost service it could knock between 3 and 5 cents off earnings per share in the quarter, according to BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long. That would reduce profit by 15 million to 26 million.      \\"CLEVER MOVE\\"      Even so, Richard Levick, who runs a U.S. consultancy that specializes in crisis management, praised the free-app offer but said RIM should have made the announcement last week.      \\"I think it's a good start, but they are always late,\\" he said. \\"They are always behind the curve.\\"      Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst at IDC, said the offer was a clever move by RIM because it would help customers to discover the app service. He said the company was likely to have struck a deal with app developers to keep the cost down.      \\"For RIM, this is an interesting way to attract users to the App World and incentivize them to search and download apps,\\" he said.      The free apps on offer include games such as Bejeweled, and premium versions of a translation service and the music discovery tool Shazam. Users can download them from BlackBerry App World beginning Wednesday, with more to be added in the next four weeks. The offer runs until the end of the year.      \\"More important than the offer itself, is that RIM is showing goodwill and being humble,\\" Jeronimo said. \\"They recognized the problem, apologized and now they are compensating their users.\\"      By early afternoon the stock dropped about 6 percent at 22.54 on the Nasdaq.      (Reporting by Alastair Sharp, Pav Jordan, Kate Holton and Tarmo Virki; Editing by Frank McGurty) ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"So, here's what happened.

Is the premise \\"A foreign country street where people are walking and sitting at tables eating taking in the sites.\\" true if \\"People are eating outside in the city.\\"?","output":"Yes, the premise \\"A foreign country street where people are walking and sitting at tables eating taking in the sites\\" can be considered true if \\"People are eating outside in the city.\\" The provided information describes an outdoor setting in an urban environment where people are engaging in activities such as walking, sitting, eating, and enjoying the atmosphere. Let's break down the two pieces of information and see how they connect: 1. \\"A foreign country street where people are walking and sitting at tables eating taking in the sites.\\"        This premise represents a picturesque scene set in a foreign country, which could be any city outside of one's own. It describes a bustling urban setting where the street is full of life and activity. People are seen walking around, presumably chatting, exploring, or on their way to various destinations. Meanwhile, others are found seated at tables, eating and conversing as they savor the atmosphere and observe the surrounding sites.    This imagery suggests an open, approachable ambiance characterized by outdoor dining, pedestrian movement, and people taking pleasure in the city sights. The presence of outdoor tables for eating implies that there may be restaurants, cafes, or street food vendors in the area, hence contributing to the lively energy of the place. 2. \\"People are eating outside in the city.\\"    This statement confirms the notion of outdoor dining within an urban setting. It provides additional information that reinforces the scene painted in the initial premise. The phrase \\"outside in the city\\" implies that this dining experience is happening in public or shared spaces, which may include streets, sidewalks, plazas, or parks. By analyzing both pieces of information, we can deduce that the premise is true. The street in a foreign city with people walking around and sitting at tables eating while enjoying the sites aligns well with the notion of people eating outside in the city. Both descriptions depict individuals engaging in outdoor dining amidst an urban environment, highlighting the various activities taking place and contributing to the overall atmosphere. To summarize, it is valid to consider the premise as true, given the presentation of people eating outside in the city, as it aligns with and complements the description of a bustling foreign street painted in the first statement. The urban setting, combined with the outdoor dining factor, creates a lively and quintessential scene that showcases the social interaction and appreciation of the surroundings found within such environments."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a sentence in the English and Hindi language.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Process: - A satellite&#x27;s need is determined - A group of people work to design a satellite capable of accomplishing the need - A team designs the physical structure of the satellite - A crew builds the physical satellite - The satellite is packed into a capsule - The satellite capsule is loaded onto a rocket - The rocket is launched into space.  Question: suppose a space race starts with another country happens, how will it affect fewer satellites are made.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"In the event of a space race with another country, it can have varying effects on the number of satellites produced and the overall process of satellite creation. To understand whether the impact is more, less or has no effect, it's important to analyze different factors that come into play during such a competitive scenario. 1. Demand for Satellites: During a space race, the demand for satellites is likely to increase as countries compete to achieve various goals related to space exploration, surveillance, and communication. This heightened demand can lead to an increase in the number of satellites produced, as countries strive to outperform each other and demonstrate their prowess in space technology. In this context, the production of satellites is expected to have more effect. 2. Allocation of Resources: A space race may result in higher allocation of resources towards space technology and satellite development. Government funding, research, and skilled personnel are usually directed towards the competitive objectives of the space race. This can lead to an increase in the capacity for satellite production, and create a more effect on the number of satellites made. 3. Technological Advancements: The high levels of competition often drive innovation and technological advancement. In a space race context, breakthroughs in satellite technology may allow the production of better and more efficient satellites. This could possibly lead to fewer satellites being required for specific tasks, as they are capable of fulfilling multiple functions. In this case, the effect on satellite production could be less. 4. Focus on Specific Objectives: A space race often pushes countries towards very specific and time-sensitive objectives, such as putting a human on a celestial body or creating a satellite network for global communication. These focused objectives might lead to the production of specialized satellites for specific missions, which could either increase or decrease the number of satellites made. The effect on satellite production can vary in this scenario, either leading to more, less, or no effect depending on the specific objectives. 5. Economic factors: A space race also has economic implications. Countries competing in space can impact the expenditure and investment decisions; the focus might shift from quantity to quality. Countries might invest more in advanced technology and improve the efficiency of existing satellites, which may lead to fewer satellites being produced with improved capabilities. In this case, the effect on satellite production would be less. In conclusion, the influence of a space race on the number of satellites produced can vary depending on factors such as demand, resource allocation, technological advancements, focus on specific objectives, and economic factors. It is not necessarily a straightforward answer of more, less, or no effect. Instead, considering the complexity of a space race and its various implications, the production of satellites can be influenced differently according to the particular conditions and objectives tied to the competition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the album whose sound Nirvana denied there being any pressure from its label to change?  Soon afterward, in April 1993, Albini remarked to the Chicago Tribune that he doubted Geffen would release the completed album.  Albini commented years later that in a sense he felt he spoke about the situation \\"from a position of ignorance, because I wasn't there when the band was having their discussions with the record label.  All I know is ... we made a record, everybody was happy with it.  A few weeks later I hear that it's unreleasable and it's all got to be redone\\".  While Albini's remarks in the article drew no immediate reply from the group or its label, Newsweek ran a similar article soon afterwards that did.  Nirvana denied there was any pressure from its label to change the album's sound, sending a letter to Newsweek that said that the article's author \\"ridiculed our relationship with our label based on totally erronous  [sic] information\\"; the band also reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in Billboard.  Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder David Geffen made the unusual move of personally calling Newsweek to complain about the article.Nirvana wanted to do further work on the recorded tracks, and considered working with producer Scott Litt and remixing some tracks with Andy Wallace (who had mixed Nevermind).  Albini vehemently disagreed, and claimed he had an agreement with the band that it would not modify the tracks without his involvement.  Albini initially refused to give the album master tapes to Gold Mountain, but relented after a phone call from Novoselic.  The band decided against working with Wallace and chose to remix and augment the songs \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" and \\"All Apologies\\" with Litt at Seattle's Bad Animals Studio in May 1993.  Furthermore, a remix of \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" by Scott Litt (at Bad Animals on November 22, 1993) appears on the censored Wal-Mart and Kmart versions of In Utero; this remix is also available on the band's 2002 best-of compilation, Nirvana, and is the same mix that appeared on the single....

Tinder was created with the hit and quit it hookup in mind and trust me no matter what he puts in his profile, that’s what he’s looking for. Crap, that’s what I was looking for let’s be honest. Here are some universal truths about Tinder and most online dating sites. If the picture looks too good to be true, it probably is. People lie. A large majority are going to be married pretending to be single. They have a handful of others on the hook while they’re talking to you.

Please write a short summary for the following article: The Most Expensive Weapon Ever Built By MARK THOMPSON Monday, Feb. 25, 2013 Marine Major Aric \\"Walleye\\" Liberman was uncharacteristically modest for a Navy SEAL turned fighter pilot. He had just landed an F-35--one of the 2,457 jets the Pentagon plans to buy for 400 billion, making it the costliest weapons program in human history--at its initial operational base late last year. Amid celebratory hoopla, he declined photographers' requests to give a thumbs-up for the cameras that sunny day in Yuma, Ariz. \\"No, no, no,\\" he demurred with a smile. Liberman's reticence was understandable. For while the Marines hailed his arrival as a sign that their initial F-35 squadron is now operational, there's one sticking point. \\"It's an operational squadron,\\" a Marine spokesman said. \\"The aircraft is not operational.\\" The F-35, designed as the U.S. military's lethal hunter for 21st century skies, has become the hunted, a poster child for Pentagon profligacy in a new era of tightening budgets. Instead of the stars and stripes of the U.S. Air Force emblazoned on its fuselage, it might as well have a bull's-eye. Its pilots' helmets are plagued with problems, it hasn't yet dropped or fired weapons, and the software it requires to go to war remains on the drawing board. That's why when Liberman landed his F-35 before an appreciative crowd, including home-state Senator John McCain, he didn't demonstrate its most amazing capability: landing like a helicopter using its precision-cast titanium thrust-vectoring nozzle. That trick remains reserved for test pilots, not operational plane drivers like him. (PHOTOS: Top 10 Most Expensive Military Planes) The price tag, meanwhile, has nearly doubled since 2001, to 396 billion. Production delays have forced the Air Force and Navy to spend at least 5 billion to extend the lives of existing planes. The Marine Corps--the cheapest service, save for its love of costly jump jets (which take off and land almost vertically) for its pet aircraft carriers--have spent 180 million on 74 used British AV-8 jets for spare parts to keep their Reagan-era Harriers flying until their version of the F-35 truly comes online. Allied governments are increasingly weighing alternatives to the F-35. But the accounting is about to get even worse as concern over spending on the F-35 threatens other defense programs. On March 1, if lawmakers cannot reach a new budget deal, the Pentagon faces more than 500 billion in spending cuts in the form of sequestration, which translates into a 10% cut in projected budgets over the coming decade. Two years ago, the White House predicted that those cuts would be so onerous to defense-hawk Republicans that they would never happen. But the GOP is now split, with a growing number of members who are more concerned about the deficit than defense. \\"We are spending maybe 45% of the world's budget on defense. If we drop to 42% or 43%, would we be suddenly in danger of some kind of invasion?\\" asked Representative Justin Amash, a Michigan Republican and part of a new breed of deficit hawks who talk of spending as a bigger threat than war. \\"We're bankrupting our country, and it's going to put us in danger.\\" MORE: How the F-35 Nearly Doubled In Price (And Why You Didnât Know)","output":"The F-35 is a special kind of plane that the United States military wants to use in the future.

Select from the following. I. go to sleep; II. watch the game; III. go home; Answer:","output":"Given the context, it can be assumed that Ash and Alex are involved in some form of a sports activity, and they are teammates or friends who are playing a game on a field. Since Ash has broken her leg and Alex has taken her position on the field to cover for her, Ash is most likely to be concerned about her well-being and the ongoing game, in which her teammate or friend has stepped in to continue participating. Among the three options provided, let's analyze what Ash would want to do next: I. Go to sleep: While Ash might be feeling some level of pain and discomfort from the broken leg, it seems unlikely that she would prioritize sleep in this situation. Instead, she is likely to seek medical attention and ensure her injury is properly taken care of. Additionally, Ash would be worried about the game and how her teammates are performing. II. Watch the game: It is quite plausible that Ash would want to watch the game, given her involvement and emotional investment in the outcome of the game. She might be feeling a mix of disappointment and concern about not being able to participate due to her injury. Supporting her team from the sidelines and cheering for her teammates, especially Alex who took up her position, can be a reasonable next step for Ash. III. Go home: Although Ash may have concerns for her health, leaving the game venue to go home may not be the first thing on her mind. At least not before seeking medical help or watching the progress of the game. While eventually going home is a possibility, it is essential to consider the immediate needs and priorities of Ash. In conclusion, given the context of the situation and taking into consideration the emotional and physical well-being of Ash, it can be deduced that Ash would most likely want to watch the game (Option II) as her next step. By watching the game, she can stay engaged with the progress of her team, cheer them on, and support her friend Alex, who stepped in to replace her, all while she waits to address her leg injury."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the below context:  The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving nude by Velázquez, but three others by the artist are recorded in 17th-century Spanish inventories. Two were mentioned in the Royal collection, but may have been lost in the 1734 fire that destroyed the main Royal Palace of Madrid. A further one was recorded in the collection of Domingo Guerra Coronel. These records mention \\"a reclining Venus\\", Venus and Adonis, and a Psyche and Cupid.Although the work is widely thought to have been painted from life, the identity of the model is subject to much speculation. In contemporary Spain it was acceptable for artists to employ male nude models for studies; however, the use of female nude models was frowned upon. The painting is believed to have been executed during one of Velázquez's visits to Rome, and Prater has observed that in Rome the artist \\"did indeed lead a life of considerable personal liberty that would have been consistent with the notion of using a live nude female model\\". It has been claimed that the painting depicts a mistress Velázquez is known to have had while in Italy, who is supposed to have borne his child. Others have claimed that the model is the same as in Coronation of the Virgin and Las Hilanderas, both in the Museo del Prado, and other works.The figures of both Venus and Cupid were significantly altered during the painting process, the result of the artist's corrections to the contours as initially painted. Pentimenti can be seen in Venus's upraised arm, in the position of her left shoulder, and on her head. Infra-red reveals that she was originally shown more upright with her head turned to the left. An area on the left of the painting, extending from Venus's left foot to the left leg and foot of Cupid, is apparently unfinished, but this feature is seen in many other works by Velázquez and was probably deliberate. The painting was given a major cleaning and restoration in 1965–66, which showed it to be in good condition, and with very little paint added later by other artists, contrary to what some...

Translate this to English?","output":"The sentence in Romanian states, \\"S-a înrădăcinat o diviziune internațională a muncii.\\" In English, this can be translated as, \\"An international division of labor has taken root.\\" This statement is addressing the concept of an international division of labor. The international division of labor refers to the way labor is distributed and arranged globally, often leading to certain countries or regions specializing in specific industries or types of production. This arrangement has evolved over time due to factors such as globalization, shifts in political power, advances in technology, and changes in economic systems. The division of labor, in general, refers to the allocation of different tasks or jobs to various individuals or groups of people, with the goal of increasing efficiency and productivity. By allowing each person to specialize in a particular job, overall productivity can be improved, as individuals are more likely to be skilled and efficient in their specific area of expertise. In the context of the international division of labor, this specialization has expanded beyond national borders, with countries becoming more interconnected and interdependent on one another. This has led to the rise of global supply chains, where the production of goods and services is distributed across multiple countries. This allows countries to take advantage of comparative advantages, which refers to the ability of a country to produce a certain good or service more efficiently than other countries. However, the international division of labor has also raised concerns and criticisms. For instance, it has led to unequal economic development, with some countries benefiting more from globalization than others. Additionally, the international division of labor has been linked to labor exploitation, as multinational corporations have sometimes been known to move their production to countries with lower labor costs and lax labor regulations. Overall, the international division of labor has become a fundamental aspect of the global economy, with numerous implications for international relations, economic development, and social justice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A family has called the police claiming their six-year-old daughter had five of her teeth removed when she went into hospital for surgery on her legs. Sarah Morrison suffers from a rare type of brittle bone disease which has seen her suffer from over 200 broken bones since she was born. She was admitted to Sheffield Children’s Hospital for surgery to have metal rods inserted to make her limbs stronger, but her furious parents say they were ‘horrified’ to learn five of her teeth had also been taken out. Sarah Morrison, six, who has brittle bone disease, was admitted to Sheffield Children's Hospital to have rods inserted into her legs to make them stronger. Her parents claim doctors also removed five of her teeth. Sheffield Children’s Hospital says the teeth were loose baby teeth which needed to be removed as they ‘posed a serious risk to Sarah’s airway’ during surgery, and that her parents spoke to a clinician beforehand about all the care she may need. However, Sarah’s parents, Philip Morrison and Sonia McCrossan, dispute this and the hospital is now carrying out an internal review. Mr Morrison, 37, said: ‘After the surgery I was outside the hospital when my partner rang me in a very erratic state, crying and screaming. ‘At that point I thought Sarah had died. I ran down to the recovery room where I first got a glimpse of Sarah with a mouth full of blood. I was horrified. ‘They didn’t mention at any point that her teeth might be taken out - it wasn’t even on the operation consent form. ‘The hospital is adamant that baby teeth were taken. But two of them were adult teeth, I know because I have the baby teeth at home. Her parents, Philip Morrison and Sonia McCrossan, claim that two of the teeth that were taken out were adult teeth and say that they have contacted the police about the situation. ‘We feel mortified and let down.’ Sarah was born with osteogenesis imperfect – a congenital brittle bone condition - and suffered 30 rib fractures in the womb. Doctors initially gave her just two days to live but she defied expectations to survive. Mr Morrison, and his partner Sonia McCrossan, moved from Ireland to Sheffield to be closer to bone specialists at the children’s hospital but they’re now planning to move her to another hospital. Mr Morrison said the family were told a dentist would examine Sarah’s teeth, but not that any would be removed. He also said the teeth taken were not loose. Sheffield Children's Hospital (pictured) says that the teeth were milk teeth and that they were removed because they were loose and posed a serious risk to Sarah's airway while she was under anaesthetic. He said: ‘She isn’t going back there again. ‘Sarah has been going mad about the missing teeth. She keeps putting her tongue up there saying “they stole my teeth”. ‘It’s not the fact her teeth were removed. She has a gastro tube and it’s been difficult trying to get her to feed, now this will set us back.’ A spokesman for South Yorkshire Police said they had been ‘made aware of an alleged incident’ at the hospital. Police are to be kept informed during the hospital review but are not investigating. The hospital says that it is carrying out an internal review but that no staff members have been disciplined. A spokesman for Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘The care given to this patient was done in her best interests. ‘She has a complex condition and had come in for a surgical orthopaedic procedure, during which five baby teeth needed to be removed while she was under general anaesthetic. ‘They were very loose and were judged to pose a serious risk to her airway. No harm was caused to her by the removal of these baby teeth. ‘Her parents spoke to a clinician before any surgery was carried out and the care their child may have needed while undergoing surgery was discussed. ‘As an issue has now been raised by her parents, we will review this as we do with any concern. ‘No action has been taken against any members of staff. ‘We understand her parents have raised this as an issue with the police and we will keep them updated as we would with any incident.’ What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

Please answer the following question: This article: Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal.

(Bruce Cotler for New York Daily News)      Blackwell served several years in prison on attempted murder charges for firing into a person’s car in August 2001 during an attempted robbery, officials said. He was eventually released from the Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate Dannemora in June 2008.      In prison, Blackwell was found to have “poor institutional adjustment problems,” said a state Department of Corrections spokeswoman.      At the time of Saturday’s shooting, he was wanted by police on a criminal mischief charge stemming from an incident last November, sources said.      Two people who grew up with Blackwell said he had a rocky relationship with his star athlete cousin.      Kory Blackwell was on the Giants roster from 1997 to 1998 before leaving the NFL in 2001 after brief stints with the Cleveland Browns, Oakland Raiders and Jacksonville Jaguars.      “They’re cousins, but they don’t see eye to eye,” said Marlo Vaughn, 43, a truck driver. “Kory even bought him a music studio. He wanted him to take his music more seriously.”      Police gather at the scene in Queens Village where a plainclothes police officer was shot in the head.

Demetrius Blackwell, who suffers from severe epilepsy, went to Bayside High School and has a 3-year-old daughter, friends said.      The shooting sparked a massive police manhunt. Officers sealed off exits to the Belt Parkway in the hope of containing the shooter, sources said.      Area resident Alexis Davis, 18, said she heard three deafening shots.      “Boom, boom, boom,” recalled Davis who lives around the corner from the shooting.      “It happened so sudden. I was scared. Then there were sirens and police everywhere. The police were saying a cop was shot. “      Moore was wounded on the corner of 212th St. and 104th Road in Queens Village after getting into a confrontation with the assailant, sources said. (Google)      Her neighbor, Abesh Goolsarran, said officers were swarming the neighborhood.      “There’s cops everywhere but I don’t know what’s going on,” said Abesh Goolsarran, 24.      “I see a SWAT team truck with lights on. I see police dogs. They’re all around my house.”      The shooting comes at a time of heightened tensions between police and civilians following a spate of cop-involved deaths of black men across the nation.      The incident marked the fifth NYPD officer shot since last December.      Officers Rafael Ramos, 40, and Wenjian Liu, 32, were executed on Dec. 20 while sitting in their patrol car outside a Brooklyn housing project.      The gunman — Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28 — shot himself in the head on a nearby subway platform as cops closed in on him.      Hours before he carried out the double slaying, the career criminal boasted on social media that he was “putting wings on pigs today” to avenge the police-involved deaths of Eric Garner in Staten Island and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.      On Jan. 5, two plainclothes cops were shot in the Bronx while responding to a grocery store robbery. The officers — Andrew Dossi, 30, and Aliro Pellerano, 38 — were approaching a suspect when his accomplice opened fire.

He was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center in Queens. (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle) (Associated Press)      Officer Brian Moore, 25, underwent surgery after being rushed in a patrol car to a Queens hospital Saturday evening after he and his partner pulled up in an unmarked police car to a man who was adjusting his waistband suspiciously, police Commissioner William Bratton said.      The officers exchanged words with the man before he turned suddenly and fired at least twice, striking Moore, Bratton said. His partner, Officer Erik Jansen, 30, radioed for help.      \\"They did not have an opportunity to get out and return fire,\\" the commissioner said at a Saturday night news conference at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center with Mayor Bill de Blasio and other officials.      Law enforcement flooded the Queens Village neighborhood following the shooting — police helicopters flew overhead, officers searched house by house and some could be seen walking on roofs. About 90 minutes later, police arrested Demetrius Blackwell, 35, near the crime scene in a house on the block where he lives, officials said.      No weapon was found and, as of early Sunday, Blackwell had not been charged. It wasn't clear if he has a lawyer.      After the shooting, witnesses described Blackwell to responding officers and pointed them in the direction he ran, Bratton said.      De Blasio said the shooting was a painful reminder of the risks officers take every day.      \\"Our hearts are with his family, his loved ones,\\" the mayor said. \\"Our hearts are with his extended family, the men and women of the NYPD.\\"      Moore, who comes from a family of police officers, has been on the job since July 2010.      The shooting instantly evoked fears of the December slayings of two uniformed officers as they sat in their patrol cars in Brooklyn by a man who posted online that he was seeking retribution against officers for the death of Eric Garner in an apparent chokehold by police.      The shootings of Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos strained an already tense relationship between city police unions and de Blasio. Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch turned his back on the mayor at a hospital the day of the killings and said de Blasio had \\"blood on his hands.\\"      But Saturday night, Lynch was among the officials who attended the news conference and could be seen shaking the mayor's hand and speaking briefly with him afterward.      Bratton said Blackwell has a criminal record that includes a weapons possession charge, but the suspect made no such anti-police postings and was being pursued by the anti-crime officers because of his behavior.      Neighbors near the scene of the shooting were surprised by the violence and described the residential area with many two- and three-family homes as quiet and safe.      \\"You walk down the street, no trouble,\\" said Sandreaus Adam, 52. \\"This is not a neighborhood where you're just going to hear shots.\\"      ___      Associated Press writers Jake Pearson and Tom Hays contributed to this report. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"A police officer named Brian Moore, who was 25 years old, got hurt when someone shot him in the cheek.

Answer the following question: Information:  - In chemistry, a soap is a salt of a fatty acid. Household uses for soaps include washing, bathing, and other types of housekeeping, where soaps act as surfactants, emulsifying oils to enable them to be carried away by water. In industry they are also used in textile spinning and are important components of some lubricants.  - A sulfonate is a salt or ester of a sulfonic acid. It contains the functional group R-SO.  - A carboxylate is a salt or ester of a carboxylic acid. \\"Carboxylate salts\\" have the general formula M(RCOO), where M is a metal and \\"n\\" is 1, 2...; \\"carboxylate esters\\" have the general formula RCOOR. R and R are organic groups; R  H.  - Surfactants are compounds that lower the surface tension (or interfacial tension) between two liquids or between a liquid and a solid. Surfactants may act as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents, and dispersants.  - Wetting is the ability of a liquid to maintain contact with a solid surface, resulting from intermolecular interactions when the two are brought together. The degree of wetting (wettability) is determined by a force balance between adhesive and cohesive forces. Wetting deals with the three phases of materials: gas, liquid, and solid. It is now a center of attention in nanotechnology and nanoscience studies due to the advent of many nanomaterials in the past two decades (e.g. graphene, carbon nanotube).  - Hard water is water that has high mineral content (in contrast with \\"soft water\\"). Hard water is formed when water percolates through deposits of limestone and chalk which are largely made up of calcium and magnesium carbonates.  - A detergent is a surfactant or a mixture of surfactants with \\"cleaning properties in dilute solutions.\\" These substances are usually alkylbenzenesulfonates, a family of compounds that are similar to soap but are more soluble in hard water, because the polar sulfonate (of detergents) is less likely than the polar carboxylate (of soap) to bind to calcium and other ions found in hard water.  - Linear alkylbenzene is a family of organic compounds with the formula C6H5CnH2n +1 . Typically , n lies between 10 and 16 , although generally supplied as a tighter cut , such as C12 - C15 , C12 - C13 and C10 - C13 , for detergent use . The CnH2n +1 chain is unbranched . They are sometimes called LABs . They are mainly produced as intermediate in the production of surfactants , for use in detergent . Since the 1960s , LABs have emerged as the dominant precursor of biodegradable detergents .    What is the relationship between 'linear alkylbenzene' and 'carbon'? Answer:","output":"The relationship between 'linear alkylbenzene' and 'carbon' lies in the chemical structure and composition of linear alkylbenzene (LAB) molecules. Linear alkylbenzene is an organic compound, which means it is primarily composed of carbon, hydrogen, and sometimes other elements like oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen. In the case of LABs, they consist of carbon and hydrogen atoms exclusively. The general formula for linear alkylbenzene is C6H5CnH2n+1, where 'C' represents carbon and 'n' is an integer representing the length of the alkyl chain. This formula demonstrates that LAB molecules are built from carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms in a specific arrangement. The structure of a linear alkylbenzene molecule can be divided into two main parts:  1. An aromatic benzene ring (C6H5):    The benzene ring is a hexagonal arrangement of six carbon atoms, with each carbon bonded to a hydrogen atom. This ring has alternating single and double bonds between the carbon atoms, giving it unique properties and making it an essential part of the LAB molecule. 2. A linear alkyl chain (CnH2n+1):    The alkyl chain represents the unbranched hydrocarbon chain attached to the benzene ring. This chain is composed of carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms and other carbon atoms in a linear, unbranched manner. The length of the alkyl chain (n) can vary, typically between 10 and 16 carbon atoms. The specific range of chain lengths, such as C12-C15, C12-C13, or C10-C13, can determine the particular properties and applications of the LAB. In summary, the relationship between linear alkylbenzene and carbon lies in the fact that carbon atoms are essential components of the LAB molecule, forming both the aromatic benzene ring and the linear alkyl chain. The arrangement and length of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain give LABs their unique properties, which make them important precursors for biodegradable detergents and other surfactants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. From the beginning the question of the country's official language was an issue of great protest. Say this using Spanish.","output":"Desde el comienzo, la cuestión del idioma oficial del país fue un tema de gran protesta. Hay varias razones detrás de esto, que incluyen la diversidad linguistica, sentimientos nacionalistas y políticas gubernamentales. Cabe mencionar que en un país con múltiples idiomas y culturas, establecer un idioma oficial puede ser un tema muy controvertido. Primeramente, en un país compuesto por diferentes grupos étnicos y regiones, la diversidad de dialectos y lenguas puede ser bastante amplia. En este contexto, elegir un solo idioma como oficial puede generar rechazo y descontento entre aquellos cuya lengua materna no sea la seleccionada. Puede percibirse como un intento de imponer una cultura dominante sobre las demás y esto podría causar tensiones culturales y políticas. En segundo lugar, los sentimientos nacionalistas también pueden influir en la cuestión del idioma oficial. En algunos casos, un grupo étnico o regional puede sentir un fuerte vínculo con su propia lengua y cultura y verse reacio a aceptar un idioma oficial impuesto por la mayoría o por el gobierno central. Esta resistencia puede manifestarse a través de protestas, manifestaciones y movimientos en defensa de la lengua y la cultura local. Por otra parte, las políticas gubernamentales también pueden ser un factor importante en el debate sobre el idioma oficial. Un gobierno puede optar por seleccionar un idioma oficial con el fin de promover la unidad nacional, facilitar la comunicación entre sus ciudadanos y fomentar la integración social y económica. Sin embargo, si estas políticas se implementan de manera forzada o sin un enfoque inclusivo, podrían tener efectos negativos y generar más conflictos en lugar de resolverlos. En conclusión, la cuestión del idioma oficial en un país con múltiples lenguas y culturas siempre será un tema delicado y cargado de emociones. Es esencial abordarlo con sensibilidad y enfoque equilibrado, teniendo en cuenta los deseos y necesidades de todas las comunidades involucradas. La clave es promover un diálogo inclusivo y respetuoso, que permita alcanzar un consenso y garantizar la preservación y promoción de todas las lenguas y culturas del país."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Explanation: When water is heated, the heat energy is transferred to the water molecules, causing them to move faster. As the molecules move faster, they gain kinetic energy and begin to move farther apart from one another. This process continues until the water reaches its boiling point. At this point, the water molecules have gained enough energy to break the hydrogen bonds between them, allowing the molecules to transition from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase (steam). This is why we observe water boiling and turning into steam as it absorbs heat; the water molecules are moving faster and farther apart."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"A woman holds a lit lamp.\\", does this mean that \\"A man is holding a book.\\"?","output":"No, the statement \\"A woman holds a lit lamp\\" does not imply or mean that \\"A man is holding a book.\\" These are two separate statements describing two completely different situations, and there is no inherent connection between the two. Let's break down these statements individually to understand why: 1. \\"A woman holds a lit lamp.\\" This statement tells us that there is a woman holding a lamp that is currently lit. It provides information about the person's gender (woman), their action (holding), and the object involved (a lit lamp). There are no inferences we can draw about anyone else or any other objects from this statement alone. 2. \\"A man is holding a book.\\" This statement, on the other hand, tells us that there is a male individual who is also holding an item – in this case, a book. Like the first statement, it provides information about the person's gender (man), their action (holding), and the object involved (a book). However, there is no information in this statement to suggest a connection to or relationship with the woman holding the lit lamp. One possibility to infer a connection between these two objects might be if we have additional information or context to suggest that both the woman holding the lit lamp and the man holding the book are in the same environment or engaging in the same activity. For example, if we were given information about a scene in which people are holding different objects, and both the woman and the man are part of that scene, then we could explore the potential interactions or connections between the two based on their respective actions and the objects they are holding. However, as the statements stand on their own, we cannot assume that the man holding the book has anything to do with the woman holding the lit lamp. The only direct assumption we can make between the two is that both are individuals (one female, one male) who are each holding an object. To conclude, the statement \\"A woman holds a lit lamp.\\" does not imply or mean that \\"A man is holding a book.\\" These are two separate statements describing two distinct situations, and to infer a connection between them would require further context or information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the premise \\"Two men kneel on a green and red mat next to each other while various objects hang on racks on a white wall behind them.\\" true if \\"Some people kneeling\\"?","output":"To determine if the premise is true, let's break it down step-by-step. 1. Identify the subject: \\"Two men\\" This tells us that the subject consists of two men, which are a subset of \\"people\\". 2. Identify the action: \\"kneel on a green and red mat next to each other\\" This action expresses that both men are kneeling on a mat and are in close proximity to one another. 3. Identify the additional context: \\"various objects hang on racks on a white wall behind them.\\" This provides more information about the setting, including objects hanging on a wall behind the two men. Now, let's assess the given statement \\"Some people kneeling\\": - \\"Some people\\" do not necessarily have to be \\"two men\\", as the phrase \\"some people\\" is more broad and can refer to any number of individuals. However, if there are \\"two men\\", they are also included within \\"some people\\". - \\"Kneeling\\" aligns with the action in the premise, stating that the two men are indeed kneeling. Based on the analysis, we can conclude that the premise is true if \\"Some people kneeling\\". This is because \\"two men\\" fall within the category of \\"some people,\\" and the fact that they are kneeling is consistent with the action described in the premise."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Help as much as you can. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: In the 18th century, New York was smaller than Philadelphia and Boston. Today it is the largest city in America. How can the change in its size and importance be explained? To answer this question we must consider certain facts about geography, history, and economics. Together these three will explain the huge growth of America's most famous city. The map of the Northeast shows that the four areas with the largest populations in this region are around seaports. At these points materials from across the sea enter the United States, and the products of the land are sent there for export across the sea. We know that places where transportation lines meet are good places for making raw materials into finished goods. That is why seaports often have cities nearby. But cities like New York needed more than their geographical location in order to become great industrial centers. Their development did not happen simply by chance.www.zxxk.com About 1815, when many Americans from the east had already moved toward the west, transportation routes from the seaports to the central regions of the country began to be a serious problem. The slow wagons of that time, usually drawn by horses, were too expensive for moving heavy freight   very far. In New York State a canal seemed the best answer to the transportation problem. From the eastern end of Lake Erie all the way across the state to the Hudson River there is a long strip of low land. Here the Erie Canal was built, and after several years of work it was completed in 1825. The canal produced an immediate effect. Freight costs were cut to about one tenth of what they had been. New York City, which had been smaller than Philadelphia and Boston, quickly became the leading city of the coast. In the years that followed, transportation routes on the Great Lakes were joined to routes on the Mississippi River. Then New York City became the end point of a great inland shipping system that started from the Atlantic Ocean far up the western branches of the Mississippi.

Answer the following question: What may be the reason for them not backing it up ?","output":"There could be several reasons for someone not backing up their device, even after considering its importance and necessity. Some of these reasons might include: 1. Time constraints: The person might be extremely busy and caught up with various other tasks. Due to this, they may not find the required time to dedicate to the process of backing up their device. Backups can take a significant amount of time, especially if it's done infrequently or for the first time, since there will be a large amount of data to transfer. 2. Lack of knowledge or technical expertise: Some people may not be familiar with the process of backing up their devices and might not understand how to perform the task. They could feel overwhelmed by the complexity of the backup process and might choose to avoid it altogether due to a lack of confidence in their technical abilities. 3. Procrastination: Human nature often leads us to postpone seemingly non-urgent tasks, in favor of more pressing or enjoyable activities. The person in question might have recognized the importance of backing up their device, but repeatedly put it off for another day, possibly due to distractions or other priorities. 4. Underestimating the risks: Some people might not fully comprehend the risks associated with not backing up their devices, such as data loss, theft, or hardware failures. Consequently, they may not prioritize the backup process, considering it to be an optional task rather than a necessary precaution. 5. Complacency: In some cases, people might have never experienced data loss or any related issues in the past and, as a result, develop a sense of complacency. They might falsely believe that they will never face such issues, making them less likely to prioritize backup tasks. 6. Limited resources: Backing up devices often requires additional storage media, such as external hard drives, cloud storage subscriptions, or other USB devices. Some individuals might not have the necessary resources readily available or could be unwilling to invest in acquiring those resources. This may act as a barrier to performing regular backups. 7. Trust in the device's durability: The person might have a high level of trust in their device's durability and reliability, leading them to believe that it is highly unlikely that the device would fail or lose its charge. This unwarranted trust could result in them neglecting the importance of backups as a safeguard against potential data loss. These are just a few of the possible reasons someone might not back up their device, even after recognizing the potential consequences of not doing so. To prevent data loss, it is crucial to prioritize data backup tasks and to educate oneself on proper backup procedures and the importance of maintaining regular backups."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a title for this article: The decision, which came after years of resistance and wrenching internal debate, was widely seen as a milestone for the Boy Scouts, a symbol of traditional America. More than 1,400 volunteer leaders from across the country voted, with more than 60 percent approving a measure that said no youth may be denied membership “on the basis of sexual orientation or preference alone.” The top national leaders of the Boy Scouts, who pledge fealty to God and country, had urged the change in the face of vehement opposition from conservative parents and volunteers, some of whom said they would quit the organization. But the vote put the Scouts more in line with the swift rise in public acceptance of homosexuality, especially among younger parents who are essential to the future of an institution that has been losing members for decades. The policy change, effective January 2014, is unlikely to bring peace to the Boy Scouts as they struggle to keep a foothold in a swirling cultural landscape, with renewed lobbying and debate already starting Thursday evening. The Scouts did not consider the even more divisive question of whether to allow openly gay adults and leaders. This drew criticism from advocates for gay rights, who called the decision a breakthrough but vowed to continue pressing the Scouts to allow gay members of all ages. Some conservative churches and parents said the Scouts were violating their oath to be “morally straight” and said they would drop out. Still, for gay men who were forced out of scouting and for their allies, thousands of whom joined the push for change, the opening of membership was more than welcome. “I’ve waited 13 years for this,” said Matt Comer, now 27, who had to leave his scout troop at 14 after he started a Gay-Straight Alliance at his school. Since the fourth grade, he said Thursday, he had dreamed of becoming an Eagle Scout and was crushed when he was denied the chance. “Today we finally have some justice for me and others,” he said. “But gay youths will still be told they are no longer welcome when they turn 18.” Leaders of the conservative faction predicted that lawsuits would soon force the Boy Scouts to allow openly gay leaders, and they accused the top leaders of ignoring the beliefs of their members. “The fallout from this is going to be tremendous,” said Robert Schwarzwalder, a senior vice president of the Family Research Council, a conservative Christian group, and a father of two scouts in Northern Virginia. “I think there will be a loss of hundreds of thousands of boys and parents.” “This great institution is going to be vitiated by the intrusion of a political agenda,” he said. After the decision was announced Thursday, John Stemberger, an evangelical leader from Florida who organized a campaign to block the change, said that like-minded groups and parents would meet next month in Louisville, Ky., to discuss creating what he called a new “character development organization for boys,” an alternative to scouting. Glaad, a gay-rights group that has campaigned for change over the last year, said it would keep pressure on the Boy Scouts over the leadership issue. “We’ll continue urging corporate donors and public officials to withhold their support,” said Richard Ferraro, the group’s vice president for communications. Several sponsors, including the UPS Foundation, Merck, the Intel Foundation, and many local United Ways and city agencies had already ended financing for the Scouts because the group’s policies violated their own nondiscrimination guidelines. In a closed meeting of the assembled delegates here Wednesday night, the top three leaders of the Boy Scouts — Wayne Brock, the paid chief executive; Wayne Perry, the volunteer president who is a corporate leader from Washington State; and Tico Perez, the volunteer commissioner and a consultant in Florida — made a strong plea to delegates and dissenting board members to allow gay youths, saying the goal of scouting was to reach as many boys as possible, according to people who attended. “This is not about what’s legal but what’s compassionate, caring and kind,” Mr. Brock reportedly said. No similar proposal to allow gay adults was on the agenda, and the executives have said little about how they made the distinction. But in surveys this spring, many parents and volunteers around the country said they were against the idea of openly gay scout leaders. The vote was a bittersweet one for David Knapp, 86, who spent much of his life in scouting as a boy, as a professional staff member and later as a volunteer with a council in Connecticut. He had tried to keep his sexual orientation a secret but one day in 1993, he said, two scout officials said, “We found out you are a homosexual,” and forced him out. “I see this as a good step, but with a lot of misgivings,” he said of the limited opening to gays. Some of the most conservative parents and leaders are already thinking of what comes next. Allison Mackey of Hanover, Pa., has five sons — one an Eagle Scout, three now active in scouting and an 8-year-old who had planned to join. The family has discussed the issue and reached a decision, she said: All the sons were willing to abandon the Boy Scouts if openly gay members are allowed. “The Boy Scouts are something we’ve really enjoyed because they celebrate manliness and leadership,” she said. But, she added, she and her husband were “looking to encourage our sons in traditional Christian values.” Personally, she said she would be disappointed to see her sons leave the Scouts. “To stand by principles would be difficult,” she said. “But we’re going to have to say no. The organization is giving up freedom.” In a meeting with reporters after the vote, Mr. Perry, the national president of the Boy Scouts, sought to put the rancor behind. “We’re moving forward together,” he said. “Everyone agrees on one thing, no matter how you feel about this issue, kids are better off in scouting.” Robbie Brown contributed reporting from Atlanta; Lauren D’Avolio from Grapevine, Tex.; and Steven Yaccino from Chicago.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Increased solar ultraviolet radiation resulting from the Antarctic ozone hole has reduced marine primary productivity (phytoplankton) by as much as 15% and has started damaging the DNA of some fish. Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, especially the landing of an estimated five to six times more Patagonian toothfish than the regulated fishery, likely affects the sustainability of the stock. Long-line fishing for toothfish causes a high incidence of seabird mortality.  and the situation: Red fishery and Brown fishery were both fishing for Patagonian toothfish. Red fishery was fishing illegally, while Brown fishery was regulated and lawful.  Answer the following question: Which fishery did more unreported fishing? Answer:","output":"Based on the given background and situation, the Red fishery did more unreported fishing than the Brown fishery.  The background information states that illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, particularly of Patagonian toothfish, is a significant issue that threatens the sustainability of the stock. Specifically, an estimated five to six times more Patagonian toothfish are landed via unreported fishing compared to the regulated fishery. The situation indicates that the Red fishery is engaged in illegal fishing activities, while the Brown fishery operates under regulation and is considered lawful. Given this information, it can be inferred that the Red fishery is likely responsible for a larger share of the unreported fishing of Patagonian toothfish than the Brown fishery. The Brown fishery, being regulated and lawful, would be more likely to adhere to the fishing quotas and report their catch accurately, in compliance with the governing bodies and regulations in place.  In contrast, the Red fishery, which is operating illegally, would likely prioritize maximizing their catch without regard for the impact on the Patagonian toothfish population or potential environmental consequences. Their illegal status suggests that they are contributing to the unreported and unregulated fishing practices described in the background information, resulting in more unreported fishing than the Brown fishery."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This will in turn affect the amount of sugar (glucose) available in the blood.  1. Food enters the body: Since there is less food, the quantity entering the body will be less than usual. 2. Food begins to be processed by the digestive system: The reduced amount of food will still be processed by the digestive system but will yield less glucose. 3. The pancreas releases enzymes to aid digestion: Despite the reduced food amount, the pancreas will still release enzymes to help digestion. 4. Digested food affects the amount of sugar in the blood: The lower amount of food will result in less sugar being present in the blood as a consequence. 5. The pancreas releases one hormone to lower the blood sugar (glucose) level: As there is less sugar in the blood, the pancreas may release lesser of this hormone. 6. The pancreas releases another hormone to raise the blood sugar (glucose) level: Since the blood sugar level is already low, the pancreas may release more of this hormone to raise the blood sugar level.

Throughout his career, Mahler composed a total of ten symphonies, with his 8th Symphony being one of his most monumental and ambitious works. The 8th Symphony was composed between 1906 and 1907, and its world premiere took place on September 12, 1910 in Munich, Germany. The nickname \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\" stems from the enormous forces required to perform the work - including a large orchestra, multiple choirs, and soloists. The size of the ensemble was so large that at the premiere, there were over 1,000 musicians on stage, thus giving rise to the aforementioned nickname. Mahler's 8th Symphony is structured in two main parts. The first part is a setting of the Latin hymn \\"Veni, creator spiritus,\\" which serves as an invocation of the Holy Spirit, while the second part is based on the final scene from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's \\"Faust.\\" This symphony stands out from Mahler's other symphonies, as it focuses more on the choral and vocal aspects rather than merely instrumental. The work explores a wide range of themes, including redemption, love, and the creative spirit, and is known for its complexity and emotional depth. The \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\" is considered a major achievement in Mahler's oeuvre and continues to be a popular choice for performances by large orchestras and choruses around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mainly based on Imperial Roman styles, it originated in, and took its name from, the rule of Napoleon I in the First French Empire, where it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The style corresponds to the more bourgeois Biedermeier style in the German-speaking lands, Federal style in the United States, the Regency style in Britain, and the Napoleonstil in Sweden. According to the art historian Hugh Honour \\"so far from being, as is sometimes supposed, the culmination of the Neo-classical movement, the Empire marks its rapid decline and transformation back once more into a mere antique revival, drained of all the high-minded ideas and force of conviction that had inspired its masterpieces\\".

The Regency style emerged during the reign of George IV (then Prince Regent) and was marked by a return to classical influences, with an emphasis on elegance, refinement, and simplicity. Similar to the Empire style, the Regency style drew inspiration from ancient Greek and Roman art and architecture but was more restrained and less grandiose compared to the French version.

Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues.

Kinnear was riding a horse as part of a scene, when he fell off, sustaining a broken pelvis. Although he was rushed to the hospital, complications developed the following day, ultimately leading to his untimely death at the age of 54. Throughout his career, Roy Kinnear appeared in many popular television shows and movies, such as That Was The Week That Was, The Beatles’ Help!, Hard Days Night, and various productions with director Richard Lester, including The Three Musketeers and its sequels. Kinnear's outstanding contribution to the world of entertainment is still remembered and celebrated, with his acting legacy being carried forward by his son, Rory Kinnear, also a successful actor in film, television, and theater."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: After years of hearing drivers complain about scratches on their cars, Japan's Nissan Motor Company has officially announced the next big thing---a paint that not only resists scratches and scrapes, but actually repairs itself within a few days. The new material, developed by Nippon Paint Company, contains an elastic rubbery-like resin  that is able to heal minor marks caused by car wash equipment, parking lot encounters, road debris   or even on-purpose destruction. The automaker admits its results vary depending on the temperature and the depth of the damage, but adds this is the only paint like it in the world, and tests prove it works. Minor scratches, the most common type, are said to slowly fade over about a week. And once they're gone, there is no trace that they were ever there. The special paint is said to last for at least three years after it is first applied, but there is no word yet on whether more can be added after that period. Nissan claims car washes are the worst offenders for this type of damage, accounting for at least 80 percent of all incidents. But the complete auto-healing won't come without scratching your wallet. The vehicle maker notes the special paint adds about  100 U.S. to the price of a car. It plans to use its new chemical mixture only on its X - Trail SUVs in Japan for now, as it looks for a more widespread presentation. And while plans to offer the feature overseas haven't been made yet, if it's a hit there, you can be almost sure market forces will drive it to these shores, as well. Options: A last 3 years before it is re-applied again B fade only in a few days C help to protect cars from minor paint damage D reduce car scrape incidents to 20 percent Answer: C help to protect cars from minor paint damage Question: The answer to this question is:","output":"What does Nissan's new self-repairing paint technology aim to achieve?

His boss, Peter Janeway, owns several technology and research-based companies and funds Doc's research to maximize his profits and influence. As progress is made on Doc's research, he becomes aware of the enormous potential of his discovery: a device allowing instantaneous worldwide communication, access to unlimited resources, and unimaginable advancements in artificial intelligence. As Doc's invention attracts increasing attention from the scientific community, it also piques the interest of a dangerous international criminal syndicate led by a man known as The Dagger. This powerful organization sees the potential to use Doc's invention for their own nefarious purposes, manipulating world events to their advantage by controlling information flow and global technology resources. When The Dagger's organization targets Dr. Thompson's lab in a violent attempt to steal the prototype, Peter Janeway reveals himself as a former intelligence operative with his own motives. He takes it upon himself to protect Doc and his invention, as well as expose the dark secrets of his past, which intersect with The Dagger's plans.

Background: John Townes Van Zandt (March 7, 1944 - January 1, 1997), better known as Townes Van Zandt, was an American singer-songwriter. He is widely held in high regard for his poetic, often heroically sad songs. In 1983, six years after Emmylou Harris had first popularized it, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard covered his song \\"Pancho and Lefty\\", reaching number one on the Billboard country music chart. Much of his life was spent touring various dive bars, often living in cheap motel rooms and backwoods cabins. Context: Van Zandt married Fran Petters on August 26, 1965; a son, John Townes \\"J.T.\\" Van Zandt II, was born to them on April 11, 1969, in Houston. The couple divorced on January 16, 1970. She would later remarry, changing her last name to Lohr. He began dating Cindy Morgan in 1974 and married her in 1978. Townes and Cindy became estranged for much of the early 1980s, and were divorced on February 10, 1983, in Travis County, Texas. They had no children together.  Van Zandt's third and final marriage was to Jeanene Munsell (born February 21, 1957). They met on December 9, 1980 at a memorial for John Lennon. When the terminally-ill Dorothy Van Zandt learned that her son had impregnated Munsell, she told him, \\"You're going to do the right thing and honor that baby.\\" He soon divorced his estranged second wife and married Munsell on March 14, 1983; their first child, William Vincent, was born ten days later. Another child, Katie Belle, was born February 14, 1992. Van Zandt and Munsell were divorced on May 2, 1994. However, the two remained close until Townes' death, and Jeanene was an executrix of his estate.  Around the time of their April 1993 separation, Jeanene coaxed the musician into signing over the publishing rights of his entire back catalog and recording royalties to her and their children. Townes's only source of income after this point was money received from concert engagements, and even then, Townes would frequently visit his ex-wife and \\"give her all the money in his pockets.\\" Following their divorce in 1994, his only worldly possessions were listed as a 1989 GMC Truck with camper shell, a 1984 Honda Shadow motorcycle and a 1983 Starwind 22-foot boat named Dorothy; he also retained sole ownership of his family inheritance of \\"ownership in oil lease and mineral rights.\\"  At the time of his death, he had begun a long-distance relationship with a woman named Claudia Winterer from Darmstadt, Germany. The two met in November 1995 during a concert of his in Hanau, Germany. Van Zandt told several friends that he planned on marrying Winterer, but the two never became formally engaged. Question: Did he have any children with Munsell?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Townes Van Zandt had two children with Jeanene Munsell.

Evaluating the connection between the two sentences requires a closer look at the given information in each sentence and their subsequent meanings. Sentence 1 states that Slate received several letters in response to the absence of Today's Papers on Oct. 8, which was due to the author, Scott Shuger, falling ill. This sentence implies that Today's Papers had a disruption on a specific date (Oct. 8) due to the author's health issue. Sentence 2, on the other hand, suggests that Today's Papers was going to be missing for an entire week in October. This sentence provides information about a possible planned disruption for a week during the same month, but it does not mention the specific reason behind the disruption nor does it indicate a direct correlation to the event mentioned in Sentence 1 (Scott Shuger's illness on Oct. 8).

The various Eastern churches do not normally refer to themselves as \\"Eastern\\", with the exception of the Assyrian Church of the East and its offshoots.  - An angel, especially according to Abrahamic religions and Zoroastrianism, is a spiritual being superior to humans in power and intelligence. Angels are typically described as benevolent, dreadful, and endowed with wisdom and knowledge of earthly events, but not infallible; for they strive with each other, and God has to make peace between them. Most of them serve either as intermediaries between Heaven and Earth, or as guardian spirits. They are studied in the theological doctrine of angelology. In Christian Science, the word \\"angel\\" is used to refer to an inspiration from God. The use of the term has extended to refer to artistic depictions of the spirits, and it is also used figuratively to refer to messengers and harbingers, and to people who possess high qualities of goodness, purity, selflessness, intelligence, and/or beauty.  - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  - An icon (from Greek \\"eikn\\" \\"image\\") is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, from Eastern Christianity and certain Eastern Catholic churches. The most common subjects include Christ, Mary, saints and/or angels. Though especially associated with \\"portrait\\" style images concentrating on one or two main figures, the term also covers most religious images in a variety of artistic media produced by Eastern Christianity, including narrative scenes.  - A photograph or photo is an image created by light falling on a light-sensitive surface, usually photographic film or an electronic medium such as a CCD or a CMOS chip. Most photographs are created using a camera, which uses a lens to focus the scene's visible wavelengths of light into a reproduction of what the human eye would see. The process and practice of creating photographs is called photography. The word \\"photograph\\" was coined in 1839 by Sir John Herschel and is based on the Greek  (\\"phos\\"), meaning \\"light\\", and  (\\"graphê\\"), meaning \\"drawing, writing\\", together meaning \\"drawing with light\\".  - Nicolas Bouvier ( March 6 , 1929 , Lancy -- February 17 , 1998 ) was a 20th - century Swiss traveller , writer , icon painter and photographer .

Step-by-step justification: 1. Finish junior high: This is an important step as it builds the foundation for further education. However, it is not the immediate step before entering tertiary education. 2. Graduate from high school: This step is crucial because it typically directly precedes entry into tertiary education. A high school diploma or equivalent is often required to gain admission to colleges and universities. 3. Catch cold: This is an unrelated event and has no bearing on entering tertiary education. 4.

Write a text based on this summary: bolivia s compromise on trade clears the air at andean summit Text:","output":"Title: Bolivia's Compromise on Trade Clears the Air at Andean Summit The atmosphere at the Andean summit dramatically improved after Bolivia, one of the Andean Community members, reached a vital compromise regarding trade that helped to alleviate tensions among participating countries. The Andean Community, comprised of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, aims to enhance economic cooperation and integrate the regions for development purposes. Despite the member countries' common goals, disagreements on certain trade policies often hinder progress and create conflict. Bolivia's decision to compromise on a critical trade issue at the summit marks a significant turning point for the Andean Community. The ability to meet common ground demonstrated that these countries can potentially navigate their differences and work together to achieve shared objectives. Bolivia's effort to ease disputes by finding a middle ground invigorated a renewed sense of collaboration, addressing the concerns of the other countries and paving the way for further negotiations. One of the primary reasons Bolivia's compromise made such an impact at the summit was due to the country's previous inflexibility in accepting certain trade agreements. Bolivia's leaders had been resistant to implementing trade policies that other Andean countries deemed crucial to unlocking the potential benefits of enhanced economic relations in the region. Bolivia's newly demonstrated willingness to compromise illustrates the country becoming more aware of the importance of reaching consensus within a regional bloc and the need to balance individual national interests with those of their neighbors. The other Andean countries expressed their appreciation for Bolivia's efforts to be more accommodating in this latest summit. Colombian President Ivan Duque, Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso, and Peruvian President Pedro Castillo praised Bolivia's compromise, acknowledging it as a valuable and necessary step in ensuring long-term success for the Andean Community. The joint statement issued at the end of the summit reflected a united front to promote development, attract foreign investment, and expand regional integration. This compromise has already led to positive consequences in terms of regional trade dynamics. Following Bolivia's cooperative approach, other Andean countries have expressed renewed interest in deepening their economic ties with Bolivia, pushing towards a more unified and prosperous Andean region in the process. Although Bolivia's compromise marks a significant step towards greater collaboration and consensus-building, it is necessary to address the ongoing challenges the Andean Community faces to secure long-term success. Among these challenges are infrastructure development, the persistent disparities in economic performance between member countries, and the impact of external factors such as global economic fluctuations. To further solidify the positive outcomes of the summit, member countries must continue to find common ground and work together on priorities ranging from climate change adaptation to technology transfer. Additionally, promoting regional unity and building a strong political commitment are vital for achieving inclusive and sustainable development in the Andean region. In summary, the Andean summit marked a turning point in the relations between the member countries with Bolivia's crucial compromise on trade paving the way for increased collaboration. The Andean Community's ability to move towards a shared vision will ultimately help them to face regional challenges and unlock the benefits of economic integration. The success of the recent summit reinforces that with strong diplomacy and amenable initiatives, even nations with historic disagreements can overcome obstacles to foster a brighter future for all."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing.

Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands.

Movie plot title: Double Jeopardy Movie plot: Libby Parsons seems to have it all. Her husband, Nick, is devoted to her and their four-year-old son Matty. The family live in a beautiful home on the Pacific Northwest waterfront. When Nick scores yet another business triumph, he buys a yacht to celebrate. Leaving Matty with their friend Angie, who is a teacher at Matty's preschool, the couple set sail for a romantic weekend. But Libby drinks too much wine and passes out. When she wakes, she is covered in blood and Nick is gone. Dizzy and disoriented, she follows a trail of blood to the upper deck. Nick is not there but Libby sees a knife and picks it up. The lights of a Coast Guard boat flash and a voice orders Libby to drop the knife. A mayday was received from the Parsons' yacht. Libby is taken into custody but Nick has seemingly vanished. Tests reveal that the blood found on the yacht was the same type as Nick's. It is presumed that the couple had an argument and Libby attacked Nick. He managed to send a mayday alert before falling or being pushed overboard.Despite the fact that no body is found, Libby is charged with murder. No one believes her story, not even the sheriff who is a family friend. Frantic over what will happen to Matty if she is found guilty, Libby signs over custody to Angie. Nick had a large life insurance policy -- which police believe was the motive for his murder -- and Libby has the money put in Matty's name.The trial is swift and a jury finds Libby guilty. She is taken to a women's prison several hours away. At first Angie regularly brings Matty to visit. When they stop coming, Libby telephones Angie but the number is disconnected. She is inconsolable until a fellow prisoner tells her to use her brain. It is not that easy to disappear and Angie must have left a forwarding address with someone.

What is the answer: What unit of measurement is used to measure the height of a horse?","output":"The height of a horse is typically measured in a unit called \\"hands.\\" A single \\"hand\\" is equal to four inches, or approximately 10.16 centimeters. This traditional method of measuring a horse's height has been used for generations and is still widely accepted worldwide for its simplicity and consistency. The horse's height is measured from the ground to the highest point of the withers, which is the ridge located between the shoulder blades. The withers is considered the ideal spot for height measurement, as it is the most stable and consistent part of a horse's top line, unlike the head, neck, or back, which can vary depending on the horse's pose or movement. To measure a horse's height in hands, follow these steps: 1. Position the horse on a firm, level surface to ensure accurate measurement. 2. Stand the horse up squarely, with its legs vertical, and the hooves flat on the ground. 3. Locate the withers, noting the highest point of the ridge between the shoulder blades. 4. Use a measuring stick or a pliable measuring tape to measure the distance from the ground to the withers. It's helpful if the measuring stick is specifically designed for horse measurements with \\"hands\\" already marked. 5. Record the height in inches first, then convert the measurement to hands by dividing the number of inches by four. For example, if the horse measures 60 inches in height, that equates to 60 ÷ 4 = 15 hands. If the horse's height is not an exact multiple of four inches, the remainder is expressed as a fraction. For example, if a horse is measured to be 61 inches, the height would be recorded as 15 hands and 1 inch (or 15.1 hands). In conclusion, the unit of measurement for a horse's height is known as \\"hands,\\" with each hand being equivalent to four inches. This traditional system ensures that equestrians and horse enthusiasts across the world can compare and understand horse heights consistently and accurately."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mobile edge computing (a.k.a. fog computing) has recently emerged to enable in-situ processing of delay-sensitive applications at the edge of mobile networks. Providing grid power supply in support of mobile edge computing, however, is costly and even infeasible (in certain rugged or under-developed areas), thus mandating on-site renewable energy as a major or even sole power supply in increasingly many scenarios. Nonetheless, the high intermittency and unpredictability of renewable energy make it very challenging to deliver a high quality of service to users in energy harvesting mobile edge computing systems. In this paper, we address the challenge of incorporating renewables into mobile edge computing and propose an efficient reinforcement learning-based resource management algorithm, which learns on-the-fly the optimal policy of dynamic workload offloading (to the centralized cloud) and edge server provisioning to minimize the long-term system cost (including both service delay and operational cost). Our online learning algorithm uses a decomposition of the (offline) value iteration and (online) reinforcement learning, thus achieving a significant improvement of learning rate and runtime performance when compared to standard reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning. We prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm and analytically show that the learned policy has a simple monotone structure amenable to practical implementation. Our simulation results validate the efficacy of our algorithm, which significantly improves the edge computing performance compared to fixed or myopic optimization schemes and conventional reinforcement learning algorithms.

He can even think for himself and figure out what you need. It may feel as if you have a considerate new brother who keeps you company all the time. But come to think of it, can you really trust him? Ever since the first robot was created decades ago, scientists have kept thinking about the task of making robots more like humans. However, as they have gotten closer to that goal, doubts have grown. According to the BBC, Japanese robot designer Masahiro Mori argues that the more lifelike robots become, the more humans feel a connection to them. But once they become too similar to humans, people begin to feel uncomfortable. This theory is what led to the creation of a brand new robot in Switzerland earlier this month. Roboy, as the new machine is called, has various human-like abilities such as hand-shaking and bicycle-riding, but instead of a skin-like covering, Roboy is wrapped in shiny white armor   that clearly shows its robot status. \\"As long as people can clearly see that the robot is a machine, even if they project their feelings into it, then they feel comfortable,\\" Rolf Pfeifer, the creator of Roboy from the University of Zurich, Switzerland, told the BBC.

A study on how heterosexual and homosexual men's brains react to seeing pictures of naked men and women has found that both hetero- and homosexual men react positively to seeing their preferred sex, using the same brain regions. The only significant group difference between these orientations was found in the amygdala, a brain region known to be involved in regulating fear. What does the amygdala region of the brain do?","output":"The amygdala region of the brain plays crucial roles in several key functions, primarily related to emotion, behavior, and motivation. It is perhaps most well known for its involvement in the emotional processing of the information our brains receive. Essentially, the amygdala helps us experience emotions such as fear, anger, sadness, and happiness. Fear regulation is one of the key roles of the amygdala. The amygdala can trigger a rapid, automatic fear response when we perceive something threatening. It issues a distress signal that prompts the hypothalamus to initiate the body's \\"fight or flight\\" response. The amygdala instigates this process before we're even consciously aware of the threat, allowing us to react quickly and instinctively to dangerous situations. Beyond fear, the amygdala is involved in other emotions as well. It assists in recognising and interpreting emotional stimuli and can help to determine our emotional reactions to specific situations. It plays a part in how we perceive others' emotions, influencing empathy and social interaction. For example, studies have implicated the amygdala in social phobias and disorders like autism which can involve difficulty interpreting others' emotions. Additionally, the amygdala plays a role in memory, especially in the consolidation and recall of emotional memories. This can include both positive and negative emotions, allowing us, for example, to remember the joy experienced at a friend's wedding or the fear felt during a traumatic event. The influence of the amygdala can make emotionally-charged memories particularly strong and vivid. In the context of the study you mentioned, the amygdala's response in regulating emotional reactions might be interpreting and reacting to the sexual content in the images presented, and creating emotional responses that are consistent with each individual's sexual preference. The difference in response between the two groups could be due to different emotional reactions induced by the images, possibly because the homosexual and heterosexual men in the study possess different sexual preferences. Overall, to sum up, the amygdala is a complex and critical part of the brain that's deeply involved in emotional processing, fear response, memory relating to emotional events, and behaviors influenced by these functions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It involves a handsome man standing outside a young woman's window, singing a love song to her to win her over. However, trying to woo a female with songs is not just something that humans do. A few animals sing love songs as well. Birds and elephants are romantic but the latest animal to  _ a female might surprise you--it is the humble mouse.     You may find it odd to find out that mice sing. We do not hear them because the frequency of their voice is so high. In fact, scientists have known for some time that male mice make special sounds to females, but it has always been assumed that the sounds are produced instinctively   and randomly, with little thought going into the process. But new research suggests otherwise. When male mice with different voices were put in a cage together, scientists found that they would gradually change their pitches   to sound like one another. But when a female mouse was put in the cage with two males, one male would change his pitch to match the other. \\"It was usually the smaller animal changing the pitch to match the larger animal,\\" professor Erich Jarvis, leader of the study, from Duke University, US, told BBC News. This ability, known as vocal learning, is rare in the natural world. It had been thought to be limited to some birds, such as parrots--as well as whales and dolphins. The latest findings challenge the long-held opinion that mice cannot learn to adapt their voices.     Scientists also found the part of the brain that controls the mice's singing ability. In the experiment, they damaged the cells in this part of the mice's brain and found that the animals couldn't keep their songs in pitch or repeat them any more. This also happened when the mice became deaf. Jarvis said that this finding had changed his understanding of the way mice make sound. \\"In mice we find that the pathways that are at least modulating   these vocalizations   are in the forebrain, in places where you actually find them in humans,\\"... Question: What do parrots, whales and dolphins have in common according to the passage? Yes or no, is the answer \\"They all have the ability to learn to adapt their voices.\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer \\"They all have the ability to learn to adapt their voices\\" is correct according to the passage. Parrots, whales, and dolphins have the ability of vocal learning in common, which is considered rare in the natural world. This ability was previously thought to be limited only to these specific animals. However, the latest findings in the study conducted by Duke University have challenged this long-held belief by showing that mice also possess the ability to learn and adapt their voices, particularly when it comes to attracting a female mate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: Still looking for their first win of the season, the Browns went home for a Week 4 AFC North duel with the Cincinnati Bengals in Round 1 of 2009's Battle of Ohio. Due to quarterback Brady Quinn's poor performance in the season thus far, head coach Eric Mangini named quarterback Derek Anderson the starter. Cleveland would trail early in the first quarter as Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Chad Ochocinco. The Browns would continue to struggle in the second quarter as defensive end Robert Geathers returned a fumble 75 yards for a touchdown. Cleveland would respond with Anderson completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Steve Heiden. The Browns would tie the game in the third quarter with Anderson's 1-yard touchdown run. Afterwards, Cleveland would take the lead in the fourth quarter with a 26-yard and a 31-yard field goal from kicker Billy Cundiff. However, Cincinnati answered with Palmer hooking up with Ochocinco again on a 2-yard touchdown run (with a blocked PAT). In overtime, both teams went back and forth with their possessions. In the end, the Bengals emerged victorious with kicker Shayne Graham kicking the game-winning 31-yard field goal.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. By. Paul Revoir. and Liz Thomas. Updated:. 07:13 GMT, 7 October 2011. Facing the axe: BBC2's daytime shows such as Flog It!, with Paul Martin,  and Cash In The Attic could be lost from schedules due to the Corporation's cuts. BBC2 will become the channel for repeats after the Corporation announced £1.3billion in cuts to ensure it no longer ‘takes the licence fee for granted’. More than half the channel’s  schedule will be devoted to reruns as bosses try to end decades of empire-building by taking an axe to  ‘luxuries’ they can ‘no longer afford’. Popular daytime shows at risk could include Cash in the Celebrity Attic and Flog It! Nearly all new daytime shows will now air on BBC1, which has been spared the brunt of the cuts. But despite cuts of 20 per cent, the BBC will still enjoy an annual budget of £3.5billion. The measures will lead to 2,000 redundancies – 800 in the news division – and the sale of Television Centre. Yesterday’s report unveiling the cuts also revealed that the broadcaster will:. But the Corporation faced embarrassment after its chief operating officer Caroline Thomson appeared to compare closing a channel to the NHS shutting hospitals. She said the BBC could not close any of its services because they were too valued by the public. Asked if any other publicly funded organisation could justify saying this, she told Radio 4’s PM Programme: ‘Ask the NHS about the problem of closing hospitals.’ It was BBC2 – once best known for its pioneering arts, science and drama – that emerged as the major loser from the cutbacks. Old shows will account for 56 per cent of its schedule. Hardly any new shows will appear before early evening, and prime time repeats will increase by 3 per cent. Switched on: BBC Director General Mark Thompson (centre) arrives at Television Centre in London with colleagues ahead of the announcement of cost-cutting proposals. Staying tuned: An employee checks his phone ahead of the announcement by the BBC at their headquarters in west London. During the day, apart from repeats, BBC2 will broadcast an international news bulletin, The Daily Politics and BBC World’s HardTalk. TOM UTLEY: 'Mark Thompson seems to forget that down here in the real world, where cash is actually earned and spent, £3500 million can still go quite a long way. He seems more concerned with width than quality and I fear he may have blown his chance to save Auntie Beeb.' The BBC will be saving £700million per year at the end of the five year process. It commissioned the Delivering Quality First report, which includes details of the cuts after the licence fee was last year frozen at £145.50 for six years. The report envisages a ‘smaller and radically reshaped BBC’. It said: ‘By 2016, the BBC will be significantly smaller than it is today; employing fewer people; occupying far less space; and spending less money both absolutely and as a proportion of the UK broadcasting industry.’ BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten said: ‘We should be able to run an outstanding public service broadcaster on a budget of £3.5billion. ‘It is a privilege to be funded by the public through the licence fee. This privilege should neither be abused or taken for granted. New home: A further 1,000 BBC staff will be moved to the development in Salford to cut costs at the corporation. ‘With people and organisations everywhere in the UK obliged to pull in their belts, we cannot absolve ourselves at the BBC from the responsibility of responding to current economic realities.’ He said some things the BBC wanted to do were ‘luxuries’ that it ‘cannot afford’. But unions bitterly condemned plans to axe thousands of jobs and threatened strike action. They said more than 7,000 jobs had been lost at the BBC since 2004, adding that the situation ‘isn’t sustainable’. Gerry Morrissey, of Bectu, the media and entertainment union, said: ‘They are destroying jobs, and destroying the BBC.’ The Corporation has vowed to drive down the number of senior managers so they account for just 1 per cent of the organisation. But this will still leave the final tally at around 200. And staff axed as part of the job cuts could be back working at the BBC in as little as three months after the Corporation watered down its redundancy terms. At present, staff have to wait 12 months before they can return. But this ‘cooling off’ period has been reduced to just three months. Critics said many of those who pick up pay-offs could simply walk back into  freelance deals within weeks  of leaving. This would allow the BBC to make it look like it had taken tough action but actually offer workers a safety net. Elsewhere in the report, Radio 4 and BBC1 have been broadly protected from the axe with the Corporation’s output in natural history, popular science, drama and arts ring-fenced. But as part of the savings late night TV shows, from 10.30pm, will be slashed, raising big questions over the future of programmes such as A Question of Sport. It is understood flagship shows in these slots such as Question Time, Newsnight, Match of the Day and Graham Norton’s chat show will be protected. BBC3 and BBC4 have been saved from be scrapped altogether. Radio will also see more repeats, with Radio 2 and 5 Live cutting back comedy, and Radio 3 doing less drama and fewer lunch-time concerts. Executives have also been told that spending on talent fees – one of the biggest expenditures for stations – needs to drop on Radio 1 and Radio 2, which could see big name stars axed when their contract is up for renewal. Liberal Democrat MP Don Foster said: ‘I’m confident the BBC can save money while still preserving the high quality programming the public loves. It’s unfortunate that this has to happen and it is imperative that cuts should not lead to a lower quality BBC.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"The article discusses the announcement of £1.3 billion in cuts by the BBC, which will affect BBC2 significantly as the channel is set to become a platform mainly for repeats.

They were both very surprised with they findings.  But I can use this background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

Die Jugendkultur ist ein Phänomen, das in vielen Ländern und Kulturen auf der ganzen Welt zu finden ist. Sie bildet einen wichtigen Teil der Identität von Jugendlichen, ermöglicht ihnen, sich auszudrücken, ihr Selbstbewusstsein zu stärken und ihre Zugehörigkeit zu einer bestimmten Gruppe zu demonstrieren. Diese einzigartige Kultur ist von Generation zu Generation unterschiedlich und entwickelt sich ständig weiter, um den sich ändernden Bedürfnissen und Interessen der Jugendlichen gerecht zu werden. Die Kleidung, die innerhalb dieser Jugendkultur getragen wird, ist oft sehr spezifisch und unterscheidet sich von der konventionellen Mode. Sie kann Elemente aus verschiedenen Stilen und Epochen beinhalten und wird manchmal als eine Rebellion gegen etablierte Modetrends oder Normen betrachtet. Typischerweise wollen Jugendliche durch ihr Kleidungsstil ihre Individualität, Ideale und die Zugehörigkeit zu einer bestimmten Subkultur zum Ausdruck bringen. Der Verhaltenskodex innerhalb dieser Jugendkultur kann sich in vielerlei Hinsicht manifestieren, wie zum Beispiel in der Art und Weise, wie Mitglieder der Gruppe miteinander und mit anderen interagieren. Dazu gehören Aspekte wie Gemeinschaftsgefühl, Loyalität und gegenseitiger Respekt. Einige Jugendkulturen können auch spezifische Rituale oder Traditionen haben, die zur Festigung von Gruppenidentität und Zusammenhalt beitragen. Die Straßensprache ist ein weiteres Schlüsselelement der Jugendkultur und dient als Mittel zur Kommunikation und Selbstdarstellung. Sie entwickelt sich oft aus einem Mix von regionalen Dialekten, Slang und Fachjargon und kann von einer Gruppe als eine Art Geheimsprache benutzt werden, um die Gruppenidentität zu stärken und sich von anderen abzuheben. Diese Straßensprache hat nicht nur eine soziale und kulturelle, sondern auch eine politische Bedeutung, da sie die Forderungen, Wünsche und Bestrebungen einer Generation zum Ausdruck bringen kann. Musik spielt in der Jugendkultur eine zentrale Rolle und fungiert als Bindeglied zwischen den Mitgliedern einer Gruppe. Unterschiedliche Musikstile können unterschiedliche Subkulturen repräsentieren und spiegeln oft die sozialen, politischen und emotionalen Aspekte des Lebens der Jugendlichen wider. Musik kann dabei sowohl Grundlage für gemeinsame Aktivitäten wie Tanzen, Konzerte oder Festivals sein, als auch ein wichtiges Medium, um Botschaften zu vermitteln und persönliche Erfahrungen auszutauschen. Zusammenfassend ist die Jugendkultur ein vielschichtiges Phänomen, das Jugendlichen dabei hilft, ihre Identität und ihren Platz in der Gesellschaft zu finden.

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Jordan's King Hussein sent a secret message to President Richard Nixon in 1970 pleading with him to attack Syria, according to declassified documents released Wednesday by the former president's library. President Nixon works at his desk in the Oval Office in a June 1972 photograph. The papers are among about 10,000 documents released by the Nixon Presidential Library, some of which offer harbingers of present-day events, such as concerns about terrorism and Saudi Arabia. Library director Timothy Naftali said the documents describe challenges such as how to get the Saudis more involved in solving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, how to get them more engaged against terrorism, how to address the Arab view that the United States always sides with Israel and how to build up moderate Palestinians to counter extremists.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: - Arab, Palestinian, and Syrians are vague terms and do not refer to specific countries or entities that could have a nuclear weapons policy. - CNN, Oval Office, Nixon Library, Nixon Presidential Library, Nixon White House, and WASHINGTON are not countries or political entities; they cannot maintain a nuclear weapons policy. - Fatah and PLO are political organizations and do not have official nuclear weapons capabilities or policies. - Israeli is an adjective and does not constitute a political entity. - Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and United States are countries, but they do not maintain a strategic ambiguity regarding their nuclear weapons capabilities. - King Hussein, Richard Nixon, and Timothy Naftali are individuals and cannot maintain a nuclear weapons policy on their own."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He killed himself when he was only 37, but he left behind him more than 2,000 paintings and drawings, which established his reputation in a way he would never have considered possible. Van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853 at Groot Zundert Province of Noord Nrabant in Dutch. He was the son of a clergyman. His first artist impressions were formed as a boy, from his uncle who was an art dealer. The motivation bore early fruit and from the age of 12 the young Vincent was drawing. The interest led to an apprenticeship   in an art dealer's firm, Groupil's, in the Hague. When he was only 20, he was transferred to the firm's London office. In London Van Gogh faced his first major crisis, when he was rejected in love. After that, he turned to religion, expressed disapproval with art-dealing and neglected his work. Groupil transferred him from London to Paris but, when his work was still unsatisfactory, dismissed him in 1876.  The young Van Gogh made religion a consuming interest and during the next few years travelled in Britain, Belgium and Holland, trying to establish himself as a preacher, but without success. In 1880, at the age of 27, he found himself drawn back to art. He had a job as an assistant evangelist  in the mining village of Borinage in Belgium but realized an artist drive which was to motivate him unceasingly until his death 10 years later. Late in 1881, he moved to the Hague and established a relationship with a woman, Christine Hoornik, with whom he lived for a time. He broke with her in 1883, however, and never again established a significant intimate relationship with a woman. In 1886 Van Gogh left Holland forever and travelled via Antwerp to Paris, and to major changes in artistic style. Van Gogh's work became more youthful in Paris. He  lived with his brother, Theo, who managed the modern department of an art dealer's. A new, more animated, painting style emerged and the impressionist tendencies of earlier work weakened somewhat. Van... When did Van Gogh die?

Our protagonist, Camila, is a fierce and passionate young woman who dreams of creating change in her troubled country. She meets Antonio, a former soldier disillusioned with the government and heads a small group of fighters against the authoritarian regime of Fulgencio Batista. With a spark of shared longing for change, they fall in love despite the chaos around them. As Castro's revolutionaries gain momentum, Camila and Antonio's group must decide whether to join forces with them or maintain their own separate rebellion. Meanwhile, José, a young spy working for Batista, infiltrates Antonio's group seeking crucial information and becomes friends with Camila. Eventually, Camila discovers José's true identity, and he is torn between his duty to Batista and his loyalty to his new friends. As the revolution intensifies, Fidel Castro's forces sweep across the island, and this story extends beyond just Camila and Antonio's love story; it becomes a battle of ideals, Camila's hope for a better future, and José's struggle between duty and friendship. Camila ultimately convinces Antonio and his group of rebels to join forces with Castro in their quest for a liberated Cuba. As the fighting continues, José decides to switch sides, offering his intelligence skills to Castro's forces. However, his betrayal is discovered by Batista's men, resulting in dire consequences. With the Cuban Revolution nearing its end, the love story between Camila and Antonio reaches its climax. They are faced with the difficult choice of staying together or sacrificing their relationship for the greater good of their country.

We have the equation: -23*a = 8*a + 16 + 15 First, let's combine the numbers on the right side of the equation. So, 16 + 15 becomes 31. Now the equation looks like: -23*a = 8*a + 31 Now, we want to get all the \\"a\\" terms on one side of the equation and the numbers on the other side. To do this, we'll add 23*a to both sides of the equation to cancel out the -23*a on the left side: -23*a + 23*a = 8*a + 23*a + 31 This simplifies to: 0 = 31*a + 31 Now, we'll move the number 31 to the other side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides: -31 = 31*a Finally, we'll solve for \\"a\\" by dividing both sides of the equation by 31: -31/31 = a This simplifies to: a = -1 So, the solution for \\"a\\" is -1."},{"instruction":"Generate a question that has the following answer:  The Thing  for the following movie plot:  A United States Air Force crew is dispatched by General Fogerty (David McMahon) from Anchorage, Alaska at the request of Dr. Carrington (Robert Cornthwaite), the chief scientist of a North Pole scientific outpost.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which pack would induce less awareness of smoking health risks, pack A or pack B?  Hint: Beginning in September 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will require larger, more prominent cigarette health warnings on all cigarette packaging and advertisements in the United States. These warnings are a significant advancement in communicating the dangers of smoking. These new cigarette health warnings contains nine different warnings that will increase awareness of the specific health risks associated with smoking, such as death, addiction, lung disease, cancer, stroke and heart disease. These warnings include: A:","output":"Based on the information provided, pack A would induce less awareness of smoking health risks compared to pack B.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose first opera was L'Orfeo? is inside the article: The Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643), in addition to a large output of church music and madrigals, wrote prolifically for the stage. His theatrical works were written between 1604 and 1643 and included ten operas, of which three—L'Orfeo (1607), Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640) and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643)—have survived with their music and librettos intact. In the case of the other seven operas, the music has disappeared almost entirely, although some of the librettos exist. The loss of these works, written during a critical period of early opera history, has been much regretted by commentators and musicologists. Opera, as a musical and theatrical genre, began to emerge during the early part of Monteverdi's career, initially as a form of courtly entertainment. With other composers, he played a leading part in its development into the main form of public musical theatre. His first opera, L'Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Mantuan court, which employed him, was a major success. In the years that followed, at Mantua and in his later capacity as maestro di cappella (director of music) at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Monteverdi continued to write theatrical music in various genres, including operas, dances, and intermedi (short musical interludes inserted into straight plays). Because in Monteverdi's times stage music was rarely thought to have much utility after its initial performance, much of this music vanished shortly after its creation. Most of the available information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide irrefutable evidence that four of these works—L'Arianna, Andromeda, Proserpina rapita and Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia—were completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous lament from L'Arianna and a trio from Proserpina are known to have survived. The other three lost operas—Le nozze di Tetide, La finta pazza Licori and Armida..., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the article, the last name of the person whose first opera was L'Orfeo is Monteverdi. The full name of this Italian composer is Claudio Monteverdi (1567-1643), who was a prominent figure in the development of opera during his time. He wrote numerous works for the stage, church music, and madrigals, but his first opera, L'Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Mantuan court, was a major success and marked the beginning of his notable contributions to the world of opera."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: John was tuning his musical instruments with two tuning forks, fork A and fork B. He produced higher frequency with fork A and lower frequency with fork B. Interestingly, both frequencies had the same amplitude.  Which fork would have lower frequency of the vibrations, fork A or fork B? The answer is:","output":"Fork B would have the lower frequency of vibrations compared to Fork A. In this scenario, John was tuning his musical instruments using two different tuning forks, Fork A and Fork B. He produced a higher frequency with Fork A and a lower frequency with Fork B, both having the same amplitude. To better understand this, let's explain what frequency and amplitude mean in relation to sound and vibrations. Sound waves are created by objects vibrating, and these vibrations propagate through a medium such as air, water, or any other suitable material. The characteristics of sound waves can be described using two fundamental properties: frequency and amplitude. 1. Frequency: Frequency is the number of cycles of a wave that occur per unit of time, typically measured in Hertz (Hz). Higher frequencies result in a higher pitch, while lower frequencies produce a lower pitch. In musical terms, this relates to how high or low the note sounds. In the case of the tuning forks, Fork A produces a higher pitch sound, indicating it has a higher frequency, while Fork B produces a lower pitch sound, indicating a lower frequency. 2. Amplitude: Amplitude corresponds to the intensity or loudness of the sound wave. It's the maximum displacement of particles in the medium from their equilibrium position due to the wave's vibrations. Amplitude is usually measured in decibels (dB), and higher amplitudes are perceived as louder sounds, while lower amplitudes are perceived as quieter sounds. In the case of the two tuning forks, both Fork A and Fork B have the same amplitude, meaning their loudness is the same. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the question, Fork B has the lower frequency of vibrations compared to Fork A. Both tuning forks have the same amplitude, meaning they produce sounds with the same loudness but varying pitches. This difference in vibration frequency is useful for tuning musical instruments, as it allows for precise adjustments in pitch and overall harmony."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tommy holds up the cashier with a pistol while Rosie waited in the car she inherited from her father. Tommy is arrested and sent to prison for 18 months. In the meantime, Rosie gets a job at a debt collection agency run by Dave Lovell, who went to jail for bilking major companies out of 800,000 through fraudulent invoices. Lovell reformed his life and mainly hires ex-cons at his firm. He is happy to give Tommy a job and a second chance. Tommy is restless and instead of following the call script, he often counsels people on how to defraud Lovell's company. When Tommy sees some mafiosos in his neighborhood, he grows enraged. He calls them fat old guys living off their reputation, and he resents the way the mafia treated his father. Over the course of the film, it is revealed that Tommy's father started his shop with a mafia loan, and he suffered frequent beatings when he was late with payments. Tommy's mother and brother still run the shop, but his mother blames Tommy's criminal activity for breaking her husband's heart and leading to his death. Whereas, Tommy blames his father's death completely on the humiliation he suffered at the hands of the mafia. Tommy skips work one day to attend the trial of John Gotti. He watches Sammy the Bull's testimony, and he perks up when Sammy explains that no guns are allowed in mafia social clubs.

Article: Is it time to kick Russia out of the BRICs  ?If so, it may end up sounding like a famous ball-point pen maker--BIC. An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device  , the BRICs, should really be the BICs. \\"Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?\\" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreign Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of \\"The Russian Balance Sheet\\", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes: \\"The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas.\\" Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing far better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about economy. As is mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors   to focus on the big promising players. From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while around 80 percent is for the other three. At very least, despite Russia's economic underperformance, its stock market outperformance does suggest it is indeed one of the group. Question: According to Aslund, Russia shouldn't be a BRIC partly because    _   . - its economic performance is worse than that of the others - its leaders are not good at managing economy - it has taken effective measures to improve its economy - it will no longer attract investors from other countries","output":"According to Aslund, Russia shouldn't be a BRIC partly because its economic performance is worse than that of the others."},{"instruction":"Given the question: USS Carter (DE-112) -  USS Carter (DE-112) was a Cannon-class destroyer escort built for the United States Navy during World War II.

And that has created a bit of a dilemma. On the one hand, you have a conventionally grown apple. On the other, you have one that's organic. Both apples are firm, shiny and red. Both provide vitamins and fiber, and both are free of fat, sodium and cholesterol. Conventionally grown food generally costs less, but is organic food a better choice? The advantages claimed for such foods over conventionally grown and sold food products are now being debated on a large scale. Supporters of organic foods -- a term whose meaning varies greatly --are frequently telling the world that such products are safer and more nutritious than others. The growing interest of consumers in the safety and nutritional quality of daily foods is a welcome development. However, much of this interest has been aroused by sweeping claims that the conventional food supply is unsafe or inadequate in meeting nutritional needs. Almost daily, the public is surrounded by claims for \\"no-aging\\" diets, new vitamins and other wonder foods. There are numerous unsubstantiated  reports that natural vitamins are superior to man-made ones, that fertilized eggs are nutritionally superior to unfertilized eggs, that untreated grains are better than those treated with insect spray and the like. Although most of these claims are not supported by scientific evidence, large amounts of written material about the benefits of organic foods makes it difficult for people to separate fact from fiction. As a result, claims that eating a diet consisting of organically grown foods prevents or cures disease or provides other benefits to health have become widely advertised and form the basis for people's opinion.

Try your best to look alert. If you feel your eyes averting to something else in the room, catch yourself and focus back on your teacher. Your teacher should have your full attention at all times during class. Your eyes should not be drifting elsewhere. Most teachers tell you the subject of the class and the objective they are aiming for you to learn. If possible, write down this objective the minute you hear it. What is it that needs to be done today? What will you be learning about? How can you remain alert and focused during this time? Set goals for yourself, and remind yourself of the objective throughout class. This way, you know exactly what you have to do. . By taking accurate notes, you'll be able to \\"get into\\" the lesson. Recognize key points as your teacher speaks, and listen for key phrases such as \\"This is important,\\" \\"This is the main idea,\\" and \\"This will be on the test,\\", for example. This can alert you to listen more intently; you'll have something to do and focus on.  Objectives: If your teacher normally writes down the lesson's objective at the beginning of the class, keep it in your head and make sure you've achieved it by the end of the lesson. Don't try to finish up old notes or homework in class. Do that later, when you have free time or else you might miss key points. This is a wonderful way to become a more focused, successful student. When a teacher asks a question, offer to answer it. If she/he asks for an opinion, share your own. This shows that the teacher that you're listening intently during the class and that you know your stuff. This can also help you avoid those embarrassing moments, when you get called on and you happen to not be paying attention. Also, teachers will note to college officers that you are actively contributing in class. If you don't understand something, never be afraid to ask. This really shows your teacher that you want to learn and can recognize the things you're having difficulty with.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of King Krishnadevaraya court jester?, using the article: The Kannada poets and scholars of the empire produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas (devotees of Vishnu), Brahminical and Veerashaiva (Lingayatism) literature. The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called Devaranama (lyrical poems) in the native meters of Sangatya (quatrain), Suladi (beat based), Ugabhoga (melody based) and Mundige (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many Dasas (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution. Kumara Vyasa, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote Gadugina Bharata, a translation of the epic Mahabharata. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. Chamarasa was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His Prabhulinga Leele, later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint Allama Prabhu (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi).At this peak of Telugu literature, the most famous writing in the Prabandha style was Manucharitamu. King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated Amuktamalyada.

Independence with Partition: The British began to see India's independence as inevitable; however, only a few seemed to understand the vital role of the religious groups. Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible. Quick it was — six months after his arrival — but not smooth.  After reading the above, is \\"Bangladesh\\" the correct answer to the question \\"In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. This proposal began the birth of what country?\\"? pick from the following. [A]. no [B]. yes","output":"[A]. no The correct answer is \\"no\\" because the passage states that Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India, and the idea of Pakistan was later formed. Bangladesh was not mentioned in the passage, and it is located in the east, not the northwest of India. So, the question is asking about a different country, not Bangladesh."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Question: James tried to arise from the lunch table, where he had done what? Options: - fall down - sitting down - go ahead - sit down - lie down  Explain why a human would choose \\"sit down\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"sit down\\" to answer the question above because it is the option that best aligns with the context provided in the question and accords with normal human behavior during a mealtime activity. The question states, \\"James tried to arise from the lunch table, where he had done what?\\" From this statement, one can infer that James was likely engaged in an activity commonly associated with a lunch table before attempting to stand up. When considering the various options provided, it becomes clear that \\"sit down\\" is the most logical and fitting choice based on typical human experiences and expectations during lunchtime. Here's a closer examination of the other options and why they would not be appropriate choices: 1. Fall down: While it is possible for someone to fall down near or at a lunch table, this option would be unlikely in comparison to sitting down for a meal. Falling down is not an expected or standard part of the dining experience. 2. Sitting down: This option is very close to \\"sit down,\\" but the phrasing doesn't fit as well with the past tense context provided in the question. The question indicates that James had already completed a posture before trying to arise. Thus, \\"sit down\\" better conveys that James was in a seated position before attempting to stand up. 3. Go ahead: This option does not provide any information about what James was doing at the lunch table. \\"Go ahead\\" is a vague expression typically used as a form of permission or encouragement, and it does not explain any specific posture or action related to a lunchtime scenario. 4. Lie down: Lying down is an action typically associated with resting or sleeping rather than eating a meal at a table. While it is physically possible for someone to lie down near a table, it is highly improbable and does not fit into the normal customs related to having a meal. In summary, a human would choose \\"sit down\\" to answer this question because it is the most logical and contextually appropriate option. It stands as the action most closely aligned with normal human behavior when participating in a meal at a lunch table."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean. This isn't much information, but it's progress and the scientists are not going to stop their studies until they learn all that they can about these waters.  and a hint : Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years.  Please answer this question : Which ocean is probably connected to less oceans with higher salinities? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that the Madrigal Ocean is connected to fewer oceans with higher salinities. The hint provided describes the Arctic Ocean on Earth, which has the lowest salinity among the major oceans. The primary reasons for its lower salinity levels are the low evaporation rates, substantial freshwater input from surrounding rivers and streams, and limited connections to other bodies of water with higher salinities.  Similarly, the Madrigal Ocean on the planet nearly identical to Earth has a lower salinity level compared to the Listy Ocean. This suggests that the Madrigal Ocean, like the Arctic Ocean, might be experiencing lower evaporation rates, a substantial inflow of freshwater from nearby sources, and limited connection to other bodies of water with higher salinity levels.  In contrast, the Listy Ocean's higher salinity suggests that it might be more connected to other oceans with high salinities. This could be due to factors like higher evaporation, lower freshwater inflow, and greater interaction with saltier water bodies. These factors contribute to the increased salt concentration in the Listy Ocean compared to the Madrigal Ocean. Therefore, considering the similarities between the Madrigal Ocean and the Arctic Ocean, it is probable that the Madrigal Ocean is connected to fewer oceans with higher salinities. Further studies and observations could offer more insights into the factors affecting the salinity of both the Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean and help understand their connections to other water bodies."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

In order to better understand the two statements, let's break them down and examine them individually. 1. \\"Two women are inside large plastic balls floating on a pool.\\" This statement gives us a clear image of the situation. There are two women, each inside a large plastic ball, and these balls are floating on water in a pool. The activity they are participating in could be recreational, for example, a fun game or just a unique way of enjoying the pool. These inflatable plastic balls, commonly known as water zorbs or water walking balls, are used for various forms of entertainment and recreational activities. 2. \\"The zombies are bowling.\\" This statement brings up an entirely different scenario that is unrelated to the first statement. It portrays a scene where zombies, fictional undead creatures, are engaging in the sport of bowling. Bowling, as we know, is an activity where a heavy ball is rolled down a lane to knock down a set of pins. Zombies are often depicted in popular culture as slow-moving and lack cognitive ability, which this statement seems to play on by creating an amusing or absurd mental image of them participating in a casual sport like bowling. In conclusion, the presence of two women inside plastic balls floating on a pool has no connection or relevance to zombies playing a game of bowling.

Young was born in Compton, California, the first child of Theodore and Verna Young. His middle name, Romelle, is derived from his father's amateur R&B singing group, The Romells. His parents married in 1964, separated in 1968, and divorced in 1972. His mother later remarried and had three children: sons Jerome and Tyree (both deceased) and daughter Shameka. Inspired by the Grandmaster Flash song \\"The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel\\", he often attended a club called Eve After Dark to watch many DJs and rappers performing live. He subsequently became a DJ in the club, initially under the name \\"Dr. J\\", based on the nickname of Julius Erving, his favorite basketball player. At the club, he met aspiring rapper Antoine Carraby, later to become member DJ Yella of N.W.A. Soon afterwards he adopted the moniker Dr. Dre, a mix of previous alias Dr. J and his first name, referring to himself as the \\"Master of Mixology\\". Eve After Dark had a back room with a small four-track studio. In this studio, Dre and Yella recorded several demos. In their first recording session, they recorded a song entitled \\"Surgery\\", with the lyrics \\"calling Dr. Dre to surgery\\" serving as the chorus to the song. He later joined the musical group World Class Wreckin' Cru under the independent Kru-Cut Records in 1984. The group would become stars of the electro-hop scene that dominated early 1980s West Coast hip hop. \\"Surgery\\", which was officially released after being recorded prior to the group's official formation, would prominently feature Dr. Dre on the turntable. The record would become the group's first hit, selling 50,000 copies within the Compton area.  Dr. Dre and DJ Yella also performed mixes for local radio station KDAY, boosting ratings for its afternoon rush-hour show The Traffic Jam. Dr. Dre's earliest recordings were released in 1994 on a compilation titled Concrete Roots. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the website AllMusic described the compiled music, released \\"several years before Dre developed a distinctive style\\", as \\"surprisingly generic and unengaging\\" and \\"for dedicated fans only\\".  His frequent absences from school jeopardized his position as a diver on his school's swim team. After high school, he attended Chester Adult School in Compton following his mother's demands for him to get a job or continue his education. After brief attendance at a radio broadcasting school, he relocated to the residence of his father and residence of his grandparents before returning to his mother's house. He later dropped out of Chester to focus on performing at the Eve's After Dark nightclub.

Article:However, there is a large increase in the risk of depression in women planning to breastfeed who are then unable to do so. The study, published in the journal Maternal and Child Health, called for more support for women unable to breastfeed. A parenting charity said mental health was a \\"huge issue\\" for many mothers. The health benefits of breastfeeding to the baby are clear-cut and the World Health Organization recommends feeding a child nothing but breast milk for the first six months. However, researchers at the University of Cambridge said the impact on the mother was not as clearly understood. One in 10 women will develop depression after the birth of their child. The researchers analysed data from 13,998 births in the south-west of England. It showed that, out of women who were planning to breastfeed, there was a 50% reduction in the risk of post-natal depression if they started breastfeeding. But the risk of depression more than doubled among women who wanted to, but were not able to, breastfeed. Dr Maria Iacovou, one of the researchers, told the BBC: \\"Breastfeeding does appear to have a protective effect, but there's the other side of the coin as well. \\"Those who wanted to and didn't end up breastfeeding had the highest risk of all the groups.\\" The benefit increased for each week of breastfeeding up to one month. However, any longer term impact on post-natal depression could not be determined due to the small number of women in the study who were still breast feeding several months after the birth. Dr Iacovou said the health profession needed to pay attention. She added: \\"It is right to tell mothers it's right to breastfeed, there's so many benefits, but the thing we need to rethink is giving more support to those who did want to breastfeed and to recognise those who are unable to, are at substantially elevated risk and to make sure health visitors keep an eye on these women.\\" Possible explanations for the beneficial effect include the release of feel-good hormones when milk is produced. Dr Iacovou added that social or psychological factors such as feelings of \\"failing as a mother\\" were also contributing. She says the improving the health of the mother will also help the baby. Rosemary Dodds, a senior policy adviser at parenting charity NCT, said: \\"Mothers often experience pressures after the birth such as pain, shortage of sleep and anxiety. \\"Breastfeeding can help to relax mothers and reduce stress, so it might play a part in preventing mental health issues developing. \\"We welcome further research into this subject as perinatal mental health is a huge issue for many mothers.

The museum, the tallest of the three buildings, will hold exhibition space, public spaces, offices and education and meeting rooms, according to the Obama Foundation. The forum and library buildings are intended to be used for study and foundation programming. Obama said his foundation, which is overseeing the project, is also looking into the possibility of locating a Chicago Public Library branch on the site. Obama said he envisioned recording studios where musicians could help young people work on music, and space for movie directors who could take on community storytelling. The center will also have exhibits with campaign memorabilia and personal artifacts. \\"Let's face it, we want to see Michelle's dresses,\\" the former president joked.

Not only can continuous use of an air conditioner lead to high energy bills, but it can also be detrimental to the environment. Fortunately, there are several easy and cost-effective techniques that can help you keep your living space comfortable while reducing your reliance on air conditioning. In this article, we'll discuss four effective tips: closing blinds or curtains, turning off heat-producing devices and lights, decluttering your living space, and opening windows strategically. 1. Close Your Blinds or Curtains The first step to maintain a cooler home is to close your blinds or curtains to block out sunlight. Sunlight can quickly heat up your indoor space as it penetrates through your windows. By blocking out this light, you significantly reduce the amount of heat that enters your home. Especially during the hottest parts of the day, it's crucial to have your blinds and curtains closed to maintain a comfortable temperature. 2. Turn Off Unnecessary Devices, Appliances, and Lights Many devices, appliances, and lights in your home can emit heat even when not in use. To keep your home cool, consider turning off and unplugging any unnecessary heat-producing items. For instance, avoid using heat-producing appliances like ovens and stoves during the hottest time of the day and opt for alternative cooking methods. Additionally, switching off lights when not needed can significantly contribute to reducing your indoor temperature, as light bulbs generate heat when in use. 3. Declutter Your Living Space A cluttered living space not only looks untidy but can also trap heat. Clearing clutter allows for better air circulation and makes your home feel more spacious, which in turn contributes to a cooler atmosphere. Regularly organizing your living space helps maintain a comfortable environment during warm summer months. 4. Utilize Windows Strategically Another effective way to cool your home without air conditioning is by strategically opening and closing windows. During cooler hours, such as in the early morning or late evening, open windows to allow fresh air to flow through your home. This natural ventilation helps reduce indoor temperatures. However, during the hottest parts of the day, keep your windows closed to trap the cooler air inside. Additionally, closing off other rooms in the house that are not in use can further help maintain a cool temperature in the areas you frequent most. Conclusion While air conditioning may be a convenient way to stay cool during hot summer days, it's worth noting that it comes with both financial and environmental costs. Implementing these simple techniques, such as closing your blinds or curtains, turning off heat-producing devices and lights, decluttering your living space, and strategically opening and closing windows, can go a long way in maintaining a comfortable living environment while reducing your energy consumption and environmental footprint. So, this summer, give these methods a try and enjoy a cooler home without relying solely on air conditioning."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Context: If you visited the Getty Center in July or early August, you may have encountered a group of high school students wearing white lab coats with “Teen Lab” splattered across the back. You might have spotted them testing kinetic sculptures made from recycled materials, sketching in front of artworks in the galleries, or taking Polaroid self-portraits inspired by David Hockney’s photocollages. Online, you may have seen the playful social media stories they created to share their experiments with artistic and scientific processes. The teens were participants in the Getty Teen Lab, a four-week paid internship for high school students. Supported by a generous grant from the Vera R. Campbell Foundation, Teen Lab was the first of several teen-focused initiatives that the J. Paul Getty Museum is launching in 2017 and 2018. The Getty’s Education Department developed Teen Lab in response to several seemingly disconnected questions that many art museums are grappling with today: How can we engage diverse youth in meaningful ways? How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning? To address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2) The Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content. In keeping with this goal, we designed the program using the project-based learning approach, which develops skills and knowledge by inviting students to explore solutions to authentic, real-world problems.

Google News’ experiment with the Friends section also comes at a time when news consumption is beginning to see a shift to personalized social news streams. A March 2010 Pew Internet study revealed that 75% of those who get their news online receive information via forwarded e-mails or posts on social networking sites. About 52% wind up sharing news with others via those very means. It will be interesting to see if this new social layer will catch on in Google News.

At a tombstone, he falls to his knees with emotion. The scene then shifts to the morning of June 6, 1944, as American soldiers land on Omaha Beach as part of the Normandy Invasion. They suffer heavy losses in assaulting fortified German defensive positions. Captain Miller of the 2nd Ranger Battalion leads a breakout from the beach. Elsewhere on the beach, a dead soldier lies face-down in the bloody surf; his pack is stenciled Ryan, S. In Washington, D.C., at the U.S. War Department, General George Marshall learns that three of the four sons of the Ryan family were killed in action and that the fourth son, James, is with the 101st Airborne Division somewhere in Normandy. After reading Abraham Lincoln's Bixby letter aloud, Marshall orders Ryan brought home. Three days after D-Day, Miller receives orders to find Ryan and bring him back. He chooses seven men from his company—T/Sgt. Horvath, Privates First Class Reiben and Caparzo, Privates Mellish and Jackson, T/4 medic Wade—plus T/5 Upham, an interpreter from headquarters. They move out to Neuville, where they meet a squad of the 101st engaged against the enemy. Caparzo is killed by a German sniper who is then killed by Jackson. They locate a Private James Ryan but he is not the right one. From passing soldiers, Miller learns that Ryan is defending an important bridge in Ramelle. Near Ramelle, Miller decides to neutralize a German machine gun position at a derelict radar station, despite his men's misgivings. Wade is killed in the skirmish. At Upham's urging, Miller declines to execute a surviving German soldier, and sets him free. Losing confidence in Miller's leadership, Reiben declares his intention to desert, prompting a confrontation with Horvath.

Answer:","output":"When the USS Pueblo was captured by North Korea, Lyndon B. Johnson was the President of the United States. Lyndon B. Johnson, the 36th President, served from November 22, 1963, to January 20, 1969, after taking office upon the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The incident involving the USS Pueblo occurred on January 23, 1968. The USS Pueblo was an intelligence-gathering ship (technically, a Banner-class environmental research ship), which was conducting a mission in the Sea of Japan, near the North Korean coast. It was gathering intelligence to monitor North Korean naval activity and gather information on the country's electronic and communication systems. On the day of the capture, North Korean naval forces approached the USS Pueblo, claiming that the ship had entered their territorial waters, and ordered it to surrender. The ship's captain, Commander Lloyd M. Bucher, insisted that the USS Pueblo was operating in international waters and attempted to evade capture. However, the North Koreans opened fire, badly damaging the ship and wounding several crew members. Ultimately, Commander Bucher was forced to surrender the ship to prevent further loss of life. The capture of the USS Pueblo led to a significant crisis in U.S.-North Korean relations. President Lyndon B. Johnson faced a difficult situation, as he had to carefully balance his response to the crisis without risking an escalation of the ongoing conflict in Vietnam. At the same time, he was under considerable domestic pressure to secure the release of the captive crew and safely return the ship to the United States. After 11 months of negotiations, the United States and North Korea finally reached an agreement to release the 82 surviving crew members in December 1968. In exchange for their release, the United States issued a formal apology and admitted to spying on North Korea, albeit with a statement from the State Department expressing that the apology did not represent the true stance of the U.S. government. The crew members were allowed to cross the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) from North Korea to South Korea on December 23, 1968. It's important to note that the USS Pueblo itself was never returned to the United States and remains in North Korean possession to this day. The ship has been put on display as a museum and propaganda piece in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. In conclusion, Lyndon B. Johnson was the President of the United States at the time of the USS Pueblo capture by North Korea in 1968. The incident marked a significant moment of tension between the U.S. and North Korea during the Cold War and serves as a reminder of the delicate balance of international diplomacy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If I tell you that Mutagenic chemicals may change the structure of a nucleotide, and ask you the question \\"what may change the structure of a nucleotide?\\", is the correct answer \\"oxidation reaction\\"? Choose your answer from:  A). Yes;  B). No; Answer:","output":"B). No; While an oxidation reaction can indeed change the structure of a nucleotide, your original statement specifically mentioned \\"Mutagenic chemicals\\" as the agents responsible for altering the nucleotide structure. Mutagenic chemicals are substances that cause mutations in DNA by changing the structure of nucleotides. These chemicals can be found in various sources, such as cigarette smoke, ultraviolet radiation, or certain types of chemotherapy drugs. When a mutagenic chemical comes into contact with DNA, it has the potential to modify the nucleotide, ultimately leading to a genetic mutation. Oxidation reactions, on the other hand, involve the gain of oxygen or the loss of electrons in a molecule. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during normal cellular metabolism or from external sources can cause the oxidation of DNA molecules, leading to the alteration of nucleotide structure. This could result in DNA damage and potential mutations. Examples of oxidation reactions that cause DNA damage include the formation of 8-oxoguanine from guanine or the conversion of 2-deoxyribose to 2-ketodeoxyribose. While oxidation reactions can cause changes to a nucleotide's structure, they should not be confused with the original statement specifying mutagenic chemicals as the cause. So, the correct answer to your question is \\"No\\" because mutagenic chemicals were originally mentioned as the agents changing the structure of a nucleotide, whereas oxidation reactions are a separate process that can also lead to changes in nucleotide structure."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Crocodiles  A crocodile mother puts a lot of time and effort into raising her babies. She starts by building a nest  , which she guards for over two months! When the eggs are ready to hatch, the young crocs call out to their mother, who digs them out and helps them hatch. She then carries them in her mouth down to the water, where she will guard them for several more weeks or months until they learn to hunt on their own. Bats   Bats become moms by hanging head up in a cave, giving birth. Catching the youngster before it can fall to the ground below, she puts it in a pouch  . Bat moms may carry babies with them when feeding for the first few days. As the little bats get bigger and heavier, moms help them hang on the wall of their caves and return often to feed them.

He looked at the ugly square buildings around him, and he did not like what he saw. He wondered why people built ugly homes, when they could have beautiful ones.     Frank Lloyd Wright lived from 1869 to 1959. When he was young, there were no courses in architecture, so he went to work in an architect's office in order to learn how to design buildings. Soon he was designing buildings that were beautiful.     He also wanted to make his buildings fit into the land around them. One of the houses he designed is on top of a high hill. Other people built tall, square houses on hills, but Wright did not want to lose the beauty of the hill. He built the house low and wide.

The corridor windows at the Hangzhou Entel Foreign Language School look a bit different from other schools. They are all decorated with beautiful paper cutting art. But they are not just for decoration. They are also to stop birds from flying into windows. Chen Zitong, 14, a Junior 3 student at the school came up with the idea. In early January, she wrote a letter to the headmaster and suggested this. She often saw birds fly into the clean windows and get hurt. After some online research, she found this solution. \\"Some people decorated windows with stickers or posters. Then I thought of replacing them with our traditional paper cutting art,\\" Chen said. To Chen's surprise, the headmaster took her advice. The school organized a paper cutting art competition. Students' works that got awards were pasted on the corridor windows. In fact, there have been paper cutting art classes since 2011. \\"We have classes once a week for a month to teach paper cutting,\\" said Fan Ming, an art teacher.

Select from: [-] yes; [-] it is not possible to tell; [-] no;","output":"[-] no; The statement \\"Cramond is located inland with no access to water.\\" is not true based on the provided premise. In the premise, it is clearly stated that present-day Cramond, where the Romans constructed a fort in the second century a.d., is located at the mouth of the River Almond. This signifies that Cramond is situated close to where the river meets the sea, providing access to water. Additionally, it's mentioned that the fort is on the eastern end of the Antonine Wall, a defensive structure built by the Romans. This Wall, which stretched from east to west across what is now Scotland, was built to defend the Roman Empire's frontiers. The defensive wall further implies that Cramond's strategic position was considered significant, perhaps, in part, due to its location at the mouth of the River Almond. Furthermore, by being located at the mouth of a river and next to a defensive wall, Cramond would have had access to both fresh water and transportation routes, which would have been essential for supporting the Roman garrison stationed at the fort. Rivers have always played an important role in the development of settlements and the transportation of people and goods due to their natural navigation capabilities. In conclusion, based on the premise given, we can confidently state that Cramond is not located inland with no access to water. Instead, it is positioned at the mouth of the River Almond, which provides access to water and may have had significant strategic importance during Roman times."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"While the word \\"good\\" can be considered a valid answer in the sense that it conveys a positive attribute about Aubrey, it does not provide a detailed and comprehensive description of her character or her actions in the given scenario.  In the context of the situation provided, where Aubrey's family was going to go fishing and she was unsure if she wanted to join but ultimately did, it is more appropriate to describe her with more specific adjectives or phrases that better reflect her actions and emotions. For example, you can describe Aubrey as: 1. Open-minded: Aubrey may not have been initially interested in fishing, but she decided to give it a try and embrace the experience alongside her family. 2. Family-oriented: She made an effort to participate in a family activity despite her personal hesitations, which shows that she values spending time with her loved ones. 3. Adaptable: Although she wasn't sure if she wanted to go fishing, Aubrey was able to adjust her plans and participate in the activity. This suggests that she is flexible and can adapt to different situations. 4. Courageous: It takes a certain level of bravery to step out of one's comfort zone and try something new.

Here is the premise:  Margaret Thatcher was embarrassed that Janet would think that she was going to ask her how she was going to vote, and it was so funny.

This premise suggests that Margaret Thatcher experienced a moment of embarrassment and was regarded as having acted dumb by Janet and, to some extent, by her husband. The scene is somewhat lighthearted, as it was funny. Now, let's look at the hypothesis:  Margaret Thatcher showed no concern. The hypothesis indicates a complete lack of concern on Margaret Thatcher's part, which contradicts the emotional state described in the premise, where she experienced embarrassment. To say that someone is embarrassed implies that they are, to some degree, concerned about the situation or at least their perceived appearance or judgment. Given the information provided in the premise, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true.

Article: When you were young, ginger ale may have been a popular choice for reducing the unpleasant feelings caused by your upset stomach on the road to get to school. For years, ginger has been used to reduce the effects of nausea . But do you know it's now also being looked at to fight cancer? Scientists have discovered that ginger can kill cancerous cells in two different ways. On the one hand, ginger causes the cancer cells to \\"commit suicide\\" by destroying themselves while leaving the surrounding healthy cells untouched. Ginger can prevent the growth of diseased cells by destroying the environment they grow in. On the other hand, ginger tricks the diseased cells and causes them to fight among themselves. Researchers are now looking into one of the toughest cancers to fight. However, scientists find repeated treatment of disease by drugs can actually lose its effectiveness over time as the cancer builds up resistance to the same treatment. This raises researchers' confidence that ginger would help stop resistance from the cancer. In a study, the cancer clearly stopped growing in the body of the mice that had been given ginger. The bad news is that such encouraging research has only been conducted on mice. The good news, however, is that it seems humans might be able to get the same benefit just by eating products with ginger and ginger root in them. Cancer prevention and fighting abilities aren't the only potential benefits you may get from adding a bit more ginger to your diet. Drinking ginger ale when your stomach was upset as a child wasn't just a placebo .Numerous studies and research, including the Mayo Clinic's strict grading system, agree that ginger has some sort of anti-nausea characteristics. Some believe that ginger works well against nausea after operations, while others use it to reduce motion sickness such as seasickness and car sickness. The Mayo Clinic, however, advises the use of ginger only to reduce nausea during pregnancy. While more research needs to be done, early studies are very promising,... Question: Why do scientists think ginger can be used to fight against cancer? Answer: Answer:","output":"Scientists think ginger can be used to fight against cancer because it has been found to kill cancerous cells in two different ways. First, ginger causes cancer cells to \\"commit suicide\\" by destroying themselves while leaving the surrounding healthy cells untouched. Second, ginger tricks the diseased cells and causes them to fight among themselves. Additionally, ginger can prevent the growth of diseased cells by destroying their environment. These properties may help stop resistance from cancer, which is often an issue with repeated treatment by drugs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Interestingly, Marañón found that most of these patients felt something but in the absence of an actual emotion-evoking stimulus, the patients were unable to interpret their physiological arousal as an experienced emotion. Schachter did agree that physiological reactions played a big role in emotions. He suggested that physiological reactions contributed to emotional experience by facilitating a focused cognitive appraisal of a given physiologically arousing event and that this appraisal was what defined the subjective emotional experience. Emotions were thus a result of two-stage process: general physiological arousal, and experience of emotion. For example, the physiological arousal, heart pounding, in a response to an evoking stimulus, the sight of a bear in the kitchen. The brain then quickly scans the area, to explain the pounding, and notices the bear. Consequently, the brain interprets the pounding heart as being the result of fearing the bear. With his student, Jerome Singer, Schachter demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine. Subjects were observed to express either anger or amusement depending on whether another person in the situation (a confederate) displayed that emotion. Hence, the combination of the appraisal of the situation (cognitive) and the participants' reception of adrenaline or a placebo together determined the response. This experiment has been criticized in Jesse Prinz's (2004) Gut Reactions.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The work that condemns the experiment mentioned in the context is Jesse Prinz's (2004) book \\"Gut Reactions.\\" In the book, Prinz criticizes Stanley Schachter and Jerome Singer's experiment where they demonstrated that subjects can have different emotional reactions despite being placed into the same physiological state with an injection of epinephrine.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Not so fast: No need to point blame for tire issues in Fontana Updated MAR 24, 2014 7:13p ET After such a tremendous race last year at Auto Club Speedway and then a terrific Nationwide race on Saturday, you wondered just how the Cup race was going to measure up. I have to say it sure didn't let us down. I hated that there were tire issues that had a bearing on the outcome of the race but, regardless of that, we just had some really hard racing all day long on Sunday. Sure, it might have been a battle for 10th place but it seemed at one point it were 15-20 drivers all fighting for that one spot. Seriously, it looked like a pack you would see at Daytona or Talladega at times. So two years in a row tells me they have the racing just the way we like it there at Auto Club Speedway. I think once we saw that the tire failures Friday and Saturday that were confined to certain organizations, and after talking to Goodyear, I had a comfort level that it really was some of the race teams stepping across the line with some setup things. However, when you see something like 20 issues as we did on Sunday during the race, well now everybody needs to be looking at everything across the board. I don't think we can point our finger solely at Goodyear, the race track, the teams, etc. and, actually, I don't think we need to be pointing our finger at anybody. I just think collectively we all need to take a look at it. Now, if I was dubbed the 'NASCAR King for a Day,' what would I do first to rectify this problem? I know one thing I wouldn't do and that would be to not touch that race track. We don't need to take the bumps out. We don't need to repave it. We need to leave that track surface alone. We don't need to lose what we have there. If we go back to last year's race again, I would wager this tire was right near the edge of durability then. So I think if you spin things ahead to this year and the elimination of the ride height rule and the aggressive setup these teams were now taking, it was just too much for the current tire configuration. Remember, too, that this car has a lot more downforce than last year's car. The corner speeds are way up. The loads this poor tire goes through, well I think we really found the edge with this tire and probably crossed it this past weekend. Now sure, if you look at nine of the top 10 finishers Sunday, they were the ones that didn't have a tire issue. Again, I just think what was expected of the tire this year was already right at the threshold and unfortunately some teams stepped over that threshold. Summary:","output":"In this news article, the author discusses the tire issues that occurred during a NASCAR race at the Auto Club Speedway in Fontana in 2014. Despite the tire failures having an impact on the outcome of the race, the event featured intense racing with multiple drivers fighting for position throughout the day. The author opines that there is no need to place blame on any one party like Goodyear, the track, or the teams, and instead urges everyone to collectively examine the issue. The author also insists on maintaining the track as-is, without making any changes to the bumps or repaving the surface. They highlight the fact that although the current tire configuration was likely near its durability limit in the previous year's race, the elimination of the ride height rule and more aggressive setups used in the 2014 race might have pushed the tires beyond their limits. The article concludes by noting that nine of the top 10 finishers who didn't face tire issues seemed to understand the limitations of the tire configuration, suggesting that teams should be cautious of pushing the tires beyond their threshold in the future."},{"instruction":"Question: He had a 12\\" Sony black-and-white, tuned to MTV, sitting on a chair at the end of the bed.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  A rate is a measure of how some property varies with time. Speed is a familiar rate that expresses the distance traveled by an object in a given amount of time. Wage is a rate that represents the amount of money earned by a person working for a given amount of time. Likewise, the rate of a chemical reaction is a measure of how much reactant is consumed, or how much product is produced, by the reaction in a given amount of time. The rate of reaction is the change in the amount of a reactant or product per unit time. Reaction rates are therefore determined by measuring the time dependence of some property that can be related to reactant or product amounts. Rates of reactions that consume or produce gaseous substances, for example, are conveniently determined by measuring changes in volume or pressure. For reactions involving one or more colored substances, rates may be monitored via measurements of light absorption. For reactions involving aqueous electrolytes, rates may be measured via changes in a solution’s conductivity. For reactants and products in solution, their relative amounts (concentrations) are conveniently used for purposes of expressing reaction rates. If we measure the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, in an aqueous solution, we find that it changes slowly over time as the H2O2 decomposes, according to the equation: 2H 2 O 2(aq) ⟶ 2H 2 O(l) + O 2(g) The rate at which the hydrogen peroxide decomposes can be expressed in terms of the rate of change of its concentration, as shown here: change in concentration of reactant time interval ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ − ⎣H 2 O 2⎦ t ⎣H 2 O 2⎦ t 1 2 = − t2 − t1.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: He's out there somewhere, an instant icon in the records of American conflict, the final big-game hunter. But a puzzle, too, his identity would be kept a secret for now, and maybe forever. He is the unknown shooter. The nameless, faceless triggerman who put a bullet in the head of the world's most notorious terrorist, Bin Laden. He's likely between the ages of 26 and 33, says Marcinko, founder of the \\"SEALs Team 6\\" that many believe led the attack on Bin Laden in Abbottabad, Pakistan. He'll be old enough to have had time to hurdle the extra training tests required to join the counter-terrorism unit, yet young enough to stand the body-punishing harshness of the job. The shooter's a man, it's safe to say, because there are no women in the SEALs. And there's a good chance he's white, though the SEALs have stepped up efforts to increase the number of minorities in their ranks, Marcinko and Smith say. He was probably a high school or college athlete, Smith says, a physical specimen who combines strength, speed and wisdom. \\"They call themselves 'tactical athletes,'\\" says Smith, who works with many future SEALs in his Heroes of Tomorrow training program in Severna Park. \\"It's getting very scientific.\\" Marcinko puts it in more conventional terms: \\"He'll be ripped,\\" says the author of the best-selling autobiography \\"Rogue Warrior.\\"\\"He's got a lot of upper-body strength. Long arms. Thin waist. Flat stomach.\\" On this point, Greitens departs a bit. \\"You can't make a lot of physical assumptions,\\" says the author of \\"The Heart and the Fist: The Education of a Humanitarian, the Making of a Navy SEAL.\\" There are SEALs who are 5 feet 4 and SEALs who are 6 feet 5, Greitens says. In his training group, he adds, there were college football boys who couldn't hack it; those who survived were most often men in good shape, but they also had a willingness to show their concerns in favor of the mission. The shooter's probably not the crew-cut , neatly shaven ideal we've come to expect from American fighting forces. \\"He's bearded,...

Determine the sentiment: This animation has a very simple and straightforward good vs. evil plot and is all about action. What sets it apart from other animation is how well the human movements are animated. It was really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around, her movements were done so well. Why don't they use this rotoscopic technique more these days? It's quite effective. Fire and Ice, in it's prehistoric setting and scarcely dressed women, was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy ways, her voluptuous body serving as pure eyecandy. Some may hate this and regard it as yet another moronic male sexual fantasy, others (including plenty of women) will adore it's esthetic quality. I for sure did not mind! Bakshi just loves animating lushious, voluptuous babes, as can also be seen in Cool World, and I don't think he has to apoligize since it's pretty much animation for adults. But I had also enjoyed this animation as a child and I never forgot it. This one was just special, so different from the standard Disney or Anime fare, and for that reason alone well worth the watch since it's possibly Bakshi's finest. For those who like animations with lushious women: try Space Adventure Cobra as well. I give Fire and Ice 8 out of 10.","output":"The sentiment expressed in this review is predominantly positive. The reviewer praises the animation's human movements, particularly the rotoscopic technique, and appreciates the uniqueness and deviation from standard Disney or Anime fare.

A media critic calls the photo \\"profit-motive journalism at its worst\\" The image shows a man moments before he's struck by a subway train. Article:","output":"Title: The Ethical Dilemma in Capturing a Tragic Moment: The Story of a Photographer and a Subway Accident Introduction:  The role of a photographer in documenting real-life incidents is often fraught with ethical concerns. Sometimes, capturing the harsh reality of a situation demands a judgment call, weighing the potential impact of an image against the emotional consequences for the individuals involved. One such incident that sparked widespread debate was when a man was struck by a subway train, and a photographer decided to immortalize the tragic moment. Step One: Introduce the Photographer's Perspective and the Incident The New York Post-featured photographer, who captured the heart-wrenching image of Mr. Han moments before being hit by a subway train, later shared his side of the story in an article. He admits, \\"I had no idea what I was shooting,\\" when he started clicking away to document the unfolding tragedy. While some may argue the photographer's actions as unfeeling or callous, it is essential to consider his perspective – being thrust into a life-or-death situation with little time for introspection. Step Two: Analyze the Public Reaction The publication of the photo, later dubbed \\"profit-motive journalism at its worst,\\" led to a media critic condemning the decision to share such a harrowing image. For many, the photo represented an invasion of privacy and voyeurism that disregarded the victim's dignity. The public's reaction underscored the delicate balance that photographers must strike when choosing to represent tragedy and human suffering. Step Three: Discuss the Ethical Dilemmas of Profit-Motive Journalism The term \\"profit-motive journalism at its worst\\" highlights the primary concern for many; the idea that news outlets prioritize financial gains over ethical considerations is disheartening. In this case, the photographer was accused of exploiting a tragic situation for monetary gain, which raises questions about the moral responsibility of media outlets and individuals capturing and sharing such images. Step Four: Reflect on the Lookout for the Well-Being of Involved Individuals Had the photographer known the gravity of the situation, he admitted that he would have advised Mr. Han to \\"run the other direction.\\" This statement emphasizes the importance of prioritizing the well-being and safety of others before documenting incidents. It is a critical lesson for photographers when making decisions in the spur of the moment and assessing the potential consequences of their actions. Conclusion:  The debate surrounding the photograph of Mr. Han's tragic brush with death raises essential questions about the ethical responsibilities of photographers and media outlets in documenting real-life incidents. While it is crucial to recognize the value of representing harsh realities, it is equally important to ensure the dignity and safety of those involved. Ultimately, this incident serves as a reminder of the delicate balance between capturing the truth and honoring the humanity of the subjects whose stories are being told."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Doctors at Bellevue Hospital are so busy caring for Ebola patient Dr Craig Spencer that they have begun transferring patients out of the intensive care unit to nearby NYU Langone Medical Center. Bellevue, one of the the most respected hospitals in the nation, is treating its first ever case of Ebola after Dr Craig Spencer arrived at the hospital last week with symptoms of the disease. Until Monday night, doctors were also concerned that Bronx boy who has recently been to Africa also had Ebola. He was isolated and treated with the same level of protection as if the disease was confirmed. Overwhelmed: Bellevue Hospital until Monday night was treating two patients that doctors suspected of having Ebola. One of the patient, a 5-year-old, has since tested negative. NYU Langone medical center is taking four ICU patients from Bellevue so that doctors at the public hospital can focus on Ebola patient Dr Craig Spencer. Ebola tests came back negative and doctors are now saying that he is likely suffering from a respiratory infection. The hospital sent two adult ICU patients to NYU Langone over the weekend and staff are preparing to send two children in the ICU to the hospital, as well, WCBS-TV reports. A spokesman said the transfers are meant to free up staff so that they can concentrate on caring for Dr Spencer, who is listed in serious conditions as he fights the deadly disease. Dr Spencer contracted Ebola while working for Doctors Without Borders in Guinea and did not begin experiencing symptoms until after he had returned home to New York. Public health officials have stressed that Bellevue, America's oldest public hospital, is fully equipped to handle Ebola cases. Dr Craig Spencer contracted Ebola while working for Doctors Without Borders in Guinea. The hospital has 1,200 beds and boasts 1,800 doctors and a staff of 5,500 workers. Dr Spencer is the first American who is not being treated at one of three hospitals with special infectious disease isolation units. Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in America, was treated at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital and later died. The two nurses he infected were transferred to specialized hospitals for treatment and both have since recovered. Seven Americans have been treated for Ebola so far and all have now recovered from the disease. Five were treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. Two were treated at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Lincoln and nurse Nina Pham was treated at National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.

It may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil, and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or playground structures. In North America, many parks have fields for playing sports such as soccer, baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball. Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Often, the smallest parks are in urban areas, where a park may take up only a city block or less. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills. Parks have differing rules regarding whether dogs can be brought into the park: some parks prohibit dogs; some parks allow them with restrictions (e.g., use of a leash); and some parks, which may be called \\"dog parks\\", permit dogs to run off-leash.  - The Potomac River is located along the mid-Atlantic Ocean coast of the United States and flows into the Chesapeake Bay.

''  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - The George Washington Memorial Parkway, colloquially the G.W. Parkway, is a parkway that runs along the south bank of the Potomac River from Mount Vernon, Virginia, northwest to Langley, Virginia, and is maintained by the National Park Service (NPS). It is located almost entirely within Virginia, except for a short portion of the parkway northwest of the Arlington Memorial Bridge that passes over Columbia Island within the District of Columbia.  - Maryland is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east. The state's largest city is Baltimore, and its capital is Annapolis. Among its occasional nicknames are \\"Old Line State\\", the \\"Free State\\", and the \\"Chesapeake Bay State\\". The state is named after Henrietta Maria of France, the wife of Charles I of England.   - A boat is a watercraft of a large range of sizes designed to float, plane, work or travel on water. Small boats are typically found on inland waterways (e.g., rivers and lakes) or in protected coastal areas. However, boats such as the whaleboat were designed for operation from a ship in an offshore environment. In naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard another vessel (a ship). Another less restrictive definition is a vessel that can be lifted out of the water. Some definitions do not make a distinction in size, as bulk freighters long on the Great Lakes are called oreboats. For reasons of naval tradition, submarines are usually referred to as 'boats' rather than 'ships', regardless of their size and shape. Ships are generally distinguished from boats based on their larger size, shape and cargo or passenger capacity.   - Delaware is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeastern regions of the United States. It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland, to the northeast by New Jersey, and to the north by Pennsylvania. The state takes its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - A census-designated place (CDP) is a concentration of population defined by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes only. CDPs have been used in each decennial census since 1980 as the counterparts of incorporated places, such as cities, towns, and villages for the purposes of gathering and correlating statistical data. CDPs are populated areas that generally include one officially designated but currently unincorporated small community, for which the CDP is named, plus surrounding inhabited countryside of varying dimensions and, occasionally, other, smaller unincorporated communities as well. CDPs include small rural communities, colonias located along the U.S. border with Mexico, and unincorporated resort and retirement communities and their environs.  - Canals and navigations are human-made channels for water conveyance (supply), or to service water transport vehicles. In the vernacular, both are referred to as 'canals', and in most cases, the engineered works will have a series of dams and locks that create areas of low speed current flow. These areas are referred to as\\" 'slack water levels',\\" often just called 'levels'. The main difference between them is that a navigation parallels a river and shares part of its waters, its drainage basin and leverages its resources by building dams and locks to increase and lengthen its long stretches of \\"deep enough\\" slack water levels while staying in its valley. In contrast, a canal cuts across a drainage divide atop a ridge (however humble), generally requiring an external water source above the highest elevation. Many canals have been built at elevations towering over valleys and others water ways crossing far below. Cities need a lot of fresh water and many canals with sources of water at a higher level can deliver water to a destination where there is a lack of water. The Roman Empire's Aqueducts were such water supply canals.  - Charles I (19 November 1600  30 January 1649) was monarch of the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649.  - Great Falls Park is a small National Park Service (NPS) site in Virginia, United States. Situated on 800 acres (3.65 km) along the banks of the Potomac River in northern Fairfax County, the park is a disconnected but integral part of the George Washington Memorial Parkway. The Great Falls of the Potomac River are near the northern boundary of the park, as are the remains of the Patowmack Canal, the first canal in the United States that used locks to raise and lower boats.  - The Chesapeake Bay is an estuary lying inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and surrounded by the North American mainland to the west, and the Delmarva Peninsula to the east. It is the largest such body in the contiguous United States. The northern bay is within Maryland, the southern portion within Virginia, and is a very important feature for the ecology and economy of those two states, as well as others. More than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the bay's drainage basin, which covers parts of six states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia) plus all of the District of Columbia.

(B) Spend too much    The context does mention that the seats are expensive, but there's not enough information to assume Skylar will spend too much or not be able to manage her expenses. So, this option is not correct.    (C) Go into debt    Considering Skylar had to get a credit card to afford the seats, it is more likely that she might go into debt if she cannot pay back the credit card bill on time.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first initial of the person who didn't believe the story that Cocteau gave about the group taking a cab? from the following article ?  At that time, a Parisian ballet audience typically consisted of two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would be expecting to see a traditional performance with beautiful music, and a \\"Bohemian\\" group who, the poet-philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted, would \\"acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes\\". Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions   began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: \\"Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on\\". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with the intervention of the police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. The unrest receded significantly during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final \\"Sacrificial Dance\\" was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.Among the more hostile press reviews was that of Le Figaro's critic, Henri Quittard, who called the work \\"a laborious and puerile barbarity\\" and added \\"We are sorry to see an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure\\". On the other hand, Gustav Linor, writing in the leading theatrical magazine Comoedia, thought the performance was superb, especially that of Maria Piltz; the disturbances, while deplorable, were merely \\"a rowdy debate\\" between two ill-mannered factions. Emile Raudin, of Les Marges, who had barely heard the music, wrote: \\"Couldn't we ask M. Astruc ... to set aside one performance for well-intentioned spectators? ... We could at least propose to evict the female element\\". The composer Alfredo Casella thought that the demonstrations were aimed at Nijinsky's choreography rather than at the music, a view shared by the critic Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi, who...

Article: Meditation is the key to changing how your mind works and will allow you to travel the path to nirvana. It should be a part of your everyday life. While you can learn to meditate on your own, a teacher can help guide you and apply proper techniques. You can meditate alone, but it is helpful to meditate with other people and under the guidance of a teacher. You cannot travel the path without meditating.  Meditation will help you better understand yourself and the world. The Buddhist teachings (i.e. The Four Noble Truths) are the lens that you view the world through. If you are unable to accept the teachings, you will not be able to follow the other steps in the path. The right view and the right understanding is the foundation of  the path.  See the world as it really is and not as you would like for it to be. You seek to understand reality completely and through an objective lens. This requires you to examine, study, and learn.  The Four Noble Truths are the basis of the right understanding.  You must believe that those truths describe things as they really are.  Nothing is perfect or permanent.  Think critically about situations instead of inserting your personal feelings, desires, and concerns. Commit yourself to developing an attitude that is line with your belief system.  Act as if all life is equal and deserves to be treated with compassion and love. This applies to yourself and to others. Reject thoughts that are selfish, violent, and hateful.  Love and non-violence should should be the rule. Show regard for all living things (e.g. plants, animals, and people) regardless of their status.  For example, you would treat a wealthy person and poor person with the same respect. People from all backgrounds, age groups, races, ethnicity, economic groups should be treated equally. The third step is the right speech. When practicing the right speech, you do not lie, slander, gossip, or speak harshly. Instead you speak kind and truthful words. You words should affirm and uplift others.  Knowing when to be silent and holding back your words is also important. Having the right speech is something you practice every day. Your actions flow out of what is in your heart and in your mind. Treat yourself and other people well. Do not destroy life or steal.  Live a peaceful life and help other people live peaceful lives as well. Be honest when you deal with other people.  For example, you would not deceive or lie to get ahead or get something that you want. Your presence and actions should be positive and improve the lives of other people and society. Choose a profession that is in agreement with your beliefs.  Do not have a job that harms other people, involves killing animals, or cheating.  Selling weapons, drugs, or working at a slaughterhouse are not acceptable occupations. Whatever profession you choose, you must carry it out with integrity. For example, if you work in sales, you would not use deception or lies to get people to purchase your product. Putting true effort into anything that you do will lead to success. Rid your mind of negative thoughts and focus on positive thinking.  Have enthusiasm for whatever you do (e.g. school, career, friendships, hobbies etc.). You have to consistently practice having positive thoughts as this does not always come naturally. This will prepare your mind to practice mindfulness. The four tenets of right effort are:  Prevent evil and unwholesome states (sensual desire, ill will, worry, doubt, restlessness) of from arising Get rid of evil and unwholesome states that have already arisen by countering them with good thoughts, redirecting your attention to something else, or confronting the thought and investigating the source of the thought.  Produce good and wholesome states Maintain and perfect the good and wholesome states Mindfulness allows you to see reality and see things as they really are. The four foundations of mindfulness are contemplation of body, feelings, states of mind, and phenomena.  When you are mindful, you live in the moment and are open to the entire experience.  You focus on your present situation not on the future or the past.  Be attentive to your body, your feelings, your thoughts, your ideas, and everything around you.  Living in the present frees you desires from your future and past. Mindfulness also means being attentive to other people's feelings, emotions, and body. Right concentration is the ability to focus your mind on a single object and not be distracted by outside influences. Going through the other parts of the path will allow you concentrate.  Your mind will be focused and not filled with stress and anxiety.  You will have a good relationship with yourself and the world. Right concentration allows you to view something clearly and as it truly is. Concentration is similar to mindfulness.  However, when you concentrate you are not aware of all of the different sensations and feelings.  For example, if you are concentrating on an exam, you are only focused on taking the exam.  If you were practicing mindfulness during the exam, you would notice how you felt taking the exam, how the other people around you were acting, or how you were sitting during the exam. What is a summary?","output":"Meditation is a crucial aspect of the path to nirvana, allowing for a better understanding of oneself and the world. Following the Buddhist teachings, such as The Four Noble Truths, helps to develop the right view and understanding. This involves critical thinking, committing to a compassionate and loving attitude, practicing right speech, treating all life equally, and choosing a profession aligned with one's beliefs. By engaging in right effort and mindfulness, an individual focuses on the present moment and seeks to cultivate positive thoughts and actions. Finally, right concentration allows individuals to focus their minds, leading to less stress and anxiety, better relationships, and a clearer view of reality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She was only yards away from Murray’s girlfriend Kim Sears and, amid all the speculation about who will be brought in to replace Lendl, you could only wonder if she might become another significant woman in his life. Otherwise, it had been a highly impressive beginning and a fairly comprehensive end, although there were times when he should have been more aggressive, as Ivan Lendl always advised. Murray's performance displayed the results of his training, dedication, and commitment to the sport, which had been significantly influenced by Lendl's guidance over the years. Known for his aggressive play and strong work ethic, Lendl had been a driving force behind Murray's rise to the top echelons of professional tennis. His departure from the coaching box left a noticeable void, and fans were eager to see who would step up to fill those shoes. The sight of Amelie Mauresmo in the stands fueled speculation about her potential role in Murray's future. As a former Wimbledon champion herself – and one of the few women to have successfully transitioned into coaching roles at the highest level – Mauresmo would bring a wealth of experience, knowledge, and insight to Murray's team. The synergy between the two could potentially propel Murray to even greater heights, building on the strong foundation laid by Lendl. In the meantime, Murray's focus was on the task at hand: performing at his best and showcasing his skills on the world stage, proving that he could continue to dominate despite the recent changes in his coaching personnel. The match against Andrey Golubev provided an opportunity for him to display his ability to adapt and grow, taking on board the lessons learned during his time with Lendl, and integrating new ideas and techniques from the support team around him. As Murray progresses through the tournament and beyond, facing stiffer competition and ever-increasing expectations, it will be fascinating to watch how he evolves as a player and an individual. With a wealth of options available to guide him, including the likes of Mauresmo and others, the future remains bright for this talented athlete. But one thing is for sure: the influence of Ivan Lendl, and the advice he always offered, will continue to be a part of Andy Murray's story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Title: \\"Shadow's Trail\\" Step 1: Introduce the main character and setting Our story follows Detective Alex Carter, a seasoned and determined detective working in a gritty, crime-ridden urban city. He is known for his out-of-the-box thinking and dedication to bringing justice to the victims he serves. The film begins with a brief introduction to his typical day, showing him saying goodbye to his loving family and his internal struggle with maintaining a work-life balance. Step 2: Present the murder case Detective Carter is assigned to a high-profile murder case involving the gruesome death of a wealthy socialite, Vanessa Hill. Her murder initially appears to be a robbery gone wrong, but as he dives deeper into the investigation, Carter starts to suspect that there may be more at play than initially meets the eye. Step 3: Introduce key witnesses and suspects While interviewing friends and family of the victim, Detective Carter identifies three key suspects: Vanessa's deceptive husband, Mark Hill; her ambitious personal assistant, Fiona Walters; and her estranged younger brother, Jack Dawson, who has ties to a criminal underworld. As Carter interacts with these characters, we see that each has their own secrets and motives for wanting Vanessa dead. Step 4: Develop tension and unexpected leads As the investigation continues, Detective Carter faces numerous obstacles. He discovers crucial evidence that mysteriously goes missing, receives threats from unknown sources, and deals with pressure from superiors to close the case quickly. However, the persistent detective stumbles upon a piece of seemingly unrelated evidence – the victim's journal, which contains cryptic messages that lead him down a twisted and dark path. Step 5: Climactic confrontation Following the clues from Vanessa's journal, Carter identifies a secret meeting location that suggests a possible connection between the victim and a notorious organized crime boss, Victor Marino. He goes to the meeting place, only to find himself face-to-face with Victor, who reveals that Vanessa was working as an informant for Carter's own department. Victor offers Carter a choice – join forces to bring down the criminals and avenge Vanessa or become another casualty in Marino's empire. Step 6: Unveil the true murderer Detective Carter pretends to accept Victor's offer but remains committed to his pursuit of justice. In a surprising revelation, he uncovers that Fiona, Vanessa's personal assistant, was heavily in debt and manipulated the events in the hopes to gain control of Vanessa's fortune. Fiona had staged the robbery and orchestrated Vanessa's murder to cover her tracks. Step 7: Resolve the conflict In the climax of the movie, Detective Carter confronts Fiona, resulting in a tense showdown. The detective outsmarts Fiona, leading to her capture and confession. He also takes down Victor Marino's criminal organization with the invaluable information collected from his prior meeting with Victor. Step 8: Conclude the story With the case now solved, Detective Carter is hailed as a hero. The movie ends on a poignant note as Carter reflects on the haunting nature of the case and his duty to continue protecting the innocent. He also learns to prioritize his family and their love amidst the chaos and darkness of his city. The final scene features Detective Carter returning home, embracing his family, and realizing the importance of cherishing the moments he has with them."},{"instruction":"Question: what phase clinical trial new drug application?

Here is a question about this article: Air quality in Boston is generally very good: during the ten-year period 2004–2013, there were only 4 days in which the air was unhealthy for the general public, according to the EPA. What is the answer to this question: How is the air quality in Boston?","output":"The air quality in Boston can be characterized as generally very good, considering the data from the ten-year period between 2004 and 2013. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), there were only four days within this timeframe where the air quality was deemed unhealthy for the general public. This statistic indicates that Boston's air quality is typically safe and satisfactory, posing little to no significant health risks for its inhabitants. Several factors contribute to the positive air quality in Boston. First, the city's location on the East Coast and its coastal climate play a role in producing cleaner air, as ocean breezes can help disperse pollutants and lower overall concentrations. Additionally, Massachusetts has implemented various air quality regulations and initiatives, which support efforts to reduce air pollution across the state, including in Boston. Some of these measures include strict emissions standards for vehicles, the adoption of cleaner fuels, and investing in public transportation infrastructure to decrease the number of private vehicles on the road. Furthermore, the city of Boston has taken additional steps to improve air quality, such as promoting green building practices, focusing on energy efficiency, and encouraging the use of renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. These actions have resulted in reduced greenhouse gas emissions and other airborne pollutants. Another aspect that contributes to better air quality in the city is the presence of numerous parks and green spaces, which help to filter and absorb pollutants. Despite the overall good air quality in Boston, certain areas may still face occasional challenges, such as increased concentrations of ground-level ozone during summer months due to higher temperatures, or temporarily elevated pollutant levels from specific sources like construction activities or seasonal fluctuations. It is essential to continue monitoring air quality data and committing to sustainable practices at the state, municipal, and individual levels to maintain and improve the air quality in the Boston area moving forward. In summary, the air quality in Boston is generally very good, as shown by the ten-year period between 2004 and 2013, where only four days were deemed unhealthy for the general public. This is attributed to factors such as the city's coastal location, stringent state and local regulations, investments in clean energy, and the presence of green spaces. While occasional challenges may arise, ongoing monitoring and continued efforts to promote sustainability and clean air initiatives will help ensure that Boston's air quality remains safe and healthy for its residents and visitors."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step-by-step translation process and justification: 1. Begin with the first part of the sentence: \\"Again, we would like to avoid that and, therefore,\\". In Finnish, the word order may differ, and this phrase can be translated as: \\"Jälleen kerran haluaisimme välttää sen ja siksi\\". - \\"Again\\" can be translated to \\"jälleen kerran\\", which carries the same meaning of emphasizing repetition. - \\"We would like to\\" becomes \\"haluaisimme\\" in Finnish, which is the conditional form of the verb \\"haluta\\" (to want). - \\"avoid\\" is translated to \\"välttää\\", remaining the same in all contexts. - \\"that\\" becomes \\"sen\\" and \\"therefore\\" can be translated to \\"siksi\\". 2.

Simplify both sides of the equation: On the left-hand side (LHS), combine the constants:  c - 403 + 171 = c - 232 The equation now becomes: c - 232 = -39*c + 48 2. Add 39*c to both sides of the equation to eliminate c from the right-hand side (RHS) and isolate c terms on the LHS: c + 39*c - 232 = -39*c + 39*c + 48 Simplify: 40*c - 232 = 48 3. Add 232 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term from the LHS and isolate the c term: 40*c - 232 + 232 = 48 + 232 Simplify: 40*c = 280 4. Divide both sides of the equation by 40 to isolate c: 40*c / 40 = 280 / 40 Simplify: c = 7 So, the solution for c in the equation c - 403 + 171 = -39*c + 48 is c = 7."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Could Facebook be to blame for spread of mysterious Tourette’s-like illness? Facebook and YouTube may have helped to spread the bizarre Tourette’s-like illness that has afflicted many young girls in upstate New York, the Daily Mail reported. Doctors said that because victims in the town of LeRoy are uploading videos and pictures of themselves on social networking sites, the symptoms could be ‘reinforced and magnified.’ They think the people who watch the videos could be subconsciously copying and spreading what they see. The disease has been reported in 19 patients so far, 14 of which are girls between the ages of 13 and 18. Symptoms of the illness include uncontrollable twitching of the face and body.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? the feature-length stretch ... strains the show 's concept .","output":"The sentiment of the movie review sentence \\"the feature-length stretch ... strains the show's concept.\\" appears to be negative. To provide a detailed analysis of the sentiment, let's break down the individual elements of the statement. 1. \\"Feature-length stretch\\": This phrase implies that the movie has been elongated to cover a feature-length duration, often around 90 minutes or more. It suggests that the content has been stretched or bloated to fill a longer running time than necessary. Such a description indicates that the reviewer believes the movie might be overly long or that it could have been more concise. This adds to the negative sentiment. 2. \\"Strains\\": The word \\"strains\\" conveys a sense of difficulty or tension. In the context of this movie review, it suggests that the movie's concept is being pushed to its limits or tested. This could mean that the reviewer feels the movie does not effectively maintain the core idea, or that the concept itself is too weak to support the entire length of the film. This reinforces the negative sentiment expressed in the sentence. 3. \\"The show's concept\\": The reference to \\"the show's concept\\" indicates that the movie is likely an adaptation or extension of a pre-existing show (possibly a television show or stage production). By mentioning the concept, the reviewer is drawing attention to a potentially crucial aspect that, in their opinion, does not translate well to the feature-length format. This critique adds to the overall negative sentiment of the sentence. In conclusion, the sentiment of the movie review sentence is negative. The reviewer expresses discontent with the feature-length format, believes the concept is being strained or pushed beyond its capabilities, and feels that the movie might not be successfully carrying over the original show concept. This critical stance implies that the movie may have been a disappointment or underwhelming for the reviewer, establishing a negative sentiment in their critique."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym.  - A regnal name, or reign name, is a name used by some monarchs and popes during their reigns, and used subsequently to refer to them. The term is simply the adjective \\"regnal\\", of or relating to a reign, monarch, or kingdom, modifying \\"name\\". Since ancient times, monarchs have frequently, but not always, chosen to use a different name from their original name when they accede to the monarchy. The regnal name is usually followed by a regnal number (ordinal), usually written as a Roman numeral (VI rather than 6), to provide a unique identification for that monarch among other monarchs of that realm. In some cases, the monarch has more than one regnal name, but the regnal number is based on only one of those names, for example Charles X Gustav of Sweden, George Tupou V of Tonga. If a monarch reigns in more than one realm, he or she may carry different ordinals in each one, as they are each assigned chronologically, and some realms may have had different numbers of rulers of the same regnal name previously. For example, the same person was both King James I of England (along with Ireland) and King James VI of Scotland.

Article: \\"It hurts me more than you\\", and \\"This is for your own good\\" --these are the statements my mother used to make years ago when I had to learn Latin, clean my room, stay home and do homework. That was before we entered the permissive period in education in which we decided it was all right not to push our children to achieve their best in school. The schools and the educators made it easy for us. They taught that it was all right to be parents who take a let-alone policy. We stopped making our children do homework. We gave them calculators, turned on the television, left the teaching to the teachers and went on vacation. Now teachers, faced with children who have been developing at their own pace for the past 15 years, are realizing we've made a terrible mistake. One such teacher is Sharon Clomps who says of her students--\\"so passive\\" --and wonders what has happened. Nothing is demanded of them, she believes. Television, says Clomps, contributes to children's passivity. \\"We're talking about a generation of kids who' vet never been hurt or hungry. They have learned somebody will always do it for them, instead of saying 'go and look it up', you tell them the answer. It takes greater energy to say no to a kid.\\" Yes, it does. It takes energy and it takes work. It's time for parents to end their vacation and come back to work. It' s time to take the car away, to turn the TV off, to tell them it hurts you more than them but it' s for their own good. It's s time to start telling them no again. Question: By \\"permissive period in education\\" (L.1, Para.2) the author means a time   _  . - when children are allowed to do what they wish to - when everything can be taught at school - when every child can be educated - when children are permitted to receive education Answer:","output":"By \\"permissive period in education\\" (L.1, Para.2) the author means a time when children are allowed to do what they wish to. This refers to a period when educators and parents adopted a more lenient approach towards children, allowing them to develop at their own pace and not pushing them to achieve their best in school. As a result, children became more passive and less self-reliant, leading to the author's call for parents to take a more involved and assertive role in their upbringing."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hypothesis: Bray is the first stop on the DART. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"To evaluate whether the premise entails the hypothesis, let's first clarify the concepts involved: 1. Premise: The last stop on the DART is Bray, a seaside resort with a beach and amusement arcades. 2. Hypothesis: Bray is the first stop on the DART. The Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART) is a rapid transit railway network serving the coastline and city center of Dublin, the capital city of Ireland. The train system runs from Howth and Malahide in the north to Greystones in the south, and Bray is one of the stations located near the southern end of the line. Now, let's break down the premise and hypothesis and analyze their relationship: Premise: The statement in the premise explains that Bray is the last stop on the DART and describes it as a seaside resort with a beach and amusement arcades. This gives us information about the location of Bray in the context of the DART train system and shares some characteristics of the town. Hypothesis: The hypothesis suggests that Bray is the first stop on the DART. This statement contradicts the information provided in the premise, as it positions Bray on a completely different end of the DART train system. To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must examine if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise, meaning that it must be true if the premise is true. In this case, the premise and hypothesis present opposing information regarding Bray's position on the DART line. Since the premise states that Bray is the last stop on the DART, it cannot also be the first stop, as stated in the hypothesis. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. The two statements are conflicting, and accepting the premise as true would disprove the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Two identical planets, Norlon and Bothar, have been discovered in a neighboring galaxy of ours. These two planets have the same type of atmosphere as Earth and are extremely similar to Earth in terms of topography and even species of animals that live on them. The main difference is that Norlon is inhabited by a species very similar to humans that emit a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Bothar, however, has no such species on its planet.  But I can use this background: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  What is an answer for this question: Which new planet has a cooler atmosphere? The answer is:","output":"Bothar has a cooler atmosphere. Step 1: Analyze the information given about the two planets, Norlon and Bothar. It is mentioned that the main difference between the two planets is the presence of a species on Norlon that emits a lot of carbon dioxide, while Bothar has no such species. Step 2: Consider the background information on the dangers of global warming and its causes. The greenhouse effect, primarily caused by the release of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide, traps heat inside the Earth's atmosphere and contributes to global warming. Step 3: Apply the background information to the planets in question. Since Norlon's inhabitants emit a lot of carbon dioxide, which contributes to the greenhouse effect, it can be inferred that Norlon's atmosphere is warmer due to the presence of this greenhouse gas. Step 4: Compare the atmospheres of the two planets based on their greenhouse gas emissions. As Bothar has no species emitting carbon dioxide, its atmosphere is less affected by the greenhouse effect and is therefore cooler compared to Norlon's atmosphere. Conclusion: Bothar has a cooler atmosphere due to the absence of species emitting carbon dioxide, which contributes to the greenhouse effect and global warming."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During the interview, Corinne becomes angry and belligerent towards the reporter, eventually lashing out at her boss and getting fired.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Saying “I love you” for the first time is really scary. If you’re nervous, planning what you are going to say can boost your confidence. Think about what you want her to know, then rehearse your declaration of love. Instead of just saying \\"I love you,\\" consider going deeper. For example:  Give her reasons why you love her. Tell her when you fell in love with her. Let her know how special she is to you. Decide if you will keep it simple or make it a grand, romantic gesture. Telling someone you love them is a personal, special affair. You want the moment to be perfect. Pick a location that is private, perhaps even meaningful to your relationship, and a time that is appropriate.  Don't express your love for her in the middle of class. If you are with a group of people, pull her aside. You can plan a special date for the occasion. Take her on a walk or a picnic. Tell her during a dinner you prepared for her. In addition to preparing what you will say, you should also prepare for her response to those three little words. Ideally, she will say, “I love you too!” However, she may not feel the same way about you.  She might ignore your comment or divert the conversation to a new topic. If this happens, do not ask her, “well, do you love me too?” Be prepared to give her some time and space to digest what you said. Try to go on with the date as normal.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Following a major road victory against the Colts, the Patriots returned home to face another tough team in the Detroit Lions. The Patriots re-signed last season's star LeGarrette Blount who had been released by the Steelers earlier that week after leaving a game early. On the opening possession of the game Matthew Stafford hit Golden Tate for gains of 24 and 17 yards en route to the Patriots 34, but could only settle for a Matt Prater 48-yard field goal. Later, midway through the first quarter, the Patriots raced 64 yards in 9 plays scoring on Brady's 4-yard touchdown pass to Tim Wright. The Lions replied on their very next possession, driving 78 yards to the Patriots 2-yard line, but the Patriots and their elite red zone defense did their thing and Prater added a 20-yard field goal. It was all Patriots for the rest of the half. Danny Amendola returned the ensuing kickoff 81 yards to the Detroit 22. A 16-yard pass to LaFell and a 3-yard encroachment penalty to Ndamukong Suh moved the ball to the 3-yard line. On the very next play Blount added a 3-yard rushing touchdown, increasing the lead to 14-6. The Lions were able to drive to the Patriots 39, but were forced to punt. Taking over at their own 7, the Patriots methodically moved 93 yards in 13 plays, culminating with Brady find Wright again, for an 8-yard touchdown pass, increasing their lead to 21-6. The Lions drove to the Patriots 35 on the ensuing possession, but Prater missed a 53-yard field goal. Taking over at their own 43, the Patriots needed just four plays to reach the Lions 17 and Gostkowski closed out the half with a 35-yard field goal as they went into the locker room up 24-6. The Patriots took the opening kickoff of the half 70 yards down to the Lions 10-yard line trying to bury Detroit, but on 1st down Tom Brady was intercepted by James Ihedigbo. Like almost every possession on the day, the Lions did nothing and punted after five plays. The Patriots proceeded to march 50 yards to the Lions 25 and Gostkowski added a 43-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 27-6. After both teams swapped three-and-outs the Lions advanced to the Patriots 31, but once again settled for a Matt Prater field goal, making the score 27-9 early in the fourth quarter. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Lions reached the Patriots 25, but turned the ball over on downs after Stafford slid short 1-yard short of the first down on 4th-and-10. After making the Patriots punt, Stafford was intercepted by Logan Ryan. Starting at their own 34, the Patriots marched 66 yards in 9 plays, with LeGarrette Blount finished off the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run. The Lions looked liked a team that was mentally unprepared and lackluster early on with their offense struggling to score in the red zone and made horrific mistakes. At the end of the game, controversy brewed when a defensive lineman slapped the head of Patriots long snapper Danny Aiken, who ended up missing the Chargers game with a concussion, in the head that led to a personal foul penalty and a first down. The Patriots promptly scored on the next play with a 3-yard Blount touchdown, which angered Lions center Dominic Raiola. Raiola later took out his frustration on Patriots defensive lineman Zach Moore by punching him in the back of the helmet. Tom Brady was 38 of 53 for 349 yards 2 TDs (both to Tim Wright) and 1 INTs. LeGarrette Blount added 78 yard on 12 carries and two TDs in his return. Matthew Stafford struggled going only 18 of 46 for 264 yards 0 TDs and 1 INTs. Joique Bell added only 48 yards on 19 carries. Another reason the Lions couldn't get going, Darrelle Revis locked down vaunted receiver Calvin Johson holding him to just 4 catches for 58 yards and 0 TDs. With the win, the Patriots improved to 9-2, not only running their winning streak to 7 games, but also making it the 14th straight winning season for the Patriots.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Is world’s largest indoor farm the way of the future? By Tuan C. Nguyen July 28 A worker at the indoor lettuce farm in Japan. General Electric photo. The old SONY factory located in eastern Japan’s Miyagi Prefecture is up and running again. This time around, however, it’s been resurrected as something else entirely: an indoor farm that, at 25,000 square feet, is the largest of its kind. As is the case with other indoor farms, crops are grown in conditions that hardly resemble conventional agriculture. Here, farm workers, dressed in white lab coats and face masks, take great care in maintaining a sterile environment to ensure that the vast majority of produce are harvested in a state of optimal freshness. The humid climate inside is managed with precision and rather than using soil, the plants are raised hydroponically, a method where nutrients and fertilizer is drip-fed and absorbed through recycled water in a measured, controlled manner. But the sprawling Mirai lettuce farm has a significant edge over the rest. In interviews, Shigeharu Shimamura, a botanist who serves as the company’s president, touts that, with just 1 percent of the water that’s used for irrigation, his lettuce grows more than twice as fast as lettuce grown outdoors. This translates to an average of 10,000 heads shipped out each day. The trick, he says, is in the lighting. Designed by General Electric, the LED fixtures sitting atop each stacked row of lettuce are programmed to automatically adjust their illumination in a cycle that maximizes photosynthesis during the day and breathing at night. Compared to outdoor farms, it’s estimated that artificially accelerating the maturation process can boost crop yields by as much as 50 percent. And while indoor farms typically use florescent lighting, LEDs are much more efficient, consuming 40 percent less energy. Shimamura also says that lettuce grown on the site are healthier. Having the capability to meticulously engineer how each head is produced, allows his team to produce a variation of romaine lettuce that contains eight to 10 times more beta-carotene and two times the vitamin C, Calcium and Magnesium. “The process for growing Mirai lettuce is leaf type, and not head type, so 95 percent of the portion is edible and can used conveniently at restaurants for salads and sandwiches,” Shimamura says. “In terms of quality, since Mirai leaf lettuce is fresh and soft, they are praised by children and the elderly as easy to eat.” They also are quite tasty, he says. In a way, the company’s newest facility may serve as a working vision of things to come. Researchers have warned that, as access to arable land and fresh water supplies dwindles, commercial agricultural systems will no longer be sufficient enough to feed a rapidly rising global population that’s expected to exceed 10 billion by 2050. To remedy the situation, these experts have said, would require moving away from industry practices that have long been wasteful. For instance, while farming accounts for 70 percent of water usage, most of it is lost because of inefficient irrigation methods, according to a report by the World Water Forum. A separate report, compiled by Britain’s Institution of Mechanical Engineers, also found that roughly half of the world’s produce is discarded, partly due to an abundance of crops failing to meet market standards. Japan, on the other hand, is already home to 380 enclosed farms dedicated to raising not only high-quality lettuce, but also spinach, strawberries and other produce. Local electronics giants Fujitsu, Toshiba and Panasonic have all gotten into the game, converting some of their old factories into high-tech farms. Aiding the nationwide overhaul is the country’s current administration, which recently expanded its subsidy and assistance program for those working on “advanced agriculture” projects, like the one undertaken by Mirai. “Early tests showed that using LED for growing vegetables works, but the kinds of challenges we would face for using it in a large scale factory was still unknown,” Shimamura says. “The Japanese government (Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) supported us, trusting the proven test data.” One drawback is that fruits and vegetables grown at high-tech facilities tend to be significantly more expensive. A comparison by the Wall Street Journal found that a head of lettuce from a factory can retail for three times as much as other options. But now, with a system that results in higher yields and better overall efficiency, Shimamura says the company is able to sell lettuce at a price point that’s competitive with offerings from traditional farms. Mirai, which runs 25 plant factories, plans to expand its operations overseas and open facilities in Mongolia, Hong Kong, Russia and China. Shimamura and his team are also exploring ways to adapt their indoor farming system to grow a wider range of crops. “I’d like to try some business that combines factory techniques and traditional agriculture, but mostly I’d like people to know that factory-grown vegetables are ultimately safe,” he says. “So far people have had little opportunity to taste them but I expected that to change in the future.” SECTION: {section=national/on-innovations, subsection=null}!!!

Greg is studying the environmental impact of agriculture. He noticed that in his own state a lake near agricultural lands has been declared as a dead zone. For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A. Then he found near a national park in his state a lake is not declared as a dead zone. To further his study he labeled this zone as zone B.  Which zone is a result of algae overgrowth, zone A or zone B?  Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. A:","output":"Based on the information provided, zone A is a result of algae overgrowth.  Step 1: Identify the dead zone - Zone A is described as a dead zone, located near agricultural lands. Step 2: Understand the cause of dead zones - As per the hint, rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil, and runoff carries it away to bodies of water. The fertilizer contains nitrogen, which stimulates algae growth. In turn, the algae consume carbon dioxide in the water. Step 3: Analyze the algae's role in creating dead zones - Once the algae die, decomposers break down their dead tissue. This process uses up the oxygen in the water, leading to dead zones, where there's too little oxygen for anything to grow. Step 4: Relate the given information to the zones - Since zone A is declared as a dead zone, it exhibits the characteristics mentioned above, including algae overgrowth and low oxygen levels. Therefore, zone A is the result of algae overgrowth, while zone B, near a national park, is not a dead zone and hence not affected by the same issue."},{"instruction":"Given the question: The answer to the question: Who asks the family servant to kill the high-born drunken cad? is inside the article: Sire Alain de Maletroit, plots revenge on his younger brother Edmond for stealing Alain's childhood sweetheart, who died giving birth to Edmond's daughter Blanche. Alain secretly imprisons Edmond in his dungeon for 20 years and convinces Blanche that her father is dead. Alain intends to further debase Blanche as revenge against Edmond. Alain tricks a high-born drunken cad, Denis de Beaulieu, in to believeing he has murdered a man. Denis escapes a mob by entering the Maletroit chateau by an exterior door which has no latch on the inside. Alain makes Denis a captive intending to force the delicate Blanche into marriage with him. Alain goes to the dungeon to torture Edmond with the news Blanche will be married to Denis, an unworthy rogue. After Alain leaves, Edmond asks the family servant Voltan to kill Denis before the wedding. However, Denis shows unanticipated redemptive qualities and he and Blanche fall in love. When Voltan comes to kill Denis, Blanche pleads with Voltan to spare his life and help him escape.

Fact 2: Sunlight Green plants require sunlight in order to grow.  Given the two facts above, what are parts of the ecosystem? A:","output":"An ecosystem refers to all the living organisms and the non-living environment interacting and functioning together within a specific area. Given the facts stated, we can focus on two primary components of an ecosystem:  1. Biotic components: These are the living components of an ecosystem. They can be categorized on the basis of their life forms or their functional roles in the ecosystem.     a. Producers (autotrophs): These are green plants which contain chlorophyll and can produce their own food through a process known as photosynthesis. Producers serve as the basic food source for all other life forms in an ecosystem. They take in energy from the sun, water from the soil, and carbon dioxide from the air to generate glucose, a basic energy source for many organisms.     b. Consumers (heterotrophs): These organisms cannot make their own food and hence depend on producers or other consumers for their sustenance. They can be further categorized into primary consumers (herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivores and omnivores), and tertiary consumers (top predators).     c. Decomposers: These are organisms such as fungi and bacteria that break down dead plants and animals into simpler substances, returning essential minerals to the soil and water bodies, effectively recycling them within the ecosystem. 2. Abiotic components: These are the non-living physical and chemical components in an ecosystem which influence the living organisms. This includes elements such as:     a. Sunlight: This is the primary energy source for an ecosystem. It drives photosynthesis in plants, enabling them to produce food and energy.      b. Soil: It provides essential nutrients, water, and physical support for plants to grow.     c. Water: All living things require water. It also serves as a habitat for many organisms.     d. Air: Provides oxygen for respiration and carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.     e. Temperature: Influences the physiological functioning of organisms.     f. Humidity: Impacts evaporation and transpiration in plants.     g. Wind: Affects the dispersal of seeds, spores, etc. Therefore, it can be concluded that parts of an ecosystem would include sunlight given it is a primary source of energy, and green plants, which are an example of producers and essential for life in the ecosystem. But we should also consider biotic components, such as other producers, consumers, and decomposers, as well as abiotic components like soil, water, air, temperature, wind, and humidity. The interaction of all these parts creates the complex network of life that we call an ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

One summer afternoon, the boys were invited to a neighborhood basketball game. Randy was naturally eager to participate, while Eric felt a tinge of apprehension mixed with excitement. He knew he couldn't match Randy's athleticism, but he didn't want to miss out on the fun. Step 1: Understand the context. Understand that the story revolves around two boys, Eric and Randy. Eric is considered less coordinated than Randy, which puts him at a disadvantage during sports and group activities. Step 2: Progress the story from where it was left off. Randy's enthusiasm contrasts with Eric's apprehension, as they get invited to participate in a basketball game. Eric's emotions are mixed, and even though he knows that Randy might outshine him, he still wants to join in the activity and have fun. Step 3: Continue the narrative with a focus on the characters' experiences. As the game began, Randy immediately excelled, scoring point after point for his team. Meanwhile, Eric, trying to blend in, constantly missed passes, fumbled the ball, and felt his face flush red with embarrassment. However, he didn't let his lack of coordination get the best of him, and he trudged on. Step 4: Include significant moments in the story. Despite his struggles, Eric had one shining moment during the game when he caught a pass from Randy, took a deep breath, and made a flawless shot, swishing it into the net. The surprise and joy that radiated from his face made it clear to everyone that although he wasn't able to keep up with Randy's athleticism, his efforts and perseverance paid off with that one unforgettable shot. Step 5: Bring the story to a conclusion that ties in with the initial context. After the game, both Eric and Randy, drenched in sweat and grinning, walked back home together. They recounted their memorable moments on the court, including Eric's triumphant shot. Even though Eric was less coordinated than Randy, he realized that day that it was more important to challenge himself, have fun, and make the most out of every experience, regardless of the outcome. By following these steps, I've continued the story of Eric and Randy, staying true to the context while highlighting their contrasting attributes and emphasizing the importance of overcoming personal limitations and enjoying life experiences."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the duo that produced \\"Start the Fire\\" for the band?, using the article: Every night on the tour to support their 2000 album Return of Saturn, No Doubt threw after-show parties where people danced to Jamaican dancehall music. During a discussion over dinner in late 2000, the band members decided they wanted to explore dancehall-style rhythms for their next album. Drawing inspiration from artists such as Bounty Killer, Cutty Ranks, and Mr. Vegas, the band began work on the album in January 2001 by creating beats on Pro Tools at guitarist Tom Dumont's apartment. The group often tried recreating beats from other song files on the computer, which resulted in modified versions of the original rhythms. They worked with producer Philip Steir at Toast Studios in San Francisco during this time, where the beginnings of \\"Hey Baby\\" emerged. When writing lyrics for previous albums, Stefani typically read works by Sylvia Plath that would make her depressed \\"or find different words that inspire me.\\" In contrast, for Rock Steady she wrote the lyrics quicker and on the spot to meet the goal of writing a song a day. Many of the demos recorded during these early sessions were used in the final tracks, rather than completely reworking the songs. The band saw this as a way to preserve the \\"initial spark\\" from when the songs were conceived.The next month, Stefani left Los Angeles for London to visit boyfriend Rossdale, and the band traveled with her to finish recording \\"Detective\\". There, they worked with Eurythmics member David A. Stewart and wrote the song \\"Underneath It All\\" in only 10 minutes. In March, No Doubt traveled to Jamaica, staying at the Blue Lagoon in Port Antonio. The band \\"spent most of the time swimming and getting sunburned and drinking and smoking and recording a little music\\", according to Dumont.

This is because the increased spinning speed of the rotor within the core, surrounded by magnets and wire loops, will lead to a greater rate of change in the magnetic field.

Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made. The first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons.

Which film saw Sean Connery's last portrayal of James Bond????","output":"Sean Connery's last portrayal of James Bond was in the 1983 film \\"Never Say Never Again.\\" The film was not an official part of the long-running Eon Productions Bond series; instead, it was produced under the Warner Bros. banner by TaliaFilm II Productions, with distribution handled by Warner Bros. Pictures. The movie is often called an \\"unofficial\\" Bond film because of its separate production from the main series. \\"Never Say Never Again\\" is essentially a remake of the 1965 official Bond film \\"Thunderball.\\" Kevin McClory, one of \\"Thunderball's\\" co-writers, held the filming rights for the story and produced this version having Sean Connery back as James Bond. The film's title arose from a conversation between Connery and his wife, who jokingly said that he should \\"never say never again\\" about reprising his role as James Bond. In this film, Connery's Bond is called out of retirement to recover two stolen nuclear warheads that are being used by SPECTRE, an international criminal organization led by mastermind Ernst Stavro Blofeld, played by Max von Sydow. Bond must work alongside his former love interest Domino Petachi (Kim Basinger), who is unknowingly aiding SPECTRE, and confront deadly assassin Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera) to foil the nefarious plot. Although \\"Never Say Never Again\\" fell outside the official Bond series, Connery's return to the role garnered attention and put his portrayal back in the spotlight. His performance was praised by critics, and many fans enjoyed seeing their favorite Bond actor back in action once more. Ultimately, Connery's final appearance as James Bond in the film marked the end of an era, concluding his time as the iconic character."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: who won the english civil war in the end?","output":"The English Civil War, fought from 1642 to 1651, was a series of armed conflicts and political disputes between the Parliamentarians (also known as \\"Roundheads\\") and the Royalists (also called \\"Cavaliers\\") over the governance of England. In the end, the Parliamentarians emerged as the victorious party in this struggle, and their win marked a significant turning point in British history. It is important to note that the English Civil War was not a single continuous conflict but rather a series of interconnected wars and events spanning nearly a decade. To better understand the outcome, it is helpful to break down the conflict into three main phases: 1. First Civil War (1642-1646): The war began in 1642 when tensions between King Charles I and the English Parliament reached a breaking point. These tensions arose due in part to religious disagreements, political power struggles, and the King's disregard for the Magna Carta and its principles. The First Civil War saw the majority of the fighting between Royalist and Parliamentary forces, with some significant battles taking place at Edgehill, Marston Moor, and Naseby. Parliament's New Model Army, led by Sir Thomas Fairfax and with Oliver Cromwell as a significant military figure, ultimately defeated the Royalist forces in this first phase. 2. Second Civil War (1648-1649): Despite the Royalist defeat in the First Civil War, tensions between the crown and Parliament continued to grow. King Charles I was held captive, and he managed to negotiate a secret treaty with the Scots to reinstate him to power. In response, this provoked another bout of fighting that eventually resulted in the defeat of the Royalist-Scot alliance by the New Model Army. 3. Third Civil War (1649-1651): Following the execution of King Charles I in January 1649, England was declared a republic, known as the Commonwealth of England, under the leadership of the newly-formed Council of State. However, Charles II, the son of Charles I, was proclaimed king in Scotland, which triggered the third phase of the conflict. Several key battles, such as the Battle of Dunbar and the Battle of Worcester, were fought between the New Model Army, now under the command of Oliver Cromwell, and the Scottish Royalist forces. Charles II's forces were decisively defeated and he had to flee into exile, marking the end of the Third Civil War and the English Civil Wars as a whole. In conclusion, the Parliamentarians, led by notable figures such as Sir Thomas Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell, emerged victoriously from the English Civil War. After the war, England saw a significant shift in power from the monarchy to the republican government, with the establishment of the Commonwealth of England. The Commonwealth period lasted until 1660 when the monarchy was restored with the return of Charles II to the throne. Nevertheless, the impact of the English Civil War and the Parliamentarians' victory had far-reaching, lasting effects on the constitutional system and political landscape of England for centuries to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"No, these two sentences are not paraphrases of each other. They convey different information and are structured differently. The first sentence provides clear information about two distinct games:  1. Illinois beat Purdue with a score of 17-7. 2. Ole Miss beat Army with a score of 27-7. On the other hand, the second sentence seems to be a mix of words and phrases from the first sentence, rearranged in a way that makes it difficult to understand the intended message. It appears to be an incorrect combination of the two events mentioned in the first sentence and does not provide clear information about the games. It almost suggests that Purdue somehow was involved in both games and beat Ole Miss Army, which does not make much sense. As a result, the two sentences cannot be considered paraphrases of each other due to their differences in clarity and structure. A paraphrase is a restatement of a sentence or statement while keeping its original meaning, and in this case, the second sentence fails to accurately convey the information provided in the first sentence."},{"instruction":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Sasha was very proud of their accomplishment at the science fair today.

The reviews on this site convinced me to buy this product. Don't make the same mistake. I called Dirt Devil and there is NO repair facility in a Metro area of almost a million people. Closest one is 60 miles away and they don't want it. The guy told me, \\"Those things are Chinese junk!\\" Dirt Devil told me I will have to ship it back to them (could take 16 weeks!!!)and they cannot tell me what it will cost! Buyer beware! Answer: A:","output":"Based on the provided review, it appears that the user would not recommend this product. Despite the product initially working well, the user experienced issues which led them to regret their purchase. Their interaction with Dirt Devil's customer service further influenced their dissatisfaction, encountering difficulties in finding a local repair facility and the potential lengthy time it could take to ship the product back for repair. Moreover, the user's quotation of an individual referring to the product as \\"Chinese junk\\" and their warning to future buyers with the phrase \\"buyer beware\\" further emphasizes their lack of support for this particular product. The combination of these disappointing circumstances and the user's advice against making the same purchasing mistake lead to the conclusion that they would not recommend this product to others."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: OPT: + negative; + positive; TEXT:The Sentinel features a sort of run of the mill and clichéd suspense/mystery but is lifted with some good acting and taut pacing.

If you have -- if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you can't make education the top priority. Can we draw the following conclusion? they believe education should be their main goal.","output":"Yes, based on the given information, we can conclude that the speaker believes education, particularly early learning and pre-school, should be their main goal. This conclusion is drawn from the following key points: 1. The speaker emphasizes the importance of early learning and pre-school, stressing that more focus should be placed on these areas. Early childhood education is a critical stage in children's development, as it lays the foundation for future learning and success. Prioritizing early education can significantly impact a society, as it helps children to develop crucial social, emotional, and cognitive skills, setting them on a path for future academic and professional achievements. 2. The speaker links their priorities to the larger context of budget allocation and tax policies. They voice concern about squandering the surplus on massive tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthiest individuals. By expressing this concern, the speaker implies that resources should instead be directed towards social programs and investments that benefit a broader range of citizens, such as education. Allocating resources to education, especially early learning and pre-school, showcases the speaker's commitment to investing in the future generation and building a more equitable society. 3. The speaker argues that if the surplus is spent on tax cuts benefiting mostly the wealthy, it restricts the ability to make education the top priority. This statement demonstrates their belief that education should be considered a primary goal that warrants proper funding and resources. By opposing the allocation of funds towards tax cuts, the speaker argues for a more balanced distribution of resources, ensuring that education is not overlooked as a critical area of investment. In conclusion, the speaker believes that education, specifically early learning and pre-school, should be their main goal. They express concerns about the allocation of funds in a manner that might favor the affluent and limit the ability to prioritize education. Redirecting resources and attention towards early learning and pre-school can contribute to building a strong foundation for a more educated and successful society in the long run."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In early 1542, Polin successfully negotiated the details of a Franco-Ottoman alliance for the Italian War of 1542-1546, with the Ottoman Empire promising to send 27,500 troops against the territories of the Spanish king Ferdinand, as well as 110 galleys against Charles, while France promised to attack Flanders, harass the coasts of Spain with a naval force, and send 40 galleys to assist the Turks for operations in the Levant. Polin tried to convince Venice to join the alliance, but in vain. The execution of the alliance would most notably lead to the Franco-Ottoman Siege of Nice in 1543. In July 1543, Polin sailed on board the Ottoman fleet of Barbarossa to the Île Saint-Honorat in the Lérins Islands off Cannes on 5 July 1543, only to find very little ready for the offensive on the French side. Polin went to see king Francis I of France to obtain troops, which led to the Siege of Nice in August 1543. Polin supervised the wintering of the Ottomans at Toulon.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Where did the person who is re-making the Sissinghurst garden serve before taking on the project? from the following article ?  John Vass, appointed head gardener in 1939, left in 1957. Called up to the RAF in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, \\"as much, if not more than Vita's, mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England\\". In 2006 they were awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour for their work at Sissinghurst. The pair were followed as head gardener by Sarah Cook, who was succeeded by Alexis Datta.In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed – the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden \\"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\\". In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden – and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck\\". Scott Smith's plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014. Sissinghurst continues to exert considerable influence, being described as a \\"Mecca\\" and a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners from around the world and encouraging many imitators.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the name of the painting that portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea? ?  Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea.

He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing.
