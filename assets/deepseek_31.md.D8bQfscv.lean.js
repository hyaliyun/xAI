Please answer the following question: Question: What prevents a couple from going to bed? Options: - insomnia - pregnancy - making love - rest - infant  Explain why a human would choose \\"making love\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"making love\\" as the answer to the question above because it is an activity that involves physical intimacy, emotional connection, and pleasure between a couple. When a couple engages in making love, it typically requires time, energy, and focus, and it often takes place in a private setting like a bedroom.  Step 1: Analyze the question and the options given. The question is about identifying a factor that would prevent a couple from going to bed. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant options. - Pregnancy: While it may cause discomfort in some cases, pregnancy itself doesn't directly prevent a couple from going to bed. - Rest: Rest is not a preventative factor since going to bed is usually associated with resting or relaxation. - Infant: While taking care of an infant may cause sleep disruption, it doesn't directly prevent a couple from going to bed; they can still go to bed and attend to the infant as needed. Step 3: Identify the most plausible answer. - Insomnia: Insomnia can prevent one or both partners from sleeping, but it doesn't necessarily prevent them from going to bed. - Making love: This activity often occurs in the bedroom and requires being awake and engaged. Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is \\"making love\\" because it is an activity that demands time, energy, and attention, preventing the couple from getting into bed to sleep or rest."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Chordates are a large and diverse group of animals that share certain characteristics, such as a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, and a post-anal tail at some point in their development. Examples of chordates include mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. To provide a more comprehensive answer to the question \\"what can chordates go through?\\", we can list several aspects that chordates may experience: 1. Shock: As mentioned, chordates can experience shock. Shock can be a result of various causes, such as trauma, severe infection, or significant blood loss, which leads to a systemic failure to provide adequate oxygen and nutrients to vital organs. 2. Disease: Chordates can indeed go through a wide variety of diseases caused by various factors, such as viruses, bacteria, parasites, or genetic mutations. Examples include common colds, cancer, parasitic infections, and countless others. As disease can impact the health and well-being of chordates, it plays a significant role in their experience. 3. Predation and competition: Chordates, like all living organisms, are involved in the struggle for existence. They may experience predation or competition for resources such as food, shelter, and mates. 4. Growth and development: Chordates undergo a multitude of developmental changes throughout their lives as they grow from embryos to adults. This process can involve metamorphosis, such as the transformation of a tadpole into a frog, or the gradual modifications that lead to an adult mammal. 5. Reproduction: Chordates must reproduce to maintain the continuity of their species. They can utilize various reproductive strategies, which can include sexual or asexual reproduction, oviparity (laying eggs), ovoviviparity (live birth with eggs retained within the mother's body), or viviparity (giving birth to live young without the development of an egg). 6. Environmental interactions: Chordates interact with their environments and must adapt to various ecological pressures. They can experience habitat changes, including variations in temperature, light, or water availability. Climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction are factors that can significantly affect the lives of chordates, sometimes leading to population declines or even extinction. 7. Social interactions: Many chordates have complex social lives, involving individual and group behaviors, such as bonding, communication, cooperation, territoriality, and conflict resolution. In summary, while disease is one of the various experiences that chordates can go through, it is essential to consider the whole picture. Chordates can go through a wide range of experiences, including shock, disease, predation, growth and development, reproduction, environmental interactions, and social interactions. These experiences, both positive and negative, are part of the complex lives and survival strategies that chordates employ."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Article: To prevent diabetes  you will get a real jolt ( shock ) when you follow the prescription offered up in the \\"Journal of the American Medical Association.\\" This 'prestigious' organization reported on separate studies of coffee drinkers in Sweden and Finland. Whiz-bang medical researchers discovered that women could decrease their risk of diabetes by 29 percent when they followed a regimen of drinking three to four cups of coffee a day. The ladies who had the courage to drink 10 or more cups of coffee a day progressed even better. They reduced their risk of diabetes by 79 percent. The men participating in the studies also reduced their risk, but not to the extent as did the women. When men drank three to four cups a day, they reduced their risk of diabetes by 27 percent. The men who drank 10 or more cups of java per day reduced their risk by 55 percent. These results confirm a January report by the equally 'prestigious' Harvard School of Public Health. That report concluded that drinking six 8-ounce cups of coffee a day could reduce diabetes risk in men by about 50 percent and in women by 30 percent. If the numbers have any connection to reality, the more coffee you drink, the better off you are. And that is the rub. The numbers have nothing to do with reality, nothing to do with the truth. Here in America the rate of adult-onset diabetes, or Type 2 diabetes, is growing increasingly. Nowadays it typically shows up in middle-age populations, but the disease is on the rise among ever-younger age groups. Do not step up your coffee consumption in the belief it will help you prevent diabetes. This disease has  ly nothing to do with a lack of coffee drinking. Science and truth are not synonymous. Medical scientists do not deal with truth. The medical scientists who monkey around with coffee drinking merely play with limited and approximate descriptions of reality. In this case, extremely limited and hardly approximate. If you are serious about preventing diabetes, you have to look at the differences between the people...

The recall covers Jeep Cherokees from the 2014 and 2015 model years. Fiat Chrysler, which makes Jeeps, says there have been a small number of inadvertent air bag deployments. The 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee (pictured) has been recalled due to faulty side air bags. Canadian safety regulators say the problem occurred mainly in off-road situations. Sudden air bag inflation can startle drivers and cause crashes, but Chrysler says it's not aware of any accidents or injuries. Most of the recalled vehicles are in the U.S. and Canada. Dealers will recalibrate the software to change the threshold for inflating the air bags. The problem is the latest in a string of auto industry troubles with air bags. The 2014 model of Jeep Cherokee is priced from 20,000 and over a million Jeeps were sold worldwide last year - a 39% increase from 2013. Jeep are reacting to worldwide demand by planning more availability of the brand in China and Brazil.

Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William \\"Coin\\" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas.

I read this background article the other day: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds.  I am facing a new situation today: Mike was interested in the science behind polar compounds. To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which compound would have lower melting point, compound A or compound B? The answer to this question is:","output":"Compound B, the nonpolar compound, would have a lower melting point. This is because polar compounds, like compound A, have relatively high melting and boiling points due to the presence of hydrogen bonds. Although these bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another. Therefore, it takes higher temperatures for changes of state to occur in polar compounds. In contrast, nonpolar compounds, like compound B, do not have these additional hydrogen bonds, so it takes less energy for their molecules to move apart, resulting in lower melting and boiling points."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: You are presented with the quiz \\"why do animals sweat?\\"   But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"if an animal sweats then that animal 's bodily water decreases\\" and \\"just like sweating, the evaporation of the water cools the body\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? A:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"why do animals sweat?\\" would be: Animals sweat in order to regulate their body temperature through the process of evaporation, which cools the body and helps maintain an optimal internal environment. When an animal sweats, its body releases water through sweat glands located in the skin. This water then evaporates on the surface of the skin. The evaporation process requires heat energy, which is absorbed from the animal's body, thereby helping to cool it down. The hint from the teacher that \\"if an animal sweats then that animal's bodily water decreases\\" refers to the fact that, when an animal sweats, it loses water from its body. This loss of water is typically replenished through the consumption of liquids, such as water or other fluids. The importance of staying hydrated cannot be understated, especially for animals that rely heavily on sweating as a means for temperature regulation, as dehydration can have adverse effects on health and performance. The second hint provided, that \\"just like sweating, the evaporation of the water cools the body\\", emphasizes that the mechanism by which sweating helps maintain an appropriate body temperature is related to the process of evaporation. As the water released by sweat glands evaporates, it effectively removes heat from the body, allowing the animal to maintain a stable internal temperature. In conclusion, the best answer to the question \\"why do animals sweat?\\" is that animals sweat to regulate their body temperature by utilizing the cooling effects provided by the evaporation of water from their skin. This physiological process is important for their overall health, as maintaining an optimal internal environment is essential to their well-being and survival."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Q: What does the presence of gill slits suggest about humans and fish?    Choices:  - Shared History  - Common Cells  - Same evolutionary chain  - common ancestor  A: Answer:","output":"The presence of gill slits in both humans and fish suggests a shared evolutionary history and a common ancestor. This similarity in anatomical structure reflects the idea that both humans and fish have descended from a common ancestor that possessed these features at some point in the distant past. To better understand this concept, it is important to first understand what gill slits are. In aquatic animals, such as fish, gill slits are openings that lead to the gills, which play a crucial role in respiration. Gills extract dissolved oxygen from the surrounding water, allowing fish to breathe and survive in their underwater environment. Humans, on the other hand, possess pharyngeal slits during embryonic development, which later develop into various structures of the head and neck. The presence of gill slits during the embryonic stage in humans is a fascinating example of a shared feature with fish. This similarity is the result of a common ancestor that both humans and fish shared millions of years ago. Over time, through the process of evolution, species have diverged and adapted to different environments and ways of life. However, some vestiges of ancestral traits can still be seen in various species, including humans. In evolutionary biology, such homologous structures are evidence for a shared evolutionary history. The presence of gill slits in both humans and fish demonstrates that the two groups share a common ancestor that possessed this feature. This ancestor would have branched off into different evolutionary lineages, leading to the variety of species we see today. While gill slits may seem like a surprising link between humans and fish, this is just one of many examples of shared features throughout the animal kingdom. By studying these evolutionary connections and similarities, scientists can better understand the relationships between different species and how they have adapted and changed over time. In conclusion, the presence of gill slits in both humans and fish points to a shared evolutionary history and a common ancestor, rather than representing a mere coincidence or the same evolutionary chain. This ancestral connection highlights the interconnectedness of all life on Earth, reminding us of our own biological roots in the rich tapestry of life."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The answer to the question should be unambiguous and a phrase in the paragraph. Most questions can have only one correct answer. Input: Passage: There are over 20 miles (32 km) of hiking trails at Worlds End State Park. Most of the trails are rocky and steep, so hikers are encouraged to wear proper footgear and to be prepared for icy conditions during the cold winter months. As John Young writes in Hike Pennsylvania, \\"If you want to do some hiking in the Worlds End region, you should know that hiking here means climbing\\". Worlds End State Park is open during the winter months for snow mobiling and cross-country skiing. Most of the trails are too steep or rugged for either activity, but the park roads are open, as are trails on surrounding state forest lands. Loyalsock Trail, often abbreviated LT, is a rugged 59.28-mile (95.40 km) hiking trail that stretches from near Loyalsockville, in Lycoming County on Pennsylvania Route 87 to north of Laporte in Sullivan County, just off U.S. Route 220. This trail follows the ridges and streams of the Loyalsock Creek watershed. The trail is primarily within the boundaries of Loyalsock State Forest and uses some old logging roads and abandoned railroad grades. The Loyalsock Trail was originally blazed in a yellow rectangle with a red stripe, and red can lids with a yellow \\"LT\\". Recently, the trail markers have been changed to a yellow disc with a red \\"LT\\". Link Trail is a moderate 8.5-mile (13.7 km) trail marked with a red X on a yellow circle blaze. The trail starts at the Cabin Bridge in the park and follows Loyalsock Creek before it branches off and follows Double Run. The trail then ascends to Canyon Vista and heads out into Loyalsock State Forest where it links up with the Loyalsock Trail at the 55.33-mile (89.05 km) post. The Loyalsock Trail can be followed back for a 17.62 miles (28.36 km) long loop. Canyon Vista Trail is a 3.5-mile (5.6 km) loop trail with blue blazes that passes through the eastern portion of the park and a stand of ash, sugar maple, and black cherry trees. This trail passes a maze-like jumble of blocky Pottsville Formation rocks known as the Rock Garden, adjacent to Canyon Vista. The vista is at an elevation of 1,750 feet (530 m) and \\"rewards the hiker with a spectacular view of the Loyalsock Creek gorge\\". Worlds End Trail is a 3.25-mile (5.23 km) trail with yellow blazes that begins at the park office and ascends to an overlook of the swimming area. It then crosses the old Pioneer Road, which was used by some of the first settlers to the area, and enters the Loyalsock State Forest, ending at the 37.77-mile (60.78 km) post of the Loyalsock Trail, which can be followed back to the park office to make a loop 11.5 miles (18.5 km) long. Butternut Trail is a 2.5-mile (4.0 km) trail marked with orange blazes that loops through a hardwood forest and crosses over Butternut Run. Two side trails connect Butternut Trail with the Loyalsock Trail.  Question: What is the name of the trail that ends at the 37.77-mile mark of the Loyalsock trail?

What is the title of this article: In 1902, the Siemens company developed a tantalum lamp filament. These lamps were more efficient than even graphitized carbon filaments and could operate at higher temperatures. Since tantalum metal has a lower resistivity than carbon, the tantalum lamp filament was quite long and required multiple internal supports. The metal filament had the property of gradually shortening in use; the filaments were installed with large loops that tightened in use. This made lamps in use for several hundred hours quite fragile. Metal filaments had the property of breaking and re-welding, though this would usually decrease resistance and shorten the life of the filament. General Electric bought the rights to use tantalum filaments and produced them in the US until 1913.","output":"\\"Siemens' Tantalum Filament Development in 1902: The Evolution of Enhanced Light Bulb Efficiency and Its Legacy\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The dog accompanied him, frisking about him in friendly fashion.  Rolfe first examined the bedroom that he had seen Inspector Chippenfield enter.  It was a small room, containing a double bed.  It was prettily furnished in white, with white curtains, and toilet-table articles in ivory to match.  A glance round the room convinced Rolfe that it was impossible for a man to secrete himself in it.  The door of the wardrobe had been flung open by the inspector, and the dresses and other articles of feminine apparel it contained flung out on the floor.  There was no other hiding-place possible, except beneath the bed, and the ruthless hand of the inspector had torn off the white muslin bed hangings, revealing emptiness underneath.  Rolfe went out into the hall again, and entered the room next the bedroom.  This apartment was apparently used as a dining-room, for it contained a large table, a few chairs, a small sideboard, a spirit-stand, a case of books and ornaments, and two small oak presses.  Plainly, there was no place in it where a man could hide himself.  The next room was the bathroom, which was also empty.  Opposite the bathroom was a small bedroom, very barely furnished, offering no possibility of concealment.  Then the passage opened into a large roomy kitchen, the full width of the rooms on both sides of the hall, and the kitchen completed the flat.

I have known, and admired, Julia Busuttil Nishimura, for many years now and always felt connected through our love of Italian food, Tuscany (Julia lived in Florence and in Orbetello, just 10 minutes away from where we lived in Porto Ercole while I was writing Acquacotta) and Japan. So I have been eagerly awaiting her debut cookbook, Ostro: The Pleasure that Comes From Slowing Down and Cooking with Simple Ingredients, and it is a beauty — it is full of food I want to make and eat. It’s also a joy to look at, as it is presented so beautifully with photographs of Julia (and often her darling little boy Haruki) at home and tables full with food that look Caravaggesque. I have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges). I absolutely love her homemade approach to everything, including all the wonderful handmade pasta like trofie and orecchiette (look at those beautiful dishes below), but also things like classic tiramisu — homemade savoiardi, homemade mascarpone (yes and yes, I absolutely believe that for the freshest, most delicious mascarpone, it needs to be homemade especially if you live outside of Italy). Yes, these are all things you can also buy in a packet, but Julia’s point is, it is a pleasure to make these things by hand, and the ingredients are so simple — water, flour, cream, eggs, — you probably have them all in your house already.

Context: In the Atlantic, the West India Company concentrated on wresting from Portugal its grip on the sugar and slave trade, and on opportunistic attacks on the Spanish treasure fleets on their homeward bound voyage. Bahia on the north east coast of Brazil was captured in 1624 but only held for a year before it was recaptured by a joint Spanish-Portuguese expedition. In 1628, Piet Heyn captured the entire Spanish treasure fleet, and made off with a vast fortune in precious metals and goods that enabled the Company two years later to pay its shareholders a cash dividend of 70%, though the Company was to have relatively few other successes against the Spanish. In 1630, the Dutch occupied the Portuguese sugar-settlement of Pernambuco and over the next few years pushed inland, annexing the sugar plantations that surrounded it. In order to supply the plantations with the manpower they required, a successful expedition was launched in 1637 from Brazil to capture the Portuguese slaving post of Elmina, and in 1641 successfully captured the Portuguese settlements in Angola. In 1642, the Dutch captured the Portuguese possession of Axim in Africa. By 1650, the West India Company was firmly in control of both the sugar and slave trades, and had occupied the Caribbean islands of Sint Maarten, Curaçao, Aruba and Bonaire in order to guarantee access to the islands' salt-pans.

Premise: \\"But when the groundlings grumble for red meat in the second act, Farrakhan abandons the smiling visage and the angel-of-peace routine and spews.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The groundlings are tempted when they see Farrakhan with the meat.\\" true?","output":"Based on the given premise, it is difficult to definitively conclude whether the hypothesis \\"The groundlings are tempted when they see Farrakhan with the meat\\" is true. The premise does not specifically mention the groundlings' perception of Farrakhan holding the meat or their temptation upon seeing it. However, the premise provides some indications that can help in analyzing this hypothesis. First, let us understand the context provided by the premise. \\"Groundlings\\" refers to members of an audience who are not entirely committed to understanding the deeper meaning of the subject matter, instead seeking entertainment or excitement. The phrase \\"red meat\\" is a metaphor for provocative statements or controversial topics that the groundlings crave. Farrakhan, a public figure, starts his speech by presenting a peaceful image in the first act, but later abandons it to deliver more controversial statements, as demanded by the groundlings in the second act. His \\"spewing\\" is an indication of his shift in tone to satisfy the audience's craving for controversy. Given this context, we can interpret the hypothesis to mean that the groundlings feel tempted when they observe Farrakhan engaging with controversy, rather than literally showing them meat. This interpretation suggests that the groundlings are more interested in the emotional stimulation that comes from controversial subjects than in the peaceful discourse that Farrakhan initially offers.  With this understanding, it seems reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis could be true, as it is supported by the fact that Farrakhan's shift in tone is a response to the groundlings' desires. While the hypothesis might not be directly stated in the premise, it can be inferred that the groundlings are indeed tempted by the metaphorical \\"meat\\" that Farrakhan presents when he abandons his initial peace-oriented message.

One of the most significant factors in achieving success in fitness is consistency, which plays a vital role in improving one's health and wellbeing. In this article, we will explore the importance of finding a time that works for you and sticking to it, building up your skills and comfort level before incorporating new elements to your workout, and how signing up for a personal trainer can be a game-changer in your fitness journey. Finding a Time That Works for You Exercising at the same time every day is conducive to establishing a habit and creating consistency. Our bodies have an internal clock called the circadian rhythm, which influences various physiological processes like metabolism, energy levels, and hormone production. By adhering to a consistent workout schedule, you can optimize your body's performance and make the most out of your exercise. Here are some tips to find the best time that works for you: 1. Consider your personal preferences: Reflect on the times of the day when you feel most energetic and motivated. Some people thrive in the morning, while others prefer exercising in the evening. 2. Take your work and family responsibilities into account: Stick to a time that doesn't conflict with your job or personal commitments, ensuring that you won't be routinely interrupted during your workouts. 3. Be mindful of your lifestyle: If you frequently attend social events in the evenings, it may be best to set aside time for workouts in the morning or afternoon. Building Skills and Comfort Level When starting a new fitness routine, it's essential to gradually build your comfort level and skills to avoid injury and maintain your motivation. For long-term success, start with a manageable workout plan and progressively increase its intensity, duration, and complexity. Here's how to build your skills and comfort level: 1. Begin with the basics: Start by mastering fundamental exercises like squats, push-ups, and planks. Focusing on form and technique will ensure you have a solid foundation for more advanced moves. 2. Listen to your body: Learn to distinguish between healthy discomfort and pain, adjusting your workouts accordingly. If an exercise causes pain, stop immediately and consult a healthcare professional. 3. Set realistic goals: Create achievable and measurable goals by setting clear milestones. Celebrate your accomplishments and use them as motivation for future progress. 4. Track your progress: Keep a workout journal to record your exercise routine, including duration, intensity, and improvements over time. This will help you analyze your progress and make necessary adjustments to your plan. Incorporating Personal Training  A personal trainer can be invaluable in helping you develop a tailored workout plan that addresses your unique fitness goals while providing ongoing guidance and support. The advantages of working with a personal trainer include: 1. Customized program: Personal trainers take into account factors like your fitness level, goals, and lifestyle to craft a workout regimen tailored to your needs. 2. Expert guidance: They can teach you proper exercise technique, help you set realistic goals, and offer advice on nutrition and lifestyle changes to improve your overall health. 3. Accountability and motivation: Having regular appointments with a personal trainer keeps you on track and committed to your fitness journey, enhancing your chances of achieving your goals. 4. Progress tracking and adjustments: Personal trainers monitor your progress and adjust your training program as needed, ensuring that you continue to make improvements over time. Conclusion Staying consistent and adapting your workout routine according to your skill level and comfort are critical factors in achieving long-lasting fitness success. Additionally, enlisting the help of a personal trainer can provide valuable guidance, motivation, and customization of your workout plan.

Un-neutered male cats are the most likely culprits to engage in this very undesirable behavior. Occasionally un-spayed females will do this as well.","output":"Therefore, it is essential to get your cat spayed or neutered as soon as they reach the appropriate age (usually around five to six months old). Doing so will help prevent them from developing the habit of spraying. However, if your cat has already begun spraying, there are several steps you can take to minimize and possibly eliminate this behavior. 1. Identify the cause of spraying: In some cases, cats spray due to stress or anxiety. Identifying any changes in your cat's environment, such as the introduction of a new family member, pet, or a change in the household routine, may help determine the root cause of their stress. Addressing these issues can help alleviate your cat's anxiety and stop the spraying behavior. 2. Provide additional litter boxes: Cats may spray urine if they feel they do not have enough access to clean litter boxes. Be sure to provide multiple litter boxes throughout the home, especially in larger households with multiple cats. Additionally, make sure to clean the litter boxes regularly and avoid using scented litter, as some cats may not like the smell. 3. Use pheromone therapy: Pheromone therapy can help reduce stress and anxiety in cats. Using synthetic cat pheromones, such as Feliway, in your home can help create a calming environment for your cat and reduce the likelihood of them spraying. These products come in various forms, such as diffusers, sprays, and collars. 4. Create a positive environment: Providing your cat with a comfortable and safe environment can help reduce stress and discourage spraying. Enrich their living space with interactive toys, scratching posts, and hiding spots. Make sure to also provide them with a space where they can retreat to if they feel threatened or stressed. 5. Clean and deodorize sprayed areas: If your cat has already sprayed in certain areas, be sure to clean them thoroughly using an enzyme-based cleaner specifically designed for cleaning up cat urine. This will help remove any lingering odor and reduce the likelihood of your cat returning to spray in the same spot. 6. Block access to sprayed areas: In some cases, it may be necessary to block off or restrict access to the areas where your cat has sprayed. This can help break the habit and discourage them from spraying in those areas again. 7. Consult with a veterinarian: If you have tried all of these methods and your cat continues to spray, it is essential to consult with a veterinarian. They can conduct a thorough examination and determine if there are any underlying medical issues contributing to the spraying behavior, such as urinary tract infections or other health problems. 8. Seek professional help: In some cases, working with a professional cat behaviorist can be beneficial in addressing and resolving spraying issues. They can provide personalized guidance and solutions based on your cat's specific needs and circumstances, helping you to establish an effective plan to deter your cat from spraying. In conclusion, to prevent a cat from spraying, it is essential to address the root cause of their behavior. Getting your cat spayed or neutered, identifying and managing any stressors, providing a safe and stimulating environment, and seeking veterinary assistance if necessary, can all help prevent and reduce spraying behavior in cats. Be patient and consistent with your efforts, and over time, you should see a decrease in your cat's spraying habits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A loving couple typically demonstrates qualities like care, understanding, kindness, patience, and support, which are all crucial in fostering a nurturing environment for a child to grow up in. Research has shown that children who are raised in loving and supportive environments tend to be happier and more resilient, as they feel secure and valued. They are also more likely to develop positive social skills and adapt better to various challenges in life. The other options do not directly convey the emotional and supportive aspect that a child needs to be happy: 1. \\"Birth\\" and \\"act of sex\\" refer to the biological and physical aspects of parenthood, which, while important, do not necessarily ensure the happiness of the child. 2. \\"Parents\\" is a broad term that can include various types of parental figures – loving, unloving, supportive, or unsupportive. Therefore, it is not specific enough to highlight the importance of love and care in raising a happy child. 3. \\"Adoption\\" is a method of creating a family, which can include a loving couple as well as other types of family structures. Adoption in itself does not guarantee a happy child, but the love and support provided by the adoptive parents would significantly contribute to their happiness.

(August 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The story follows the escape of two men from an Alaska prison, the efforts of a railroad dispatch office to safely stop the out-of-control train they are on, and the hunt by their warden to recapture them. Oscar \\"Manny\\" Manheim is a ruthless bank robber and hero to the convicts of Stonehaven Maximum Security Prison. After two previous escape attempts, the doors to Manny's cell were welded shut for three years. A court order compels Manny's nemesis, the vindictive and sadistic Associate Warden Ranken, to release him back into the general prison population. Manny intends to break out a third time with his older brother Jonah, but he is forced to set his escape plan into action in the middle of winter after Ranken employs a serial killer to stab him. Jonah stabs his attacker to death in retaliation and in turn is severely beaten by a prison guard, leaving him in a high-security hospital wing. Manny has to leave his brother behind. He recruits Buck McGeehy, who was convicted of statutory rape and who works in the prison's laundry room, to smuggle him out in a trolley. Buck decides to join Manny in the escape, even though Manny wants to go it alone. After a freezing cross-country hike (involving a 300Â ft drop into a river and subsequent swim) the two hop on board a train consisting of four locomotives at a remote Alaskan rail yard. Both men enter the fourth unit and stow away in the toilet compartment. Just as the train starts to move, the elderly engineer suffers a heart attack. In attempting to stop the train and get off, he does not set the throttle to idle, instead engaging the brakes, before collapsing off the still-moving train.

A: Choose from: * molecules * electrons * compounds * protons The answer is:","output":"All the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons in their nucleus, though they may have different numbers of neutrons. To elaborate on this, let's first understand some basic atomic structure. An atom, which is the smallest unit of an element, consists of a nucleus and electrons orbiting around it. The nucleus is located at the center of the atom and contains two types of subatomic particles: protons and neutrons. Protons are positively charged particles while neutrons have no charge, and both contribute to the mass of the atom. Orbiting around the nucleus, the electrons are negatively charged particles. Each element has its unique atomic number (Z) which represents the number of protons in its nucleus. This defines the element and determines its chemical properties. No two elements have the same atomic number, and it is the presence of the exact same number of protons that gives each element its specific characteristics. For example, if an atom has one proton, it is hydrogen. If it has two protons, it is helium. While protons define the element, neutrons can vary in number among the atoms of a single element. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Most elements have more than one isotope, and these isotopes have the same chemical properties but slightly different physical properties, primarily due to their differences in mass. For instance, carbon has two stable isotopes: carbon-12, which consists of 6 protons and 6 neutrons, and carbon-13, with 6 protons and 7 neutrons. In summary, all the atoms of a given element have the same number of protons, which define the element, in their nucleus. Neutrons can differ among the atoms of the same element, giving rise to isotopes with unique properties."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here are some ways good hygiene can help indirectly impact the process: 1. Storing food properly: Keeping bread and other food items in sealed containers will make it more challenging for mold spores to come into contact with the food. In addition, proper storage may help maintain the freshness of the food for a longer period of time. 2. Regular cleaning: Routinely cleaning surfaces and areas where food is prepared or stored will help eliminate contaminants that could carry mold spores. This includes wiping counters, washing utensils and cutting boards, and emptying trash cans. 3. Monitoring moisture levels: Mold thrives in damp and humid environments. Controlling the moisture level in your home can make it less appealing for mold spores to settle and grow. This includes ensuring adequate ventilation and using dehumidifiers when necessary. 4. Addressing mold growth promptly: If mold does appear in your living space, it is essential to address the issue immediately and thoroughly to prevent further spread. This includes removing moldy items, cleaning affected areas with mold-killing solutions, and taking measures to address the underlying cause of the mold growth. 5. Personal hygiene: Washing your hands regularly and thoroughly, especially before handling food, can prevent the transfer of mold spores from your hands to the bread or other food items.

Facebook, in particular, has been criticized for failing to provide GCHQ with five of Michael Adebowale's 11 accounts. This not only hints at a lack of cooperation between internet companies and security agencies but also raises questions about whether Facebook should be held responsible for its content. Adebowale, one of Rigby's murderers, had used Facebook as a platform to express his violent intentions. Staff at the social media giant failed to inform the security services of these \\"graphic and emotive\\" posts, including one where Adebowale told an Al Qaeda extremist, \\"Let's kill a soldier\\". Lee Rigby's family has publicly blamed MI5 and internet companies, including Facebook, for failing to prevent the attack. Sister Sara McClure went as far as stating, \\"Facebook has my brother's blood on their hands. I hold them partly responsible for Lee's murder.\\" This case has sparked a contentious debate between civil liberty groups and proponents of increased surveillance. Civil liberty organizations argue that this \\"appalling murder\\" should not be used as an excuse to \\"justify further surveillance and monitoring of the entire UK population.\\" On the other hand, MPs have been accused of \\"spin\\" to divert attention from the failings of MI5 and MI6, the UK's intelligence agencies. Adding to the debate, a former MI6 director stated that expecting businesses like Facebook to pass on terror-related material is both \\"almost impossible\\" and \\"unfair,\\" suggesting that these companies should not bear the sole responsibility for security threats. Lee Rigby's stepfather, Ian, seeks answers from Prime Minister David Cameron, noting, \\"We have lost a son, but we have never been able to mourn Lee.\\" Cameron's spokesman has confirmed that the Prime Minister is willing to meet with the family to discuss their concerns. The Rigby case highlights the challenges faced by intelligence agencies, such as MI5, MI6, and GCHQ, in monitoring potential terror threats. Between Adebowale and Adebolajo, the Rigby murderers, there were seven intelligence investigations. MI6 has been criticized for their \\"deeply unsatisfactory\\" response when Adebolajo attempted to join Al Shabaab terrorists in Kenya. He was subsequently dismissed as a drug dealer weeks before Rigby's murder and fell off the official radar.

Baby boomers, people born between 1946 and 1965, will on average earn £740,000 during their lives, according to the Resolution Foundation. Generation X, those now aged between 35 and 50, are projected to earn 13% more than that - £835,000 on average. But the figure for millennials, the under-35s, is lower than that - they are forecast to earn £825,000 over their working lives. Laura Gardiner, author of the Resolution Foundation's report Stagnation Generation found a range of reasons for the dismal outlook for millennials. Laura, a millennial herself, says the timing of the financial crisis was particularly bad for her generation. \\"This pay squeeze in particular hit millennials just at the point you expect your pay to be rising most quickly, in your early twenties,\\" she says. There's still a chance that millennials' lifetime earnings could outstrip those of their parents because they are likely to live longer and work longer, Laura says. She adds, however, that the slowdown in productivity growth (which affects national income) and the rise of insecure or precarious work, such as zero-hours contracts, self employment and short-term contracts, could prove so devastating that millennials would still earn less than their parents. Claudia Wells, who is 24, graduated from university in 2015 and since then has had a series of temporary and short-term contracts, the most recent of which has taken her to France. \\"In today's market,\\" she says, \\"finding a job can be hard.\\" Claudia also faces other financial burdens compared with her baby boomer father Ian. As soon as she starts earning more than £21,000 she will have to start paying off more than £40,000 of student debt. Ian compares his daughter's circumstances with his own: \\"At 23 I was in a secure, big company job with a good pension scheme, I had bought my first modest house and I was paying off a mortgage, not student debt.\\" \\"I live in a shared house and the idea of me or any of my friends owning a house by ourselves is pretty unforeseeable,\\" Claudia says. In fact, by the age of 30, Claudia's generation are 50% less likely to own their own homes than their baby boomer parents. Almost two-thirds of Ian's generation were homeowners by the same age. Part of the problem is that supply has failed to keep up with demand for housing as the population has grown. And Angus Hanton, co-founder of the Intergenerational Foundation, which exists to promote fairness between the generations, believes that older people are hogging the housing that is available. \\"Partly,\\" he says, \\"because they are living longer and partly because there aren't suitable places to downsize to, but they are taking more than their share.\\" This matters for Claudia's generation because property remains the single biggest asset owned by people in the UK and is a valuable source of wealth and, potentially, rental income in later life. Ian and his wife own their home outright and receive rental income from properties overseas that will supplement his already generous defined benefits pension and large savings pot, should he choose to retire. For \\"generation rent\\" - as millennials are also known - their retirement prospects look a lot bleaker. Not only are they more likely to forego income and wealth from owning property, they also face much higher pension costs. And, despite the start of auto-enrolment into company pension schemes, the shift towards defined contribution pensions and the rise in self-employment (excluded from auto-enrolment) could dramatically reduce millennials' retirement income. The state is often seen as the arbiter of fairness between generations. But, there is evidence that government policy itself may have widened the intergenerational divide. Prof Sir John Hills of the London School of Economics found that baby boomers were, on average, net beneficiaries of the welfare state - they will get more in benefits than they have paid in tax. They have enjoyed tax cuts and a boom in welfare spending. Subsequent generations, by contrast, are likely to be net contributors over their lifetimes and get back less than they have paid in, thanks to austerity cuts to state benefits. \\"The older generation have more voting power... they lobby more, the MPs and the policy makers are more likely to be baby boomers so [young people's] interests tend to be treated as less important,\\" says Angus Hanton. So government decisions to protect the state pensions with a \\"triple lock\\" guaranteeing an annual rise of at least 2.5%, at a time when other working-age benefits are being cut, has added to the controversy over intergenerational fairness. \\"In the UK we have a huge number of pensioners who are wealthy, probably two million over-60s who live in households with more than a million pounds' worth of assets,\\" adds Angus. \\"It seems odd that they should be getting this handout of the state pension.\\" Not everyone, however, puts the blame quite so squarely on the shoulders of the older generations. \\"I would dispute the fact that the generations are at war,\\" says Baroness Greengross, president of the Pensions Policy Institute. \\"The older generation has no desire to fight the younger generation... these are their children and grandchildren.\\" There is evidence that, in some countries at least, state level transfers of wealth from the young are, to some extent, offset by private transfers from old to young within families. And, Ian admits that, like most parents, he is setting aside money to help Claudia get on to the housing ladder.

This article was about:","output":"The question of whether baby boomers are to blame for the economic difficulties experienced by millennials is complex and multifaceted. Baby boomers, who enjoyed economic good times, tax cuts, and free higher education, benefited significantly from these advantages, but it is essential to consider various factors before establishing who is at fault. One key aspect that has affected millennials disproportionately is the global financial crisis of 2008. The timing of the crisis was particularly bad for this generation, hitting them during a period when their pay would typically be rising, causing a persistent pay squeeze. While some argue that millennials could still outperform their parents over their lifetime earnings due to a longer life and work duration, others believe that slow productivity growth and the rise of unstable work (i.e., zero-hour contracts, self-employment, and short-terms contracts) make it unlikely. In addition, housing has become a significant issue for millennials, with home ownership at the age of 30 down to 50% compared to the baby boomer generation. The increase in housing demand due to population growth, insufficient housing supply, and older generations using up more housing stock than previous generations, have contributed to the current predicament for millennials. Moreover, millennials face financial burdens, including student loans, that their parents did not. These loan repayments delay their ability to build wealth and plan for the future. Millennials are also part of the \\"generation rent,\\" whereby they are unlikely to benefit from home ownership and rental income in their retirement. Furthermore, with the shift towards defined contribution pensions and the rise in self-employment, millennials' retirement income could be considerably less than their parents'. To compound these issues, government policy has seemingly widened the generational divide. Decisions to protect state pensions under a \\"triple lock\\" while other working-age benefits are cut have added to the controversy over intergenerational fairness. However, while some argue that baby boomers have benefitted at the expense of younger generations, others maintain that older individuals have no intention to harm their children or grandchildren, instead, offering financial support to help them navigate these economic challenges. Ultimately, the causes of millennials' economic difficulties are numerous, involving a range of interconnected factors such as the financial crisis, housing market imbalances, government policies, pension changes, and student loan burdens. While it is undeniably true that baby boomers benefited from a more favorable economic climate, it is overly simplistic to attribute blame solely to this generation. Factors such as global economic trends and political decision-making have also played a significant role in shaping the current economic landscape for millennials."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the standings of the two men, the painting was received in both social and political terms. A number of writers mentioned Bertin's eventful career, in tones that were, according to art historian Andrew Carrington Shelton, either \\"bitingly sarcastic [or] fawningly reverential\\". There were many satirical reproductions and pointed editorials in the following years. Aware of Bertin's support of the July Monarchy, writers at the La Gazette de France viewed the portrait as the epitome of the \\"opportunism and cynicism\\" of the new regime. Their anonymous critic excitedly wondered \\"what bitter irony it expresses, what hardened skepticism, sarcasm and ... pronounced cynicism\\".Several critics mentioned Bertin's hands. Twentieth-century art historian Albert Boime described them as \\"powerful, vulturine ... grasping his thighs in a gesture ... projecting ... enormous strength controlled\\". Some contemporary critics were not so kind. The photographer and critic Félix Tournachon was harshly critical, and disparaged what he saw as a \\"fantastical bundle of flesh ... under which, instead of bones and muscles, there can only be intestines – this flatulent hand, the rumbling of which I can hear!\\" Bertin's hands made a different impression on the critic F. de Lagenevais, who remarked: \\"A mediocre artist would have modified them, he would have replaced those swollen joints with the cylindrical fingers of the first handy model; but by this single alteration he would have changed the expression of the whole personality ... the energetic and mighty nature\\".The work's realism attracted a large amount of commentary when it was first exhibited. Some saw it as an affront to Romanticism, others said that its small details not only showed an acute likeness, but built a psychological profile of the sitter.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please write a short summary for the following article: Donald Trump, Seeking Ambassadors, Sorts Through Competing Priorities So far, Mr. Friedman is the exception. As the intense jockeying for ambassadorships has begun among donors, loyalists to Mr. Trump and, in some cases, people close to his children, his advisers have potentially competing priorities. If Mr. Trump chooses Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets who is a longtime Republican donor and a friend of the president-elect, or someone like Peter S. Kalikow, the New York developer and Trump supporter, he would be following a familiar script. If he chooses someone like Jon M. Huntsman Jr. for Japan, Mr. Trump would be trying to match a Republican establishment figure with a region he is familiar with. Mr. Huntsman has served as ambassador to China and Singapore. If he goes for someone like Robert Pence, a Virginia developer who did not support Mr. Trump’s candidacy but who has been recommended by Vice President-elect Mike Pence, it would fall more in line with his choice of Ms. Haley and of bringing outsiders into the fold. (The two Pences are not related). The expectation is that Mr. Trump will begin by rewarding supporters with appointments to Western Europe or the Caribbean, as is often the case with new administrations. But they could also include donors to his campaign or transition, people he might need again in the future. “They generally start out more political,” said Asgeir Sigfusson, the communications director for the American Foreign Service Association. “The numbers will even out.” In previous administrations, he said, about 70 percent of nominations were foreign service professionals and 30 percent were political appointees. It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump will adhere to that breakdown, Mr. Sigfusson said. Aides to Mr. Trump declined to comment, beyond saying that discussion about candidates was in the early stages. There are some favorites among the names Mr. Trump’s advisers are batting around, however, and meetings on the subject are expected to increase in frequency starting this week. Mr. Trump’s aides are sifting through a broad list of recommendations from people involved in the transition process, including the president-elect’s daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. As a result, the suggestions have included people who did not immediately support the Trump ticket, such as Ronald J. Gidwitz, who backed Jeb Bush in the primaries. There have been some aspirational suggestions, such as Mr. Huntsman, who served as ambassador to China in the Obama administration, for Japan; or Michèle A. Flournoy, a top Pentagon official in the Obama administration, as an ambassador to NATO. The two have deep knowledge of policy and have been spoken of favorably by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief White House strategist. But a number of Mr. Trump’s top advisers oppose them. Then there are more personal recommendations from people involved in the transition. One was for Morris Goldfarb, the chief executive of the G-III Apparel Group, which had a licensing agreement for Ms. Trump’s apparel line. Another was former Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia, who has been recommended by Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, a Trump adviser. Ivana Trump, Mr. Trump’s first wife, cheekily recommended herself to The New York Post for ambassador to the Czech Republic. John Jay LaValle, chairman of the Suffolk County Republican Committee in New York and one of Mr. Trump’s few vocal defenders in the campaign’s final days, could see a plum post. And there are a raft of donors and longtime Republicans angling for appointments who could expect particularly close scrutiny by Democrats during confirmation hearings. “I think confirmation is always problematic,” said Mel Sembler, a party fund-raiser appointed ambassador to Australia by the elder President George Bush and to Italy by the younger. “The first time out, it was a long and embarrassing and difficult process,” Mr. Sembler said. Old scars become new information as senators start their review, he said. Some donors could see old troubles resurface. Mr. Kalikow, the New York developer, who filed for personal bankruptcy when he owned The New York Post more than two decades ago, has been mentioned for a possible post. So has Georgette Mosbacher, a socialite whose husband, now deceased, was the focus of a lawsuit over a flawed census count in 1990. Neither Mr. Kalikow nor Ms. Mosbacher would comment for this article. Duke Buchan, major supporter of Jeb Bush and a defender of the work of Right to Rise, the “super PAC” backing that candidate, joined the Trump effort in the summer and contributed significantly to his campaign. Mr. Buchan has expressed interest in becoming ambassador to Spain, where he says he studied and where a company he once held stock in recently owned property. He also used to own shares in a company that holds military contracts, records show. Mr. Buchan, who does not know Mr. Trump well, has had blunt discussions about how to best position himself for an ambassadorship, according to people close to the transition. He did not respond to requests for comment. Fred V. Malek, a former aide to President Richard M. Nixon and to the elder President Bush, said that being a donor did not guarantee anything. “It doesn’t mean that somebody can be a fund-raiser and just have an ambassadorship,” he said. “They have to have some credentials.” At least two prospective candidates from the donor community, according to people with direct knowledge of the discussions, are likely to end up with posts. Lewis M. Eisenberg, the Republican National Committee finance chairman who raised money with Mr. Trump’s choice for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, is seen as a possible choice for Italy. Mr. Johnson, the Jets owner, is a leading choice for Britain. Joseph Forgione, who was passed over for secretary of housing and development, has support to become ambassador to the Vatican. So does William E. Simon Jr., an ally of Rudolph W. Giuliani, who recommended him. R. Nicholas Burns, an ambassador to Greece under President Bill Clinton, said that the State Department typically put forward a list of people to consider, and that incoming presidents should be aware of their options. “I think President-elect Trump would be well advised to broaden the circle of people he consults in making these appointments,” Mr. Burns said. An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the corporate role of Morris Goldfarb. He remains the chief executive of the G-III Apparel Group, and did not recently leave that post.

The four seem to worship a bestial idol in the forest who speaks to them with a disembodied voice. The newcomers are three Parisians, Thomas (Bernard Letrou), Brigitte (Solange Pradle) and Marc (Marquis Polho), who have come to the countryside to cure the sisters of their so-called illness. They do not believe that the sisters are vampires, and don't believe in vampires at all. Thomas is a psychoanalyist, determined to cure them from their madness. He believes it has been induced by the superstitious villagers, who have driven the confused women insane with their religious symbols and persecution. He tries to convince them that crucifixes and sunlight won't harm them, and that the blind sister can actually see. He takes all of this as proof that their vampirism is all in their minds. When one of the sisters fall for Thomas' charms, the old man orders another sister to kill him, Brigitte and Marc. When this fails, he unleashes the peasants, who brutally murder all the women they can find, which also includes Brigitte. Thomas asks one of the sisters to bite him to prove her wrong, and discovers she is, in fact, a vampire, and that he was misled by his own preconceptions. The two flee to the beach and are gunned down by Marc, who is distraught by Brigitte's death at the hands of the peasants. Queen of the Vampires/The Vampire Woman[edit] The vampire queen (Jacqueline Sieger) is introduced. She briefly arrives by boat to the beach where the dead couple lies. She commands her hooded cohort to grab the old man and pin him down to the slab of rock, then proceeds to sacrifice him, and licks the knife... My question: Where does Thomas wait for death?

Yes The answer you provided, \\"A particularly hostile relationship developed with the United States and United Kingdom, resulting in the 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya and United Nations-imposed economic sanctions,\\" is a good answer to the question \\"How did the world respond to Libya in 1986?\\" because it accurately summarizes the events and actions surrounding that year's international treatment of Libya. While it is a concise answer, it nonetheless encapsulates two significant responses towards Libya during that time. The 1986 U.S. bombing of Libya, also known as Operation El Dorado Canyon, was a response to a series of terroristic activities linked to the Libyan government under Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. The operation, which occurred on April 15, 1986, targeted multiple Libyan military installations and was overseen by the Reagan Administration. The primary goal of the operation was to deter Gaddafi's support of terrorist activities and bring an end to his regime's sponsorship of such acts. This bombing attack was just one component of the hostile relationship mentioned in the answer. In addition to military force, economic sanctions were imposed by the international community, led by the United States and the United Kingdom. These sanctions were introduced through Resolution 748, adopted by the United Nations Security Council on March 31, 1992. The resolution demanded that Libya comply with the investigation and prosecution of those suspected of being involved in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland – another terror attack that was traced back to the Libyan government. The sanctions included freeze of assets, travel bans on Libyan officials, and an embargo on arms and air traffic in and out of Libya. These economic sanctions further exacerbated the strained relationships with the United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western powers. While there were other nations and entities that responded to Libya's actions in different ways, the U.S. and U.K.'s hostile relationship and the two main events – the 1986 U.S. bombing and the UN-imposed economic sanctions – are key factors in understanding the world's response to Libya in 1986."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Michael Kevin \\"Mick\\" Taylor (born 17 January 1949) is an English musician, best known as a former member of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (196669) and The Rolling Stones (196974). He has appeared on some of the Stones' classic albums including \\"Let It Bleed\\", \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and \\"Exile on Main St.\\". Since resigning from the Rolling Stones in December 1974, Taylor has worked with numerous other artists and released several solo albums. From November 2012 onwards he has participated in the Stones' \\"Reunion shows\\" in London and Newark and in the band's 50 & Counting World Tour, which included North America, Glastonbury Festival and Hyde Park in 2013. The band decided to continue in 2014 with concerts in the UAE, Far East & Australia and Europe for the 14 On Fire tour. He was ranked 37th in \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine's 2011 list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time. Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash states that Taylor had the biggest influence on him.  - Lewis Brian Hopkin Jones (28 February 1942  3 July 1969) was an English musician, the founder and the original leader of The Rolling Stones.  - Universal Music Group, Inc.

Fourteen songs that Richards wrote with the Rolling Stones' lead vocalist Mick Jagger are listed among \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine's \\"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\". The Stones are generally known for their guitar interplay of rhythm and lead (\\"weaving\\") between Richards and Brian Jones, Mick Taylor and Ronnie Wood over the years. In spite of this, Richards plays the only guitar tracks on some of their most famous songs including \\"Paint It Black\\", \\"Ruby Tuesday\\", \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\", \\"Gimme Shelter\\", and \\"Angie.\\"  - Ronald David \\"Ronnie\\" Wood (born 1 June 1947) is an English rock musician, singer, songwriter, artist and radio personality best known as a member of The Rolling Stones since 1975, as well as a member of Faces and the Jeff Beck Group.  - The Rolling Stones are an English rock band formed in London in 1962.

This was subsequently overtaken by a few other tours, but it remains The Rolling Stones' second highest grossing tour behind their 20052007 A Bigger Bang Tour.  - Forty Licks is a double compilation album by The Rolling Stones. A 40-year career-spanning retrospective, \\"Forty Licks\\" is notable for being the first retrospective to combine their formative Decca/London era of the 1960s, now licensed by ABKCO Records (on disc one), with their self-owned post-1970 material, distributed at the time by Virgin/EMI but now distributed by ABKCO's own distributor Universal Music Group (on mostly disc two).

Write an article based on this summary: The Prince of Wales dodged a hailstorm as he stepped off the train to visit Lancashire food producers. Article:","output":"Title: Prince of Wales Braves Hailstorm during Visit to Lancashire Food Producers Introduction The Prince of Wales demonstrated his unwavering support for the local food industry when he valiantly faced down a sudden hailstorm during a recent visit to Lancashire food producers. Stepping off the train amidst the volatile weather, Prince Charles continued with his goodwill visit, meeting with local artisans and sampling their products. Paragraph 1: The Royal Visit Prince Charles arrived in Lancashire via train, no doubt eager to learn more about the area's thriving food industry and eager to meet the craftsmen behind it all. Despite being welcomed by a hailstorm upon his arrival, the Prince of Wales pressed on, determined to show his support for these hardworking individuals. His visit is an important gesture that highlights the significance of local food producers for the country's economy and its people. Paragraph 2: The Resilient Spirit of Lancashire The hailstorm, though unexpected, served as an appropriate backdrop to showcase the resilience of both the Prince and the local food producers. Lancashire is known for its dedication to innovation and quality in food production, and the region's food producers embody the spirit of hard work and determination needed to succeed in this challenging industry. The Prince's determination to proceed with his visit in the face of inclement weather resonates with the very spirit that drives the Lancashire food industry. Paragraph 3: Tour and Tastings During his visit, Prince Charles was given a tour of several local food producers' facilities, meeting with the artisans and craftsmen responsible for creating the region's culinary delights. He sampled an array of products, including cheeses, meats, and baked goods. By personally tasting these goods, Prince Charles reinforces not only the high-quality output of Lancashire food producers but also the importance of preserving the traditional methods that have long characterized this region's food industry. Paragraph 4: The Importance of Local Food Industries Prince Charles's visit to Lancashire serves as a reminder of the critical role that local food producers play in regional economies. In supporting these businesses, the Prince of Wales reaffirms the crown's commitment to promoting UK commerce while also celebrating the culinary diversity that makes the country unique. It is through the enduring efforts of these craftsmen that traditional recipes can be preserved, and new culinary innovations can emerge. Conclusion Despite the unexpected hailstorm, the Prince of Wales successfully carried out his visit to Lancashire food producers, offering encouragement and support to the hardworking individuals who contribute to the area's thriving food industry. Each sampling and conversation helped to further emphasize the importance of local food production and commerce in the United Kingdom. As Prince Charles continues his tour, his determination in the face of adversity serves as an inspiration and a powerful reminder of the resilience and talent that lies within the British food industry."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which runner has a greater chance of getting a tendon injury?  Hint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).

Recommendation: Congressional oversight for intelligence-and counterterrorism-is now dysfunctional. Congress should address this problem. We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this.

Henry Hill, Jr. was born on June 11, 1943 in Manhattan, New York, to Henry Hill, Sr., an Irish immigrant and electrician, and Carmela Costa Hill, a Sicilian. The working-class family consisted of Henry and his eight siblings who grew up in Brownsville, a poorer area of the East New York section of Brooklyn. From an early age, Hill admired the local mobsters who socialized across the street from his home, including Paul Vario, a capo in the Lucchese crime family. In 1955, when Hill was 11 years old, he wandered into the cabstand across the street looking for a part-time after-school job. Hill testified against his former associates to avoid a possible execution by his crew or going to prison for his crimes. His testimony led to 50 convictions.  Jimmy Burke was given 20 years in prison for the 1978-79 Boston College point shaving scandal, involving fixing Boston College basketball games. Burke was also later sentenced to life in prison for the murder of scam artist Richard Eaton. Burke died of lung cancer while serving his life sentence, on April 13, 1996, at the age of 64.  Paul Vario received four years for helping Henry Hill obtain a no-show job to get him paroled from prison. Vario was also later sentenced to ten years in prison for the extortion of air freight companies at JFK Airport. He died of respiratory failure on November 22, 1988, at age 73 while incarcerated in the FCI Federal Prison in Fort Worth.  Hill, his wife Karen, and their two children (Gregg and Gina) entered the U.S. Marshals' Witness Protection Program in 1980, changed their names, and moved to undisclosed locations in Omaha, Nebraska; Independence, Kentucky; Redmond, Washington; and Seattle, Washington. In Seattle, Hill hosted backyard cookouts for his neighbors, and on one occasion, while under the influence of a combination of liquor and drugs, he revealed his true identity to his guests. To the ire of the federal marshals, they were forced to relocate him one final time to Sarasota, Florida. There, a few months had passed, and Hill repeated the same breach of security, causing the government to finally expel him from the Federal Witness Protection Program.

Write an article based on this summary: A rogue Venezuelan policeman who used a stolen helicopter to fire on government buildings has re-emerged at an opposition vigil.","output":"Title: Rogue Venezuelan Policeman Re-emerges at Opposition Vigil Introduction In a surprising turn of events in Venezuela, Óscar Pérez, the rogue policeman who notoriously stolen a helicopter to attack government buildings, has made a public appearance at an opposition vigil. Pérez's reappearance raises questions about his motives and the future of Venezuela's political landscape. In this article, we explore the details of this incident, discuss the context surrounding it, and analyze its potential implications for the country's ongoing crisis. Background Step 1: Summarize the helicopter incident Óscar Pérez first gained notoriety in June 2017 when he and a group of accomplices stole a helicopter from a police airbase. They used the aircraft to stage an audacious attack on the Supreme Court and Interior Ministry buildings in Caracas, launching grenades and firing shots in a brazen act of defiance against President Nicolas Maduro's government. Although the attack caused panic in the capital city, it resulted in no casualties or significant damages. Step 2: Provide context on the political situation in Venezuela Venezuela's political crisis has deep roots, with hyperinflation, food shortages, and social unrest leading to widespread dissatisfaction with the ruling regime. The opposition, led by the National Assembly, has been in a constant tussle with President Maduro and his United Socialist Party for power, leading to street protests, international pressure, and attempts to recall the president through a referendum. The Re-emergence Step 1: Describe the opposition vigil Pérez reappeared in public in early 2018, attending an opposition vigil to pay tribute to the victims of the political crisis and anti-government protests. He appeared wearing a hat with the Venezuelan flag's colors and addressed a small crowd that had gathered to show support for the opposition. Pérez's presence at the vigil brings renewed attention to his actions and the country's ongoing unrest. Step 2: Analyze Pérez's possible motives It is unclear what exactly motivated Pérez to re-emerge in such a public manner. There are various theories, with some suggesting that he is seeking redemption, while others believe that he is attempting to elevate his status as a symbol of resistance or even pursue a political career of his own. Regardless of his intentions, Pérez's reappearance at the vigil highlights the volatile situation in Venezuela and the depth of the divisions within the country. Implications Step 1: Assess the impact on the political landscape Pérez's re-emergence at the opposition vigil may not change the political landscape substantially. However, his affiliation with the opposition could potentially strengthen their narrative and enhance the pressure on Maduro's government. Furthermore, his presence might also inspire other dissidents within the security forces to take similar actions against the government, increasing the risk of further instability. Step 2: Examine the potential impact on security Aside from the political implications, Pérez's reappearance raises questions about the overall security and authority of the Venezuelan government. His initial helicopter attack demonstrated the ability of opponents to penetrate government security measures and acquire resources like military-grade hardware. The fact that Pérez remains at large despite a highly publicized manhunt underscores the challenge that the Maduro government faces in maintaining control over the country. Conclusion Óscar Pérez's return to the public eye at an opposition vigil is a stark reminder of the deep divisions and unrest within Venezuela. While his motives for re-emerging remain uncertain, his actions and the government's inability to apprehend him serve as a testament to the volatile and precarious nature of the political climate. As the country continues to grapple with a severe economic crisis and political divisions, the risk of further upheaval remains very real."},{"instruction":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What's the full name of the person who invites Matt to a party? , can you please find it?   Matt Franklin is a recent MIT graduate who works at a Los Angeles Suncoast Video store in 1988 while trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life, something that his police officer father has grown impatient with. While working one day, Matt's high school crush, Tori Frederking walks into the store. After pretending that he doesn't work there and saying that he works at Goldman Sachs in an effort to impress her, Tori invites Matt to a Labor Day party, hosted by Matt's twin sister Wendy's boyfriend, Kyle Masterson, at his hillside home. Later that night, Matt, Wendy, and Matt's best friend, Barry Nathan, head to the party. On the drive over, Barry steals a brand new Mercedes-Benz convertible from the car dealership he got fired from earlier that day, justifying his actions by saying that Matt needs the convertible if he really wants to impress Tori. The trio arrive at the party. While there, Matt catches up with an old classmate (who actually works at Goldman Sachs) and then awkwardly tries to woo Tori. Barry snorts some cocaine he found in the glove box of the stolen convertible and gets involved in a dance-off, and Wendy's boyfriend proposes to her in front of everyone at the party. She says yes, upsetting Matt, who doesn't think that Kyle will support her in her dream to attend graduate school at the University of Cambridge. Tori eventually invites Matt and Barry to another party her boss is hosting in Beverly Hills. Matt takes Tori there in the Mercedes, while Barry rides with her two friends in another car, using the cocaine as an enticement to let him go along. Barry has a wild sexual encounter with an older woman while Matt and Tori continue to mingle with each other, after Matt's successful 'put down' of Tori's boss, a habitual sexual harasser.

Movie title: The Bat Context: Vincent Price and Gavin Gordon in The Bat Cornelia Van Gorder (Agnes Moorehead) is a mystery author who lives in a town terrorized by a mysterious murderer known only as \\"The Bat\\". The Bat is said to be a man with no face who murders women at night by ripping out their throats with steel claws. Early in the film, The Bat enters Van Gorder's house and releases a bat, which bites van Gorder's maid Lizzy (Lenita Lane). With Lizzy in a panic, fearing she may now have contracted \\"the rabies\\", an outbreak of which local papers have reported, Van Gorder calls her doctor, Dr Malcolm Wells (Vincent Price), who is conducting research on bats. Meanwhile, the whole town is searching for a million-dollar stash of looted bank securities that were recently stolen. Dr. Wells discovers the location of the treasure when the thief confides in him. Wells then murders the thief in cold blood, presumably so that he can take the treasure for himself, which he believes to be hidden in van Gorder's house. A series of break-ins and murders by The Bat brings the local chief of detectives, Andy Anderson (Gavin Gordon) to the Van Gorder house. The Bat then murders two people in the Van Gorder house, Mark Fleming (John Bryant) and Judy Hollander (Darla Hood). Anderson attempts to determine the identity of The Bat, suspecting both Wells and Van Gorder's new butler, Warner (John Sutton). Wells is removed from suspicion, however, when he is murdered by The Bat in his lab. Van Gorder cleverly manages to capture The Bat inside the secret room in her house. The Bat shoots a detective named Davenport (Robert Williams), and is then shot by Warner. Warner unmasks The Bat and he is revealed to be Lieutenant Anderson.

Summarize: Fill a lawn roller ¾ full of water and walk it over the entire sod. This presses down the sod to ensure good root contact with the soil before watering. Keeping the grass moist during the first few weeks is essential. During this time, the grass roots are establishing and growing. Without plenty of water, this process will slow or halt, and the sod die before it takes. After the first two weeks, water the grass a few times a week to keep it from drying out.  Use a sprinkler system to ensure the grass gets evenly watered. Don't wait until the grass looks brown to water it. Do a soil test by sticking your finger into the dirt. If the soil feels moist to a depth of several inches, it's fine. If the dirt feels dry on the surface or to a depth of an inch or two, it's time to water it. Shade-grown grass should be watered less frequently, since it holds dew longer. Water just to the point of puddling, then stop. If the sod lifts up off the soil, it has been overwatered. Mowing before the roots are well established can pull them out of the soil and damage your sod. Wait patiently until the grass is at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) tall, and gently pull up on several areas of sod to confirm it is firmly attached. Once the lawn is ready, mow it down to no shorter than ⅔ of its height, and never below 2 inches (5 cm).  Always be sure the mower blades are sharp, straight and clean, Mow in a different directional pattern each time the grass is mowed to ensure even growth. You can bag the clippings, but leaving them on the lawn will actually improve its health, since they act as free fertilizer. Use the same starter fertilizer to dress the lawn after a month has passed. This is necessary to replace the nutrients that may have been washed away during a month of heavy watering. After the first month, you need only fertilize your grass once or twice a season to replace nutrients in the years to come. Keeping up with watering, mowing and fertilizing your lawn is the best way to grow thick, healthy grass, and it's also the best way to keep weeds away. Weeds tend to move in when the grass gets patchy. They're nature's way of covering up bare spots in the ground. If you make sure there aren't bare spots to begin with, you won't have to worry much about weeds. If you notice an area where the sod seems to be dead, replace it as soon as possible. Tear up the old sod, enrich the soil underneath with compost, and add fresh sod, making sure the seams lay right next to the healthy grass on either side. This will prevent weeds from coming up where the sod is dead.","output":"To establish a healthy lawn using sod, follow these important steps:  1. Start by filling a lawn roller to ¾ of its capacity with water and walk it over the entire sod area. This helps press the sod down, ensuring its roots make good contact with the soil. 2. For the first few weeks, it is crucial to keep the grass moist, as the roots are establishing and growing. Water the lawn sufficiently to promote healthy root growth and prevent the sod from drying out or dying. 3. After the initial two weeks, maintain the lawn's moisture by watering it a few times a week. Use a sprinkler system for even distribution of water. Regularly check the soil's moisture levels with your finger. If it feels dry on the surface or at a depth of 1-2 inches, it's time to water. 4. Grass that grows in shaded areas typically requires less frequent watering, as it holds dew for more extended periods. Water just enough to avoid puddling and overwatering, which can cause the sod to lift off the soil. 5. Avoid mowing the lawn until the grass is at least 3 inches tall and the sod is firmly attached to the soil. Once the lawn is ready, only cut it down to no shorter than ⅔ of its height and never lower than 2 inches. Ensure you use sharp, clean, and straight mower blades. Additionally, alternate mowing patterns to promote even growth. 6. Although bagging clippings is an option, leaving them on the lawn can improve its health, acting as a natural fertilizer. 7. After a month has passed, apply the same starter fertilizer to replace nutrients possibly washed away because of heavy watering. In the future, you only need to fertilize the lawn once or twice a season. 8. Consistently maintain your lawn by watering, mowing, and fertilizing. This practice ensures thick, healthy grass growth and naturally keeps weeds at bay, as they tend to thrive in patchy areas. 9. If you spot any dead sod, replace it promptly. Remove the old sod, enrich the soil with compost, and install new sod while ensuring the seams are aligned with the healthy grass on either side. This prevents weeds from invading the dead sod area. By adhering to these guidelines, you will be able to establish a strong, healthy, and weed-free lawn from sod, ensuring optimal growth and long-term maintenance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

U.S. law enforcement agencies and Silicon Valley are getting ready to face off on the issue of privacy. This latest battle is focused on a 30-year-old law on government access to electronic communications and associated data. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act was a forward-looking statute when enacted in 1986, but technology has dramatically outpaced the ECPA. The U.S. Congress has been looking into ways to revise the law in order to preserve the privacy of internet users while also preserving the legal tools necessary for government agencies to enforce the law and protect the public. The late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis called privacy \\"the most comprehensive of rights, and the right most valued by a free people.\\" The Senate Judiciary Committee this week is considering an amendment to the ECPA that would expand the government's ability to collect data using a National Security Letter, which doesn't require a court order. The amendment would authorize the FBI to demand a person's internet browser history and internet protocol address, enabling investigators to see what websites a person visits, how much time is spent on a particular site and the location of the internet user — all without judicial oversight. The FBI contends that such data is covered implicitly under current statute, which was written years ago and only explicitly covers data normally associated with telephone records. FBI Director James Comey has said the amendment is needed to fix \\"a typo\\" in the ECPA that has hindered the bureau's ability to work in \\"a very, very big and practical way.\\" But a letter sent earlier this week warned Congress that such an amendment is opposed by tech giants and civil liberties organizations. \\"This expansion of the NSL statute has been characterized by some government officials as merely fixing ‘a typo' in the law,” the letter said. \\"In reality, however, it would dramatically expand the ability of the FBI to get sensitive information about users' online...

The statement attributed to Schwarz-Schilling highlights the development of an economic community in Southeast Europe due to the establishment of free trade practices. The process of free trade allows countries to engage in commerce with one another without the interference of tariffs, import quotas, and other trade restrictions. This sort of economic cooperation is essential for fostering economic growth, increasing efficiency, and promoting international relationships among countries in the region. As a result of these efforts, Southeast Europe (a region that includes countries such as Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Greece, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia) has experienced the growth of a thriving economic community. The increased exchange of goods, services, and investments among these countries has helped to strengthen their economies and establish new business opportunities, which leads to higher employment and improved living standards for the citizens of Southeast Europe. Having a recognized economic community can also help these countries to collectively negotiate better trade agreements and secure favorable market access conditions with countries outside their region. This can lead to increased exports and a stronger presence on the global market stage. Furthermore, the development of an economic community in Southeast Europe can contribute to political stability, as it encourages countries to work together for their common economic interests. This cooperation can help to reduce the likelihood of conflicts and promote stronger diplomatic relationships among these nations. Overall, the statement highlights that the process of free trade in Southeast Europe has led to the creation of a recognized and flourishing economic community.

A: Pick your answer from: -- stays the same. -- reduces. -- mutates. -- increases. A:","output":"As temperature increases, the solubility of the majority of solid substances typically increases. This phenomenon is related to the behavior of solid substances and their solute particles in a solvent when energy in the form of heat is applied. When a solid solute dissolves in a solvent, the particles of the solid separate and disperse throughout the solvent, and the process involves the conversion of the solute-solute interactions into solute-solvent interactions. This transformation is facilitated by the heat energy that increases the kinetic energy of the particles, allowing them to move faster and separate from each other. Besides, applying heat can disrupt intermolecular forces within the solute, such as ionic, covalent, and van der Waals bonds. Meanwhile, the increased kinetic energy also helps the solute particles collide more frequently with solvent particles, which further enhances the solute's dissolution process. However, the relationship between temperature and solubility is not always linear or uniform among all solid substances. The solubility of specific substances, such as certain salts, may decrease with an increase in temperature. Additionally, the solubility of gases in a solvent typically decreases as temperature increases due to the increased kinetic energy causing a higher tendency of gases to escape the solution. Nevertheless, the general observation remains valid for the majority of solid substances – as temperature increases, solubility increases as well. This principle lays the foundation for numerous applications across different industries, ranging from pharmaceuticals to food processing and climate science."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background: Alaska Natives are indigenous peoples of Alaska, United States: Inupiat, Yupik, Aleut, Eyak, Tlingit, Haida, Tsimshian, and a number of Northern Athabaskan cultures. They are often defined by their language groups. Many Alaska Natives are enrolled in federally recognized Alaska Native tribal entities, who in turn belong to 13 Alaska Native Regional Corporations, who administer land and financial claims. Ancestors of the Alaska Natives are known to have migrated into the area thousands of years ago, in at least two different waves. Context: Arriving from Siberia by ship in the mid-eighteenth century, Russians began to trade with Alaska Natives. New settlements around trading posts were started by Russians, including Russian Orthodox missionaries. These were the first to translate Christian scripture into Native languages. British and American traders generally did not reach the area until the nineteenth century, and in some cases missionaries were not active until the twentieth century. In the 21st century, the numerous congregations of Russian Orthodox Christians in Alaska are generally composed mostly of Alaska Natives.  Rather than hunting the marine life, the Russians forced the Aleuts to do the work for them. As word spread of the riches in furs to be had, competition among Russian companies increased and they forced the Aleuts into slavery. Catherine the Great, who became Empress in 1763, proclaimed good will toward the Aleut and urged her subjects to treat them fairly. On some islands and parts of the Alaska Peninsula, groups of traders had been capable of relatively peaceful coexistence with the local inhabitants. Other groups could not manage the tensions. Russians took hostages, families were split up, and individuals were forced to leave their villages and settle elsewhere. The growing competition between the trading companies, merging into fewer, larger and more powerful corporations, created conflicts that aggravated the relations with the indigenous populations. Over the years, the situation became catastrophic for the natives.  As the animal populations declined, the Aleuts, already too dependent on the new barter economy created by the Russian fur trade, were increasingly coerced into taking greater risks in the dangerous waters of the North Pacific to hunt for more otter. As the Shelikhov-Golikov Company and later Russian-American Company developed as a monopoly, it used skirmishes and systematic violence as a tool of colonial exploitation of the indigenous people. When the Aleut revolted and won some victories, the Russians retaliated, killing many and destroying their boats and hunting gear, leaving them no means of survival.  The most devastating effects were from disease: during the first two generations (1741/1759-1781/1799 AD) of Russian contact, 80 percent of the Aleut population died from Eurasian infectious diseases. These were then endemic among the Europeans, but the Aleut had no immunity against the new diseases. Question: What did they trade?. Whats the answer?","output":"The Russians and Alaska Natives traded mostly in furs. The Alaska Natives, specifically the Aleuts, were skilled at hunting animals like sea otters for their valuable fur. The Russians wanted these furs to sell them and make money. In exchange, the Alaska Natives received goods and items brought by the Russians."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Read this article and answer this question Gaozong promoted Qin Hui in 1138 and put him in charge of deliberations with the Jin. Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and a large number of officials at court criticized the peace overtures. Aided by his control of the Censorate, Qin purged his enemies and continued negotiations. In 1138 the Jin and Song agreed to a treaty that designated the Yellow River as border between the two states and recognized Gaozong as a \\"subject\\" of the Jin. But because there remained opposition to the treaty in both the courts of the Jin and Song, the treaty never came into effect. A Jurchen army led by Wuzhu invaded in early 1140. The Song counteroffensive that followed achieved large territorial gains. Song general Liu Qi  won a battle against Wuzhu at Shunchang . Yue Fei was assigned to head the Song forces defending the Huainan region. Instead of advancing to Huainan, however, Wuzhu retreated to Kaifeng and Yue's army followed him into Jin territory, disobeying an order by Gaozong that forbade Yue from going on the offensive. Yue captured Zhengzhou and sent soldiers across the Yellow River to stir up a peasant rebellion against the Jin. On July 8, 1140, at the Battle of Yancheng, Wuzhu launched a surprise attack on Song forces with an army of 100,000 infantry and 15,000 horsemen. Yue Fei directed his cavalry to attack the Jurchen soldiers and won a decisive victory. He continued on to Henan, where he recaptured Zhengzhou and Luoyang.

The original premise, \\"well uh what do you know what the last repair was uh that that you had done to your car,\\" does not specifically provide information about when the last repair was completed. The speaker seems to be asking what the last repair was, which implies what type of repair or service the car had undergone, not when that repair happened.

Instead, a more accurate hypothesis based on the original premise would be, \\"Regarding your vehicle, what was the last repair performed?\\" It appears that the person asking the question is interested in the nature of the last repair, rather than the time it was completed.

Can we draw the following conclusion?

While the premise introduces a former philosophy teacher and author of Sophie's World, it doesn't provide any information about their views on the Jurassic Park franchise. The author of Sophie's World is Jostein Gaarder. He is indeed a former philosophy teacher, and his book was an unexpected international success. However, while the book deals with philosophical questions and historical knowledge about philosophy, it doesn't offer critiques or assessments on popular media franchises like Jurassic Park. The premise of your argument suggests that a former philosophy teacher, known for writing Sophie's World, had an opinion on the Jurassic Park franchise. Gaarder can indeed be considered \\"a former philosophy teacher,\\" but I am not aware of any source that documents his opinions on the Jurassic Park franchise. To expound further, Jurassic Park, a well-known media franchise, began with Michael Crichton's 1990 novel and was adapted into a movie by Steven Spielberg. It has since generated numerous sequels, video games, and merchandise, becoming one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. The quality of the franchise's installments, as with most long-running series, is often subject to debate among fans and critics.  Given that Jostein Gaarder's specialties lie in philosophy and literature, not cinema or paleobiology, it would be unusual for him to comment specifically on this franchise's trajectory. His statements about the Jurassic Park franchise are not widely documented, if they exist at all. To connect Gaarder more clearly with Jurassic Park, you would need a direct quote or a reliable source reporting his words. Without this evidence, you can't, unfortunately, draw the conclusion that \\"A former philosophy teacher once said the Jurassic Park franchise started out stronger than it ended.\\"  To sum it all, it would be incorrect to draw this conclusion based solely on the details provided in the premise.

Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew. Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it. This was a rather foolish assumption—especially since she's an educator, not a psychiatrist, especially with how skilled I am at wearing the mask of calm, the face of sanity. “You seem great, Julie.

The fight matches typically consist of several rounds and take place in an arena, while each character has widely differing abilities but each is relatively viable to choose. Players must master techniques such as blocking, counter-attacking, and chaining attacks together into \\"combos\\". Since the early 1990s, most fighting games allow the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations. The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups, which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player.  - The action game is a video game genre that emphasizes physical challenges, including handeye coordination and reaction-time. The genre includes diverse subgenres such as fighting games, shooter games and platform games which are widely considered the most important action games, though some real-time strategy games are also considered to be action games.  - The Astyanax , known in Japan as The Lord of King (        ) , is a side - scrolling action game developed by Aicom released for the arcades by Jaleco . A home version for the Nintendo Entertainment System , simply titled Astyanax , was released during the same time as the arcade version .  - A Platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to advance the game. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternative like swiping in touchscreen. \\"Jumping\\", in this genre, may include swinging from extendable arms, as in \\"Ristar\\" or \\"Bionic Commando\\", or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in \\"Alpha Waves\\". These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called \\"platforming\\", a verbification of \\"platform\\". Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" series, fall outside of the genre.  - Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo then developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over 85 billion. From 1992 until 2016, Nintendo was also the majority shareholder of Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - Aicom was a Japanese video game developer, founded in 1988, possibly by a group that left Irem and Jaleco. Despite evidence to support this, the Sammy corporate website lists 1990 as the first year and that it was a subsidiary. It was bought by Sega Sammy Holdings in 1992.  - Shooter games are a subgenre of action game, which often test the player's speed and reaction time. It includes many subgenres that have the commonality of focusing on the actions of the avatar using some sort of weapon. Usually this weapon is a gun, or some other long-range weapon. A common resource found in many shooter games is ammunition. Most commonly, the purpose of a shooter game is to shoot opponents and proceed through missions without the player character being killed or dying. A shooting game is a genre of video game where the player has limited spatial control of his or her character, and the focus is almost entirely on the defeat of the character's enemies using long-range weaponry.   - The Sega Sammy logo is a design based on the letter S, the initial letter of both companies names. The synergy generated by the integration of the two companies are represented by a combination of blue and green, which are the companies corporate colors. Furthermore, In the logo, a curved line that suggests the horizon linking the words Sega and Sammy symbolizes the companies collaboration, and the Sega Sammy Groups determination to develop globally.  - The Nintendo Entertainment System (commonly abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit home video game console that was developed and manufactured by Nintendo.

Cecil Fredricks (Dick Van Dyke), an elderly night security guard about to retire from the American Museum of Natural History, hires Larry despite his unpromising rÃ©sumÃ©. The museum, which is rapidly losing money, plans to replace Cecil and two colleagues Gus (Mickey Rooney) and Reginald (Bill Cobbs) with one guard.

Fans of the children’s television show “SpongeBob SquarePants” are calling on Super Bowl organizers to have the song “Sweet Victory” sung during the game’s halftime show.      The petition, which had garnered more than 31,000 signatures on Change.org as of Friday, comes in the wake of show creator Stephen Hillenburg death's earlier this week after a battle with ALS.      “As some of you may or may not know, Stephen Hillenburg—the creator of Spongebob Sqaurepants—has passed away recently,” the petition read. “As a tribute to his legacy, his contributions to a generation of children, and to truly showcase the greatness of this song, we call for Sweet Victory to be performed at the Halftime Show.”      SpongeBob’s rendition of “Sweet Victory” was performed on the episode “Band Geeks,” which aired in the show’s second season in 2001. The cartoon sponge and his bandmates sang it at halftime of the fictional bubble bowl. David Glen Eisley, who originally sang the song, voiced SpongeBob during the musical performance.      The Super Bowl will take place on Feb. 3 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. Maroon 5 is reportedly slated to be in the halftime show.      Fox News’ Sasha Savitsky and Tyler McCarthy contributed to this report. ||||| Screenshot via Nick.com      On Monday, marine biologist-turned-SpongeBob Squarepants creator Stephen Hillenburg died at 57. Hillenburg's iconic cartoon about a porous yellow rectangle brought some light and optimism to our dark world, and even taught at least one kid how to do the Heimlich maneuver. So in honor of his passing, one brilliant fan hatched a plan to celebrate Hillenburg in the best way he knew how: by getting the song from that episode where Spongebob plays a halftime show into the actual 2019 Super Bowl.      The fan, Isreal Colunga, hopped on Change.org and launched a petition calling for \\"Sweet Victory\\" to be featured in the upcoming halftime show \\"as a tribute to [Hillenburg's] legacy, his contributions to a generation of children, and to truly showcase the greatness of this song.\\" Apparently, the world agreed—the petition has already pulled in more than 50,000 signatures since it launched on Tuesday, and it's still climbing.      For those pitiful few who don't know the entire SpongeBob oeuvre by heart, the song comes from an episode called \\"Band Geeks,\\" in which SpongeBob and the gang venture up onto dry land to perform during halftime at the Bubble Bowl.      \\"Sweet Victory\\" is a truly ripping 80s power ballad, like something Foreigner might've written in their heyday if they woke up one morning magically transformed into cartoon sea creatures, and by God, it is exactly the thing the Super Bowl halftime show needs.      \\"It's a hugely inspirational song that I listen to when working out and boosting confidence, but besides that I want it played at the Super Bowl to honor the man who gave us one of the greatest and most quotable cartoons of all time,\\" a petition supporter named Jonathan Hersey said. \\"I need it,\\" another wrote simply.      The version of \\"Sweet Victory\\" that aired in SpongeBob was performed by a guy named David Glen Eisley. Unfortunately, Eisley probably won't be playing the halftime show no matter how many signatures this petition gets, since Maroon 5 is already set to perform.      But given that halftime shows historically just feature bands playing medleys of their most popular songs, along with the fact that Maroon 5 has never written anything that reaches the epic heights of \\"Sweet Victory\\" over the course of the band's entire career, maybe the petition will inspire Adam Levine to belt out a few lines of the song in Hillenburg's honor. At least 50,000 people out there know it's the right thing to do.      Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They ask distinct aspects of tourist destinations. I will individually provide detailed answers to each question to help clarify the differences. 1. What are the world's deadliest tourist destinations? The world's deadliest tourist destinations typically combine an element of risk with natural beauty or historic interest, drawing in intrepid travelers. Here are some of the most dangerous tourist destinations: a. Mount Everest, Nepal: The highest mountain in the world, Mount Everest is a challenging climb with extreme weather conditions and altitude-related dangers, such as avalanches and frostbite. Over 300 people have died attempting to conquer its summit. b. Death Valley, USA: This desert valley in California is infamous for its  extreme heat, which can reach up to 130°F (54°C). Dehydration, heatstroke, and other heat-related risks make this area dangerous for unprepared travelers. c. New Smyrna Beach, Florida: Despite its picturesque beauty, the waters off this Floridian beach have the highest number of shark attacks worldwide, earning it the nickname \\"Shark Attack Capital of the World.\\" d. Acapulco, Mexico: A popular beach city known for its vibrant nightlife, Acapulco has made headlines in recent years for high crime rates, including violent crimes that pose risks to tourists. e. Snake Island, Brazil: Officially named Ilha da Queimada Grande, this island off the coast of Brazil is home to an estimated 4,000 venomous golden lancehead pit vipers. The island is off-limits to visitors due to the high risk of snake bites. f. Danakil Desert, Ethiopia: With its blazing temperatures, volcanic activity, and toxic gases, this inhospitable region offers a beautiful but treacherous landscape to intrepid visitors. 2. Which countries are most unexplored tourist destinations? Unexplored tourist destinations are often those that have remained relatively untouched by mass tourism, offering travelers the opportunity to experience something unique. Here are some of the most unexplored tourist destinations: a. Bhutan: Nestled between China and India, this small, predominantly Buddhist country has preserved its cultural heritage and pristine landscapes by limiting the number of tourists and imposing daily fees for visitors. b. Turkmenistan: Central Asia's enigmatic destination remains mostly unexplored, with highlights like the white marble city of Ashgabat, the Darvaza Gas Crater (The Door to Hell), and ancient ruins of Merv. c. Papua New Guinea: With limited infrastructure and facilities, this island nation in the Pacific Ocean boasts an incredible variety of landscapes and cultures, from dense rainforests to remote highland tribes. d. São Tomé and Príncipe: These tropical islands off the west coast of Africa offer an experience of pristine beaches, lush forests, and unique wildlife, including marine turtle nesting sites and endemic bird species. e. Belarus: Rising as an offbeat European destination, Belarus showcases striking architecture from the Soviet era, vast national parks, and a fascinating cultural dynamic between traditional and modern influences. To summarize, the first question focuses on the most dangerous places that attract tourists due to their adventurous nature or unique features. In contrast, the second question addresses lesser-known, unexplored destinations that haven't been impacted by mass tourism and provide an exclusive, uncharted experience. These two questions are not paraphrases of each other since they explore different aspects of tourist destinations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Former Division I collegiate wrestler Scott Voss is a 42-year-old bored and disillusioned biology teacher at the failing Wilkinson High School.  Budget cutbacks at the school jeopardize the continuation of its music program, which would result in its teacher, Marty Streb, being laid off.  Concerned for both his colleague and his students, Scott attempts to raise the 48,000 necessary to keep the music program alive.  He moonlights as a night instructor for an adult citizenship class, where student Niko asks him for outside tutoring.  When Scott arrives at Niko's apartment, he learns that Niko was a former mixed martial arts fighter.  While watching the UFC at Niko's apartment, Scott learns that the loser of a fight receives 10,000, which gives him the idea of raising the money by fighting and losing in MMA. Scott, helped by Niko and Marty, begins with small unsanctioned bouts paying only 750 to the loser.  Niko begins training him in defense, later adding trainer Mark to teach offense, after Scott knocks out an opponent and realizes that wins give larger payouts, needing fewer fights to achieve his 48,000 goal. While Mark trains with Scott, Malia De La Cruz, one of Scott's students and a band member, helps Niko study for his citizenship test by putting the information into songs. Scott then begins fighting in small MMA fights and gradually gaining higher amounts of money for the school.

When she got home she put one bag of ice in the sink and another in the freezer, but then was distracted by a phone call and forgot to put the other bag in the freezer. When she returned, the bag of ice had melted.  Was the temperature of the melted bag higher or lower than the temperature of the frozen bag? The answer to this question is:","output":"The temperature of the melted bag would be higher than the temperature of the frozen bag.  When Susan left the bag of ice out, the ice began to melt due to the room temperature being higher than the freezing point of water (0°C or 32°F). As the ice absorbed heat energy from the surrounding environment, it gradually changed from a solid to a liquid state. This process of melting increased the temperature of the ice to reach the room temperature.  On the other hand, the bag of ice placed in the freezer remains at a lower temperature, which is below 0°C or 32°F, since the freezer's purpose is to maintain temperatures at or below the freezing point to prevent food from spoiling and to keep frozen items in their solid state.

It was written in 1908 by Jack Norworth and composed by Albert Von Tilzer, both of whom were prolific Tin Pan Alley songwriters of their time. Jack Norworth, whose full name is John Godfrey Knauff, was an American songwriter, lyricist, and performer. Born in Philadelphia on January 5, 1879, he is best known for writing the lyrics to \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\" and several other hit songs. Despite penning the lyrics to a song about baseball, it is interesting to note that Norworth had never actually attended a professional baseball game until more than 30 years after the song was written, in 1940. Albert Von Tilzer, born Albert Gumm on March 29, 1878, in Indianapolis, was the brother of another successful Tin Pan Alley composer, Harry Von Tilzer. Albert adopted the \\"Von Tilzer\\" moniker as a stage name, implying a noble European origin. Throughout his career, he wrote and composed music for numerous popular songs. In addition to collaborating with Jack Norworth on \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game,\\" his other famous works include \\"Put Your Arms Around Me, Honey\\" and \\"I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time.\\" \\"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\\" quickly gained popularity after its original publication and is now firmly entrenched in American baseball culture.

Kronos and his companion, the hunchback Hieronymus Grost, are professional vampire hunters. Grost explains to the initially sceptical Marcus that the dead women are victims of a vampire who drains not blood but youth, and that there are \\"as many species of vampire as there are beasts of prey.\\" The discovery of another victim confirms Grost's explanation. Along the way, Kronos and Grost take in a local barefoot girl, Carla, who had been sentenced to the stocks for dancing on the Sabbath. She repays them by helping them hunt the vampire; she later becomes Kronos' lover. Grost and Kronos conduct a mystical test that indicates the presence of vampires. Their findings are contradicted by an eyewitness who claims to have seen \\"someone old, very old\\", whereas a youth-draining vampire should appear youthful. Marcus visits the family of his late friend, Lord Hagen Durward, and speaks with Durward's son, Paul (Shane Briant), and his beautiful sister Sara (Lois Daine). He must leave before speaking with the bed-ridden Lady Durward. While riding through the woods, Marcus encounters a cloaked figure that leaves him shaken, and he finds blood on his lips. At a tavern, Kronos defeats thugs led by Kerro, who were hired by Lady Durward's coachman to murder him. Kronos, Grost, Marcus and Carla set up a network of alarm bells in the woods to announce the passage of vampires. Meanwhile, a large bat attacks and kills a young woman. Marcus realises that he has become a vampire and begs Kronos to kill him. After various methods (including impalement with a stake and hanging) fail, Kronos accidentally pierces Marcus's chest with a cross of steel that Marcus had been wearing round his neck. Having thus determined the vampireâs weakness, Kronos and Grost obtain an iron cross from a cemetery. They are accosted by angry villagers who believe that they murdered Dr. Marcus. Grost forges the cross into... My question: Who does Kronos tries to kill by staking and then hanging?

Context: The amazing December turnaround of the Philadelphia Eagles continued with another road win over a division rival. Philadelphia's surprising 23-7 Christmas Day victory over the Dallas Cowboys was broadcast on national television and clinched a playoff spot. Jeff Garcia, who outshined fellow backup-turned starting quarterback Tony Romo, led the Eagles to scores on four of their first five possessions. Capping off their first drive, which took 7:12 off the clock, Garcia hit tight end Matt Schobel for a 25-yard touchdown. Cowboys' return man Miles Austin fumbled the ensuing kickoff to Quintin Mikell. However, Dallas cornerback Anthony Henry intercepted Garcia and the Cowboys drove to the Eagles' 1-yard line. From there, the Philadelphia defense stuffed Dallas goal-line back Marion Barber III on three straight plays. The ball turned over on downs and Garcia promptly found Dont&#233; Stallworth for a 39-yard gain. The drive finished with a David Akers field goal and the Eagles led 10-0. Romo and the Cowboys responded with a 14-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens, who only caught two passes for 23 yards on the game. With only&#160;:29 seconds left in the half, Garcia got the Eagles into field goal range, and David Akers connected on a 45-yarder to make it 13-7 as time expired. On the opening drive of the third quarter, Garcia beat a Dallas blitz and completed a 65-yard catch and run to L.J. Smith. Philadelphia finished the drive with another field goal and it was 16-7. Early in the fourth quarter, Brian Dawkins made an over the shoulder interception in front of Owens in the end zone. On a 6:57 drive that included ten running plays and broke the Cowboys' backs, Correll Buckhalter pounded it in from one yard out, increasing the lead to 23-7. Romo would throw another interception, this one to Lito Sheppard, and the Eagles' domination of the Dallas offense continued for the rest of the game. The Eagles ran the ball a whopping 42 times for 204 yards (with Brian Westbrook accounting for 122 of those yards), while Garcia and the passing game gained 238 yards. The defense recorded three sacks in addition to the two interceptions and held Dallas to a meager 201 total yards on their own turf. Philadelphia clinches a playoff berth, and now suddenly controls the NFC East and can win the division with a win over the Atlanta Falcons or a Dallas loss. With another victory, the Eagles moved up to 9-6. Question: How many total points were scored in the first half? Answer:","output":"In the first half, a total of 20 points were scored. The Eagles scored 13 points and the Cowboys scored 7 points."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

The news comes as Plymouth Hospitals Trust in Devon confirmed it has been on the alert - the highest level the NHS has - since early January. Yeovil Hospital in Somerset is also now on the alert, while hospitals in Exeter and Dorset are under pressure. The alert indicates a hospital has officially confirmed its services are overwhelmed by demand. Extension of it comes after the Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust confirmed it was on the alert status, last Tuesday. The last time hospitals were this busy was six years ago, NHS England says. Almost all hospitals in the region have seen sharp increases in patients and they're finding it increasingly difficult to cope. Derriford now admits that, since the start of the year, it has been in \\"critical internal incident mode\\", jargon for the highest level of escalation - or a state of \\"black.\\" The majority of emergency  admissions are older people with respiratory problems. One exacerbating factor may be that this season's flu vaccine is largely ineffective against the strain of the virus currently in circulation. Austerity has also taken its toll. Despite a cash injection to help manage \\"winter pressures\\", years of flat incomes have dented hospitals'  resilience, while spending cuts by hard-pressed councils mean less money for the care packages needed to allow frailer patients to be sent home after treatment. A spokesman for Plymouth Hospitals Trust said: \\"Since the end of December, we have faced unprecedented and sustained demand on our emergency and medical services, which has impacted right across the hospital.\\" The spokesman said the hospital had been in \\"critical internal incident mode\\" since early January, which is nationally recognised as a \\"black alert\\". Torbay and the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital has been on red alert for the past week and Dorset County Hospital has announced a red alert - one level below black. Kevin Baber, chief operating officer at Plymouth Hospitals Trust, said \\"a number of operations\\" had been cancelled. In a statement on the trust's website, he said: \\"As more patients are admitted from the emergencyâ€ˆdepartment onto wards, beds get taken up. \\"This means we don't have beds available for those patients coming in for planned operations, with a particular lack of critical care beds, and therefore we have to cancel their surgery.\\" Ben Bradshaw, Labour MP for Exeter and former health minister, said he was told the volume of patients being admitted to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital had led to the cancellation of all operations on one day. He said: \\"This is very worrying and it shows the unprecedented pressure that our hospitals and our A&E departments in particular, are under.\\" At the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, which covers St Michael's in Hayle, West Cornwall Hospital in Penzance and The Royal Cornwall at Treliske, 280 beds have been blocked so far by people who were fit to leave but had no care package in place.

Austerity measures and spending cuts on care packages for frailer patients have also played a role in reducing hospital resilience. Consequently, hospitals have had to cancel surgeries and face critical bed shortages, creating concern among healthcare professionals and politicians."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

One key factor in successful emotional healing is the ability to embrace our independence and detach ourselves from the sources of our pain, which can be achieved through a series of actionable and empowering coping strategies. In this article, we will discuss the importance of letting yourself grieve, turning on the water works, exercising regularly, and surrounding yourself with people who love, care for, and understand you. 1. Let Yourself Grieve  Acknowledging the loss or change that has affected your emotional well-being is the first essential step in the healing process. It is crucial to allow yourself to experience the pain and sadness that come with grieving as bottling up these emotions will only prolong your suffering. While it may be tempting to put on a brave face and suppress the emotions, opening up to them and experiencing them fully enables you to start healing. 2. Embrace Your Independence  As you begin to heal emotionally, embracing your independence becomes increasingly crucial in achieving long-term mental and emotional stability. Nurturing your own self-reliance and inner strength during this time allows you to explore your unique passions, interests, and values while fostering a renewed sense of self-worth and self-confidence. Engaging in activities and hobbies that bring joy and satisfaction is an essential aspect of establishing a healthy sense of independence. 3. Detach Yourself  Detaching yourself from the source of your emotional pain is not only necessary but also a liberating experience since it enables you to break free from negative influences and situations that could potentially hinder your healing process. Keep in mind that detachment is not synonymous with avoidance or indifference, but rather an acknowledgement that you need to prioritize your own well-being. Establishing firm boundaries, setting rational expectations, and practicing self-compassion are invaluable tools that will help you in the process of detachment. 4. Turn on the Water Works  Crying is a natural and effective way to release bottled up emotions and process your feelings. Turning on the water works during your emotional healing journey can be extremely therapeutic and beneficial in gaining relief from overwhelming feelings. Remember that showing vulnerability is not a sign of weakness, but an act of courage that allows you to unburden yourself and emerge stronger than before. 5. Exercise Regularly  Physical activity plays a crucial role in promoting overall mental and emotional well-being. Engaging in regular exercise not only enhances your mood and reduces stress, but also improves your self-esteem and fosters feelings of personal accomplishment and resilience. Whether you prefer walking, running, yoga, or team sports, incorporating an activity that you enjoy into your daily routine can be a game-changer in your journey toward emotional healing. 6. Surround Yourself with People Who Love, Care for, and Understand You  The presence of a strong, loving, and supportive social network is an invaluable asset as you traverse the emotional healing process. Connecting with friends and relatives who genuinely empathize with your situation can help to alleviate feelings of isolation and loneliness that often accompany grief or loss. Likewise, participating in group therapy or joining a support group can also provide additional resources and encouragement as you work through your emotions and strive for personal growth. Conclusion Emotional healing is a dynamic and deeply personal process that necessitates time, patience, and commitment. By learning to let yourself grieve, embracing your independence, detaching yourself from sources of pain, turning on the water works, exercising regularly, and surrounding yourself with supportive people, you can successfully navigate the challenging terrain of emotional healing while ultimately opening the door to a brighter, more fulfilling future."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you are given a passage which has a question and the context.

Input: Context: Characteristic clinical heterogeneity and mostly slow-growing behavior of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (GEP-NENs) cause problems in finding appropriate treatments. Thus, current therapy options are not satisfactory. PKI-587 is a highly potent novel dual inhibitor of PI3K and mTORC1/C2.', 'We assessed the effects of PKI-587 in different GEP-NEN tumor models, including poorly differentiated cell line LCC-18, compared with the established mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus.', 'We treated the cell lines BON, QGP1, KRJ-I and LCC-18 with increasing concentrations of the inhibitor PKI-587, and compared with everolimus and DMSO. We assessed the impact of treatments on viability (WST-1 assay), on apoptotic processes (Caspase 3/7 assay, JC-1) and on cell cycle regulation (flow cytometry). We determined alterations of signaling mediators by phosphor-specific western blot analysis and conducted multiplexed gene expression analysis (nCounter® technology).', 'In all cell lines, PKI-587 dose-dependently inhibited proliferation whereas everolimus was less effective. Treatment with PKI-587 led to cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and successfully suppressed activity of direct mTORC1 target 4E-BP1, a crucial factor for tumor genesis only partially inhibited by everolimus. Gene expression analyses revealed relevant changes of RAS, MAPK, STAT and PI3K pathway genes after treatment. Treatment dependent and cell line characteristic effects on AKT/RB/E2F signaling regarding cell cycle control and apoptosis are extensively discussed in this article.Question: Is inhibition of mTORs Catalytic Site by PKI-587 a Promising Therapeutic Option for Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor Disease?

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue.  Now, I have a new situation: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries.  Answer this question please: Which country would have lower labor supply in response to their taxation? A:","output":"Based on the background information provided, the Laffer curve suggests that a below-critical tax rate should lead to higher labour supply, while an above-critical tax rate should lead to a lower labour supply due to the decline in labour supply as a consequence of higher taxation. Considering post-World War II policies in Germany and France, it can be inferred that West Germany mostly elected pro-capitalist governments that implemented tax rates below the critical rate. In contrast, France's pro-socialist governments implemented tax rates above the critical rate. Informed businesses operating in these countries had to take into account the differences in tax policies when making decisions. Since the Laffer curve suggests that higher tax rates above the critical rate lead to lower labour supply, it is predicted that in this scenario, France would have a lower labour supply as a response to their relatively higher taxation policies compared to Germany. Conversely, Germany, with its more pro-capitalist approach and lower tax rates, is expected to have a higher labour supply. However, it is essential to note that numerous factors impact labour supply, and taxation is just one of these contributing elements. In reality, the situation could differ due to the influence of other socio-economic and political factors in these countries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg has 'lost focus' in third term, say more than half of New Yorkers BY Jonathan Lemire DAILY NEWS CITY HALL BUREAU CHIEF Originally Published:Wednesday, October 19th 2011, 9:52 AM Updated: Wednesday, October 19th 2011, 11:55 AM More than half of New Yorkers believe Mayor Bloomberg has \\"lost focus\\" during his controversial third term, a new poll released Wednesday found. Though more people than not - 47% to 42% - still approve of Bloomberg's job as mayor, 52% of New Yorkers believe the billionaire has lost his way during the autumn of his administration. \\"The job-approval bounce Mayor Michael Bloomberg got from his handling of Tropical Storm Irene has faded,\\" said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. \\"He's back in the third-term blahs and slightly more than half of the neighbors think Hizzoner has lost focus,\\" said Carroll. Bloomberg's widely praised handling of the August storm briefly resuscitated his popularity, sending his job approval rating soaring to 54%, the highest it had been in months. That jolt had faded among the 1,000 voters surveyed last week for the poll. Carroll attributed the decline due to a series of third-term disappointments, including the CityTime scandal and the disastrous appointments of former Schools Chancellor Cathie Black and former Deputy Mayor of Operations Stephen Goldsmith. Those voters had not just soured on Bloomberg, but also on some of those who are seeking his job. The disapproval ratings for City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio and Controller John Liu all jumped from Quinnipiac's last poll two months ago. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly also had his disapproval rating rise - from 17% to 24% - but the voters still say the city's top cop is their choice to replace Bloomberg in two years. Kelly's personal standing remains unchanged even in light of the high-profile clashes between cops and Occupy Wall Street protesters - and the ongoing NYPD ticket-fixing scandal. Kelly was the pick of 25% of those polled - even though the police commissioner has never indicated he will run for mayor. Quinn was the next highest choice, being named by 22% of voters if Kelly is removed from the candidates. City voters' dissatisfaction with elected officials spread to Washington, as President Obama saw his approval rating dip to 62% - the lowest since he took office. The majority of those polled - 58% - believe that Obama is a strong supporter of Israel, a hot-button issue that became part of the recent special election to fill the seat of former Rep. Anthony Weiner.

Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Choice Review: I first heard a tape of this album in 1995 when a friend put it on my stereo one day. It's a little bit jazzy, very original, definitely upbeat. This album is all about rainbows and sunshine. The danger of this is that it can sometimes get too close to cliche and whimsy, but Becvar has managed to keep the stream of sounds in good order. I am a great fan of Acoustic guitar music, and this type of album certainly has a place in my collection. Not as melancholy or reflective as someone like William Ackerman, nor as quirky as Hedges or Adrian Legg. It is an album full of child-like adventure, if you can allow yourself to visit a place like that within yourself, I suggest you take it for a spin. Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Positive tone. Step 1: Analyze the content of the review. The review mentions phrases like \\"a little bit jazzy, very original, definitely upbeat,\\" \\"all about rainbows and sunshine,\\" \\"managed to keep the stream of sounds in good order,\\" and \\"an album full of child-like adventure.\\" These are all positive descriptions of the album. Step 2: Compare positive and negative statements. While the reviewer does mention a potential drawback (\\"it can sometimes get too close to cliche and whimsy\\"), the overall review is predominantly positive, providing a balance that suggests a generally positive tone. Step 3: Consider the recommendation. The reviewer ends by saying, \\"if you can allow yourself to visit a place like that within yourself, I suggest you take it for a spin.\\" This is a clear recommendation, further supporting the positive tone of the review."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Who is told that Ruth is married to the commodore? from the following article ?  A young idealistic schoolteacher named Ruth Kirke is transporting a group of war orphans from South China to Calcutta when their steamship Tollare is torpedoed and sunk in the Pacific. Along with sailor Timothy Blake, they are the only passengers to survive the enemy attack. They are picked up by the steamship Westonia and taken to San Francisco, where immigration officials inform Ruth that the orphans will be held until a 500 bond is posted for each child. With no money of their own, Ruth and Timothy go to the home of Commodore Thomas Spencer Holliday, the wealthy owner of their sunken cargo ship, who perished during the torpedo attack. When they appeal for financial assistance for the orphans, the commodore's family refuses. Desperate to help the children, Timothy tells the commodore's family that Ruth and the commodore were married aboard the Tollare before it was attacked. With the children's future at stake, Ruth reluctantly goes along with the deception. Ruth, Timothy, and the eight orphans move into the Holliday mansion, where they soon meet the commodore's grandson, Thomas Spencer Holliday III. When a sceptical Tom questions Ruth about how she became his grandmother, Ruth explains that her Christian mission was destroyed in a Japanese bombing raid, and that she was sent south with eight European children, entrusted with their safety.

Answer this question: what are the names of pluto's moons??","output":"Pluto, which is a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, has a total of five known moons. They are as follows: 1. Charon: Discovered in 1978, Charon is the largest and most massive of Pluto's moons. It was named after the ferryman of the dead in Greek mythology. With a diameter of about 1,214 kilometers (754 miles), Charon is roughly half the size of Pluto, and the two bodies are often referred to as a binary system due to their close relationship. Charon and Pluto are tidally locked, meaning they both always present the same face to each other. 2. Nix: This moon was discovered in 2005, along with Hydra, by astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope. Nix is an elongated, irregularly shaped moon that is approximately 54 kilometers (34 miles) in diameter. Named after the Greek goddess of darkness and chaos, Nix orbits Pluto at a distance of roughly 48,700 kilometers (30,250 miles). 3. Hydra: Also discovered in 2005, Hydra is the outermost moon orbiting Pluto and is roughly 65 kilometers (40 miles) across. The moon's elongated and irregular shape suggests it may have been formed by merging smaller satellites. Hydra was named after the nine-headed serpent in Greek mythology that guarded the entrance to the Underworld. It orbits Pluto at a distance of approximately 64,700 kilometers (40,200 miles). 4. Kerberos: This small moon was discovered in 2011 by a group of scientists utilizing the Hubble Space Telescope. With an estimated diameter of 19 kilometers (12 miles), Kerberos is one of the smallest moons in Pluto's system. It's named after the mythological three-headed dog that guards the entrance to the Underworld in Greek mythology. Kerberos orbits at a distance of around 57,700 kilometers (35,850 miles) from Pluto. 5. Styx: Discovered in 2012, Styx is the smallest and second-closest moon to Pluto. It has an estimated diameter of around 13 kilometers (8 miles) and is believed to be elongated and irregular in shape. Styx was named after the river that ancient Greeks believed separated the world of the living from the world of the dead, which was guarded by the aforementioned Charon. It orbits Pluto at a distance of approximately 42,600 kilometers (26,500 miles). These five moons orbit Pluto in a nearly coplanar arrangement, tilted just slightly with respect to the dwarf planet's equator. All of them are believed to have been formed from a giant impact that created the Pluto-Charon binary system. The debris from this impact eventually coalesced into the smaller moons now orbiting Pluto."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

With a finishing time of 38:29.7 minutes, Cologna won the gold medal with an impressively large margin of victory. This was an awe-inspiring achievement on the world’s biggest platform for winter sports, especially considering that Cologna had undergone ankle surgery just a few months prior to these Games. This wasn’t the Swiss athlete's first Olympic triumph. He had previously clinched the gold at the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games in the men's Individual 15 km (Free) event.

Mary's (Elle Fanning) seemingly dull Christmas is suddenly filled with excitement and adventure following the arrival of her Uncle Albert, who gives her a Nutcracker as a gift. Later that night, Mary dreams that the Nutcracker – called N.C. – comes to life and takes her on a wondrous journey. They discover that the Nazi-like Rat King has usurped the Nutcracker's kingdom. When Mary and N.C. go to the top of the Christmas tree, they meet a fairy and, as she begins to sing, N.C. looks at his hand, as it begins to turn human. Worried about this he runs into the sleigh, but leaves his human hand revealed, and Mary sees this. Mary, seeing this, goes to N.C. and rubs his hand as we see that he is in fact a human crying with tears of joy that he is human again. The snow fairy begins to sing and toys appear and begin to ice skate around the tree. N.C. takes Mary to the top to show her his city. The two come up with a plan to shut down the smoke factory.

Subtract '20' from both sides of the equation: 10*q + 20 - 20 = 0 - 20 10*q = -20 Step 5: Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 10 to solve for 'q': 10*q / 10 = -20 / 10 q = -2 So the value of 'q' that satisfies the equation 15*q + 20 = 5*q is q = -2."},{"instruction":"Definition: Given two entities as input, classify as \\"yes\\" if second entity is the part of the first entity.

Summarize this article: New ways in which Facebook might have played a role in 2016 election meddling continue to emerge. Yesterday (March 16), the company announced the suspension of data analytics company Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) and its prominent parent political firm Cambridge Analytica—three years after it illegally used the data of up to 50 million users.      According to a note shared by the company, in 2015 Facebook found out that, despite telling its users otherwise, Cambridge professor Aleksandr Kogan passed user data collected through personality testing app “thisisyourdigitallife” (which touted itself as a personality test used by psychologists) to the political firm Cambridge Analytica—a company owned by Robert Mercer and led by Steve Bannon at the time—and to Christopher Wylie, from a digital service company called Eunoia Technologies.      The 270,000 people who downloaded the app allowed it access not only to their data, but some of their friends’—depending on their settings. However, they did not authorize that their data be shared with other companies, a behavior that is in violation of Facebook platform policies. The revelation comes from reporting by The Observer.      According to Wylie, a whistleblower who detailed the illegal data use, saying the information was used in 2014 to profile individual US voters who were then served Donald Trump ads during the election. “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons,” Wylie told The Observer, “That was the basis that the entire company was built on.”      After finding out that the breach had happened, Facebook deleted the app, then requested a certification from all involved that the obtained data had been destroyed—but Facebook never followed up on it. “They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back,” Wylie said.      Only last month, Cambridge Analytica’s CEO and Facebook both told the British parliament the political firm did not harvest any of the social media user data to target election ads during Brexit.      The firm continues to deny the allegations:      Facebook has repeatedly denied that data breaches as the one detailed occurred—and even after finding out, years after the fact, that it had, the company defends its best practices. ”We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information,” Facebook states in the same note that admits their “vigorous enforcement” consisted in taking the word of someone who had already broken their regulation to ensure said information was protected.      Further, the note tries to put the responsibility of controlling such information on the user, but highlighting a the “ways we give people the tools to control their experience.” ||||| Cambridge paid to acquire the personal information through an outside researcher who, Facebook says, claimed to be collecting it for academic purposes.      During a week of inquiries from The Times, Facebook downplayed the scope of the leak and questioned whether any of the data still remained out of its control. But on Friday, the company posted a statement expressing alarm and promising to take action.      “This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, a vice president and deputy general counsel at the social network, said in a statement to The Times earlier on Friday. He added that the company was suspending Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Wylie and the researcher, Aleksandr Kogan, a Russian-American academic, from Facebook. “We will take whatever steps are required to see that the data in question is deleted once and for all — and take action against all offending parties,” Mr. Grewal said.      Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, and other officials had repeatedly denied obtaining or using Facebook data, most recently during a parliamentary hearing last month. But in a statement to The Times, the company acknowledged that it had acquired the data, though it blamed Mr. Kogan for violating Facebook’s rules and said it had deleted the information as soon as it learned of the problem two years ago.      In Britain, Cambridge Analytica is facing intertwined investigations by Parliament and government regulators into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “Brexit” campaign. The country has strict privacy laws, and its information commissioner announced on Saturday that she was looking into whether the Facebook data was “illegally acquired and used.”      In the United States, Mr. Mercer’s daughter, Rebekah, a board member, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Nix received warnings from their lawyer that it was illegal to employ foreigners in political campaigns, according to company documents and former employees. ||||| The algorithm used in the Facebook data breach trawled though personal data for information on sexual orientation, race, gender – and even intelligence and childhood trauma      The algorithm at the heart of the Facebook data breach sounds almost too dystopian to be real. It trawls through the most apparently trivial, throwaway postings –the “likes” users dole out as they browse the site – to gather sensitive personal information about sexual orientation, race, gender, even intelligence and childhood trauma.      A few dozen “likes” can give a strong prediction of which party a user will vote for, reveal their gender and whether their partner is likely to be a man or woman, provide powerful clues about whether their parents stayed together throughout their childhood and predict their vulnerability to substance abuse. And it can do all this without an need for delving into personal messages, posts, status updates, photos or all the other information Facebook holds.      Some results may sound more like the result of updated online sleuthing than sophisticated data analysis; “liking” a political campaign page is little different from pinning a poster in a window.      Revealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach Read more      But five years ago psychology researchers showed that far more complex traits could be deduced from patterns invisible to a human observer scanning through profiles. Just a few apparently random “likes” could form the basis for disturbingly complex character assessments.      When users liked “curly fries” and Sephora cosmetics, this was said to give clues to intelligence; Hello Kitty likes indicated political views; “Being confused after waking up from naps” was linked to sexuality.      These were just some of the unexpected but consistent correlations noted in a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal in 2013. “Few users were associated with ‘likes’ explicitly revealing their attributes. For example, less than 5% of users labelled as gay were connected with explicitly gay groups, such as No H8 Campaign,” the peer-reviewed research found.      The researchers, Michal Kosinski, David Stillwell and Thore Graepel, saw the dystopian potential of the study and raised privacy concerns. At the time Facebook “likes” were public by default.      “The predictability of individual attributes from digital records of behaviour may have considerable negative implications, because it can easily be applied to large numbers of people without their individual consent and without them noticing,” they said.      “Commercial companies, governmental institutions, or even your Facebook friends could use software to infer attributes such as intelligence, sexual orientation or political views that an individual may not have intended to share.”      To some, that may have sounded like a business opportunity. By early 2014, Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix had signed a deal with one of Kosinski’s Cambridge colleagues, lecturer Aleksandr Kogan, for a private commercial venture, separate from Kogan’s duties at the university, but echoing Kosinski’s work.      Quick guide How the story unfolded Show Hide In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.            Her initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.            She found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.            While chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.            The Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.            But the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.            Her network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.            Cambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.      The academic had developed a Facebook app which featured a personality quiz, and Cambridge Analytica paid for people to take it, advertising on platforms such as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk.      The app recorded the results of each quiz, collected data from the taker’s Facebook account – and, crucially, extracted the data of their Facebook friends as well.      The results were paired with each quiz-taker’s Facebook data to seek out patterns and build an algorithm to predict results for other Facebook users. Their friends’ profiles provided a testing ground for the formula and, more crucially, a resource that would make the algorithm politically valuable.      Aleksandr Kogan      To be eligible to take the test the user had to have a Facebook account and be a US voter, so tens of millions of the profiles could be matched to electoral rolls. From an initial trial of 1,000 “seeders”, the researchers obtained 160,000 profiles – or about 160 per person. Eventually a few hundred thousand paid test-takers would be the key to data from a vast swath of US voters.      It was extremely attractive. It could also be deemed illicit, primarily because Kogan did not have permission to collect or use data for commercial purposes. His permission from Facebook to harvest profiles in large quantities was specifically restricted to academic use.      And although the company at the time allowed apps to collect friend data, it was only for use in the context of Facebook itself, to encourage interaction. Selling that data on, or putting it to other purposes, – including Cambridge Analytica’s political marketing – was strictly barred.      It also appears likely the project was breaking British data protection laws, which ban sale or use of personal data without consent. That includes cases where consent is given for one purpose but data is used for another.      The paid test-takers signed up to T&Cs, including collection of their own data, and Facebook’s default terms allowed their friends’ data to be collected by an app, unless they had changed their privacy settings. But none of them agreed to their data possibly being used to create a political marketing tool or to it being placed in a vast campaign database.      Kogan maintains everything he did was legal and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.      Facebook denies this was a data breach. Vice-president Paul Grewal said: “Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it’s a serious abuse of our rules.”      The scale of the data collection Cambridge Analytica paid for was so large it triggered an automatic shutdown of the app’s ability to harvest profiles. But Kogan told a colleague he “spoke with an engineer” to get the restriction lifted and, within a day or two, work resumed.      Within months, Kogan and Cambridge Analytica had a database of millions of US voters that had its own algorithm to scan them, identifying likely political persuasions and personality traits. They could then decide who to target and craft their messages that was likely to appeal to them for those individuals – a political approach known as “micro-targeting”.      Facebook announced on Friday that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform pending information over misuse of data related to this project.      Facebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach.      It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels”, but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information onto third parties. ||||| Summary:","output":"Facebook is once again facing scrutiny for its potential influence on the 2016 US elections. The social media giant announced on March 16, 2018, that it had suspended data analytics company Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), later incorporated as Cambridge Analytica, for illicit use of data belonging to an estimated 50 million users. The saga began in 2015 when Cambridge professor Aleksandr Kogan developed the app \\"thisisyourdigitallife\\", purporting it to be a personality test used by psychologists. In violation of Facebook's policies, Kogan transferred user data gathered from the app to Cambridge Analytica, a political firm owned by Robert Mercer. It was led by Steve Bannon and had significant ties with Christopher Wylie, a former data scientist at Cambridge Analytica. Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app, inadvertently adding their own data as well as that of some of their Facebook friends (depending on permissions) to Cambridge Analytica's databank. This data was allegedly used to profile individual US voters and deliver them targeted ads during the Trump election campaign. When Facebook discovered the data breach, the app was removed. However, despite receiving certifications from the involved parties that the data had been erased, Facebook neglected to follow up. This breach allegedly took place two years before the Cambridge Analytica CEO and Facebook insisted before a British parliament hearing that none of the user's data was collected or used for targeted ad purposes during the Brexit referendum. Despite the controversy, Facebook maintains that its data breach policies are effective and robust. Facebook stated that it wrongly trusted Kogan, who acquired personal data for academic purposes and subsequently used it for his dealings with Cambridge Analytica. Today, the company asserts that control of such information essentially resides with the users. The conversation has broadened, however, to discuss a larger issue: that the infamous data breach was actually a window into a deeply dystopian reality powered by algorithms. The ability of Facebook's algorithm, which scouts for user 'likes', to predict sensitive personal information like sexual orientation, race, gender, political preferences, susceptibility to substance abuse, etc., is alarming. The research into it (by Michal Kosinski, David Stillwell, and Thore Graepel) was published in 2013, clearly highlighting the risks to privacy. In the realm of politics, an algorithm that can predict user behavior on such granular levels is extremely attractive. Aleksandr Kogan used this algorithm in a political marketing tool used for 'micro-targeting' potential voters, a tactic considered illegal. Despite the massive scale of this data harvesting operation, Kogan insists he followed all legal protocols and worked closely with Facebook, which granted him the requisite permissions for his apps. However, Facebook emphasizes that although Kogan had obtained the data legally, sharing it with third parties was a breach of regulation. Current investigations are still underway into these allegations against Cambridge Analytica. At present, Facebook maintains the information wasn't breached but was obtained improperly by external parties."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What was the number of the locomotive that was leased to Cadillac and Lake City Railroad in Michigan?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1979, the locomotive was renumbered \\"1881\\", painted black with silver stripes, and leased to a Hollywood company for use in the filming of the horror movie Terror Train (1979), starring Jamie Lee Curtis. In 1980, the locomotive was repainted with a color scheme used by Canadian Pacific in the 1930s.  The black, gold, and Tuscan red paint job was popular with railroad enthusiasts and photographers.  The number 1293 was also restored to the engine.  In February 1982, the headlights, handrails, and cab roof of 1293 were damaged when the roof of a Steamtown storage building gave way to heavy snow.Although the Steamtown Special History Study reasoned that, since this type of locomotive had historically operated in New England, perhaps as far south as Boston, it qualified to be part of the federal government's collection, the Canadian native sat unused for 12 years following the move to Scranton. Ohio Central Railroad System purchased it in 1996, and it underwent a 13-month restoration.  As of July 2010, Ohio Central Railroad has lost control of most of its holdings, but former owner, Jerry Joe Jacobson, maintained a collection of vintage equipment including CPR 1293 and her sister, CRP 1278, which is also a veteran of Steamtown, U.S.A. operational locomotives.

The new number remained on the locomotive from 1966 until 1973, when its former number was restored.  The locomotive was leased to the Cadillac and Lake City Railroad in Michigan from 1970 to 1971.

Question: suppose baby is developed from a fetus happens, how will it affect HURTING mitosis to proceed normally.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"C: no effect Mitosis is a process of cell division that is vital for growth and repair in all organisms. This includes both the development of an embryo into a fetus and the development of a fetus into a baby. Any disruption in mitosis could lead to developmental issues or other health problems.  However, the development of a baby from a fetus would not directly affect the mitosis process itself. This is because mitosis is a cellular-level process that takes place throughout an individual's lifetime. It is responsible for the growth and development of every organism, from the prenatal phase through postnatal growth and adulthood. In contrast, any damage or 'hurting' of the mitosis process could potentially affect the development of a baby from a fetus - for example, by causing developmental abnormalities or growth issues. But the reverse (the process of a baby developing from a fetus affecting mitosis) is not the case. So, the answer is C: the development of a baby from a fetus would have no effect on the ability of mitosis to proceed normally, assuming everything else remains equal and no other factors are causing damage to the cell division process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Given the following context:  After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a...  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person whose music, from the Fourth Symphony onwards, was strongly influenced by the music of Mahler?

Which of these is the most likely disadvantage that can result from this process? Select from:  -decreased genetic diversity;  -habitat destruction;  -overpopulation;  -increased erosion;","output":"The most likely disadvantage resulting from the selective breeding process in plants for pest resistance and higher yield is decreased genetic diversity.  Selective breeding involves the intentional mating of plants with specific desirable traits to produce offspring that inherit these traits. Over time, this process can result in plants that are better adapted to various conditions or have traits that are beneficial for agriculture and food production. However, as the focus is placed on enhancing specific traits, the genetic diversity within the species may decline. Decreased genetic diversity can have several negative consequences, including: 1. Reduced ability to adapt to environmental changes: With less genetic variation, the species may not possess the necessary traits to adapt to changing climatic conditions, new pathogens, or other environmental changes, making them vulnerable to extinction. 2. Increased vulnerability to pests and diseases: As the gene pool becomes more homogeneous, it becomes easier for pests and pathogens to target and affect the plants. In the case of a new pest or disease outbreak, having genetically similar plants could make the entire population more susceptible, leading to significant crop losses. 3. Negative impact on ecosystem balance: A reduction in genetic diversity can affect the overall health of ecosystems, as diverse plant populations contribute to a more balanced ecosystem. Less genetic diversity can also have negative consequences for other organisms that depend on the plants, such as pollinators and herbivores. 4. Weakened resistance to diseases and pests: While selective breeding can produce plants with improved resistance, decreased genetic diversity can lead to new issues, such as the evolution of pests and diseases that can overcome the established resistance. This can exacerbate the problem, potentially resulting in a reliance on chemical pesticides and other interventions, which can have negative environmental impacts. While the other options (habitat destruction, overpopulation, and increased erosion) can be associated with modern agricultural practices in general, they are not necessarily direct consequences of the selective breeding process itself. The most likely disadvantage directly resulting from selective breeding for pest resistance and higher yield is a decrease in genetic diversity. In order to address this issue, it is essential to implement strategies that preserve and maintain genetic diversity, such as conserving wild relatives of cultivated plants and promoting sustainable agricultural practices that support genetic variation within crops."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The research, which spanned over five years, concluded that patients experienced a reduction of 42% in their likelihood of dying from a heart attack. This substantial decrease in heart attack mortality attests to the efficacy of Zocor as a potent cholesterol-lowering drug, a factor that likely contributed to its financial success for Merck, as it made them over US1 billion in 1995, along with another drug, Mevacor. The groundbreaking research into this new class of molecules for cholesterol reduction won accolades, including the Japan Prize in 2006 and the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award in 2008, which were awarded to Endo.

Article:The council has been heavily criticised for its handling of the disaster on 14 June that killed at least 80 people. Both the council leader and chief executive have resigned as a result. Only 14 out of the 158 affected families have accepted offers of temporary accommodation but ministers say no-one will be forced to move. Housing minister Alok Sharma fought back tears as he told the Commons of hearing \\"harrowing accounts\\" from survivors, saying it had been the most \\"humbling and moving experience of my life\\". He said 19 families \\"have not yet been ready to engage\\" in the process of being rehoused, while others were waiting for offers of permanent tenancy and many were still in hotels. A statement from the Met Police said 250 specialist investigators were working on the operation and the last visible human remains were removed from Grenfell Tower on Monday. Met Police Commander Stuart Cundy said there had been a total of 87 recoveries but, due to the \\"catastrophic damage\\" inside, that did not mean 87 people. So far, 21 people have been formally identified and their families informed. The taskforce is to take over the housing department, as well as other council operations. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: \\"The challenge of providing that support is, and will continue to be, significant. I want to help the council meet that challenge. \\" Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, who was chosen as Kensington and Chelsea Council's new leader on Monday said: \\"The unprecedented scale of this incident makes it impossible for one organisation to cope on its own. That's why my first action as leader was to ask the Department for Communities and Local Government for help. \\"I look forward to working with their staff as we all concentrate our efforts on healing the wounds in the north of our borough and to regain the trust of a community traumatised by disaster.\\" BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said it was not yet clear who would be on the taskforce - but a statement from DCLG said the detail would be confirmed in the \\"following few weeks\\". Eleanor Kelly, chief executive of Southwark Council and spokeswoman for the Grenfell Response Team, said the team would be \\"very welcome\\". She told BBC Radio London: \\"We can't stay in a crisis mode for an extended period of time because everybody needs to actually feel that things have gone back to a level of stability [and] a level of control.\\" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said putting the taskforce in place was the \\"absolute minimum\\" the government should do, but called for external commissioners to take charge of the council until elections next year. Meanwhile, the government has said 190 buildings in England that underwent fire tests on their cladding have failed, the government.  It also announced that cladding from one building had passed the test - the only sample to do so to date. The news about the taskforce comes after a tense three-hour meeting on Tuesday between survivors, Cdr Cundy and Westminster coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox. Survivors were reportedly angry as they asked for information about people who were still missing. However, they were told the \\"recovery phase\\" could last until the end of the year, as Dr Wilcox described the inside of the tower as \\"apocalyptic\\". Police also faced questions at the meeting as to why there had not been any arrests. Cdr Cundy warned it may never be possible to identify all the victims. \\"Such is the devastation caused by the fire it may be that tragically we cannot find or identify all those who lost their lives,\\" he said. Police again appealed for the public to come forward to ensure there are no \\"hidden victims\\" from the fire. The taskforce announcement came on the same day as the government-set deadline to find temporary accommodation for all those made homeless by the fire. The Grenfell Response Team says 139 formal offers of housing have been made to survivors, after the prime minister promised housing would be offered to those in need by Wednesday. Housing Minister Alok Sharma told the Commons the temporary homes were in Kensington & Chelsea or neighbouring boroughs and being offered on a rent-free basis - but no-one will be \\"forced into a home they do not want to move to\\". A spokesman for North Kensington Law Centre - which represents more than 100 Grenfell victims - said many of the offers had been unsuitable. Father-of-two Mahad Egal escaped the fire with his family from their fourth floor flat and is now staying with friends, as the hotel room he was given was \\"too small\\" for four people. He has been offered a property but it is in a different borough and is bigger than his flat in Grenfell, which he worries will lead to higher rent costs. Robert Atkinson, leader of the Labour Party at Kensington and Chelsea Council, said decisions about accommodation should be taken by survivors when they are ready - and not just to meet government deadlines. \\"I want these arrangements to be made in the timescale and at the pace at which the victims and survivors wish to make these decisions.\\" Shadow housing secretary John Healey said the government has been \\"off the pace at each stage following this terrible tragedy\\" and the latest statement on the numbers rehoused show \\"that in some ways it still is\\".

The move follows heavy criticism of the council for its handling of the disaster on 14 June, which is believed to have killed at least 80 people.

Given the question: In erosion, the higher the elevation, the farther the stream is from where it will reach base level and the more cutting it has to do.  A stream going across a low plain will have to do much or little cutting? The answer is:","output":"A stream going across a low plain will have to do little cutting.  Erosion is the process by which the earth's surface is worn away by the action of natural forces such as water, wind, and ice. In the case of a stream, the force of the water flow gradually wears away the channel's bed, banks, and surrounding soil, leading to the transportation of sediment downstream. The base level of a stream is the lowest elevation to which it can erode its channel—the point at which the velocity of the water flow is no longer enough to support significant erosion. In general, this base level is considered to be at the same elevation as the body of water (such as a lake or ocean) into which the stream eventually flows.  When a stream flows across a high elevation, it has a more significant vertical drop and a longer distance to travel before reaching its base level. This increased slope and elevation difference result in a faster water flow and higher erosive power, and thus, the stream has to do more cutting to reach its base level. Conversely, a stream going across a low plain has a smaller elevation difference to its base level and a relatively flat channel slope. As a result, the water flow is gentler and slower, which reduces its erosive force. In this case, the stream needs to do much less cutting to reach its base level, as it is already at or close to the elevation where erosion can no longer occur."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Most of the teachers are young and sociable,and there are a lot of parties there. Korea is usually the place most people go,because they have the most benefits and highest salaries by working only twenty hours a week. Japan is also a good choice,but only if you stay there for a long time will you save some money. China is a new rising star and lots of people are going there. Like Japan,the pay is quite good,but the cost of living in China is much cheaper. You can save a sizable amount and complete all your loans back home. Besides,Chinese people are enterprising   and you can learn a lot from them. In China,Taiwan is a good place to go,especially for females who want to earn much,but there are not many adult classes offered. The Middle East offers very high salaries and great packages for teachers,all of which is tax free. However,you must be a certified teacher and have a few years' experience if you want to teach there. Most of the people who tend to teach there are older and more conservative,so they don't expect a party scene. Italy and Spain are two beautiful countries where you can try your fortune.

About four-fifths of high school students in China have poor eyesight . And now more and more children in primary school need glasses, too. Two main reasons can cause poor eyesight: too much time spent indoors studying and too little time spent outdoors playing. Reading and writing for hours and hours, sometimes in poorly lighted rooms, causes eyesight to weaken. But students have to do this because there is so much pressure on them to succeed in school. They have less time to enjoy the sun. The sun, it turns out, is important in developing good eyesight. According to a study by Australian National University, Australian children and Chinese children have the same level of eyesight before they start school, but once they enter primary school, Chinese children only spend about an hour a day outside, while Australian children spend three to four hours each day in the sunshine. The result is that while about forty percent of Chinese primary school students need glasses, only three percent of Australian children do. And poor eyesight at a young age can have serious long term influence. As you get older, your eyesight can worsen. With all that in mind, don't you think it's time to give your eyes a break? Question: Which can cause poor eyesight according to the reading? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Spend too much time indoors studying.\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, according to the reading, one of the causes of poor eyesight is spending too much time indoors studying. The article states that around four-fifths of high school students in China have poor eyesight, and more children in primary school also need glasses. Two main reasons are mentioned for this issue: too much time spent indoors studying and too little time spent outdoors playing. Reading and writing for extended periods, sometimes in poorly lit rooms, can weaken eyesight. Students often engage in these activities due to the immense pressure they face to succeed in school, which leads to them spending less time enjoying outdoor activities and sunlight. Sunlight is crucial for developing good eyesight, as demonstrated by a comparative study between Australian and Chinese children conducted by the Australian National University. The study found that at the beginning of their primary schooling, Australian and Chinese children had the same level of eyesight. However, as they progressed in their education, a considerable difference emerged. Chinese children spent only an hour a day outside, while their Australian counterparts spent three to four hours each day in the sunshine. As a result, 40% of Chinese primary school children needed glasses, compared to just 3% of Australian children. This highlights the potential long-term impact of poor eyesight during childhood, as eyesight can continue to worsen as one gets older. In light of this information, spending too much time indoors studying is identified as a significant factor contributing to poor eyesight among Chinese students."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mary, a baby girl, suffered from colic, whereas Patricia, also a baby girl, did not, so it was quite simple to console  Available choices: [+] Mary .. [+] Patricia ..","output":"Mary. The sentence most likely ends with \\"Mary\\" because it implies that Patricia, who did not suffer from colic, was easier to console in comparison to Mary. Colic, which is known to cause severe discomfort and crying in babies, makes it more challenging to console the affected infant. So, in the given context, it is quite simple to console Mary as she is the baby girl who suffered from colic. The complete sentence would be: \\"Mary, a baby girl, suffered from colic, whereas Patricia, also a baby girl, did not, so it was quite simple to console Mary.\\" This sentence emphasizes the differences between the two baby girls – one who suffered from colic and the other who did not – and as a result, shifts focus onto their varying levels of comfort and need for consolation. While both babies may experience general discomfort or distress, the sentence indicates that Mary's condition unavoidably made it more challenging to comfort her, compared to Patricia's more manageable state in terms of being consoled and soothed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step 1: Understand the context and paragraph provided. The paragraph explains the importance of reviewing the lease agreement before subleasing an apartment. It emphasizes that the lease will state whether or not subleasing is allowed. Step 2: Analyze the available options. (A) This option refers to contacting legal authorities and involves countries and police. It doesn't follow the context of the paragraph. (B) This option talks about getting special permission from the landlord if the lease forbids subleasing. This option is relevant to the topic of subleasing. (C) This option offers a specific example about the landlord consenting in certain situations. However, it suddenly jumps to a statement about six different situations, which doesn't make sense in the context of the paragraph. (D) This option mentions writing down the agreement in the lease and subleases having provisions.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — During his first year in office, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s persistent pursuit of diplomacy, often working in parallel with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, played a significant role in persuading North Korea to engage in talks to end its nuclear program. “Before the extreme measures might have been chosen by the United States, he gave diplomacy another chance to succeed,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

I was one of many that expected to see a glorified, Yankee-doodle dandy portrayal of a day that (as famously quoted) should live in infamy, rather than glory. How wrong I was. These guys were there, right in the middle of it, and the pictures they returned are both amazing and heartbreaking. And yet it all occurred on a chance trip to the world trade centre on September 11, 2001. Two French filmmakers were compiling a documentary about life as a NY firefighter, particularly from the perspective of a young rookie coming up through the ranks. At the beginning we see much of this footage, just to remind us that there was no thought to producing a film about terrorism. This was intended to be a film about regular people earning an honest living helping others, and the beauty of the film is that it never loses this edge. While investigating a suspect gas line (I think, my memory's a little hazy on that), we suddenly hear a plane fly overhead. The camera pans up to reveal a commercial jet torpedoing itself into one of the towers. What must the cameraman have been thinking at this time? Recognising the importance of the footage the camera stays on, and possibly realizing the same thing, the FDNY allow the camera to follow them into the building. What follows is a true view from the front-lines. We see the commitment of the FDNY, their reactions (the stunned silence after hearing the first person fall to their death is chilling) as well as the collapse of the one of the buildings from the inside, while a second camera captures the events from the outside. If it wasn't for the horrific event they were covering, the footage alone would be any young doco-maker's dream come true. Quite simply, the footage deserves to be preserved for all time. But what really sets this film apart is the genuine humanity that it brings to the viewer. We see firefighters charging in without hesitation, people of different races helping one another escape to wave of rubble and even the concern of the filmmakers for one another (they are brothers) as they cannot reach one another in the confusion. There are amazing sights as well as amazing human stories in this film, something Hollywood could never duplicate (even though it's trying). 9/11 isn't a film about politics. Nor is it a film about religion, nationality or even jihad for that matter. 9/11 is a film about people, and a true indication of the best and worst that we are capable of. 9/11 is quite simply one of the most important films I've ever seen, and would be the only film to be born from this event if it were up to me.

Drivers in the study were able to stay in their lanes when researchers distracted the participants with challenging questions, the researchers said. This likely happens because the brain subconsciously corrects for any mistakes that are made, the researchers said.      But when the drivers were asked to text while behind the wheel, they tended to drift between lanes, said the study, published today (May 12) in the journal Scientific Reports. The work was led by researchers at the University of Houston and the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, and was funded in part by the Toyota Class Action Settlement Safety Research and Education Program. [Understand the 10 Most Destructive Human Behaviors]      Normally, \\"the driver's mind can wander, and his or her feelings may boil, but a sixth sense keeps a person safe, at least in terms of [avoiding] veering off course,\\" Ioannis Pavlidis, a professor of computer science at the University of Houston and the lead author of the study, said in a statement.      \\"What makes texting so dangerous is that it wreaks havoc into this sixth sense,\\" Pavlidis said.

Credit: Malcolm Dcosta      In the study, 59 participants were asked to drive, in a driving simulator, down a challenging stretch of virtual highway under normal, nonstressful conditions. Then, the participants drove the same stretch under three different stressful conditions: cognitive stress, during which the driver was asked mathematical or analytical questions; emotional stress, during which the driver was asked \\"emotionally stirring\\" questions; and \\"sensorimotor\\" stress, \\"where the driver needs to move [his or her] eyes and one hand between the car's controls and the smartphone all the time.\\" In this study, the sensorimotor stressor was texting.      The researchers measured every driver's biological stress response during each condition by looking at how much the driver was sweating around the nose. They also measured how many times the driver drifted into another lane.      In all of the stressful situations, the drivers' stress levels went up, the researchers found. In addition, the increased stress levels were associated with jittery handling of the steering wheel, which could result in drivers drifting into other lanes, the study said.      However, when drivers were challenged cognitively or emotionally, they were able to correct for these \\"jitters\\" and stay in their lanes, the researchers found. It was only when the drivers' hand-eye coordination was disrupted, such as while texting, that they drifted into other lanes, the study said.      The \\"sixth sense,\\" or the ability of drivers to correct their driving mistakes, may come from the part of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex, the researchers wrote.      This part of the brain \\"is known to automatically intervene as an error corrector\\" when there is a problem, Pavlidis said. For example, if a jittery, stressed-out driver turns the steering wheel to the left, the brain responds instantaneously by steering back toward the right, he said. This ensures that the driver's steering is straight, he said. [10 Things You Didn't Know About the Brain]      But this \\"sixth sense,\\" or subconscious correction, requires hand eye-coordination, the researchers said.      When drivers text at the wheel, they interrupt the necessary hand-eye coordination, and the brain no longer immediately corrects the mistakes, the researchers wrote.      Still, the results of the study don't give people license to let themselves get distracted while driving. The researchers noted that extreme levels of cognitive and emotional stress would lead to unsafe driving, and that the threshold for the amount of stress that could cause unsafe driving is unclear.

A team of researchers from the University of Houston (UH) and the Texas A&M; Transportation Institute (TTI) focused on all three of these important factors.      Led by Ioannis Pavlidis from UH and Robert Wunderlich of TTI, the research studied how drivers behave when they are absent minded, emotionally charged or engaged in texting. The work was funded, in part, by the Toyota Class Action Settlement Safety Research and Education Program.*      The study looked at 59 volunteers who were asked to drive the same segment of highway four times - under 'normal conditions' of being focused on driving, while distracted with cognitively challenging questions, while distracted with emotionally charged questions and while preoccupied with texting trivialities. To avoid bias, the order of the drives was randomized.      In all three interventions - absent minded, emotional and texting - the researchers found that the drivers' handling of the wheel became jittery with respect to normal driving. This jittery handling resulted in significant lane deviations and unsafe driving only in the case of texting distractions. In the case of absent-minded and emotionally charged distractions, jittery steering resulted in straighter trajectories with respect to a normal drive and safer driving.      \\"A likely explanation for this paradox is the function performed by a part of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC,\\" Pavlidis said. \\"ACC is known to automatically intervene as an error corrector when there is conflict. In this case, the conflict comes from the cognitive, emotional and sensorimotor, or texting, stressors. This raises the levels of physiological stress, funneling 'fight or flight' energy to the driver's arms, resulting in jittery handling of the steering wheel.\\"      What happens when the brain's ACC automatically intervenes, Pavlidis said, is that it counterbalances any strong jitter to the left with an instant equally strong jitter to the right and vice versa. The end effect of this forceful action is nullification of any veering to the left or the right of the lane and, thus, very straight driving.      For ACC to perform this corrective function, it needs support from the driver's eye-hand coordination loop. If this loop breaks, which it does when the driver texts, then ACC fails and the jittery handling of the steering wheel is left unchecked, resulting in a significant lane deviation and possible accident.      \\"The driver's mind can wander and his or her feelings may boil, but a sixth sense keeps a person safe at least in terms of veering off course,\\" Pavlidis said. \\"What makes texting so dangerous is that it wreaks havoc into this sixth sense. Self-driving cars may bypass this and other problems, but the moral of the story is that humans have their own auto systems that work wonders, until they break.\\"      Pavlidis and Wunderlich think the scientific and manufacturing community can benefit from their team's study. They posit that the question of what happens when self-driving cars experience failures needs to be asked now rather than later. Case in point, their research uncovers the mechanism that makes moderate cognitive and emotional distractions relatively safe, but only as long as the driver's natural tendency to handle multiple tasks is not overwhelmed.      \\"Following up on the results of our science study, we are currently looking into the development of a car system to monitor outward driving behaviors, such as steering jitter or lane deviation, as well as the internal state of the driver that causes them,\\" Pavlidis said. \\"This system, which I call 'stressalyzer,' a play on the word breathalyzer, may serve not only as a 'black box' in car accidents, but also as a driver alert and prevention mechanism, since it will continuously sense a driver drifting to distracted mode.\\"      #      The findings are described in a paper titled \\"Dissecting Driver Behaviors Under Cognitive, Emotional, Sensorimotor, and Mixed Stressors,\\" appearing May 12 in Scientific Reports, an online open-access research journal from the Nature Publishing Group.

This reflected the association of sympathetic state with steering performance (indicative of motor reaction) and driving performance. The experiment had three parts:      Introductory Sessions: We measured perinasal perspiration during a sitting session with soothing music to establish the subject’s sympathetic baseline at rest. This was followed by two simulator drives, where we also measured perinasal perspiration. The first drive familiarized subjects with the simulator (Practice Drive, or PD). The second drive intended to relax subjects (Relaxing Drive, or RD) by having them operate the vehicle in a simple environment.      Loaded Drives: We measured perinasal perspiration, steering angle, and maximum right-side/left-side lane departures on four drives (order randomized) repeated on the same highway segment under similar ambient conditions; they featured a modicum of driving difficulty (Loaded Drives, or LD j , where j denotes the type of stressor). One loaded drive had no additional stressor (LD ∅ , j = ∅). Each of the remaining three loaded drives was characterized by a different stressor j: Loaded Drive with Cognitive Stressor (LD C , j = C); Loaded Drive with Emotional Stressor (LD E , j = E); Loaded Drive with Sensorimotor Stressor (LD M , j = M). The specific stressor j was applied twice during the corresponding drive LD j . The presence or absence of the specific stressor divided the LD j drives into five phases: (no stressor for all); (no stressor in LD ∅ | stressor in LD C , LD E , LD M ); (no stressor for all); (no stressor in LD ∅ | stressor in LD C , LD E , LD M ); (no stressor for all). Table 1(a) illustrates the stressor layout for the Loaded Drives.      Table 1: Experimental Design. Experimental sessions are crossovered in (a) and parallel grouped in (b). Full size table      Failure Drive: We measured perinasal perspiration, steering angle, and maximum right-side/left-side lane departures on a drive that featured at the end an unintended acceleration incident, during which the vehicle brake had no effect (Failure Drive or FD y , where y denotes the arm of the experiment). Subjects belonging to the y = o arm of the experiment did not have any additional stressor during the FD y drive. Subjects belonging to the y = L arm of the experiment had an additional stressor during the second half of the FD y drive. This stressor was of mixed distracting nature - initially sensorimotor, and then mixed with cognitive alternating with emotional stimuli. The presence or absence of the mixed stressor and the occurrence of the dramatic failure divided the FD y drive into three phases: (no stressor for all); (no stressor for y = o vs. mixed stressor for y = L); (failure event for all). Table 1(b) illustrates the stressor/event layout for the two experimental arms in the Failure Drive.      Experimental Validity      Trait Anxiety Inventory (TAI)10 and Personality A/B11 scores for the subjects whose data were analyzed in this research (n = 59), covered a broad range in the non-extreme regions of the respective scales. Specifically, the TAI scores ranged from 20 to 52 in a scale graded from 20 to 80; mean TAI was 33.22 and the standard deviation was 7.87. The A/B scores ranged from 144 to 282 in a scale graded from 35 to 380; mean A/B was 208.85 and the standard deviation was 30.08.      We found no significant correlation of TAI and A/B scores with mean perinasal perspiration responses or mean absolute steering or maximum right-side/left-side lane departures in any of the drives (p > 0.05 for the correlation coefficients in all cases). This suggests that key personality traits that could have biased sympathetic responses, driver reactions, and driver performance did not play any role.      To ascertain that the experiment’s challenging drives were perceived as such, we asked subjects to complete the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) after each drive. NASA TLX measures subjective workload assessment on operators working with man-machine interfaces. It draws on six sub-scales TLX s : Mental Demand (TLX MD , s = MD), Physical Demand (TLX PD , s = PD), Temporal Demand (TLX TD , s = TD), Performance (TLX P , s = P), Effort (TLX E , s = E), and Frustration (TLX F , s = F).      We ran a mixed effects model to examine the dependence of each sub-scale TLX s on fixed effects, defined by the different types of stressful loaded drives (LD C , LD E , LD M ), keeping the loaded drive with no stressors LD ∅ as the intercept:      where k stands for subjects, acting as random effects. The model indicated that loaded drives LD C and LD M with cognitive and sensorimotor stressors, respectively, had significantly higher scores with respect to LD ∅ in all NASA TLX sub-scales (p < 0.001 for all TLX s ). The model also indicated that the emotionally loaded drive LD E had significantly higher scores with respect to LD ∅ in the Mental Demand, Temporal Demand, and Effort sub-scales only (p < 0.01 for TLX MD , TLX TD , TLX E ).      These results suggest that subjects perceived drives with cognitive or sensorimotor loads as challenging across the sub-scales of a validated instrument12, thus, confirming the effectiveness of the study’s design regarding these two stressors. The fact that subjects perceived the emotionally loaded drives as challenging in half of the NASA’s instrument sub-scales, suggests that the study’s design was moderately effective in this respect.      Introductory Sessions Analysis      Comparison among the mean perinasal perspiration signals in the baseline session, the practice drive, and the relaxing drive indicated the absence of any significant differences (p > 0.05, repeated measures analysis of variance). This suggests that in all these cases subjects were hovering close to their tonic levels, in the absence of any serious challenge.      Loaded Drives Analysis      We analyzed perinasal perspiration (explanatory variable) to determine the sympathetic effect of distractions in loaded drives. Next, we analyzed steering angle (response variable I) to determine how sympathetic effects associate with motor reactions. We also tested and found that age significantly affected the absolute mean steering angle, with older subjects exhibiting larger values (p < 0.05). Finally, we analyzed maximum right-side/left-side lane departures (response variables II) to ascertain how motor reactions are modulated, shaping error prone driving behaviors.      Specifically, for the explanatory variable we computed the mean perinasal perspiration signal intensity for each driving phase P i , of each loaded drive LD j , for each subject k. These values represented the mean sympathetic arousals exhibited by the subjects in response to the presence or absence of stress stimuli.      For response variable I, we computed the mean angular steering deviation (in absolute terms) for each driving phase P i , of each loaded drive LD j , for each subject k. These steering values served as indicators of motor reactions. Given that the subjects were traveling on a straight highway for 10.4 out of the 10.9 km of the drive, the mean absolute steering value should have been close to zero; the further away from zero, the stronger the sympathetic effect on instantaneous motor responses - an apparent deterioration of steering performance.      For response variables II, we computed the maximum lane departures on the right X R (k, LD j , P i ) and left X L (k, LD j , P i ) side of the road for each driving phase P i , of each loaded drive LD j , for each subject k. Here we define lane departure as the position of the car’s center with respect to the right or left boundary of the road, depending on the side it veered off. Ideally, the driver should maintain a nearly constant distance from these boundaries, driving in the middle of her/his lane (X R ≈ X L ≈ 0). If her/his car’s lateral position deviates significantly, then the maximum lane departure values X R and/or X L would increase substantially - a true deterioration of driving performance.      For each subject, we normalized the explanatory and response variables with respect to the corresponding variables in the LD ∅ drive that featured no stressor. These LD ∅ baselines represented the subject’s sympathetic state, steering performance, and driving performance under normal conditions. Since the itinerary and environment remained the same in all loaded drives, any mean deviations from the subject’s LD ∅ baselines should be attributed to the forced distractions.      Effect of Cognitive Load on Sympathetic State, Steering and Driving Performance      For our sample of n = 59 subjects, we computed for each driving phase P i the distributions of paired differences between:      • Mean perinasal perspiration in LD C and LD ∅ (Eq. 2) - proxy for sympathetic changes      • Mean absolute steering angle in LD C and LD ∅ (Eq. 3) - proxy for steering changes      • Maximum lane departures in LD C and LD ∅ on the right and left side (Eq. 4a–4b, ) - proxies for driving changes      Equation (2) produced the first row of boxplots in Fig. 1, suggesting that cognitive distraction of subjects in phases and had as a result significant elevation of their mean sympathetic arousal, with respect to phases and in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.001, paired t-tests in both cases).      Figure 1: Paired t-tests for the explanatory (perinasal perspiration) and response I (steering) variables in each phase of the cognitively, emotionally, and sensorimotorically loaded drives. Full size image      Equation (3) produced the second row of boxplots in Fig. 1, suggesting that cognitive distraction of subjects in phases and had as a result significant deterioration in mean steering performance, always with respect to phases and in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.001 in and p < 0.0125 in , paired t-tests in both cases). It is interesting that deterioration in mean steering performance remained significant in phase with respect to phase in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.001, paired t-test), indicating that there was a lingering behavioral effect on subjects with respect to response variable I, which outlived the second application of the cognitive stressor.      Equations (4a–4b), produced the first row of boxplots in Fig. 2, suggesting that cognitive distraction of subjects in phase had as a result significant improvement in terms of maximum right-side and left-side lane departures, with respect to phase in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.001 for X R in and p < 0.0125 for X L in , paired t-tests in both cases).      Figure 2: Paired t-tests for the response II variables (maximum R/L lane departures) in each phase of the cognitively, emotionally, and sensorimotorically loaded drives wrt the no-stressor drive; they are accompanied by visualizations of the cars’ itineraries in each stressful drive. Where color boxplots are closer to the R/L boundaries wrt grey boxplots, the stressor had a negative effect. Full size image      Effect of Emotional Load on Sympathetic State, Steering and Driving Performance      For our sample of n = 59 subjects, we computed for each driving phase P i the distributions of paired differences between:      • Mean perinasal perspiration in LD E and LD ∅ (Eq. 5) - proxy for sympathetic changes      • Mean absolute steering angle in LD E and LD ∅ (Eq. 6) - proxy for steering changes      • Maximum lane departures in LD E and LD ∅ on the right and left side (Eq. 7a–7b, ) - proxies for driving changes      Equation (5) produced the third row of boxplots in Fig. 1, suggesting that emotional distraction of subjects in phases and had as a result significant elevation of their mean sympathetic arousal, with respect to phases and in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.001, paired t-tests in both cases).      Equation (6) produced the fourth row of boxplots in Fig. 1, suggesting that emotional distraction of subjects in phases and had as a result significant deterioration in mean steering performance, always with respect to phases and in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.0125, paired t-tests in both cases).      Equations (7a–7b), produced the second row of boxplots in Fig. 2, suggesting that emotional distraction of subjects in phases and had as a result significant improvement in terms of maximum right-side and left-side lane departures, with respect to phases and in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.0125 for X R and X L in and p < 0.001 for X R and X L in , paired t-tests in all cases).      Effect of Sensorimotor Load on Sympathetic State, Steering and Driving Performance      For our sample of n = 59 subjects, we computed for each driving phase P i the distributions of paired differences between:      • Mean perinasal perspiration in LD M and LD ∅ (Eq. 8) - proxy for sympathetic changes      • Mean absolute steering angle in LD M and LD ∅ (Eq. 9) - proxy for steering changes      • Maximum lane departures in LD M and LD ∅ on the right and left side (Eq. 10a–10b, ) - proxies for driving changes      Equation (8) produced the fifth row of boxplots in Fig. 1, suggesting that sensorimotor distraction of subjects in phases and had as a result significant elevation of their mean sympathetic arousal, with respect to phases and in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.001 in and p < 0.0125 in , paired t-tests in both cases).      Equation (9) produced the sixth row of boxplots in Fig. 1, suggesting that sensorimotor distraction of subjects in phases and had as a result significant deterioration in mean steering performance, always with respect to phases and in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.001, paired t-tests in both cases). It is interesting that deterioration in mean steering performance remained significant in phases and with respect to phases and in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.001, paired t-tests in both cases), indicating that there was a lingering behavioral effect on subjects with respect to response variable I, which outlived each application of the sensorimotor stressor.      Equations (10a–10b), produced the third row of boxplots in Fig. 2, suggesting that sensorimotor distraction of subjects in phases and had as a result significant deterioration in terms of right and left lane departures, with respect to phases and in the no-stressor drive (p < 0.0125 for X R in and , p < 0.001 for X L in and , paired t-tests in all cases). This behavioral effect on subjects with respect to response variables X R and X L tended to linger in , outliving the first application of the sensorimotor stressor (p < 0.0125 for X R and p < 0.001 for X L in , paired t-tests in both cases).      Failure Drive Analysis      In the Failure Drive, for the y = o group we found that phase featured significantly higher values than phase in terms of mean sympathetic responses (p < 0.0125, paired t-test - Fig. 3a1). In contradistinction, for the y = L group we found that phase featured significantly lower values than phase both in terms of mean sympathetic and mean absolute steering signals (p < 0.001, paired t-tests in both cases - Fig. 3b1).      Figure 3: Statistics for Failure Drive’s first two phases. Mean perinasal perspiration and absolute steering distributions for: (a1) The y = o group. (b1) The y = L group. § Failure Drive examples. Perinasal perspiration (E) and absolute steering/steering (|ST|/ST) signals for: (a2) Subject T013 belonging to the y = o group. The two insets depict thermal snapshots of perinasal perspiration in the initial ( ) and later ( ) phase of the drive; the first pattern appears busier than the second. (b2) Subject T025 belonging to the y = L group. The two insets depict thermal snapshots of perinasal perspiration in the initial ( ) and later ( ) phase of the drive; the second pattern appears busier than the first. The dashed horizontal lines indicate the mean values in the corresponding signal segments. Full size image      Figure 3a2,b2 depict sympathetic (i.e., perinasal perspiration) and absolute steering signals from subjects representative of the y = o and y = L groups, respectively. In the y = o example, the subject’s sympathetic signal was somewhat elevated in phase with respect to phase in the mean sense. This could be ascribed to the start-up effect, where the sympathetic system responds to the driving transition from idle to a steady state. In the y = L example, however, the sympathetic and absolute steering signals during phase (non-loaded phase) were significantly lower with respect to phase (loaded phase) in the mean sense. Specifically, during the loaded portion of the drive the steering signal became highly variable, indicating that the driver had frequently strong impulsive motor responses. Apparently, the dramatic effect of the mixed stressor during the loaded phase of the Failure Drive overwhelmed any start-up effect characterizing its initial non-loaded phase .      Running a mixed effects model to examine the dependence of mean absolute steering on fixed effects:      • : mean perinasal perspiration adjusted to each subject’s resting baseline,      • y: sympathetic load indicator (y = o vs. y = L),      • AG: age group (Young: <27 vs. Old: >60),      we found that all three variables representing fixed effects bore significance in predicting steering behavior (p < 0.05); subjects were treated as random effects. Furthermore, the coefficients in all cases were positive. Hence, for each of the load and age binary variables as we moved from the low level (y = o and AG = Young) to the high level (y = L and AG = Old), steering increased. Importantly, for fixed y and AG, higher values of mean perinasal perspiration (indicating elevated arousal) were correlated with higher mean absolute steering values (Fig. 4a). Figure 4b shows how higher mean absolute steering values under the spell of the mixed stressor in , resulted in ominous lane departures and outright traffic violations; the difference from the orderly itinerary patterns in , , and is striking.      Figure 4 (a) Scatterplot of mean absolute steering vs. mean perinasal perspiration for all subjects in the first two phases of FD. (b) Car itineraries for the y = o and y = L groups. White, yellow, and pink pavement indicate phase , , and , respectively. Lane departures in , where the mixed stressor applied, are striking, suggesting an increased risk of accident. Extreme lane departures in are the results of the startling incidence - almost all cars crashed. Crash - No Crash incidents following the unintended acceleration event in phase according to: (c1) Load. (c2) Age. Full size image      Specifically, mixed distraction of subjects in phase had as a result highly significant deterioration in terms of maximum right-side and left-side lane departures, with respect to phase where no-stressor applied (p < 0.001 for X R and X L in both cases). By contrast, there was no significant deterioration in terms of maximum right-side and left-side lane departures in phase with respect to , for the y = o (no stressor) arm of the experiment.      It is important to note that we adjusted the individual perinasal perspiration signals by subtracting the mean tonic level (resting baseline) of each subject, correspondingly. This was necessary for fair comparison, as each person had a different sympathetic baseline and what was of interest was to find how much the drive and the distractions raised the subject’s sympathetic state above her/his resting baseline.      Regarding the unintended acceleration event that took place the last 10 s of the Failure Drive (phase ), the question was if prior distraction or any other factor, played a role in the subject’s crash risk CR. Running a logistic regression model to examine the dependence of crash risk CR on fixed effects:      • : mean perinasal perspiration adjusted to each subject’s resting baseline,      • y: sympathetic load indicator (y = o vs. y = L),      • AG: age group (Young: <27 vs. Old: >60),      we found that all variables representing fixed effects had no significance in predicting crash odds (p > 0.05). In fact, as Fig. 4c1,c2 illustrate, a very small number of drivers avoided crashing, among those who experienced the unintended acceleration event. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"A recent study, funded in part by the Toyota Class Action Settlement Safety Research and Education Program, reveals that, whilst distracted driving may lead to better lane control and ultimately a safer journey, texting while driving interrupts hand-eye coordination and increases the likelihood of an accident.

Is the gap between the rich and poor a religious problem as well as a social problem in desperate need of solutions? Jesus, Pope Francis, and brain scientists have asked these questions, and the answers are clear if unnerving. Wealth and power are dangerous for your mental health, your spiritual condition, and for society in general -- especially when they contribute to the neglect of the poor. New research explains how this works (more on this in a minute). Ridding the world of poverty is, of course, a fantasy. Jesus knew this: \\"You will always have the poor among you,\\" he said (Matthew 26:11). He also said, \\"God blesses you who are poor, for the kingdom of God is yours.\\" (Luke 6:20). Only a few verses before this moment in Luke, he cries (echoing the Old Testament): \\"The spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he has anointed me to bring the good news to the poor.\\" (Luke 4:18). Is it any wonder that when a rich young man came to OPTIONS: - CNN asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - God asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Jay Parini asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Jesus asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Lord asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Luke asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Matthew 26:11 asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Old Testament asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Parini asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Pope asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Pope Francis asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - Ridding asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" - South Korea asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\"","output":"Is it any wonder that when a rich young man came to Jesus asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: \\"If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.\\" (Matthew 19:21). This teaching underscores the notion that material wealth can act as a barrier to spiritual growth and the development of true compassion for others. And in today's society, this message is more relevant than ever. The increase in wealth inequality reveals a widening gap between those who have more than they could ever need and those who struggle to meet basic needs. This growing divide poses not only a social and economic issue but also a moral and spiritual one. It's easy to become blinded by the pursuit of wealth and success, losing sight of our interconnectedness and shared humanity. As brain scientists delve further into understanding how wealth impacts our mental and emotional well-being, studies have shown that wealthier individuals tend to be more self-focused, less empathetic, and less compassionate. These deficits can significantly hinder spiritual growth and meaningful connections with others. In contrast, those with fewer material attachments often demonstrate a greater appreciation for the people and experiences that enrich their lives. Pope Francis has been a vocal advocate for the moral responsibility to care for the poor and marginalized. His calls for a \\"culture of encounter\\" challenge us to engage with those who are different from ourselves, whether in terms of socio-economic status, race, or religion, promoting empathy, understanding, and compassion. Such encounters can foster spiritual growth and lead us towards a shared sense of humanity. Not only religious leaders but also scientists, activists, and policymakers must actively work together to address the widening gap between the rich and poor. Though completely eradicating poverty may be an unattainable goal, striving to create a more equitable society is indeed a noble endeavor. Through fostering a sense of collective responsibility and empathy, we can work towards bridging this gap and ultimately cultivating a more compassionate, spiritually rich world. To achieve this, individuals with wealth and power must be encouraged to focus less on the accumulation of material possessions and more on the cultivation of empathy, compassion, and a willingness to actively work towards solving the problems facing the less fortunate. This shift in values can bring about genuine happiness, spiritual growth, and a greater connection to our shared humanity - fulfilling the promise Jesus offers in his teachings on wealth, poverty, and spiritual development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

US blue chips fall as oil prices rise, but Apple lifts Nasdaq NEW YORK : US blue chips ended lower on Monday on higher oil prices and an analyst downgrade of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer; but techs managed a small gain, helped by an upgrade for Apple Computer. Which topic is this article about?","output":"This article is about the performance of various sectors in the U.S. stock market with specific focus on blue-chip stocks, technology stocks, and their relationship with oil prices. It primarily covers two major points: 1. The Effect of Rising Oil Prices on U.S. Blue-chip Stocks:  The first part of the article deals with the performance of U.S. blue-chip stocks and how they were affected by rising oil prices. Blue-chip stocks are shares in large, nationally recognized, financially sound companies with a record of stable and reliable growth. The article mentions that these blue-chip stocks fell due to increasing oil prices, which suggests that the rising oil prices added a significant amount of cost and economic uncertainty to these companies, thus negatively affecting their stock prices. 2. Impact of Analyst Ratings on Specific Stocks: The second main focus of this article is the role of analyst ratings on specific stocks, specifically Pfizer and Apple. It mentions how an analyst downgrade (a negative change in stock rating by a financial analyst) of pharmaceutical giant Pfizer might have influenced the market and contributed to the lower end for blue-chip stocks. On the other hand, the article also mentions how tech stocks, particularly Apple, managed to gain, thanks largely to an upgrade; an upgrade typically refers to a positive change in stock rating by a financial analyst. This implies that despite the broad market factors such as rising oil prices, specific factors such as an analyst upgrade can also have a significant influence on individual stock prices.  It also points out an interesting dynamic of the market where not all sectors move in the same direction. While the broader market represented by blue-chip stocks declined, technology stocks represented by companies such as Apple managed a small gain.  So, the overall topic of this article is the complex and multifaceted nature of the stock market, specifically highlighting the diverging performances of blue-chip stocks and technology stocks in light of changes in oil prices and analyst upgrades or downgrades. It provides insights into how broader economic forces like oil prices and more specific factors such as analyst ratings can influence the performance of different sectors in the stock market."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Snow and cold to hit Massachusetts Tuesday A mix of rain and snow hit the Boston metro area Tuesday evening, leading to a messy evening commute, the National Weather Service said. Residents of Western Massachusetts have already seen some snow, the weather service said. The storm system is expected to increase in intensity as it moves eastward across the state. “Be aware and be prepared for adverse weather conditions as we go into the later portion of this afternoon and this evening,” weather service meteorologist Benjamin Sipprell said. Sipprell said visibility will be down to a quarter-mile. “Just be prepared on area roadways,” he said, “because snow will definitely accumulate and make for slick and slippery conditions.” Take a look at the places getting hit hard by the snow. Temperatures will drop into the 20s during the evening, as rain is expected to change into snow that will fall late into the night. In Boston, less than a half an inch of snow is expected, the weather service said Tuesday. But in Central and Western Massachusetts, accumulations could reach 2 inches, the weather service said. “Have some caution this evening when you’re driving,” weather service meteorologist Kim Buttrick said. “Leave enough room between yourself and the car in front of you. ... Maybe drive a little bit slower than the speed limit.” “This is a quick-hitting storm system,” she added, saying snowfall should wind down by midnight. Highs Wednesday are expected to only be in the mid-20s to low 30s across Massachusetts, with blustery winds gusting up to 30 miles per hour. “The real cold air comes in tomorrow,” Buttrick said. “It’s going to feel even colder because of the wind.” What was this article about?","output":"This article is about a mix of rain and snow hitting the Boston metro area and Massachusetts on a Tuesday evening, leading to a messy evening commute.

Read this and answer the question The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room.

In Sentence 1, the emphasis is on the buyers purchasing these homes quickly, while Sentence 2 directly refers to the sales of these homes. Essentially, these phrases are two different ways of presenting the same idea – that there was a significant increase in the housing market. 3. \\"at a brisk pace\\" (Sentence 1) and \\"grew at a robust pace\\" (Sentence 2): Both phrases describe the speed at which the housing market experienced growth. \\"Brisk\\" and \\"robust\\" both suggest a strong and rapid pace of growth, although \\"robust\\" might suggest a slightly higher level of intensity. 4. \\"in April\\": Both sentences refer to the same time period during which this growth in the housing market occurred. 5. \\"spurred by low mortgage rates\\": Lastly, both sentences end with the same explanation for this increased growth in the housing market – the influence of low mortgage rates. In conclusion, both sentences convey the same overall message: that there was a strong and rapid increase in the sales of new and existing homes in April, driven by low mortgage rates.

Write an article using the following points: Paul Griffith was stopped at Stansted airport on his way to Malaga. The 75-year-old was asked to take his shoes off before he made the remark. Airport staff called police and on his return from Spain he was arrested. But 24 hours before appearing in court the CPS dropped all charges. Article:","output":"Title: The Incident at Stansted: Paul Griffith's encounter with airport security The tranquillity of an airport - a place that often sits in stark contrast to the life-filled destinations it serves - can be quickly overshadowed by security alerts. Paul Griffith, a 75-year-old British citizen, recently discovered this disquieting fact during a seemingly routine security check at London's Stansted Airport. Before proceeding to the idyllic Spanish city of Malaga, Griffith was stopped by airport security officials, an all-too-common occurrence in the post-9/11 era. However, the mundane request issued by the staff – to remove his shoes as part of the regular security protocol - unexpectedly catapulted the septuagenarian into a maelstrom of legal entanglements. Following that request, Griffith made a remark which set in motion a chain of events leading to his arrest. With earnest concern about maintaining airport security, staffers at Stansted immediately reported Griffith's comment to the police. Regardless of the significance of his remark, the seriousness of airport safety protocols cannot be underestimated – it is, after all, a matter of life and death for the thousands of passengers that transit through these landscape of terminals and runways daily. Completing his journey under the heavy clouds of uncertainty, Griffith returned to England from Spain, only to be arrested by the police. The arrest served as a stark reminder that safety measures in the world of air travel are subject to a zero-tolerance strategy towards any perceived threats or unusual behavior. However, in a surprising turn of events and just 24 hours prior to his appearance in court, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided to drop all charges against Griffith. Whether this signifies a flaw in the efficiency of UK's security and justice system or whether the CPS deemed that his comments were not a threat after all, remains a subject of conjecture. What is clear, though, is that this incident serves as a potent pointer towards the intricate balance that needs to be maintained between robust security procedures and the rights of individuals in an airport setting. While not undermining the need for strict security measures, one wonders whether there is a bridge that connects extreme vigilance with respect for personal liberty. Could this incident serve as a catalyst for a more nuanced and contextual analysis of situations at airports, rather than a trigger-responsive set of actions predicated on perceived threats?  Nevertheless, amidst safety protocols and flights to sunny Spanish climates, Griffith's story presents an interesting point of discussion about the state of airport security and the tensions that often simmer just beneath its surface."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- The U.S. space shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving American astronauts to hitchhike into orbit. But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"The U.S. space shuttle program lasted for how many years?\\" is \\"2011\\"?","output":"The passage does not provide direct information on when the U.S. space shuttle program started, therefore we can't infer how many years it lasted only from the given text. We only know that the program retired in 2011. To figure out how long the program lasted, we would need to know the year it started, which is not provided in the paragraph. Please note that the US Space Shuttle program actually launched its first mission in 1981, so if we take this information into account, we could say that the program lasted for 30 years, from 1981 to 2011.

Anthony Weiner was so oversexed, he had phone sex as many as seven times in a single day, according to the woman at the center of the mayoral candidate’s second sexting scandal in the past two years.      Sydney Leathers, Weiner’s web mistress who brought his “Carlos Danger” alter ego — as well as images of the politician’s private parts — to light, sat down with Howard Stern Tuesday, where she dished dirty, dirty details on the horny politician’s kinky predilections, including a fetish for feet and heels.      PHOTOS: See All Of Anthony Weiner’s Explicit Facebook Messages      And while much of what she said is too raunchy to repeat here, the details will leave you wondering how Weiner would find time to keep his pants on long enough to be mayor of New York!      Leathers, a self-described “political junkie,” told the King of All Media that she initially reached out to Weiner on Facebook to express her disappointment in his actions in the wake of the 2011 sex scandal that saw him resign from Congress. Leathers said he poked her back on the social media site a full year later, and after trading a few innocuous messages, the two were engaging in hot-and-heavy banter and photo exchanges.      “It didn’t take long — he didn’t have a good segue, he just went right into it,” she said, admitting she was infatuated with him at the time.      PHOTOS: 12 Celebrity Couples Who’ve Survived Scandal      “It’s amazing to me because he got in so much trouble the first time around,” Stern observed.      Leathers said they would both pleasure themselves when talking to each other, saying that while she found the Democrat to be “well endowed,” he wasn’t much in the stamina department.      “He was like, ‘Oh yeah, thank you baby’ … it was just like, ‘Conversation over'” after Weiner was finished. But, Leathers added, she’d “hear from him very quickly after” for another steamy exchange.      PHOTOS: 12 Celebrity Couples Who’ve Survived Scandal      And while she did not use the term Minute Man, she made it clear that no time was lost in getting to the end as many as seven times a day.      “You would think his (bleep) would hurt by the end of it,” she joked. “How can you be mayor of New York City when you’re (bleeping) like five times a day?”      “Well Clinton was president,” Stern sidekick Robin Quivers chimed in.      Leathers revealed some of Weiner’s sexual talk and more. She’s admitted to a promiscuous past and a profitable presence on Sugar Daddy-soliciting websites over the years and now says she’s looking to parlay her newfound notoriety into a lucrative sex tape deal.      PHOTOS: Anthony Weiner In Woman’s Underwear      She and her agent, former porn star Gina Rodriguez, said their next stop Tuesday was to Weiner’s house, where they would do a photoshoot.      Asked by Stern if she’d be getting naughty with any other prominent politicians, Leathers said, “Chris Christie‘s above my weight limit.”      Leathers said she came forward because she resented Weiner’s duplicity in his latest mayoral campaign.      “He lured me into this situation and he didn’t want to own up to it,” she said, while Rodriguez chimed in, “I think people should be applauding her really, that she did this.”      Applause?

Leathers boasts of offering sex for money, as well as her rampant drug use, her desire to \\"ruin\\" Weiner and fear that she herself was being blackmailed.      These shocking new revelations heap further embarrassment on the shamed New York City mayoral candidate, who is being pressured to quit the race.      Weiner has steadfastly refused to drop out, despite falling from first to fourth place in Democratic primary polling since the sexting scandal broke.      How long he can stay in remains an open question, however, especially after more information comes out about the dealings of Sydney Leathers.      A series of Facebook message exchanges with friend Lou Colagiovanni, spanning a period of four months (April-July of this year) has come to light.      In one June 6 message, Leathers stated: \\"I’m seeing this one sugar daddy right now who pays me 1,000 to go down on me for half an hour.\\"      Colagiovanni asked: \\"Does he possess any skill or is it a dull 30 minutes? Ahh Well for 1,000 a few moans and shouts should be included.\\"      Miss Leathers responded: \\"He isn’t very good at it but I can fake it ... I don’t have to do anything except pretend I like it though so it’s not a bad gig lol.\\"      In later communications, Sydney Leathers admitted to being active on a sugar daddy websites offering services to older men \\"on and off\\" for a year.      \\"I get money from dudes I’ve never even met,\\" she claims.      \\"People are super-pathetic. It’s funny. I have guys on the sugar daddy site message me over and over and over even though I don’t respond.\\"      \\"One guy offered to marry me in the first message. Um dude, you have no f***ing clue who I am, you saw like 10 photos if that.\\"      One of those men? Weiner, who \\"met\\" Leathers online when he \\"poked\\" her in response to a comment she made about his 2011 sexting scandal.      Then the man asking 10 million people to trust him with their city sent nude photos, engaged in phone sex, professed his love and offered to get her an apartment in Chicago.      Even Leathers herself is disgusted by that. ||||| Weiner's Sexting Partner My First Steps INTO PORN BIZ      Anthony Weiner's Sexting Partner Sydney Leathers -- First Steps Into PORN BIZ      EXCLUSIVE      's sexting partner could be taking her \\"talents\\" to video ...

A majority of New York voters think Anthony Weiner should drop out of the mayoral race, according to a citywide poll released Monday afternoon.      Fifty-three percent of respondents in the poll of likely voters said that Weiner should quit the race, versus 40% who said he should stay in, Quinnipiac found.      While the news was bad for Weiner, the poll featured an unprecedented show of strength from public advocate Bill de Blasio, who ranked second behind city council speaker Christine Quinn. Twenty-seven percent of voters said Quinn would be their pick for mayor, versus 21% who selected de Blasio. Former city comptroller Bill Thompson notched 20% in the poll, versus 16% for Weiner.      Support has deteriorated dramatically for Weiner in the week since the public learned that he continued to send strangers pictures of his genitals after resigning from Congress in June 2011 in disgrace over the behavior. His campaign manager quit abruptly on Sunday.      In a snap overnight poll conducted by Marist immediately after the new pictures came to light, 47% of respondents thought Weiner should stay in the race, while 43% thought he should drop out. That was before Weiner endured days of tough questions about his behavior and public humiliation at the hands of the tabloid press.      A Quinnipiac poll released just prior to the latest flare-up in the Weiner scandal found the former congressman in the lead over Quinn by 26-22.      Consistently strong polling by Quinn, the frontrunner in most surveys, belies her potential vulnerability in a mayoral runoff, to be held if no one candidate gains 40% of the vote. Quinn's net favorability rating has lagged both De Blasio and Thompson, potential runoff opponents. A Quinnipiac poll last week of a hypothetical Democratic runoff between Quinn and Thompson found Thompson out front 51-42.      Monday's poll has Quinn losing a hypothetical runoff against Thompson by 10 points, 50-40. ||||| Anthony Weiner's latest sexting paramour Sydney Leathers has certainly come a long way since telling The Daily Mail a few days ago that she \\"didn't want the attention\\" that came with the story's exposure, and certainly wasn't \\"looking to make money off it.\\"      The 23-year-old Hoosier has already sat down with Inside Edition for an exclusive interview; stripped down for the New York Post in an exclusive bikini photo shoot; and now it seems, went down...to the office with porn magnate Steve Hirsch to sign an exclusive adult film contract.      TMZ says nothing is yet known about what exactly went on during the meeting between Hirsch and the porn-named Leathers at Vivid's headquarters in LA over the weekend, but, as the gossip site notes, \\"you don't get in [Hirsch's] car unless you're lookin' for a ride.\\"      Vivid, of Farrah Abraham's \\"sex tape\\" fame, is no doubt looking to capitalize on Weiner's new woes, and the pressure is on to beat other porn production houses, at least one of which has just announced a Weiner-themed porn parody starring Weiner sexting alum Ginger Lee.      Meanwhile, Weiner seems poised to prolong the scandal with fresh rumors that his sexting days aren't yet behind him.      [screengrabs via TMZ] ||||| We're hearing for the first time from the young woman at the center of the Anthony Weiner sexting scandal.            Twenty-three-year-old Sydney Leathers spoke exclusively to INSIDE EDITION about the raunchy text messages and phone calls she exchanged with Weiner, who's now running for mayor of New York City.      \\"Anthony Weiner is responsible for his downfall,\\" said Leathers.\\"I feel sick about it. I'm disgusted by him. He is not who I thought he was.\\"      Watch video of Part 1 of our interview here.            INSIDE EDITION's Jim Moret said to Leathers, \\"I read one quote that suggested you thought he was a dirty old man.\\"      Leathers replied, \\"He actually said that about himself to me. The exact wording is that he an argumentative, perpetually horny middle-aged man.\\"            Leathers says her bizarre relationship with Weiner began in June, 2011 after he resigned from Congress in disgrace for sending images to women he met online.      Leathers sent him a Facebook message, criticizing his behavior. Out of the blue, a year later in July, 2012, she says he replied with a Facebook poke, a simple way of saying 'hi.'      Moret asked, \\"When did things turn dark and dirty?\\"      \\"Very quickly,\\" said Leathers.      \\"Who prompted that?\\" asked Moret.      \\"He did,\\" she replied.      \\"So, Anthony Weiner moved your conversation from professional to dirty?\\"      \\"Yes,\\" said Leathers.            They began to exchanged steamy text messages. In one of the tamer ones, Weiner writes: \\"What are you wearing? Much for me to take off? I'd hold u by the throat.\\"      He used a pseudonym that's become infamous overnight: Carlos Danger.            \\"It sounds ridiculous,\\" said Moret.      Leathers said, \\"It is ridiciulous. I never really said anything about it, but I thought it was very silly.\\"            She says she was shocked when Weiner texted her a risque self-picture that we can't show.            \\"I was absolutely shocked that he was willing to do that. And the fact that it was his idea is even more shocking,\\" said Leathers.            She says she and Weiner also had phone-sex at least twice a week.      \\"Did you get the sense that he was acting out on the phone calls?\\" asked Moret.      \\"Absolutely, yes,\\" she answered.      \\"And were they real for you, as well?\\"      \\"I think it was a fantasy thing for the both of us,\\" said Leathers.            The sexting was constant, with Weiner writing: \\"I've found the perfect woman. Gorgeous, sexy and like a bit of crazy.\\"            She replied: \\"I basically worship the ground you walk on. You're incredible.\\"      Moret asked, \\"Did you think at that time that you loved Anthony Weiner?\\"      \\"Maybe not loved, but I definitely cared about him,\\" said Leathers.            Leathers is from Mount Carmel, Illinois and is a college sophomore majoring in political science.      \\"I'm a total political junky, nerd,\\" she admits.            Leathers says their sexting relationship ended in November, 2012. She thought Weiner was jealous that other men were leaving messages on her Facebook page.            \\"What would upset him?\\" asked Moret.      She explained, \\"Me being hit on by other men really upset him. We were Facebook friends, so he could see if men were commenting on photos of me, or telling me that I was pretty. Really minor things like that really bothered him.\\"            She told Moret she last communicated with Weiner on Facebook four months ago when he announced he was running for mayor of New York.            He texted her: \\"Do me a solid. Can you hard delete all our chats here.\\"            Leathers said, \\"Obviously I knew that he wanted me to erase any evidence of our conversations, because that was around the time I knew that he was going to run for mayor.\\"            She says her relationship with Weiner reminded him of the Netflix series House of Cards, where actor Kevin Spacey plays a seedy congressman who carries on an affair with a reporter.      Moret asked, \\"Did you think, 'Oh my gosh, that's my life right now.'\\"      \\"Yes. When I saw House of Cards, I think it gave me a little bit of a panic attack, honestly,\\" said Leathers.            She wept when we showed her Weiner's news conference where he acknowledged their relationship. She wants to apologize to his wife, Huma Abedin.      \\"I just feel very, very sorry for my part and the pain that she obviously feels,\\" said Leathers. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Anthony Weiner, a former New York Congressman and mayoral candidate, was implicated in two sexting scandals in two years, the second of which involved a young woman named Sydney Leathers. According to Leathers, her relationship with Weiner began when she reached out to him on Facebook to express her disappointment with his past sex scandal. A year later, Weiner responded to her, and their conversation quickly turned sexual. They exchanged explicit messages and engaged in phone sex several times a day. Leathers claimed that Weiner had a fetish for feet and heels and seemed to be persistently oversexed. Despite these actions leading to his resignation from Congress in the past, Weiner again engaged in this behavior while running for the mayoral position. Leathers revealed that Weiner was selfish and quick during their phone sex interactions, and they would proceed to start a new session almost immediately after ending one. When Weiner announced his intention to run for mayor, he asked Leathers to delete all their conversation history. Denied by the scandal, Weiner fell from first to fourth place in Democratic primary polling. Still, he refused to drop out of the race despite the growing calls for his withdrawal. As for Leathers, she leveraged her newfound notoriety into various ventures, expressing interest in doing a sex tape and even meeting with porn mogul Steve Hirsch. She participated in interviews and photoshoots, capitalizing on the scandal. Despite stating early in the scandal that she did not want attention nor intended to make money off of it, Leathers was clear to disregard that position as she navigated the situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ignoring the claims of late-night sales pitches, many granite counter tops are better left unsealed. To test your surface, leave a few drops of water or a wet paper towel on the granite for 10 to 15 minutes. Possible answers: a). The water will help open pores and allow easier drainage. Always test for cracks before sealing granite countertops. b). A telltale sign of a wet coating and \\" dry glaze \\" will show up regardless. If your granite manufacturer states they're \\" water proofing \\" their granite countertops, let them dry for 24 to 48 hours before handling them. c). If the top comes off cleanly, the granite is ready to use. Put on gloves and a dust mask. d). If the water begins to soak into and darken the counter top, continue to the next step to begin sealing. If the water remains beaded on the surface, the counter top is already stain-resistant, and should not be sealed.","output":"d). If the water begins to soak into and darken the countertop, continue to the next step to begin sealing. If the water remains beaded on the surface, the countertop is already stain-resistant, and should not be sealed.  If the countertop needs sealing, clean the surface thoroughly with water, mild dish soap, and a soft cloth, gently removing any dirt or residue. Rinse the countertop well with water and then dry it with a clean, lint-free cloth. Make sure the surface is completely dry before proceeding to the next step. Choose a high-quality granite sealer, which is specifically designed for natural stone surfaces. It is important to read and follow the manufacturer's instructions for application and drying times. Some sealers may require a single application, while others may call for two or more coats. Before applying the sealer, you should protect any nearby surfaces or fixtures, such as sinks or cabinetry, by covering them with plastic sheeting or painter's tape. Pour the granite sealer onto a clean, white cloth or use a spray bottle to apply it to the surface of the countertop. Gently work the sealer into the granite using circular motions, overlapping each area to ensure full coverage. Once the entire surface has been treated, allow the sealer to penetrate the granite for the recommended amount of time, as indicated by the product's instructions. Generally, this period can range from 10 to 20 minutes, with certain sealers requiring more time. When the specified time has elapsed, use a clean, white cloth to wipe off any excess sealer from the surface of the granite. This will prevent streaking or hazing. Allow the sealer to dry and cure for the period specified by the manufacturer. This can range from a couple of hours to a full day, depending on the product. It is essential to keep the countertop free of water, spills, and other liquids during this time. After the sealer has fully cured, some granite sealers may require buffing with a clean, soft cloth or a polishing pad to achieve optimal shine and protection. Regularly test and maintain your granite countertops by repeating this process every one to three years or as needed, depending on the wear and tear your countertops receive. This will ensure that your countertops continue to resist staining and maintain their beautiful appearance for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sir Edmund Walker and Eric Brown of the National Gallery of Canada wanted to purchase In the Northland, but Montreal trustee Dr. Francis Shepherd convinced them to purchase Spring Ice instead. The reception of Thomson's paintings at this time was mixed. Margaret Fairbairn of the Toronto Daily Star wrote, \\"Mr. Tom Thomson's 'The Birches' and 'The Hardwoods' show a fondness for intense yellows and orange and strong blue, altogether a fearless use of violent colour which can scarcely be called pleasing, and yet which seems an exaggeration of a truthful feeling that time will temper.\\" A more favourable take came from artist Wyly Grier in The Christian Science Monitor: Tom Thomson again reveals his capacity to be modern and remain individual. His early pictures—in which the quality of naivete had all the genuineness of the effort of the tyro and was not the counterfeit of it which is so much in evidence in the intensely rejuvenated works of the highly sophisticated—showed the faculty for affectionate and truthful record by a receptive eye and faithful hand; but his work today has reached higher levels of technical accomplishment. His Moonlight, Spring Ice and The Birches are among his best. In The Canadian Courier, painter Estelle Kerr also spoke positively, describing Thomson as \\"one of the most promising of Canadian painters who follows the impressionist movement and his work reveals himself to be a fine colourist, a clever technician, and a truthful interpreter of the north land in its various aspects\\".In 1916, Thomson left for Algonquin Park earlier than any previous year, evidenced by the many snow studies he produced at this time. In April or early May, MacCallum, Harris and his cousin Chester Harris joined Thomson at Cauchon Lake for a canoe trip. After MacCallum and Chester left,..., can you guess it ?

Article: 00:32 Stargazers Might See Green ‘Incredible Hulk’ Comet Pass Earth Soon Observers in the Northern Hemisphere have the best chance to see the comet Tuesday and Wednesday.      At a Glance The best time to view the comet in the Northern Hemisphere will be Tuesday and Wednesday.      Remnants of the comet will come within 70.4 million miles of Earth.      Remnants of a green comet nicknamed the \\"Incredible Hulk\\" will zip by Earth this week, offering stargazers a view of a dust cloud at least twice the size of Jupiter.      Discovered in September 2017, PanSTARRS C/2017 S3 reportedly broke up in late July as it approached the sun. The remaining dust cloud will make its closest approach to Earth on Tuesday, coming within 70.4 million miles (113.4 million kilometers) of the planet, Sputnik News reports.      The comet's green glow, the result of cyanide and carbon molecules becoming ionized by the warmth of the sun, may increase as it makes its way closer to the sun, astronomers say.      The 161,000-mile-long gas cloud that originated from several eruptions of the comet in June and early July may cause electromagnetic disturbances in the Earth's atmosphere, Austrian amateur astronomer Michael Jäger‎ told sott.net.      The comet, electrified by solar wind, was expected to be visible with the naked eye. But it broke apart from intense solar heat and is rapidly fading from view. Experts don't rule out another eruption in the coming days, which could make the comet brighter in the night sky.      The best time to view the comet in the Northern Hemisphere will be Tuesday and Wednesday. As the dust cloud approaches the sun, it will become less visible in the sky, astronomers say.      On Tuesday night, scattered showers and thunderstorms may hinder the view in portions of the East, Midwest and central Plains. The best areas for viewing will be from the northern Plains into much of the West, where partly cloudy to mostly clear skies are expected. However, views in some areas of the West may be impacted by smoke, says weather.com meteorologist Linda Lam.      On Wednesday night, areas from the East into the southern Plains and Southwest will see clouds, showers and thunderstorms, but clouds shouldn't impede viewing in the upper Midwest to the West Coast.      The only real chance for a view of the comet in the Southern Hemisphere will be just before dawn Aug. 15. ||||| Skywatchers in the northern hemisphere have been watching a green comet bursting with light that keeps growing brighter as it nears the sun.      Officially named PanSTARRS (C/2017 S3) or — more prosaically — the 'Incredible Hulk,' due to its size, the comet is expected to reach its closest point to the Earth on August 7, Russian Media outlet Izvestia reported, citing Russian comet and meteorite researcher Yevgeniy Dmitriyev.      \\"The size of the gas-dust cloud of the celestial body is at least twice the size of the largest planet in the Solar System: Jupiter,\\" Dmitriyev said, cited by Izvestia.      The Incredible Hulk was reportedly discovered September 2017. The space giant is surrounded by 260,000-kilometer-long cloud of dust and gas, which is electrified by the solar wind, Dmitiriyev said.      ​Russian researcher says that the Incredible Hulk will miss our planet, pointing out its closest pass to Earth will come at some 113.4 million kilometers. However, its giant cloud of space dust could potentially cause electromagnetic disturbances in the Earth's atmosphere, endangering vital processes.      \\"When the Earth passes through the gas-dust environment of a bright comet, a giant lightning may occur which generates a powerful cometary electromagnetic pulse that can be ruinous for civilization,\\" Dmitriyev said, cited by Izvestia.      The demise of comet C/2017 S3 (PANSTARRS)      After two spectacular outbursts in early and mid July, the nucleus of comet C/2017 S3 (PANSTARRS) has finally disintegrated.      Farewell, comet PANSTARRS!https://t.co/ZHimRj4TeU pic.twitter.com/q6AU3n6HF1 — Northolt Branch Obs (@NBObservatories) 27 июля 2018 г.      Astronomers say that PanSTARRS (C/2017 S3) will reach its perihelion, or the closest point to the sun, on Aug. 16. It will be prowling just within the orbit of Mercury, where its nearness to the sun will make it a prime target for a blast of solar radiation.      Meanwhile, its proximity to the sun will make it almost impossible to be seen in mid-August. Astronomers say the best times to spot the green comet in the northern hemisphere are on the first few days of the month, particularly August 7 and 8.      In the southern hemisphere, there is less chance to spot the comet, although it may be visible for a brief period before sunrise on August 15 after it turns away from our star, The Tech Times reported, citing Austrian astronomer Michael Jaeger.      However, Russian astronomer Stanislav Short was quoted by Russian media outlets as saying that Incredible Hulk, despite its \\"threatening approach\\" toward Earth and its tail of \\"giant electrified gas cloud,\\" poses no danger as the comet broke up last month, and adding that such space objects have passed by our planet many times in the past without apocalyptic consequences. |||||Summary:","output":"A green comet called PanSTARRS C/2017 S3, also known as the \\"Incredible Hulk\\", is set to pass Earth this week, providing stargazers with a spectacular celestial display.

They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Egg oil (also known as ovum oil and egg yolk oil) is derived from the yolk of chicken eggs and contains mainly fatty acid derivatives (e.g. triglycerides, lecithin) as well as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which help revitalize the follicle cells in your hair. In addition, it also contains anti-oxidant xanthophylls, like lutein and zeaxanthin, which arrest premature aging (graying) in your hair, and immunoglobulins, which reduce inflammation. As an added bonus, the cholesterol in egg oil brings luster and shine to your hair and eliminates dandruff. Egg oil is mess free and stable. It is a more convenient alternative to egg yolk masks and does not smell like raw egg yolks or cook in the hair during a hot shower. There is no risk of salmonella which could give you a scalp infection. You can make your own egg oil simply by heating egg yolks on the stove in a saucepan until they elicit a dark colored oil. Make sure to cool the oil before applying to your scalp, as you don't want to burn yourself.  You can also mix the egg oil with ingredients like two tablespoons olive oil to make create more of a mask and easier to apply. Another option would be to a tablespoon or so of honey, both for its nice scent for also for the shine and vitality it will add to your hair.  You can purchase egg oil commercially. Just make sure that you are buying 100% egg oil and not something combined with artificial solutions or chemicals. Using your fingertips, work the egg oil into your scalp gently with small circular motions. Do this for five to ten minutes. Make sure you've evenly spread the egg oil into your scalp. Egg oil needs time to act. Leave it on at least three hours or preferably overnight. If you wear it overnight, do not forget to cover your pillow with a cloth to prevent oil stains. Alternatively, you could wrap your head in a clean towel after you apply the oil to your scalp and then sleep with the towel on, though this may or may not be comfortable for your neck. Shampoo off the egg oil the next morning (or whenever you're in between egg oil applications) with a gentle, high quality shampoo, preferably an herbal or natural shampoo with no artificial ingredients or chemicals. Use shampoo only once as repetition removes the natural lipids of hair making it dry and brittle. If possible, let your hair air dry after shampooing. This remove the possibility of further damaging your hair through the high heat and power of a blowdryer. Apply, massage, and leave egg oil on your sleep at least twice a week for at least 12 weeks for visible results. Regular, continued use is important for proper nourishment of the follicular cell membranes in the hair. Continue long term massage therapy of egg oil to prevent hair loss and graying. Discontinuing use may gradually bring back hair fall problems and resume graying.","output":"The article discusses the benefits of egg oil for hair health, highlighting its revitalizing, anti-aging, and anti-inflammatory properties, while providing a guide on making your own egg oil and its proper application for optimal results."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information:  - A natural satellite or moon is, in the most common usage, an astronomical body that orbits a planet or minor planet (or sometimes another Small Solar System Body).  - Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of 2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.  - An explosion is a rapid increase in volume and release of energy in an extreme manner, usually with the generation of high temperatures and the release of gases. Supersonic explosions created by high explosives are known as detonations and travel via supersonic shock waves. Subsonic explosions are created by low explosives through a slower burning process known as deflagration. When caused by a man-made device such as an exploding rocket or firework, the audible component of an explosion is referred to as its \\"report\\" (which can also be used as a verb, e.g., \\"the rocket reported loudly upon impact\\".)  - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\".  - Mercurius is a lunar impact crater that is located in the northeastern part of the Moon . It lies to the northeast of the smaller crater Carrington , and west - northwest of Zeno . Just to the south is the small lunar mare named Lacus Spei , and to the west is the larger Lacus Temporis . The rim of Mercurius is circular , with a somewhat irregular edge . There are small outward bulges along several sections of the rim , with the most notable bulges being along the eastern and southern sides . The inner wall has slumped around much of the perimeter , producing a sharp edge . The sides are also somewhat worn , with some tiny craterlets overlying the inner wall . Within the rim the interior floor has been resurfaced by lava and is nearly level , with a slight hint of a central mound . The remainder of the floor is marked only by a few tiny craterlets and some low ridges in the northeastern corner .  - The lunar maria (singular: mare ) are large, dark, basaltic plains on Earth's Moon, formed by ancient volcanic eruptions. They were dubbed \\"maria\\", Latin for \\"seas\\", by early astronomers who mistook them for actual seas. They are less reflective than the \\"highlands\\" as a result of their iron-rich compositions, and hence appear dark to the naked eye. The maria cover about 16 percent of the lunar surface, mostly on the side visible from Earth. The few maria on the far side are much smaller, residing mostly in very large craters. The traditional nomenclature for the Moon also includes one \\"oceanus\\" (ocean), as well as features with the names \\"lacus\\" (lake), \\"palus\\" (marsh), and \\"sinus\\" (bay). The last three are smaller than maria, but have the same nature and characteristics.  - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.  - Hypervelocity is very high velocity, approximately over 3,000 meters per second (6,700 mph, 11,000 km/h, 10,000 ft/s, or Mach 8.8). In particular, hypervelocity is velocity so high that the strength of materials upon impact is very small compared to inertial stresses. Thus, even metals behave like fluids under hypervelocity impact. Extreme hypervelocity results in vaporization of the impactor and target. For structural metals, hypervelocity is generally considered to be over 2,500 m/s (5,600 mph, 9,000 km/h, 8,200 ft/s, or Mach 7.3). Meteorite craters are also examples of hypervelocity impacts.  - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known.   - An impact crater is an approximately circular depression in the surface of a planet, moon, or other solid body in the Solar System or elsewhere, formed by the hypervelocity impact of a smaller body. In contrast to volcanic craters, which result from explosion or internal collapse, impact craters typically have raised rims and floors that are lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. Although Meteor Crater is perhaps the best-known example of a small impact crater on Earth, impact craters range from small, simple, bowl-shaped depressions to large, complex, multi-ringed impact basins.  - Lacus Spei (latin for \\"Lake of Hope\\") is a small lunar mare that is located in the northeastern part of the Moon's near side. To the north is the crater Mercurius and to the west-southwest lies Schumacher.  - Basalt (, , , or ) is a common extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock formed from the rapid cooling of basaltic lava exposed at or very near the surface of a planet or moon. Flood basalt describes the formation in a series of lava basalt flows.  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.  - Lacus Temporis (Latin for \\"Lake of Time\\") is a small lunar mare that is located in the northeastern quadrant of the Moon's near side. The selenographic coordinates of this feature are , and it lies within a diameter of 117 km.  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - Meteor Crater is a meteorite impact crater approximately east of Flagstaff and west of Winslow in the northern Arizona desert of the United States. Because the United States Board on Geographic Names commonly recognizes names of natural features derived from the nearest post office, the feature acquired the name of \\"Meteor Crater\\" from the nearby post office named Meteor. The site was formerly known as the Canyon Diablo Crater and fragments of the meteorite are officially called the Canyon Diablo Meteorite. Scientists refer to the crater as Barringer Crater in honor of Daniel Barringer, who was first to suggest that it was produced by meteorite impact. The crater is privately owned by the Barringer family through their Barringer Crater Company, which proclaims it to be the \\"best preserved meteorite crater on Earth\\".

Build a movie plot around this: who promises to help the disgraced doctor? ygor","output":"Title: The Redemption of Dr. Krieger Genre: Drama, Mystery, Sci-fi Plot: Act 1: The Downfall The story begins with Dr. Albert Krieger, a respected genetic-engineer, working in an elite research laboratory called GENE-X. Dr. Krieger's life takes a tragic turn when he is accused of conducting illegal human experiments, causing an uproar that disgraces him in the scientific community. Despite claiming innocence, the evidence is stacked against him. Devastated, Dr. Krieger loses his job, friends, and research funding. Meanwhile, Ygor, a mysterious figure lurking in the shadows, watches in fascination as Dr. Krieger's life crumbles. Intrigued by the doctor's work and sensing his genius, Ygor decides to offer his help. Act 2: The Alliance As Dr. Krieger desperately searches for a way to clear his name and redeem himself, Ygor approaches him and promises to help. Skeptical at first, Dr. Krieger eventually accepts Ygor's offer due to a lack of viable alternative options. Ygor informs the doctor that he has access to a cutting-edge, underground facility where the doctor can continue his genetic research discreetly. Upon arriving at the secret laboratory, Dr. Krieger encounters other brilliant scientists and engineers working on various top-secret endeavours. They, too, have partnered with Ygor for their own reasons. Over time, Dr. Krieger becomes consumed once again by his research, driven by the desire to revolutionize genetic science and ultimately take down the people who slandered him. Act 3: A Sinister Revelation As Dr. Krieger's work progresses, a series of mysterious events and suspicious encounters lead him to question Ygor's motives. The deeper he dives into Ygor's background, the more nefarious his intentions appear to be. Dr. Krieger discovers that Ygor is a powerful and cunning businessman with vast resources and connections in the scientific community. Ygor's scheme involves collecting the work of these exceptional yet vulnerable researchers and marketing it as his own. Feeling betrayed, Dr. Krieger confronts Ygor. However, he's faced with a serious dilemma: expose Ygor and risk losing everything or collaborate in silence to continue his research and reinstate his reputation. Act 4: The Redemption Ultimately, Dr. Krieger chooses to stand up against Ygor. With the help of the other scientists working in Ygor's facility, he uncovers concrete evidence of Ygor's nefarious dealings. Dr. Krieger realizes that it is not just about redeeming himself, but also protecting the future of scientific research from unscrupulous individuals. In the climax, Dr. Krieger and his fellow scientists expose Ygor's true intentions to the public, leading to his arrest. However, the fallout severely damages their reputations, forcing each of them to start anew. Dr. Krieger, now more determined than ever, channels his energy into rebuilding his career and pursuing research with integrity. In the end, he not only rediscovers his passion for science but also becomes a staunch advocate for research ethics, which earns him the respect and admiration of his peers. Conclusion: \\"The Redemption of Dr. Krieger\\" explores themes such as ethics, integrity, and the moral dilemma one faces when entangled in a web of deceit. It puts a spotlight on the importance of staying true to oneself and one's beliefs, even when the odds are stacked against you.

Fort Ticonderoga (), formerly Fort Carillon, is a large 18th-century star fort built by the French at a narrows near the south end of Lake Champlain, in northern New York, in the United States. It was constructed by Canadian-born French military engineer Michel Chartier de Lotbinière, Marquis de Lotbinière between October 1755 and 1757, during the action in the \\"North American theater\\" of the Seven Years' War, often referred to in the US as the French and Indian War. The fort was of strategic importance during the 18th-century colonial conflicts between Great Britain and France, and again played an important role during the American Revolutionary War. The site controlled a river portage alongside the mouth of the rapids-infested La Chute River, in the 3.5 miles (5.6 km) between Lake Champlain and Lake George. It was thus strategically placed for the competition over trade routes between the British-controlled Hudson River Valley and the French-controlled Saint Lawrence River Valley. The terrain amplified the importance of the site. Both lakes were long and narrow and oriented north–south, as were the many ridge lines of the Appalachian Mountains, which extended as far south as Georgia. The mountains created nearly impassable terrains to the east and west of the Great Appalachian Valley that the site commanded. The name \\"Ticonderoga\\" comes from the Iroquois word tekontaró:ken, meaning \\"it is at the junction of two waterways\\".During the 1758 Battle of Carillon, 4,000 French defenders were able to repel an attack by 16,000 British troops near the fort. In 1759, the British returned and drove a token French garrison from the fort. During the American Revolutionary War, when the British controlled the fort, it was attacked in May 1775 in the Capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the  Green Mountain Boys and other state militia under the command of Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold, who captured it in the surprise attack.  Cannons taken from the fort were transported to Boston to lift its siege by the British, who evacuated...

She frequently appears on television, radio, and as a speaker at public and private events.  - Roger Joseph Ebert (June 18, 1942  April 4, 2013) was an American film critic and historian, journalist, screenwriter, and author. He was a film critic for the \\"Chicago Sun-Times\\" from 1967 until his death in 2013. In 1975, Ebert became the first film critic to win the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism.  - Structural engineering is mainly a sub-division of civil engineering where structural engineers are trained to understand, predict, and calculate the stability, strength and rigidity of built structures for buildings and non-building structures, to develop designs and integrate their design with that of other designers, and to supervise construction of projects on site. They can also be involved in the design of machinery, medical equipment, vehicles etc. where structural integrity affects functioning and safety.  - An arch is a curved structure that spans a space and may or may not support weight above it. Arch may be synonymous with vault, but a vault may be distinguished as a continuous arch forming a roof. Arches appeared as early as the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamian brick architecture, and their systematic use started with the Ancient Romans who were the first to apply the technique to a wide range of structures.  - News of the Weird is a syndicated newspaper column edited by Chuck Shepherd that collects bizarre news stories. It was created in 1988. , it is syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate and published in more than 250 newspapers in the United States and Canada. As of July 2008, the daily internet column has merged with two other \\"weird\\" websites to form Weird Universe.  - Earthquake engineering is an interdisciplinary branch of engineering that designs and analyzes structures, such as buildings and bridges, with earthquakes in mind. Its overall goal is to make such structures more resistant to earthquakes. An earthquake (or seismic) engineer aims to construct structures that will not be damaged in minor shaking and will avoid serious damage or collapse in a major earthquake. Earthquake engineering is the scientific field concerned with protecting society, the natural environment, and the man-made environment from earthquakes by limiting the seismic risk to socio-economically acceptable levels. Traditionally, it has been narrowly defined as the study of the behavior of structures and geo-structures subject to seismic loading; it is considered as a subset of structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, applied physics, etc. However, the tremendous costs experienced in recent earthquakes have led to an expansion of its scope to encompass disciplines from the wider field of civil engineering, mechanical engineering and from the social sciences, especially sociology, political science, economics and finance.  - In the United States, same-sex marriage has been legal in all states, Washington, D.C., as well as all U.S. territories except American Samoa, but not on Indian lands, since June 26, 2015, when the United States Supreme Court ruled in \\"Obergefell v. Hodges\\" that state-level bans on same-sex marriage are unconstitutional. The court ruled that the denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples and the refusal to recognize those marriages performed in other jurisdictions violates the Due Process and the Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The ruling overturned a precedent, \\"Baker v. Nelson\\".  - Compression members are structural elements that are pushed together or carry a load, more technically they are subjected only to axial compressive forces. That is, the loads are applied on the longitudinal axis through the centroid of the member cross section, and the load over the cross sectional area gives the stress on the compressed member. In buildings posts and columns are almost always compression members as are the \\"top chord\\" of trusses.  - Uclick LLC was an American corporation (a division of Andrews McMeel Universal) selling \\"digital entertainment content\\" for the desktop, the web and mobile phones.

In other words, a column is a compression member. The term column applies especially to a large round support (the \\"shaft\\" of the column) with a capital and a \\"base\\" or pedestal and made of stone, or appearing to be so. A small wooden or metal support is typically called a post, and supports with a rectangular or other non-round section are usually called piers. For the purpose of wind or earthquake engineering, columns may be designed to resist lateral forces. Other compression members are often termed \\"columns\\" because of the similar stress conditions. Columns are frequently used to support beams or arches on which the upper parts of walls or ceilings rest. In architecture, \\"column\\" refers to such a structural element that also has certain proportional and decorative features. A column might also be a decorative element not needed for structural purposes; many columns are \\"engaged\\", that is to say form part of a wall.  - Architecture (Latin \\"architectura\\", from the Greek  \\"arkhitekton\\" \\"architect\\", from - \\"chief\\" and  \\"builder\\") is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings and other physical structures.

The Moon thus tends to \\"stretch\\" the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, particularly horizontally.  As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the Earth's surface change constantly; although the ocean never reaches equilibrium—there is never time for the fluid to \\"catch up\\" to the state it would eventually reach if the tidal force were constant—the changing tidal force nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height.  Now, I have a new situation: Mike was reading about an instrument that could measure gravity, gravimeter. He then found how gravimeter was used to measure the gravitational field of the Moon. He read about two distinct cases where the Moon's gravitational field was measured on earth, side A and side B. In side A the Moon's gravity was measured from the side where the Earth was facing the Moon. And in side B the Moon's gravitational field was measured from the opposite side of the Earth. He found these two locations showed very different consequences of Moon's gravitational field.  Answer this question please: On which side the Moon's gravitational field would exert weaker force, side A side B? Answer:","output":"The Moon's gravitational field would exert a weaker force on side B, the opposite side of the Earth from where the Earth is facing the Moon."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Context: Jan said no in a way that made it very clear what she meant.

Question: What does Joey do after Jake asks him if he had an affair with Vikki? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Raging Bull Context: In a brief scene in 1964, an aging, overweight Italian American, Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro), practices a comedy routine. The rest of the film then occurs in flashback. In 1941, LaMotta is in a major boxing match against Jimmy Reeves, where he received his first loss. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). Some time thereafter, Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vikki (Cathy Moriarty) at an open-air swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite the fact that Jake dominates Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson and Joey feels Robinson won only because he was enlisting into the US Army the following week. By 1947, Jake marries Vikki. Jake constantly worries about Vikki having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake's opponent in his next fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colasanto), and Vikki. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vikki approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vikki, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first. In a match against Billy Fox, after briefly pummeling his opponent, Jake does not even bother to put up a fight. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, though he realizes the error of his judgment when it is too late. He is eventually reinstated, and in 1949, wins the...

Should I validate this answer? Choose from: (A). No; (B). Yes; The answer is:","output":"(A). No; The suggested answer provided is not an accurate response to the question about SATA Power Connectors. Instead, it discusses the industry compatibility standards and the ownership transfer of SATA contents, rather than focusing on the features and purpose of SATA Power Connectors. A more appropriate response to the question would be: SATA Power Connectors are essential components within computer systems, responsible for supplying power to Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA) devices, such as hard disk drives (HDDs) and optical drives (CD/DVD/Blu-ray). They are specifically designed to meet the requirements of SATA-based storage devices and ensure reliable power connections. The connectors typically have 15 pins and are larger than the SATA data connectors, with the power connectors measuring 7.5mm x 3mm. The pins are organized into three rows, providing multiple voltages (3.3V, 5V, and 12V) needed by the SATA devices. The presence of different power connections in the 15-pin layout ensures that the devices receive the correct power voltage and current. Additionally, SATA Power Connectors have incorporated features, such as hot-swapping capabilities, which allow SATA devices to be connected or disconnected without turning off the system. In summary, the focus of the answer should be on the purpose, design, and functionality of the SATA Power Connectors rather than on the industry bodies overseeing SATA standards."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out.

In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084–1105) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a question and a context passage. You have to answer the question based on the given passage. Q: What effect did this have on the coffers?, Context: In 1374 King Louis of Hungary approved the Privilege of Koszyce (Polish: \\"przywilej koszycki\\" or \\"ugoda koszycka\\") in Košice in order to guarantee the Polish throne for his daughter Jadwiga. He broadened the definition of who was a member of the nobility and exempted the entire class from all but one tax (łanowy, which was limited to 2 grosze from łan (an old measure of land size)). In addition, the King's right to raise taxes was abolished; no new taxes could be raised without the agreement of the nobility. Henceforth, also, district offices (Polish: \\"urzędy ziemskie\\") were reserved exclusively for local nobility, as the Privilege of Koszyce forbade the king to grant official posts and major Polish castles to foreign knights. Finally, this privilege obliged the King to pay indemnities to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside Polish borders. A:","output":"The effect of the Privilege of Koszyce on the coffers was significant as it imposed several financial limitations on the king. Firstly, it broadened the definition of nobility and exempted the entire class from all but one tax, reducing the overall tax income. Secondly, it limited the łanowy tax to 2 grosze from łan, further restricting the income from taxes. Thirdly, it abolished the King's right to raise taxes unilaterally, making it necessary to get the agreement of the nobility for any new taxes. Lastly, it required the King to pay indemnities to nobles injured or taken captive during a war outside of Polish borders, adding an additional financial burden.

The Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643), in addition to a large output of church music and madrigals, wrote prolifically for the stage. His theatrical works were written between 1604 and 1643 and included ten operas, of which three—L'Orfeo (1607), Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640) and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643)—have survived with their music and librettos intact. In the case of the other seven operas, the music has disappeared almost entirely, although some of the librettos exist. The loss of these works, written during a critical period of early opera history, has been much regretted by commentators and musicologists. Opera, as a musical and theatrical genre, began to emerge during the early part of Monteverdi's career, initially as a form of courtly entertainment. With other composers, he played a leading part in its development into the main form of public musical theatre. His first opera, L'Orfeo, written in 1607 for the Mantuan court, which employed him, was a major success. In the years that followed, at Mantua and in his later capacity as maestro di cappella (director of music) at St Mark's Basilica in Venice, Monteverdi continued to write theatrical music in various genres, including operas, dances, and intermedi (short musical interludes inserted into straight plays). Because in Monteverdi's times stage music was rarely thought to have much utility after its initial performance, much of this music vanished shortly after its creation. Most of the available information relating to the seven lost operas has been deduced from contemporary documents, including the many letters that Monteverdi wrote. These papers provide irrefutable evidence that four of these works—L'Arianna, Andromeda, Proserpina rapita and Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia—were completed and performed in Monteverdi's lifetime, but of their music, only the famous lament from L'Arianna and a trio from Proserpina are known to have survived. The other three lost operas—Le nozze di Tetide, La finta pazza Licori and Armida... Answer:","output":"Monteverdi"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

While working as a correspondent at the offices of the Northern Star newspaper, Kipling (Christopher Plummer) is approached by a ragged, seemingly crazed derelict, who reveals himself to be his old acquaintance Peachy Carnehan (Michael Caine).

Billy speaks English as well as the local tongue, and it is he, acting as translator and interpreter of the customs and manners, who smooths the path of Peachy and Danny as they begin their rise, first offering their services as military advisors, trainers, and war leaders to the chief of a much-raided village.Peachy and Danny muster a force to attack the villagers' most-hated enemy. In their first battle, the natives decide that Danny must be a god when he is unharmed after being struck in the chest by an arrow. In fact, the arrow was stopped by a bandolier hidden beneath his clothing. As victory follows victory, the defeated warriors are recruited to join the swelling army.Finally, there is no one left to stand in their way, and they are summoned to the holy city of Sikandergul.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas?, using the article: Tosca is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa. It premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 14 January 1900. The work, based on Victorien Sardou's 1887 French-language dramatic play, La Tosca, is a melodramatic piece set in Rome in June 1800, with the Kingdom of Naples's control of Rome threatened by Napoleon's invasion of Italy. It contains depictions of torture, murder and suicide, as well as some of Puccini's best-known lyrical arias. Puccini saw Sardou's play when it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, obtained the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. Tosca premiered at a time of unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public. Musically, Tosca is structured as a through-composed work, with arias, recitative, choruses and other elements musically woven into a seamless whole. Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas. While critics have often dismissed the opera as a facile melodrama with confusions of plot—musicologist Joseph Kerman called it a \\"shabby little shocker\\"—the power of its score and the inventiveness of its orchestration have been widely acknowledged. The dramatic force of Tosca and its characters continues to fascinate both performers and audiences, and the work remains one of the most frequently performed operas. Many recordings of the work have been issued, both of studio and live performances., what would be the answer ?","output":"The answer to the question \\"What is the first name of the person who used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas?\\" would be Giacomo. The person who used Wagnerian leitmotifs in this context is Giacomo Puccini, the composer of the opera Tosca. According to the provided article, Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs in this opera to identify characters, objects, and ideas. Wagnerian leitmotifs, named after the German composer Richard Wagner who extensively used this musical technique, is a brief, recurring musical phrase associated with a particular character, place, thing, or idea in a piece of music, especially in operas. Leitmotif technique provides a musical representation for different characters or themes, enabling audiences to associate these motifs with their corresponding elements within the story, even as they evolve over time. In specific relation to Tosca, Giacomo Puccini applied this method in his composition and arrangement of the score. Despite some criticisms on its plot integrity, Tosca is acknowledged for the power of its score and the inventiveness of its orchestration, with the utilisation of leitmotifs being a significant contributing factor. The melodrama unfolds with characters, objects and ideas being represented and identified through unique recurring musical phrases, adding depth and complexity to the overall narrative. This technique enhances the expressive impact of the music, correlating specific motifs with unfolding drama, thereby heightening emotional engagement for the audience. So, despite the controversies and debates around Tosca since its premiere in 1900, it is incontrovertible that Puccini made a significant contribution to the musical world, integrating Wagnerian leitmotifs to help deepen audience engagement, create character associations, and convey the narrative more powerfully."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation 0 = 31*t + 232 - 77 for t, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation. Combine like terms on the right side of the equation: 0 = 31*t + (232 - 77) 0 = 31*t + 155 Step 2: Isolate the variable (t) on one side of the equation. To do this, move the constant term (155) to the left side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides: 0 - 155 = 31*t -155 = 31*t Step 3: Solve for t. Now, you want to get t by itself, so you need to divide both sides of the equation by 31: -155 / 31 = 31*t / 31 -5 = t So, the value of t that solves the equation 0 = 31*t + 232 - 77 is t = -5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This first production ran from May 30 to June 21, 2015. Despite a mixed critical reception, the show quickly gained a cult following online, largely thanks to its cast recording which was released on October 30, 2015. Released into the world of digital music, the recording popularized the show among a new generation of theater fans. The viral growth led to a number of productions of the musical taking place around the world, as its fan base continued to expand. Due to its popularity, an Off-Broadway production was announced and began previews at the Irene Diamond Stage at the Signature Theatre on July 26, 2018, officially opening on August 9, 2018. This production was directed by Stephen Brackett and choreographed by Chase Brock. Following its Off-Broadway run, \\"Be More Chill\\" transferred to Broadway, opening for previews at the Lyceum Theatre on February 13, 2019, with its official opening taking place on March 10, 2019.

Can you tell me what it is? The answer to this question is:","output":"Life expectancy at birth.  In the context of the Human Development Index (HDI), which is a composite statistic of life expectancy, education, and income per capita indicators, one of the tiers besides education and income per capita is life expectancy at birth. Life expectancy at birth is a measure of how long a newborn is expected to live, on average, given the current health conditions, mortality rates, and quality of healthcare in a particular country.  Higher life expectancy generally implies a longer and healthier life for the individuals living in a country. A longer life expectancy allows people to have more opportunities for personal and professional growth, increased well-being, and an overall better quality of life. This is why life expectancy is one of the three key indicators used in the HDI for ranking countries and determining their level of human development. The HDI, developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq and published by the United Nations Development Programme, assesses countries across these three primary indicators to understand people's ability to \\"be\\" and \\"do\\" desirable things in their lives. By considering life expectancy at birth alongside education and income per capita, the HDI provides a more comprehensive understanding of a country's development and overall living conditions than any single indicator could offer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The review offers a positive experience of donating items through the Salvation Army's pickup service, highlighting the navigability of the website, the convenience of scheduling a pickup online, and the efficiency of the pickup team in removing items from the apartment. The quick response of the pickup service adds to the positive sentiment. However, the reviewer also mentions a couple of negative points, including the difficulty in locating the pickup page from the Salvation Army's homepage and the lack of a predetermined pickup window until the morning of the pickup. Although these points are crucial to taking note of for future improvement, overall, they do not overshadow the positive elements of the reviewer’s experience.

When I first saw this game at my cousins house it was the coolest game I have ever seen I mean it has a great story line, good graphics, and massive worlds and on the PS2 its going to be great cause you can play 1-4 players and you dont have to buy four PCs to play the game with all of your friends and that's a major + any way I just cant wait for this awesome game to come out on the PS2.

The reviewer also highlights favorable aspects of the game, such as a great storyline, good graphics, and massive worlds. They mention that the game will be fun to play with friends on the PS2 due to the 1-4 player feature.

Gayle, took effect, and led to a United States Supreme Court decision that declared the Alabama and Montgomery laws that segregated buses were unconstitutional.

Bong! Bong! Big Ben's story started in 1834. In that year the old parliament building was burned down. Its clock tower fell to the ground. There had to be a new building and a new clock.  Plans were made. They called  for a \\"King of Clock, the biggest and the best in the world\\". So the clock had to be big. And it had to keep very good time.  In two years the big clock was made. Five more years went by before the clock tower was last finished. Then the four bells for the chimes   were brought into the tower. And at last the big hour bell was put in place. It rang out for the first time on July 11, 1859.  This great bell had to have a name. A meeting of parliament was called to pick one. \\"This clock is the king of clocks,\\" one man said. \\"Let's call the bell the Queen of Bells.\\"  \\"Then why not Victoria?\\" said another (Victoria was the British queen   at that time). The talk about names went on and on. Then Benjamin Hall got up to speak. He was a big man. By this time they were all tired.

This method avoids rice getting into the mat.  Place the seaweed sheet, shiny side down, on the mat. Select from the following. a). Place your sushi rolling mat in a refrigerator to chill. Dig up 2-5 stalks of green chilies, or any other large green chilies, and place the seaweed sheet, wide side down, on top of the sushi sheet.. b). Take the knees of the seaweed sheet and wrap them tightly around the sushi sandwich. The towels will help to trap the seaweed and relieve pressure, helping to ensure perfect sushi roll rolling.. c). This is important so the dough will rise evenly. Alternatively, peel and slice the seaweed strips thinly.. d). Pour water into a bowl and dip your fingers in it. Wetting your hands makes the rice less sticky while you work with it so it stays on the seaweed instead of your fingers..","output":"d). Pour water into a bowl and dip your fingers in it. Wetting your hands makes the rice less sticky while you work with it so it stays on the seaweed instead of your fingers. Following this step, you will then need to: 1. Prepare the sushi rice: Rinse the sushi rice under cold running water until the water runs clear. Combine the rinsed rice with an equal amount of water and cook in a rice cooker or on the stovetop according to package instructions. Once the rice is cooked, gently fold in sushi vinegar (a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt) and set aside to cool to room temperature. 2. Prepare the ingredients: For a traditional California roll, you'll need cooked crab or imitation crab meat, sliced cucumber, and sliced avocado. Make sure all ingredients are sliced into long, thin strips for easy assembly. 3. Assembly: Starting at the bottom edge of the seaweed sheet, spread a thin, even layer of sushi rice across the seaweed, leaving about 1-2 cm of space at the top to seal the roll. Lay the crab, cucumber, and avocado slices horizontally across the middle of the rice layer, ensuring each ingredient extends to the edges of the seaweed. 4. Rolling: Using the sushi rolling mat, start with the edge closest to you and gently roll the seaweed, rice, and fillings into a tight cylinder, applying pressure to keep the roll compact. Be sure not to roll the mat itself into the sushi. As you reach the end of the roll, moisten the exposed seaweed strip with some water to create a seal. 5. Cutting: Using a sharp, wet knife, slice the sushi roll into bite-sized pieces, about 2 cm thick. Regularly clean and wet the knife to ensure smooth and clean cuts through the sushi roll. 6. Serving: Arrange the California roll slices on a serving plate with a small dish of soy sauce for dipping, a portion of pickled ginger to cleanse the palate, and a dab of wasabi for added heat, if desired. Enjoy your homemade California rolls with chopsticks or just your fingers! Remember to practice patience and persistence when making sushi rolls, as it will take time to master the perfect roll. With each attempt, you'll find yourself improving and gaining confidence, all while discovering the delicious, satisfying world of homemade sushi."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As the southernmost of the three Nubian kingdoms, Alodia was the last to be converted to Christianity. According to John, the Alodian King was aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and asked him to send a bishop who would also baptize his people. The request was granted in 580, leading to the baptism of the King, his family and the local nobility. Thus, Alodia became a part of the Christian world under the Coptic Patriarchate of Alexandria. After conversion, several pagan temples, such as the one in Musawwarat es-Sufra, were probably converted into churches. The extent and speed with which Christianity spread among the Alodian populace is uncertain. Despite the conversion of the nobility, it is likely that Christianization of the rural population would have proceeded slowly, if at all.Between 639 and 641, Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt from the Byzantine Empire. Makuria, which by this time had been unified with Nobadia, fended off two subsequent Muslim invasions, one in 641/642 and another in 652. In the aftermath, Makuria and the Arabs agreed to sign the Baqt, a peace treaty that included a yearly exchange of gifts and socioeconomic regulations between Arabs and Nubians. Alodia was explicitly mentioned in the treaty as not being affected by it. While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia, they began to settle along the western coast of the Red Sea. They founded the port towns of Aydhab and Badi in the 7th century and Suakin, first mentioned in the 10th century. From the 9th century, they pushed further inland, settling among the Beja throughout the Eastern Desert. Arab influence would remain confined to the east of the Nile until the 14th century. contains an answer for the question: Which kingdom had their king baptized in 580?, what is it ?

In John of Ephesus' account, the Alodian King became aware of the conversion of Nobadia in 543 and requested a bishop to baptize his people. Consequently, in 580, the Alodian King, his family, and the local nobility were baptized, leading to the Christianization of Alodia.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please answer the following question: Joel has just started his first day working as a scientist in a laboratory. The first task he was given is to look at two atoms and to jot down as much information about the two as he can. First, he needs to come up with an identification for these atoms. Since he is new, he decides to keep it professional and simply call the larger of the two atoms \\"atom L\\" and the smaller one \\"atom S\\". Now that he's taken care of that he can get down to work.  Is the shielding effect in atom S higher or lower than in atom L?  Hint: The ionization energies of the representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom. The attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus weakens as the distance between them increases and as the shielding effect increases, resulting in a lower ionization energy for the larger atoms within a group. Although the nuclear charge is increased for larger atoms, the shielding effect also increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. This is particularly easy to see in the alkali metals, where the single valence electron is shielded by all of the inner core electrons. Answer:","output":"To determine whether the shielding effect in atom S is higher or lower than in atom L, let's follow these steps and analyze the given information: Step 1: Understand the shielding effect. The shielding effect refers to the decrease in the effective nuclear charge experienced by the valence electrons due to the presence of inner electrons, which causes a reduction in the attractive force between the valence electrons and the nucleus. Step 2: Consider the hint provided. The hint states that the ionization energies of representative elements generally decrease from top to bottom within a group. This is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. As the size of the atom increases, the valence electron being removed is further from the nucleus, resulting in a lower ionization energy due to the weakened attractive force between the valence electron and the nucleus. Step 3: Relate the hint to the shielding effect. The hint also states that although the nuclear charge is increased for larger atoms, the shielding effect also increases due to the presence of a larger number of inner electrons. Step 4: Apply the information to atoms L and S. Atom L is larger than atom S. Based on the hint, a larger atom has a higher shielding effect due to the increased presence of inner electrons, which limits the attractive force between valence electrons and the nucleus. Conclusion: The shielding effect in atom S is lower than in atom L."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

The sentence starts with \\"Amy really appreciated Elena, so...\\" The word \\"so\\" suggests a cause and effect relationship.

Option 1 says \\"Amy gave a very nice gift to show her affection.\\" This would make sense, as Amy's appreciation should result in Amy herself taking an action, which is indeed giving a gift in this instance. Option 2 says \\"Elena gave a very nice gift to show her affection.\\" This isn't aligned with the initial sentence, since Elena's actions aren't the focus according to the context set. We are talking about Amy’s feeling and presumably her resultant action. Consequently, the most reasonable choice is option 1, \\"Amy gave a very nice gift to show her affection.\\" This is the option that remains consistent with the causal relationship pointed to by the \\"so\\" in the first part of the sentence.

What are the reasons for anemia? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Choices: A). no B). yes","output":"A) No, hemophilia and anemia are not the same, but they can be related in some cases. Hemophilia and anemia are both blood-related disorders; however, they have distinct differences in their underlying causes and effects on the body. Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder that primarily affects males and is characterized by a deficiency or dysfunction in one of the proteins that help the blood to clot, known as clotting factors. There are different types of hemophilia, classified according to which clotting factor is deficient or affected, with the two most common types being hemophilia A (deficiency in clotting factor VIII) and hemophilia B (deficiency in clotting factor IX). Hemophilia results in prolonged and spontaneous bleeding, either externally (from injuries and cuts) or internally (into joints, muscles, or organs). Treatment for hemophilia typically involves the administration of the missing clotting factor in the form of a concentrate or recombinant product. Anemia, on the other hand, is a general term for a condition where the body does not have enough red blood cells (RBCs) or the RBCs do not function properly. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein that binds to oxygen and allows the RBCs to transport oxygen throughout the body. A lack of functional RBCs results in lower oxygen-carrying capacity and can cause fatigue, pale skin, shortness of breath, and various other symptoms. There are several types and causes of anemia: 1. Iron-deficiency anemia: This is the most common type of anemia, caused by a lack of sufficient iron in the body. Iron is a critical component of hemoglobin, and without enough iron, the body cannot produce enough hemoglobin to maintain adequate RBC function. Potential reasons for iron deficiency include poor diet, the body's reduced ability to absorb iron, or blood loss (either from injury, menstruation, or gastrointestinal bleeding). 2. Vitamin-deficiency anemia: A deficiency in vitamin B12 or folic acid can lead to anemia because these vitamins are necessary for the production of red blood cells. Reasons for these deficiencies may include poor diet, malabsorption disorders, or medications that affect absorption. 3. Hemolytic anemia: This type of anemia occurs when RBCs are destroyed prematurely, leading to a decrease in RBC lifespan and a shortage of RBCs. Hemolytic anemia can be caused by various factors such as autoimmune diseases, infections, or inherited conditions like sickle cell anemia or thalassemia. 4. Aplastic anemia: Aplastic anemia is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when the body fails to produce enough RBCs due to damage or failure of the bone marrow (the tissue responsible for producing blood cells). Causes of aplastic anemia can include exposure to radiation, certain medications, autoimmune diseases, or inherited conditions. 5. Anemia of chronic disease: Some chronic inflammations or long-term diseases can lead to the development of anemia, such as kidney disease, cancer, or rheumatoid arthritis. To summarize, hemophilia and anemia are related insofar as they are both blood-related disorders with distinct causes, manifestations, and treatments. Hemophilia mainly focuses on the clotting factor deficiencies affecting the blood's ability to clot and is caused by genetic factors, while anemia is characterized by a lack of functional red blood cells or a lower oxygen-carrying capacity, and can have a wide range of underlying causes."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

These scenarios might make answering the question harder.  Additionally, the instructions caution that there are 'distractor sentences' throughout the story that aren't relevant to the answer. The steps to solve this task are as follows: Step 1: Read the story - it’s important to read carefully since it shares a lot of information that may or may not be relevant. Step 2: Identify the distractor sentences. These sentences might not have any direct impact on the question being asked. For instance, \\"Mason entered the office\\" doesn't appear to pertain to the location of the pumpkin. Step 3: Identify the object in question, which is the pumpkin in this case. Step 4: Follow the journey of the object in the story. Here, it's first stated that \\"The pumpkin is in the blue_crate.\\" The story ends with \\"William moved the pumpkin to the green_suitcase.\\" Step 5: Use information from step 4 to answer the question \\"Where is the pumpkin really?\\"  Following these steps, you can conclude the pumpkin is really in the green suitcase since William moved it there."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Will Games help Scotland's flower bloom? Scotland may not have qualified for the World Cup in Brazil, but Glasgow is gearing-up for what could be one of the most significant sporting events in Scottish history. The Commonwealth Games will be officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on July 23 and there are much more than medals at stake. This event has taken on added significance because it will be followed a few weeks later by the referendum on Scottish independence. The two are so close together that it is impossible to separate sport from politics. Scottish Nationalists are pinning their hopes on a successful Games to generate a burst of national pride that will give them momentum in the polls and a ‘Yes’ majority. You can already feel the excitement beginning to build around the city. Paula Speirs, a mother of two, is among more than 50,000 people to have volunteered their services. \\"I love sport and having such a huge sporting event in my home city is something I wanted to be part of. Glasgow is starting to really come alive with all things Games,\\" she said, \\"I was so delighted when I got my email to offer me a Clyde-sider role and thrilled to be selected. I'm even looking forward to six days of 7.30am starts!\\" In contrast to the unifying experience of the London Olympics, the Commonwealth Games also sets Scotland and England against each other. In a sporting manifestation of a possible political future, the two countries compete independently under their own colours with their own teams. This also provides the Scottish government with an opportunity. Scotland’s first minister, Alex Salmond, was famously pictured 'photo-bombing' Wimbledon, waving Scotland's flag in the stand when Andy Murray, a Scot, won the championship. We can expect a lot more of that kind of thing in Glasgow. The most high-profile events will take place at Hampden Park. The stadium, which has been temporarily converted from football to athletics, is a place of tribal intensity. Former council leader Steven Purcell helped to bring the Commonwealth Games to Glasgow. He is hoping that this event will be much more celebratory and welcoming than the deadly seriousness that accompanies football in Scotland. \\"Glasgow is a famously friendly city and it will be a privilege to welcome world-class performers like Jessica Ennis and Mo Farah,\\" he said. \\"I believe that Scotland is more confident about itself now and I want to see everyone who competes here, including athletes from England, get a huge cheer from the Hampden crowd.\\" Nobody can predict with confidence how the Glasgow crowd will respond when the UK’s national anthem 'God Save the Queen' is played during medal ceremonies. The Commonwealth Games might also show how politics can be shaped by unintended consequences. Purcell is a member of the pro-UK Labour Party. By bringing the event to Glasgow, he could end up being one of the people most responsible for helping 'yes' to victory.

Shares AMSTERDAM, Netherlands, Oct 11 – The Netherlands failed to reach the 2018 World Cup finals as they could only beat Sweden 2-0 on Tuesday when they needed an unlikely 7-0 victory. Elimination is fresh humiliation for the nation that reached the 2010 World Cup final and the semi-finals four years later, after they also missed out on Euro 2016 qualification. Can we infer the following? Soccer is boring and scores very little points","output":"The statement \\"Soccer is boring and scores very little points\\" is a subjective opinion and cannot be inferred from the given information regarding the Netherlands failing to reach the 2018 World Cup finals and their previous successes in 2010 and 2014.  It is true that soccer, or football as it is known in most parts of the world, is a sport in which scoring is generally low compared to other sports. However, this does not mean that soccer is inherently boring or uneventful. Rather, it is important to understand various aspects of the sport that contribute to its global popularity and the excitement it generates. Firstly, soccer is a fast-paced sport wherein teams must constantly adapt to various in-game situations. The lack of frequent stoppages and constant action in soccer adds to the excitement of the game. Soccer matches are played in two 45-minute halves, with limited interruptions, which allows for a continuous flow of play. This flow can create tense and thrilling situations throughout a match, even if scoring is relatively rare. Secondly, the lower scoring nature of soccer places a higher emphasis on the importance of each goal. As a result, scoring opportunities and goals carry a certain weight and significance that may not be present in other sports with higher scoring. This often results in intense efforts from both teams trying to capitalize on every potential scoring chance, resulting in a high level of competitiveness and excitement for fans. Additionally, soccer is a globally popular sport that attracts millions of fans due to its accessibility, simplicity, and diverse range of talented players and teams. The sport transcends cultural, linguistic, and geographical boundaries, creating a shared global interest. This shared interest generates a vibrant atmosphere in stadiums and watching parties, where fans come together to support their respective teams, adding to the excitement of the matches. Furthermore, soccer has a rich history and iconic moments, from thrilling goals to monumental upsets that have captivated the world. The sport has produced numerous legendary players and teams that have inspired generations of fans. These moments add layers of emotion and passion to the sport, creating narratives that contribute to the overall appeal of soccer. Lastly, major international tournaments, such as the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship, add a competitive element and a sense of national pride to the sport. These events captivate entire countries and bring a sense of unity between people who may otherwise have little in common. In conclusion, while it is accurate to say that soccer generally experiences lower scoring in comparison to certain other sports, it is not valid to infer that the sport is boring as a direct result. The excitement and appeal of soccer rely on a multitude of factors, including its fast pace, global popularity, rich history, and high-stakes competitions. Soccer is a beloved sport for millions of fans worldwide, and the low scoring nature of the game only adds to the suspense and significance of each goal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Osceola was named Billy Powell at birth in 1804 in the Creek village of Talisi. now known as Tallassee, Alabama, in current Elmore County. \\"The people in the town of Tallassee...were mixed-blood Native American/English/Irish/Scottish, and some were black. Billy was all of these.\\" After Osceola's death, army doctor Frederick Weedon persuaded the Seminole to allow him to make a death mask of Osceola, this being a European-American custom at the time for prominent people. Later he removed Osceola's head and embalmed it. For some time, Weedon kept the head and a number of personal objects Osceola had given him. Later, Weedon gave the head to his son-in-law Daniel Whitehurst. In 1843, Whitehurst sent the head to Valentine Mott, a New York physician. Mott placed it in his collection at the Surgical and Pathological Museum. It was presumably lost when a fire destroyed the museum in 1866. Some of Osceola's belongings are still held by the Weedon family, while others have disappeared.  Captain Pitcairn Morrison sent the death mask and some other objects collected by Weedon to an army officer in Washington. By 1885, the death mask and some of Osceola's belongings had arrived in the anthropology collection of the Smithsonian Institution, where they are still held.  In 1966, Miami businessman Otis W. Shriver claimed he had dug up Osceola's grave and put his bones into a bank vault to rebury them at a tourist site at the Rainbow Springs. Shriver traveled around the state in 1967 to gather support for his project. Archaeologists later proved that Shriver had dug up animal remains; Osceola's body was still in its coffin.  In 1979 the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma bought Osceola's bandolier and other personal items from a Sotheby's auction. Because of the chief's significance, over time some people have created forgeries of Osceola's belongings. Rumors persist that his embalmed head has been found in various locations. Did Weedon keep the mask?","output":"No, Weedon did not keep the mask.

(Melina Mara/ The Washington Post) Is Mitt Romney getting the band back together? The 2012 Republican presidential nominee has invited his debate prep advisers and senior campaign aides to his mountaintop chalet in Park City, Utah, for a weekend of skiing later this month, according to two people close to Romney. The reunion of Romney's political brain trust comes amid a burst of positive buzz about the former Massachusetts governor -- from favorable reviews of \\"MITT,\\" the Netflix documentary about his campaigns, to chatter among some powerful GOP donors about another Romney presidential campaign in 2016. But Romney has been adamant in saying he will not run for president a third time. And his aides insisted this month's reunion in Park City is not a 2016 strategy session. \\"It's really informal,\\" said a Romney aide, who requested anonymity to discuss the reunion. \\"The Romneys invited a few campaign friends out to Utah to ski for the weekend.\\" Asked if there would be any political strategizing, the aide wrote in an e-mail, \\"Purely recreational. No 'strategizing.'\\" The reunion is expected to include some senior campaign staff and debate prep advisers, including Beth Myers, Stuart Stevens, Russ Schriefer, Bob White, Peter Flaherty, Eric Fehrnstrom, Austin Barbour, Gail Gitcho and others. The team will gather in Park City, where Romney recently purchased a large vacation home at the Deer Valley ski resort. Romney said in a recent interview with The Washington Post that he shares the home \\"50-50\\" with a co-owner.

WATCH VIDEO BELOW The California Highway Patrol is hunting for a pair of heartless thugs, who were caught on tape beating another man senseless and leaving him by the side of the road during a Los Angeles traffic argument last week. The brawl occurred on June 12 on the northbound side of Interstate 5, and a passerby's video of it made local newscasts on Tuesday after going viral on YouTube and Live Leak, KTLA television reported. The passerby, who was in his car, rolled down his passenger-side window and filmed the four cursing, shouting and, ultimately, fighting with each other. In the video, three men standing near an older-model Volkswagen argue with a man in a red shirt standing beside his Honda. Eventually, the man in red and one of the other three raise their fists.

Article: Yu Pengnian is an 88-year-old real estate Chinese businessman. He amassed  a fortune of 1.3 billion dollars during his career but instead of keeping the money and living like an emperor, he decided to give it all away. All of his fortune will be spent on helping poor Chinese students get a better education. And Yu isn't the only super-rich person in China who has this spirit of giving. Chen Guangbiao, a Jiangsu recycling tycoon, has given millions of dollars to charity  and promises to give all of his money to charity when he dies.    Yu and Chen are among the many businessmen who have become prosperous during China's economic rise. An American business magazine, Forbes, estimates that there are 117 billionaires in China and hundreds of thousands of millionaires. What sets Yu and Chen apart from the rest, though, is their tremendous generosity(,) when it comes to donating money to charity.    Last week Bill Gates and Warren Buffett came to Beijing. Gates and Buffett, two of the world's richest men, are also the world's biggest philanthropists. They invited fifty of China's richest people to have dinner with them and talk about the spirit of giving. At first, only a few people accepted their invitation. It seemed some of the invited guests were afraid that Buffett and Gates were going to pressure them into giving their wealth to charity.    A lot of people are angry at the billionaires who are not willing to give away their fortunes. They  _ hem for being miserly and not caring about the poor and the less fortunate. But I think this criticism is wrong. A gift, any gift, should come from the heart.

A:","output":"If Mona owns a greenhouse and decides to cover the top up to restrict sunlight, her plant's ability to make food would decrease. This is because photosynthesis, which is the process through which plants and phytoplankton produce food, relies heavily on exposure to sunlight. Sunlight provides the necessary energy for plants to undergo photosynthesis and produce essential sugars used for growth and sustenance. By covering the top of the greenhouse, Mona would be reducing the amount of sunlight, and therefore, the amount of available energy for her plants' photosynthesis process. With less sunlight reaching her plants, they would be less capable of producing the needed food to grow and thrive. As a result, the overall productivity and health of her plants would suffer due to the decrease in the food production process.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article: In other words, do the things you want your children to do.  If you direct your children to be on time for appointments or be at home at a certain time, you should also arrive when you say you are going to.  If you don’t want your child to use foul language, don’t curse.  If you want your children to tell the truth, don’t lie to them or others.  Even if you advise your children to do the right thing, they will not admire you if you are hypocritical. .   Children will not admire an inflexible tyrant.  Including your child in discussions which affect them will gain their admiration and help them develop a sense of personal autonomy and agency.  You can include your child in both small and large decisions.  For instance, a few nights a week you could ask your child what he or she wants for dinner.  (Naturally, if they answer something unacceptable like ice cream, you should tell them that is not an option.) Including your child in family decisions doesn’t mean relinquishing all responsibility for those decisions.  You’re still the parent and ultimately, authority still rests with you. Go for walks, go to the movies, and go to get ice cream together.  Enjoy the time you spend with them.  Tell your child regularly that you love them.  When they come home after school, ask “How was your day?”  Ask about their dreams, ideas, and feelings.  For instance, your child says, “I want to be a dancer when I grow up,” you could ask, “Why do you want to be a dancer?”  Listen to their answers and don’t belittle what they have to say.  If you need more information, ask follow-up questions. Take time to seriously answer any questions your child asks. Show your child know that you will always be there for them.  If they need help with homework or if they are sick, take time out of your schedule to care for them. Recognize that nobody is perfect.  If you make a mistake, you should acknowledge that you did so and apologize for hurting anyone’s feelings.  Find ways to amend the situation and think about what you can do next time to prevent a similar situation from occurring.  Use these situations to illustrate to your child how to admit when you’re wrong and ask for forgiveness.  For instance, if you mistook your child’s drawing a of a bird for a butterfly, your child might feel distraught.  Admit that you made a mistake by identifying it wrongly and reassure them that it is a great drawing.  Say, “I’m sorry, can you forgive me?” When your children make mistakes, you should always expect them to acknowledge the mistake.  Your child should apologize and correct the situation as needed.  For instance, if they spilled milk on the floor while you were out of the room, ensure that they admit to doing so and then help you clean it up (assuming they are of an appropriate age to do so). Tell your child you love them even when they make mistakes. If you always have something interesting to teach or explain to your child, they will be much impressed and admire you for your depth of knowledge.  Having a well-rounded education will not only equip you for a richer life, but it will also demonstrate to your child that education should be an important part of their life, as well.  If you did not graduate high school, consider getting your GED. If you did graduate high school, consider going to college.  You could get a two-year associate’s degree or a four-year bachelor’s degree. You don’t need a college education to be well-educated or interested in learning, though it does help.  Keep up with current events by reading the newspaper regularly.  Visit your local library to check out some books.  Read a mix of both fiction and nonfiction.  Watch documentaries as well as feature films. Expand your mind by diving deeper into topics you know little about.  By challenging yourself, you will be able to think about things in a different way. By taking your child to local art museums, you can learn together. If you lose your job, fall ill, or suffer another misfortune, do not mope about it.  Instead, take proactive action to correct the situation.  For instance, if you lose your job, seek new work in the classifieds of your local paper or online.  Use labor networking sites like LinkedIn and Monster.com to make your resume available for potential employers and browse available jobs.  Develop patience and control your anger when you feel it rising within you. Do not take your frustration about a difficult situation out on your child or anyone else.  Find positive ways to deal with your frustration through deep breathing, yoga, mediation, or engaging yourself with a fun hobby. While it is natural to feel depressed when confronted with loss of a family member or other hardship, stay strong and positive for your child.  Talk to a trained therapist if your feelings persist. Summary:","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of leading by example for parents and ensuring a healthy parent-child relationship. Parents should exhibit the behavior they want their children to follow, include their children in decision-making processes, and spend quality time with them. Listening to and showing interest in a child's ideas, feelings, and opinions is vital, as is acknowledging mistakes and demonstrating forgiveness. Moreover, parents should be continuous learners, expanding their knowledge and interests and involving their children in cultural and educational activities.

Carrie Fisher’s death could be a windfall for Disney.      The entertainment company, the distributor of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” and the next two films in the franchise, could receive 50 million thanks to an insurance policy the company took out in the event Fisher was unable to fulfill her three-film contract.      It’s set to be the largest single personal accident insurance claim payout ever, according to Insurance Insider.      Fisher reprised her career-making role of Princess Leia from the original 1977 “Star Wars” flick for the new trilogy. “The Force Awakens,” released in December 2015, made 2.068 billion at the box office worldwide.      Filming on “Episode VIII” was already complete at the time of Fisher’s death on Dec. 27 at the age of 60, after she suffered a heart attack aboard a flight from London to Los Angeles.      Fisher was due to appear in “Episode IX,” forcing the film’s creators to either rewrite the plot or possibly use visual effects to insert her in the film. The latter was implemented for “Rogue One,” in which the late Peter Cushing reprised his role as Grand Moff Tarkin.      It’s unclear if a similar insurance policy was taken out on Fisher’s co-star, Mark Hamill.      An autopsy Friday determined Fisher’s cause of death was “not obvious” and that further testing will be required, TMZ reported.      Fisher’s mother, Debbie Reynolds, passed away the day after her daughter’s death. She was 84 years old.      Hamill gave his first extended interview after the mother-daughter pair’s passing, calling the two “mothering types, both opinionated and determined.”      “I can’t think of [Fisher] in the past tense. I think of her in the present tense, in the future tense,” Hamill told Entertainment Weekly. “I’m angry and so sad.” ||||| Recent news:      Lloyd’s braced for 50mn Carrie Fisher Star Wars claim      Adam McNestrie, Dan Ascher and Matthew Neill 30 December 2016      Insurers at Lloyd's of London look set to pay out a significant contingency claim following the tragic death of Star Wars actress Carrie Fisher, The Insurance Insider can reveal.      Sources said that Disney had taken out 50mn of so-called contract protection cover as insurance for the event that Fisher was unable to fulfil her obligations to act in the new Star Wars films, with the policy now likely to trigger.      The policy was underwritten by specialist New Jersey-based managing general agent Exceptional Risk Advisors, but if the policy triggers the loss will be entirely borne by capacity providers in Lloyd's, with Enstar subsidiary Atrium the lead on the facility.      Sources said that the claim would be widely spread within the Lloyd's contingency market, with more than 20 carriers on the binder.      However, the loss would cause substantial damage to the 2016 underwriting result for the segment, with some Lloyd's insurers writing contingency books with 10mn or less of annual premiums.      Fisher died on Tuesday (27 December), four days after she suffered a heart attack on a flight between London and Los Angeles.      The actress rose to prominence in the late 1970s, playing Princess Leia in the first Star Wars trilogy.      She reprised the role last year in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, a runaway success which took 2.07bn at the box office.      Filming for Star Wars Episode VIII, which will be released next year, was completed ahead of Fisher's death.      Princess Leia was again slated to have a major role in Episode IX and it is not clear how Disney, which owns the Star Wars franchise, will choose to respond.      According to its website, Exceptional Risk Advisors is a specialist in high-limit specialty life, accident, and disability products, with underwriting authorities from Lloyd's insurers that exceed 50mn per individual risk.      Fisher's spokesperson could not be reached. Atrium declined to comment. Exceptional Risk Advisors and Disney did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Carrie Fisher's death could result in a 50 million insurance payout for Disney, due to an insurance policy the company took out in case Fisher was unable to fulfill her three-film contract for the Star Wars franchise.

Chancellor Valorum (Terence Stamp) of the Galactic Republic, sends Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) on a secret mission to meet with the Trade Federation to settle the crisis. Unknown to them, the Trade Federation is in league with the mysterious Sith Lord Darth Sidious, who orders them to invade Naboo with their immense droid army and also to kill the two Jedi. Following a failed attempt to force their way into Gunray's command center, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan escape and flee to the surface of Naboo, where they meet local Gungan outcast Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best). As Jar Jar brings them to an underwater Gungan settlement, the Trade Federation captures Naboo's leader, Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman). Through a Jedi mind trick, Qui-Gon secures a submarine, which he, Obi-Wan, and Jar Jar use to reach the capital of Naboo and rescue Queen Amidala and her escort. The group departs for Coruscant, the Galactic Republic's capital planet, to seek help from the Senate.During the escape, the ship is attacked by the Federation blockade, forcing R2-D2, one of the ship's droids, to fix the shields.

Alpine lake had low water levels this spring although the lake is usually at full level by late spring. Last year was a very wet year with lots of precipitation. Rangers were planning on letting water out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake.

The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level.

Now that he has successfully completed braiding his hair, they both acknowledge the accomplishment by shaking hands. This not only confirms their agreement on the completion of the task at hand but also demonstrates a mutual appreciation for the woman's guidance and the man's effort to learn something new. Option (1) is less logical because the woman is already providing hair styling tips through her demonstration. Returning for more advice would likely be repetitive. Option (3) is less fitting because taking a bow is often reserved for performers, artists, or athletes in competitive environments, and there is no indication of a performance or competition taking place in this context. Option (4) is the least logical choice because the \\"finish\\" logo is an abstract concept and doesn't have a clear connection to concluding the process or wrapping up the scenario.

The coalition said no operations had been conducted near the embassy. Saudi Arabia recently cut ties with Iran after its embassy in Tehran was attacked by protesters angry at the Saudi execution of a key Shia cleric. The regional rivals back opposing sides in Yemen - Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia accuses Iran of supporting the Shia Houthis militarily. Tehran denies this. The Saudi-US-Iran triangle: How crisis reflects deeply fractured Middle East Great rivalry explained: Why don't Iran and Saudi Arabia get along? Spiralling tensions: Why crisis is \\"most dangerous for decades\\" Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr: Who was leading Saudi Shia cleric? A statement by the Saudi-led coalition on Thursday said Iran's allegations were \\"false and that no operations were carried out around the embassy or near to it\\". It said its investigation \\"also confirms the embassy building is safe and has not been damaged\\". Residents and witnesses in Sanaa had also earlier reported there was no damage to the main embassy building. Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Hossein Jaber Ansari had accused Saudi Arabia of a  \\"deliberate action\\" in \\"violation of all international conventions that protect diplomatic missions\\". He spoke of damage to the building and injuries to staff. Later, Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian said: \\"During an air raid by Saudi Arabia against Sanaa, a rocket fell near our embassy and unfortunately one of our guards was seriously wounded.\\" He added: \\"We will inform the Security Council of the details of this attack.\\" Ever since the Saudi-led air campaign began against Yemen's Houthi rebels last March, there was always a risk that the cold war between the region's two big rivals, Saudi Arabia and Iran, could ignite into something more serious. The Saudis accuse Iran of smuggling in arms by sea to equip the Shia Houthis, who retain control over the capital and much of the country. Saudi officials have even claimed that Iranian military commanders are on the ground there, helping to direct the Houthis. Both Iran and the Houthis deny this. The reality is that the Houthis owe most of their military gains to support from renegade Yemeni army units loyal to ousted ex-President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Saudi Arabia's military spokesman says its coalition has asked for precise co-ordinates of foreign embassies in the Yemeni capital so it can avoid hitting them. Angry as the Saudis are about the ransacking of their embassy in Tehran, it would have been a major escalation if they had carried out a deliberate, direct hit on Iran's embassy in retaliation. It is not clear whether the Iranian embassy was fully functioning, but a number of countries have withdrawn their staff or relocated missions to the port city of Aden in the past year. Although the incident may turn out to be less serious than initially feared, the BBC's Arab Affairs Editor Sebastian Usher says the growing row between Saudi Arabia and Iran could derail peace efforts in Syria and Iraq, as well as in Yemen. The row began after Saudi Arabia executed Shia cleric, Nimr al-Nimr for \\"terrorism offences\\" After the Saudi embassy was attacked, Saudi Arabia severed relations with Iran. A number of Saudi allies then followed suit in taking diplomatic action against Tehran. At least 2,795 civilians have been killed in Yemen since March, when the Saudi-led coalition began a military campaign to restore the government and drive back the Houthis and allied security personnel loyal to ex-President Saleh. In the past six months, coalition and pro-government forces have retaken Aden, but the rebels still control the capital. The already dire humanitarian situation has also deteriorated, with more than 21 million people - four-fifths of the population - now requiring aid.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Sissinghurst Castle Garden, at Sissinghurst in the Weald of Kent in England, was created by Vita Sackville-West, poet and writer, and her husband Harold Nicolson, author and diplomat. It is among the most famous gardens in England and is designated Grade I on Historic England's register of historic parks and gardens. It was bought by Sackville-West in 1930, and over the next thirty years, working with, and later succeeded by, a series of notable head gardeners, she and Nicolson transformed a farmstead of \\"squalor and slovenly disorder\\" into one of the world's most influential gardens. Following Sackville-West's death in 1962, the estate was donated to the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. It is one of the Trust's most popular properties, with nearly 200,000 visitors in 2017. The gardens contain an internationally respected plant collection, particularly the assemblage of old garden roses. The writer Anne Scott-James considered the roses at Sissinghurst to be \\"one of the finest collections in the world\\". A number of plants propagated in the gardens bear names related to people connected with Sissinghurst or the name of the garden itself. The garden design is based on axial walks that open onto enclosed gardens, termed \\"garden rooms\\", one of the earliest examples of this gardening style. Among the individual \\"garden rooms\\", the White Garden has been particularly influential, with the horticulturalist Tony Lord describing it as \\"the most ambitious ... of its time, the most entrancing of its type.\\"The site of Sissinghurst is ancient and has been occupied since at least the Middle Ages.

Summarize: Write each vocabulary word in a sentence that gives contextual clues to the word’s meaning. Contextual clues are words and phrases around an unknown word that point to the word’s meaning.  For example, if the vocabulary word is “succinct,” you might write, “Julia gave a succinct presentation and the meeting was over in no time.” Remember that contextual clues can be misleading. For example, the sentence “As he rushed out the door, Chris felt reluctant to meet his friend,” could imply that “reluctant” means Chris was rushing to see his friend because he was excited or rushing because he was nervous and apprehensive. Using the contextual clues you’ve provided, let your students brainstorm each word’s meaning. Letting your students brainstorm will get their mental juices flowing and they’ll be more primed to remember the meaning of the words later on. Once they’ve had a chance to think about the word on their own, you should tell them what it really means. You can read them the dictionary definition, but it’s more important to present the word in a way that your students will connect with. Use your students’ experience of the world to explain the word. For example, if the word is “hodgepodge,” pull out a plastic crate of different colored markers and “this is a hodgepodge of markers. A hodgepodge is a confusing mix of different things all thrown together.” Students learn words more quickly if they can connect them to images. Come up with different ways to represent a word using imagery.  For example, if the word is “interstellar,” talk to them about the vast space between the stars and explain, “’interstellar’ is the word for that space.” If the word is something more abstract, like “repercussions,” show them pictures of children who were sent to their rooms without supper or pictures of people in jail.","output":"To help your students understand the meaning of vocabulary words through contextual clues, it is essential to create sentences that provide hints about the word's definition. Here is a detailed approach to teaching vocabulary words using contextual clues, brainstorming, real-world examples, and visual aids. Step 1: Choose vocabulary words Select a list of vocabulary words that you would like your students to learn. These words can be from a reading assignment, subject-specific, or simply a list of words you think would be beneficial for them to know. Step 2: Craft sentences with contextual clues For each vocabulary word, create a sentence that provides contextual clues to its meaning. Avoid misleading contextual clues to prevent confusion. Here are some examples: 1. Altruistic: Despite having little money herself, Maria made an altruistic gesture by donating to the charity. 2. Nebulous: Steve's explanation of the project was nebulous, leaving the team unsure of what their roles were. 3. Serendipity: When Jane found an old coin in her backyard, she called it a serendipity. 4. Placate: The father tried to placate his crying child with a toy from the store. 5. Quandary: Faced with two highly appealing job offers, Alicia found herself in a quandary. Step 3: Brainstorm with students Introduce each sentence to your students and let them brainstorm the meaning of the vocabulary word using the contextual clues. Allow them time to discuss their ideas and guesses amongst themselves. Step 4: Reveal the meaning After your students had a chance to think about the word on their own, reveal the actual definition. Present the word in a way that connects with their experiences and enables them to relate to it. Step 5: Provide real-world examples Share real-world examples that illustrate the meaning of the word and help your students better understand its context. This could be current events, situations from popular media, or even examples from their own lives. Step 6: Use visual aids Show students images that represent the vocabulary words. This can be especially helpful for abstract concepts or words that might be difficult for them to visualize. Find creative ways to connect the images with the words to reinforce their meaning and help with retention. By following this approach, your students will have a better understanding of the vocabulary words and be more likely to remember their meanings. Creating sentences with contextual clues, allowing for brainstorming, presenting real-world examples, and using visual imagery help solidify these words in your students' minds and improve their overall vocabulary skills."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Explanation: This action will not likely cut the metal bar into two equal sizes due to the improper use of a drawer and the lack of a proper cutting tool. Part 2: Using words provided in the input. Usage: Cut the metal bar into two equal sizes by wrapping it in a towel and gently tapping it with a hammer. Explanation: This action uses the words \\"cut\\" and \\"equal sizes\\" from the input but will not actually lead to cutting the bar because the method is not effective at cutting metal. Part 3: Introduce unrelated objects or events. Usage: Cut the metal bar into two equal sizes by surrounding it with a circle of lit candles and singing \\"Happy Birthday\\". Explanation: This action introduces unrelated objects (candles) and an event (singing) that do not have any connection to cutting a metal bar, thus not leading to the desired outcome. Part 4: Creating contradictory statements. Usage: Cut the metal bar into two equal sizes by trying to weld the two ends together. Explanation: Welding is a process used for joining metal parts, so stating that welding can be used to cut a metal bar creates a contradiction and does not lead to the asked outcome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who probably examines his life after writing the text? Answer: Answer:","output":"The author probably examines their life after writing the text. The reason behind this deduction is that the text encourages the reader to envision a better, evolved version of themselves, focusing on various aspects such as physical appearance, emotional wellbeing, mental health, and behavior. The author provides a comprehensive framework for readers to follow in their self-exploratory journey, which suggests that they might have gone through this process themselves.

The digital data on a CD begins at the center of the disc and proceeds toward the edge, which allows adaptation to the different size formats available. Standard CDs are available in two sizes. By far, the most common is 120 millimetres (4.7 in) in diameter, with a 74- or 80-minute audio capacity and a 650 or 700 MiB (737,280,000-byte) data capacity. This capacity was reportedly specified by Sony executive Norio Ohga in May 1980 so as to be able to contain the entirety of the London Philharmonic Orchestra's recording of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony on one disc.

We show sadness and happiness through our expressions. But exactly how many emotions can our face make?Scientists used to believe we had six basic facial expressions that tell others how we feel: sad, happy, surprised, fearful, angry and disgusted  . But a new study shows that our faces can do more than we think. Scientists from Ohio State University found out that humans can actually make 21 different facial expressions after studying how people move their facial muscles. The scientists took pictures of 230 volunteers making faces in response to different cues  .These cues included phrases like \\"you just got some great unexpected news\\", which produced a \\"happily surprised\\" reaction from volunteers. Other cues included \\"you smell a bad odor  \\", which caused \\"disgusted\\" faces. In total, around 5,000 pictures were taken of the volunteers. The scientists then studied similarities of these pictures using a computer expression database. _ helped them to define a facial expression. \\"That tells us that these 21 emotions are expressed in the same way by nearly everyone,\\" said DrAleix Martinez to The Daily Telegraph. For example, to express surprise, 92 percent of volunteers widened   their eyes and opened their mouth. And 99 percent raised their cheeks   and smiled to show being happy. We are not always aware of our facial expressions, which can hold clues to how we really feel. So these results may have a big impact   on medical treatment. If doctors were able to recognize more complex   emotions, it would help doctors treat patients suffering from certain diseases. How didscientists from Ohio State University find out the number of facial expressions? A) They studied how people move their eyes. B) They studied how people move their mouths.

My thick black hair had been recently cut short into an untidy style. Her natural blonde hair flowed to her waist and looked great. I was 12 and one of the oldest in the class while she was 11 and the youngest. I was awkward and shy. She wasn't. I couldn't stand her, considering her my enemy. But she liked me and wanted to be friends. One day, she invited me over and I said yes--I was too shocked to answer any other way. My family had moved six times in six years, and I had never managed to develop any friendships. But this girl who wore the latest fashions wanted me to go home with her after school. She lived in a fun part of town that had two pizza places, an all-night bookstore, a movie theater and a park. As we walked from the school bus stop through her neighborhood, I tried to guess which house might be hers. Was it the white one with the perfect lawn or the three-story house with a front porch? I got very surprised when she led me into an old apartment building. She lived on the fourth floor in a two-room place with her mother,her stepfather, her two brothers and her sister. When we got into the room she shared with her sister, she took out a big case of Babies, which was my next surprise. I had never played with them. We sat on the floor,laughing as we made up crazy stories about the Babies. We found out that we both wanted to be writers when we were older and both had wild imaginations.

Available options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no","output":"The available options for the given multi-choice question are \\"yes,\\" \\"it is not possible to tell,\\" and \\"no.\\" To provide a detailed and long answer, let's first analyze the two sentences provided before determining which of the available options applies. Sentence 1: \\"1999: Turnout for Apocalypse Lighter Than Expected\\" suggests that the number of people who participated or were present during the so-called \\"Apocalypse\\" was lower than initially anticipated. This statement implies that there were expectations about the turnout for this event, and the actual number of people showing up did not meet those expectations, making the turnout \\"lighter\\" than anticipated. Sentence 2: \\"Many more people showed up for the Apocalypse than expected\\" indicates a situation where the turnout for the Apocalypse surpassed expectations. This statement is in direct contrast to Sentence 1, as it implies that the number of participants or attendees exceeded the predicted figures. Now that we've analyzed both sentences, let's examine the multi-choice question itself: \\"If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?\\" As mentioned earlier, Sentence 1 establishes that the turnout for the Apocalypse was lower than expected. Therefore, if Sentence 1 is true, it directly conflicts with Sentence 2, which claims the turnout was higher than anticipated.

Winning the international contest was \\"a total shock\\", Ann said from San Francisco. \\"I definitely think it will have an influence on my future.\\" Ann thanked her family for encouraging her interest in science, telling the judges that her first toy was a box of transistors  . Ann's prize includes a 25,000 scholarship and a \\"once-in-a-lifetime experience\\" from either the European Organization for Nuclear Research, Lego or Google for her Hollow Flashlight, which has no moving parts or batteries. Ann created the flashlight for a local science fair. The inspiration for the invention came from seeing unwanted batteries and after visits to the Philippines, where she saw the need for a battery-free flashlight. A friend at school there failed in her studies because of a lack of electricity and light to study when it became dark. In her project, Ann wrote that she \\"made two flashlights that do not use any batteries, harmful chemicals, or kinetic energy  . They do not create any noise and will always work. The flashlight's only limitation is its need for at least a 5degC temperature difference to provide usable light.\\" A You Tube video of Ann explaining how she created the flashlight has been viewed more than 1.4 million times.

Translate to French","output":"Il ne faut pas se contenter de soumettre la santé à la logique du système de marché, car cette situation pourrait conduire à une participation reposant uniquement sur le libre choix du service de santé ou du professionnel de la santé. Le fait de considérer la santé uniquement sous l'angle du système économique de marché peut entraîner des problèmes de prise en charge globale des soins et un déséquilibre dans les choix proposés aux utilisateurs de services de santé. En effet, soumettre la santé à cette logique entraînerait une participation basée uniquement sur le libre choix du service de santé ou du professionnel de soins, ce qui risque d'exacerber les inégalités et de menacer les systèmes de protections sociales. Les conséquences d'une telle situation sont multiples et peuvent générer une large gamme de problèmes pour les individus et la société en général. Tout d'abord, les services de santé fonctionnant selon les impératifs du marché pourraient être plus intéressés par les profits que par la prestation de soins de qualité. Cela peut se traduire par une diminution de la qualité des soins ou par une augmentation des coûts pour les patients, lesquels sont souvent confrontés à des choix difficiles pour accéder aux meilleurs traitements. De plus, lorsque la logique du marché prédomine dans le domaine des soins de santé, il est probable que les patients ayant les moyens financiers et les connaissances nécessaires pour choisir parmi les services de santé disponibles soient privilégiés. Cela marginalise ceux qui sont moins informés, moins aisés ou qui font face à des barrières culturelles pour accéder à des soins de qualité. Ce phénomène peut alors contribuer à creuser les inégalités en matière de santé et à fragiliser les systèmes de couverture maladie universelle. Afin de prévenir de telles conséquences, il est crucial d'adopter une approche plus holistique et équitable de la santé et de l'accès aux soins. Un système de santé performant doit garantir une qualité de soins élevée pour tous, indépendamment du statut économique ou social des patients. Des régulations et des politiques publiques doivent être mises en place pour garantir que tous les acteurs du secteur de la santé (hôpitaux, cliniques, médecins, etc.) se conforment aux normes éthiques et aux exigences en matière de qualité de l'ensemble de la population. En résumé, le fait de soumettre la santé à la logique du marché entraîne des risques pour la société et les individus, aggravant les inégalités et menaçant les systèmes de protection sociale.

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump disclosed in a financial report filed with the government’s ethics watchdog Tuesday that he had reimbursed his personal lawyer more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses. In his annual financial disclosure form, which was released by the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) on Wednesday, Trump acknowledged that he had “fully reimbursed” his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, in the range of 100,000 to 250,000 in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act. Under the Ethics in Government Act, top government officials are required to report all debts in excess of 10,000 during the previous reporting period. “Knowingly or willfully” falsifying or failing to file reports carries civil and criminal penalties. Trump listed several hundred million dollars in liabilities in his financial report. Critics seized on...

Write an article based on this summary: Watch out for the smokers' cough. Watch for yellowing teeth. Look for yellow stains on your child's fingers. Pay attention if your teen is wheezing. Notice any shortness of breath. Look for a higher frequency of respiratory diseases. Article:","output":"Title: Recognizing the Signs of Teenage Smoking: A Guide for Parents Introduction As a parent, it's essential to be aware of the various signs and symptoms that might indicate your teenager has picked up the habit of smoking. Not only is smoking harmful to their health in the immediate sense, but it can also have long-lasting consequences that can follow them into adulthood. In this article, we will discuss the signs and symptoms to watch for, such as the infamous smoker's cough and yellowing teeth, and provide tips for addressing the issue if you suspect your child is smoking. 1. The Smoker's Cough One of the most noticeable and early signs of smoking is the persistent smoker's cough. This cough is characterized by a raspy, dry, and sometimes painful hacking that can become more severe in the mornings. If your teenager experiences frequent or prolonged bouts of coughing that seem out of the ordinary, it's worth considering the possibility that they may be smoking. 2. Yellowing Teeth Yellowing teeth are another sign of smoking, and it's essential to take notice if your child's teeth appear to be turning yellow or they complain of stained teeth. Smoking can cause severe damage to the teeth and gums over time and may lead to oral health issues that could become more serious if left untreated. 3. Stains on Fingers Notice any suspicious yellow stains on your teenager's fingers or hands? These stains could be a result of nicotine and tar buildup from frequent smoking. If you spot such discoloration, it's essential to talk openly and honestly with your child about the potential risks of their habit. 4. Wheezing and Shortness of Breath If your teenager is experiencing wheezing, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing during light activity, it could be a sign of smoking. The inhalation of cigarette smoke weakens lung function over time, making it more difficult for their lungs to provide adequate oxygen, leading to these symptoms. 5. Frequent Respiratory Diseases Smoking can also contribute to a higher frequency of respiratory diseases like bronchitis and pneumonia. Keeping track of your child's health history can help in identifying patterns that may be linked to their smoking habits. If you notice they have recurring respiratory infections, it's essential to talk with them about the dangers of smoking and the impact it can have on their overall health. Conclusion Recognizing the signs of teenage smoking is crucial in helping your child make healthy choices and potentially avoid a lifetime of nicotine addiction. If you suspect your teenager is smoking, it's essential to have an open, honest, and non-judgmental conversation with them about the risks involved. Encourage them to seek professional help if necessary, and remind them that it's never too late to quit and improve their health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

US President Barack Obama has angered Beijing by saying the uninhabited Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea, which are claimed by China and Japan, would be covered by the US-Japan security treaty. He is the first US president to spell this out.      He gave the assurance as he began a four-nation Asia tour in Tokyo yesterday.      Watch: Imperial pomp starts Obama's Japan visit      China was quick to hit back. \\"The so-called security alliance between the US and Japan is a bilateral arrangement made during the cold war period, and it should not be used to damage China's sovereignty and legitimate interest,\\" foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said. \\"We resolutely oppose applying the Diaoyu Islands to the Japan-US security treaty.\\"      We resolutely oppose applying the Diaoyu Islands to the Japan-US security treaty      FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN QIN GANG      China and Japan are engaged in a bitter territorial dispute over the Diaoyus, known as Senkakus in Japan. The risks of an unintended conflict were highlighted in January when Tokyo alleged that a Chinese frigate locked its radar on a Japanese destroyer in the East China Sea. In December, the US military cruiser Cowpens had to take evasive action in the South China Sea to avoid hitting a warship supporting China's first aircraft carrier, Liaoning.      Adding fuel to those fears, both PLA Navy commander Admiral Wu Shengli and Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force chief of staff Katsutoshi Kawano, attending a defence forum in Qingdao this week, said an accidental conflict between the two militaries could not be ruled out, according to Phoenix TV reports.      In written remarks published by Japan's Yomiuri Shimbum, Obama said the US alliance with Japan was \\"stronger than ever\\".      \\"The policy of the United States is clear - the Senkaku Islands are administered by Japan and therefore fall within the scope of Article 5 of the US-Japan Treaty of Mutual Co-operation and Security,\\" Obama said. \\"And we oppose any unilateral attempts to undermine Japan's administration of these islands.\\"      Article 5 of the treaty, which was signed in 1960, stipulates US defence obligations to Japan, stating that each party recognises that an armed attack against either party in the territories under the administration of Japan would be dangerous to its own peace and safety.      Obama said he had told President Xi Jinping that the territorial disputes should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy, and also commended Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to strengthen Japan's defence forces.      \\"We believe that it's in the interest of both our countries for Japanese Self Defence Forces to do more within the framework of our alliances,\\" he said.      In a sign of the balancing act that the US faces in Asia, Obama said the US and China can work together on issues of mutual interest.      Obama's tour, which will also take him to South Korea, the Philippines and Malaysia, came as Asian nations fear that US commitment to the region will be lessened, particularly as Obama cancelled his tour last year because of financial problem at home.      In signs that China was keeping a close watch on the tour, Xi had a phone conversation with South Korean President Park Geun-hye, saying bilateral ties enjoyed a \\"sound momentum\\", state-run Xinhua reported.      Xi also told Park that China was committed to the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.      Shi Yinhong , a US affairs expert at Renmin University, said Obama made the unprecedented assurance because Washington needed Tokyo's support for the Trans Pacific Partnership, a US-dominated trade pact.      Obama to set aside decades of uneasy ties with Malaysia visit      Barack Obama will this weekend become the first US president in nearly 50 years to visit Malaysia, where he will seek to put decades of uneasy bilateral relations behind him as both nations cast wary eyes on a rising China.      Mindful of America's image problem in the Islamic world, Obama is expected to tout the US friendship with the thriving moderate Muslim nation.      Malaysia is also an important partner in the US \\"rebalance\\" of its strategic attention to Asia, where concern is rising over China's territorial assertiveness.      Obama will \\"highlight the growing strategic and economic relationship\\" with Malaysia and its \\"credentials as a moderate, Muslim-majority state and emerging democracy\\", said Joshua Kurlantzick, a fellow at the US Council on Foreign Relations.      Prime Minister Najib Razak, meanwhile, will seek to capitalise on Obama's expected praise to counter flagging voter support and global criticism over the handling of the loss of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370.      Obama was five years old the last time a serving US leader visited Malaysia. Lyndon Johnson went in 1966 to rally support for the US war in Vietnam.      Tension followed during the 1981-2003 tenure of authoritarian leader Mahathir Mohamad, a harsh critic of US policies.      But ties - especially trade - remained solid, and the more Western-oriented Najib has sought even closer relations.      US deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes this week expressed hope that the visit would \\"elevate US-Malaysian relations to a new stage\\".      Obama postponed a visit last year to deal with the US government shutdown.      Underlining the need for a reintroduction after nearly a half-century, Malaysia is the only stop on Obama's Asian swing to include a \\"town-hall meeting\\". He also visits close allies Japan, South Korea and the Philippines.      China will loom large. It is Malaysia's top trade partner and Najib has played down their rival maritime claims. But Malaysian anxieties have grown, particularly after China held naval exercises in disputed waters last year, and the US and Malaysia have moved recently to improve defence ties.      Chinese criticism over MH370 has also left a bitter aftertaste.      \\"[Najib's government] obviously hopes that Obama's star effect can rub off on its flagging popularity,\\" said Dr Oh Ei Sun, senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.      \\"And Malaysia can continue to counterbalance China with the US in its foreign policy - siding with China economically but with the US on security.\\"      Differences remain, though.      The economic component of Obama's \\"rebalance\\" rests largely on his vision of a Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a region-wide trade liberalisation pact bedevilled by rocky negotiations with partners. Malaysia has resisted free-market reforms that clash with its controversial policies reserving economic advantages for majority ethnic Malays.      Obama may also face pressure to address uncomfortable human rights, democracy and religion issues in Malaysia. ||||| TOKYO (AP) — The voice was slightly halting, childlike. \\"Welcome to Miraikan, Mr. President, it is a pleasure to meet you.\\"      President Barack Obama watches a Yabusame or horseback archery demonstration as he tours Meiji Shrine in Tokyo, Thursday, April 24, 2014.

(Associated Press)      President Barack Obama bowed, looking delighted.      His greeter, after all, was a 55-inch-tall, give or take, humanoid robot with the look of a diminutive Star Wars storm trooper.      \\"It's nice to meet you, too,\\" Obama said, pausing to watch the robot, named ASIMO, perform during a tour of the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation.      Despite Obama's background in constitutional law, there's a presidential geek side that always seems charmed, if not bemused, by technological advances.      Asimo, made by Honda, announced \\"I can really run fast\\" before loping toward a soccer ball and informing Obama, \\"I can kick a soccer ball, too.\\"      The robot delivered a well-aimed ball at Obama who trapped it neatly with his foot. For its final demonstration, the robot declared, \\"Recently I have learned how to jump.\\" It then proceeded to hop, first on one foot, then on two.      Curious, Obama asked Mamoru Mohri, chief executive director of Miraikan, whether the robot was remote controlled. Yes, Mohri replied, but the robot can act autonomously, too.      Obama also witnessed demonstrations by other robots, including one designed by Japanese technicians and partially financed by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency that was developed to help with disaster response.      \\"I have to say the robots were a little scary,\\" he said afterward. \\"They were too life-like.\\"      ______      After holding a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Obama met with the three relatives of two Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korea.      At the news conference, Obama said the United States stood with Japan in seeking to resolve such North Korean kidnappings and in a statement issued after the session with relatives, the White House said Obama was \\"moved by their tragic experiences.\\"      Later, the relatives said Obama, as father of two daughters, showed empathy over the kidnapping of their loved ones. He said he would do his utmost to resolve the problem, possibly by adopting a U.N. Security Council resolution to pressure the North.      As father of two teenage daughters, Obama seemed particularly empathetic to Sakie Yokota, 78, whose daughter Megumi was kidnapped by North Korean agents 37 years ago when she was only 13. Yokota said Obama carefully looked at the pictures she brought and seemed to understand the pain of waiting such a long time.      \\"President Obama said it's not just another political or human rights issue. He said he cannot tolerate this problem as a human being and a father,\\" Yokota told reporters after the meeting. \\"He reassured us that he would give us a firm support to resolve the problem.\\"      _______      Of prayer cards and archers.      Obama visited the Meiji Shrine that commemorates Emperor Meiji, who died in 1912, and his wife Empress Shoken. The shrine has been something of a regular stop for visiting U.S. dignitaries.      Then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton went to the shrine in 2009 and Vice President Joe Biden stopped there in 2011. President George W. Bush visited in 2002.      Like Bush, Obama was treated to a demonstration of yabusame, or horseback archery, where archers in traditional dress ride past a reviewing stand at a gallop while shooting arrows at a target. Obama watched      Moments earlier, Obama had toured the shrine with priests and then written on a prayer card. After hanging it with numerous other cards, a priest removed it, apparently out of fear that someone would take it.      \\"My only question is,\\" Obama said to the priest, \\"will my wish still work if you take it?\\" ||||| Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story      TOKYO — President Obama encountered setbacks to two of his most cherished foreign-policy projects on Thursday, as he failed to achieve a trade deal that undergirds his strategic pivot to Asia and the Middle East peace process suffered a potentially irreparable breakdown.                              Mr. Obama had hoped to use his visit here to announce an agreement under which Japan would open its markets in rice, beef, poultry and pork, a critical step toward the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the proposed regional trade pact. But Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was not able to overcome entrenched resistance from Japan’s farmers in time for the president’s visit.      In Jerusalem, Israel’s announcement that it was suspending stalemated peace negotiations with the Palestinians, after a reconciliation between the Palestine Liberation Organization and the militant group Hamas, posed yet another obstacle to restarting a troubled peace process in which Secretary of State John Kerry has been greatly invested.      The setbacks, though worlds apart in geography and history, speak to the common challenge Mr. Obama has had in translating his ideas and ambitions into enduring policies. He has watched outside forces unravel his best-laid plans, from resetting relations with Russia to managing the epochal political change in the Arab world. On Thursday, as Russia staged military exercises on the border with Ukraine, Mr. Kerry denounced broken promises from the Kremlin but took no specific action.      Continue reading the main story Video      Mr. Obama has not given up. Indeed, his advisers insisted that they had achieved a “pathway” to resolving the sticking points in a trade deal during marathon talks that continued until just before the president left Tokyo for Seoul.      On Friday in South Korea, Mr. Obama continued his weeklong quest to breathe life into his shift to Asia. Mr. Kerry, the tireless campaigner for Middle East peace, was still working the phones, trying to maneuver the Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating room.      One of the president’s most grandiose foreign-policy projects, a nuclear agreement with Iran, remains very much on the table, with diplomats from Iran and the West beginning to draft language that would limit Iran’s nuclear program and inhibit its ability to produce a weapon.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      In one sense, the latest news from the Middle East offers a rationale for Mr. Obama to keep his gaze fixed on the fast-growing economies of Asia. While the troubles with the peace negotiations have surprised almost no one, the trade talks with Japan still hold some hope of yielding a landmark deal, since it is in the interests of both Mr. Abe and Mr. Obama — a bet on the future rather than an effort to clear the enmities of the past.      First, though, Mr. Obama has to overcome the stubborn hurdles to any trade agreement. Back home, he has been unable to win support from Congress for the deal. “Prime Minister Abe has got to deal with his politics; I’ve got to deal with mine,” he said on Thursday. “It means that we sometimes have to push our constituencies beyond their current comfort levels.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Mr. Obama also declared that the United States was obligated by a security treaty to protect Japan in its confrontation with China over a clump of islands in the East China Sea. But he stopped short of siding with Japan in the dispute regarding who has sovereignty over the islands, and carefully calibrated his statement to avoid antagonizing China.      The net result, seen in a news conference in which the leaders referred to each other a bit stiffly as Barack and Shinzo, was an alliance clearly on firmer footing than it was earlier, but still vulnerable to political frailties on each side.      Similar frailties were on display in Jerusalem, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel acted swiftly to suspend talks after his Palestinian counterpart, President Mahmoud Abbas, signed a deal seeking to reconcile his Fatah faction, which dominates the Palestine Liberation Organization and leads the West Bank government, with Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the Gaza Strip.      Mr. Abbas “had a choice: peace with Israel or pact with the terrorist Hamas,” Mr. Netanyahu said in an interview with NBC News. “So that’s the blow for peace, and I hope he changes his mind.”      Mr. Kerry told Mr. Abbas on Thursday that he was disappointed by the reconciliation announcement, and he planned to speak later with Mr. Netanyahu. The administration’s Middle East peace envoy, Martin S. Indyk, remained in the region, refusing to give up.      “Choices need to be made by both parties, and we’ll see what happens in the days ahead,” Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman, told reporters in Washington. Palestinian leaders sought to shift the blame for the breakdown to Israel.      Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said Israel had “deliberately sabotaged the peace process by stopping the negotiations” and by refusing to freeze settlement construction. Mr. Erekat said in a telephone interview that reconciliation was “an internal Palestinian affair that Israel has no right to interfere in” and that it “should not be used as a pretext to evade negotiations.”      But after a six-hour meeting on Thursday, Israel’s top ministers voted unanimously to halt the talks and to impose an unspecified series of punitive measures against the Palestinians for their promise to form a new government within five weeks that would prepare for long-overdue elections. Negotiations could only resume, Israeli officials said, if Mr. Abbas abandoned or failed to carry out the deal with Hamas — something Palestinian analysts say is a possibility.      “What will happen now is the usual routine: Israel will try to punish the Palestinians; the Palestinians will complain; Israel will not really punish the Palestinians, because we cannot afford the Palestinian Authority to collapse,” said Shlomo Brom, a researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. “So it will be another episode in this never-ending story.”      Events in Asia tend to move at a slower pace. But with trade a key pillar of Mr. Obama’s strategy in Asia and each side looking for something from the other, the negotiations assumed a Middle East-like intensity.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      In round-the-clock negotiations this week, American and Japanese officials said, the United States pressed Japan to make major concessions, including cutting protective tariffs close to zero on agricultural products like cheese and pork.      “There are a lot of people in Japan who question whether Japan should make big concessions just because Obama is here,” said Nobuhiro Suzuki, a professor of agriculture at the University of Tokyo. “Abe has to heed them, too, to avoid appearing like an American patsy.”      Other analysts faulted Mr. Obama, saying his decision not to fight for the legislative authority at home to pass major trade deals had robbed him of leverage with the Japanese, who are reluctant to make concessions for a deal that may not survive Congress.      “Their strategy was to get the Japanese to do the deal, then go to Congress and say, ‘Look what a great deal we got, now give us the authority,’ ” said Michael J. Green, an Asia adviser to President George W. Bush. “He made a decision to go into this with one hand tied behind his back.”      Speaking to reporters on Air Force One en route to Seoul, a senior administration official said that after their meeting, Mr. Obama and Mr. Abe instructed their staffs to find a way to close the remaining gaps. “Nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to,” the official said. But he added, “We’re at a moment where we see where we’re going to achieve resolution.”      In Tokyo, the Japanese trade minister, Akira Amari, told reporters that no agreement had been reached, but noted: “We are moving toward a conclusion.”      The president’s statement about the United States’ obligations toward Japan was important because it was the first time he had explicitly put the disputed islands under American protection, though Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel recently made the same statement and the policy has been held by successive administrations.      “This is a very important turning point for the United States-Japan alliance because it means the period of drift under President Obama has finally come to an end,” said Yuichi Hosoya, an expert on American-Japanese relations at Keio University in Tokyo. “The fact that this was said by the president will have a huge psychological impact on Japanese officials and people.”      The Chinese government reacted swiftly, saying it was “firmly opposed” to Mr. Obama’s position. More than anything, Mr. Obama appeared eager to defuse tensions over the islands, referring to them as a “rock” and saying they should not be allowed to derail a relationship that could otherwise be productive.      “It would be a profound mistake to continue to see escalation around this issue rather than dialogue and confidence-building measures between Japan and China,” Mr. Obama said.      Mr. Abe said he was encouraged by Mr. Obama’s pledge to protect the islands. “On this point,” he said, “I fully trust President Obama.” ||||| Write a summary.","output":"US President Barack Obama had angered Beijing by saying that the uninhabited Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea, which are claimed by China and Japan, would be covered by the US-Japan security treaty.

Options:  A. crowding  B. wonder  C. being bored  D. fear  E. sore feet Answer:","output":"B. wonder Step-by-step justification: 1. When visiting a museum, a child is exposed to various exhibits, historical artifacts, and educational displays. This environment can evoke a sense of curiosity and wonder in the child. 2. Museums are designed to be educational and engaging, so it is common for children to experience awe and fascination as they learn about new things or explore unfamiliar concepts. 3. While other options like crowding, being bored, fear, and sore feet may be side-effects of visiting a museum, they are not the primary intent or experience that museums aim to provide, especially for children.

Q:Information:  - In information theory , Shannon 's source coding theorem ( or noiseless coding theorem ) establishes the limits to possible data compression , and the operational meaning of the Shannon entropy . The source coding theorem shows that ( in the limit , as the length of a stream of independent and identically - distributed random variable ( i.i.d . ) data tends to infinity ) it is impossible to compress the data such that the code rate ( average number of bits per symbol ) is less than the Shannon entropy of the source , without it being virtually certain that information will be lost . However it is possible to get the code rate arbitrarily close to the Shannon entropy , with negligible probability of loss . The source coding theorem for symbol codes places an upper and a lower bound on the minimal possible expected length of codewords as a function of the entropy of the input word ( which is viewed as a random variable ) and of the size of the target alphabet .  - Ecology (from , \\"house\\", or \\"environment\\"; -, \\"study of\\") is the scientific analysis and study of interactions among organisms and their environment. It is an interdisciplinary field that includes biology, geography, and Earth science. Ecology includes the study of interactions organisms have with each other, other organisms, and with abiotic components of their environment. Topics of interest to ecologists include the diversity, distribution, amount (biomass), and number (population) of particular organisms, as well as cooperation and competition between organisms, both within and among ecosystems. Ecosystems are composed of dynamically interacting parts including organisms, the communities they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as primary production, pedogenesis, nutrient cycling, and various niche construction activities, regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits, and the variety of organisms is called biodiversity. Biodiversity, which refers to the varieties of species, genes, and ecosystems, enhances certain ecosystem services.  - Quantum computing studies theoretical computation systems (quantum computers) that make direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. A quantum Turing machine is a theoretical model of such a computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer. The field of quantum computing was initiated by the work of Paul Benioff and Yuri Manin in 1980, Richard Feynman in 1982, and David Deutsch in 1985. A quantum computer with spins as quantum bits was also formulated for use as a quantum spacetime in 1968.  - In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on  or to heat  the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.  - The Boltzmann constant (or ), which is named after Ludwig Boltzmann, is a physical constant relating the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas with the temperature of the gas. It is the gas constant divided by the Avogadro constant :  - In signal processing, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information. The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding (encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted) in opposition to channel coding.  - A temperature is an objective comparative measurement of hot or cold. It is measured by a thermometer. Several scales and units exist for measuring temperature, the most common being Celsius (denoted °C; formerly called \\"centigrade\\"), Fahrenheit (denoted °F), and, especially in science, Kelvin (denoted K).  - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon.  - Natural language processing is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of humancomputer interaction. Many challenges in NLP involve: natural language understanding, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or natural language input; and others involve natural language generation.  - In statistical thermodynamics, entropy (usual symbol ) (Greek:,  + ) is a measure of the number of microscopic configurations that a thermodynamic system can have when in a state as specified by certain macroscopic variables. Specifically, assuming that each of the microscopic configurations is equally probable, the entropy of the system is the natural logarithm of that number of configurations, multiplied by the Boltzmann constant (which provides consistency with the original thermodynamic concept of entropy discussed below, and gives entropy the dimension of energy divided by temperature). Formally,  - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.  - Information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information. It was originally proposed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948 to find fundamental limits on signal processing and communication operations such as data compression, in a landmark paper entitled \\"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\". Now this theory has found applications in many other areas, including statistical inference, natural language processing, cryptography, neurobiology, the evolution and function of molecular codes, model selection in ecology, thermal physics, quantum computing, linguistics, plagiarism detection, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection.  - In data mining, anomaly detection (also outlier detection) is the identification of items, events or observations which do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset. Typically the anomalous items will translate to some kind of problem such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are also referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.  - Signal processing is an enabling technology that encompasses the fundamental theory, applications, algorithms, and implementations of processing or transferring information contained in many different physical, symbolic, or abstract formats broadly designated as \\"signals\\". It uses mathematical, statistical, computational, heuristic, and linguistic representations, formalisms, and techniques for representation, modelling, analysis, synthesis, discovery, recovery, sensing, acquisition, extraction, learning, security, or forensics.  - Cryptography or cryptology (from Greek \\"kryptós\\", \\"hidden, secret\\"; and \\"graphein\\", \\"writing\\", or \\"-logia\\", \\"study\\", respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. Applications of cryptography include ATM cards, computer passwords, and electronic commerce.    What is the relationship between 'shannon's source coding theorem' and 'claude shannon'?

In 1906 , the Mount Vernon , New York Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution , consecrated Chief Nimham Memorial at Van Cortlandt Park . OPTIONS: [-] no [-] yes","output":"The correct answer is [-] yes. Both sentences are essentially saying the same thing, albeit slightly rearranged and with different emphasis. Here's a closer look at each sentence. 1. In the first sentence, \\"In 1906, the Van Cortlandt Park Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution dedicated the Chief Nimham Memorial at Mount Vernon, New York,\\" we learn that the action of dedication occurred in 1906 and was performed by the Van Cortlandt Park Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. The act was the dedication of the Chief Nimham Memorial, and it took place in Mount Vernon, New York. 2. In the second sentence, \\"In 1906, the Mount Vernon, New York Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, consecrated Chief Nimham Memorial at Van Cortlandt Park,\\" we again learn that the time of the action was 1906. This time, the chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution is identified as being from Mount Vernon, New York. They consecrated the Chief Nimham Memorial, which is located in Van Cortlandt Park.  It's important to note that \\"dedicated\\" and \\"consecrated\\" are used to mean the same thing in this context, both referring to the act of formally declaring something as special or sacred, commonly used in relation to public monuments or memorials like the Chief Nimham Memorial. Therefore, while the sentences have been constructed somewhat differently, they convey the identical historical event: In 1906, a chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution, linked with both Van Cortlandt Park and Mount Vernon, New York, performed a dedicatory or consecratory act for the Chief Nimham Memorial.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Background: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds.  Paragraph: Mike was interested in the science behind polar compounds. To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which compound would have higher boiling point, compound A or compound B? Answer:","output":"Compound A, the polar compound, would have a higher boiling point compared to compound B, the nonpolar compound. This is because polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points due to the additional energy required to break the hydrogen bonds between their molecules."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Found fame as he taunted the authorities during his decades on the run. Gang targeted a train in 1963 and made off with Â£40m in today's money.","output":"Title: The Demise and Legendary Criminal Exploits of a Notorious Outlaw: A Timeless Tale from North London Last month, North London bore witness to the final chapter of an infamous life, as one of its most notorious criminals, aged 84, passed away. The crook, in his audacious style, always mocked authorities, and his daring escapades kept him on the run for decades. His most renowned act, a train heist in 1963, saw him and his gang escape with a pile of money equating to over £40 million in today's economy. It was this audacity and bravado in shunning law enforcement that had catapulted him into the public eye as a notorious figure. His lifestyle was marked by his bold crimes and the manner in which he taunted the police, making him a part of local lore. His story, although fear-inducing, was also enthralling and often caught the attention of many. Despite the illegality of his actions, there was an uncanny fascination when it came to his audacious heists and narrow escapes.  Throughout the multiple decades he spent on the run, the criminal mastermind was never shy of the spotlight. In actuality, it seemed he relished in it, enjoying the infamy that his criminal actions brought him. He was always evasive, taunting authorities with his elusive nature, consistently managing to stay one step ahead of them. This audacious dance with law enforcement further emphasized his confidence and further perpetuated his notorious reputation.  His fame as a criminal reached its zenith in August 1963 when he, along with his gang, targeted a Royal Mail train traveling between Glasgow and London – an incident that would go down in history as 'The Great Train Robbery'. After tampering with the railway signals to stop the train, the group managed to make off with 120 bags full of money, amounting to roughly £2.6 million then, a sum that equates to over £40 million in today's economy. The audacity, planning, and the scale of the hit were immense - setting a new high (or low, depending on viewpoint) in criminal enterprises. To this day, the Great Train Robbery remains one of the most infamous heists in British history and has been the subject of numerous films, books, and television series.  Despite the general public's fascination with the daring escapade, the reality that this notorious criminal made off with such a colossal sum of money, much of which was never recovered, is a stark reminder of the gravity of his criminal activities. He and his gang changed the face of crime in the UK with their audacity, acting as reminders for the need for ever-vigilant and adaptive law enforcement.  As the news of the notorious criminal's death broke, it marks an end to this legendary tale of notoriety and audacity. However, his bold exploits and the manner in which he taunted authorities during his decades on the run remain timeless in the annals of criminal history. His demise brings about a chance to reflect on how law enforcement has evolved over the years and how it continues to adapt to the ever-changing nature of crime. Notorious as he was, his story serves as a reminder - not as a point of fascination but as a case study in the enduring battle between crime and justice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Out of the options provided, the word \\"talent\\" is the most appropriate and fitting choice to complete the sentence. It effectively captures and conveys the idea that her capability to entertain others is an inherent gift, setting her apart in this specific area. While the other options potentially have some connection to the idea, they do not accurately convey the intended meaning as well as \\"talent\\" does. Let's analyze each one: 1. \\"Fun\\" - This word alone doesn't express the notion that she had a particular ability to entertain. Although it may suggest that she was fun to have around, it doesn't effectively capture the idea that she had a special aptitude for entertaining others. 2. \\"Learn about\\" - This phrase doesn't fit in the context of the sentence and is not a suitable choice for completing it. It implies that one will gain knowledge about something or someone, which is unrelated to the idea that the woman had a unique ability to entertain. 3. \\"Intelligence\\" - Although intelligence can contribute to a person's ability to entertain others, it doesn't specifically convey the same meaning as \\"talent.\\" Intelligence implies a mental capacity for learning, understanding, and problem-solving, rather than an inherent skill or ability for a specific task, such as entertaining. 4. \\"Recognize\\" - This word also doesn't accurately capture the intended meaning of the given question. While it could suggest that others acknowledged her skills to entertain, it does not express that she had a natural ability to do so.

Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage.

Greece Following the assassination of Phillip II, his son Alexander III (\\"The Great\\") assumed the leadership of the League of Corinth and launched an invasion of the Persian Empire with the combined forces of all Greek states in 334 BC. Undefeated in battle, Alexander had conquered the Persian Empire in its entirety by 330 BC. By the time of his death in 323 BC, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to India. His empire split into several kingdoms upon his death, the most famous of which were the Seleucid Empire, Ptolemaic Egypt, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria, Antioch, Seleucia and the many other new Hellenistic cities in Asia and Africa. Although the political unity of Alexander's empire could not be maintained, it resulted in the Hellenistic civilization and spread the Greek language and Greek culture in the territories conquered by Alexander. Greek science, technology and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the Hellenistic period. Q: In which year did Alexander III die?","output":"Alexander III, also known as Alexander the Great, died in the year 323 BC. His death marked a significant moment in history as it led to the division of his vast empire that stretched from Greece to India. Imperatively, even though the political unity he had established was not upheld after his death, it resulted in the spread of Hellenistic civilization, as well as the Greek language and culture, across the territories he conquered. The kingdoms that emerged from the division of Alexander's empire included the Seleucid Empire, Ptolemaic Egypt, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom. These kingdoms played significant roles in human history, influencing cultural, political and economic aspects of life in the ancient world. For instance, the Seleucid Empire, which at its height stretched from modern-day Turkey to Pakistan, became a center of Hellenistic culture that maintained the preeminence of Greek customs where a Greek political elite dominated. The Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt was characterized by its wealthy cities such as Alexandria, which during its golden age was the cultural, spiritual and scientific heart of the entire Hellenistic world. In the Greco-Bactrian and the Indo-Greek Kingdoms, we see the fusion of Greek and eastern elements, which not only enriched Greek culture but also significantly contributed to the development of various aspects of Asian civilizations. Many Greeks migrated to newly established Hellenistic cities such as Alexandria, Antioch, and Seleucia, further spreading Greek culture and influence. Moreover, during the Hellenistic period following Alexander's death, Greek science, technology, and mathematics reached remarkable heights. Pioneers in various fields advanced knowledge and innovation significantly. It was a period marked by intellectual exchange and flourishing creativity, which dramatically shaped the course of the Western intellectual tradition. In summary, the period following Alexander III's death in 323 BC was characterized by political fragmentation but also major cultural and intellectual advancements, where the influence of Greek civilization integrated with local cultures spread across a vast territory. This unique blend of cultures left a profound influence on the world, as the remnants of this Hellenistic civilization can be traced in the modern cultures of the Mediterranean, Middle East, Central Asia, and India."},{"instruction":"- title is bishop of the archdiocese of trani-barletta-bisceglie -lrb- emeritus -rrb-    - previous post is prelate    - see is roman catholic archdiocese of trani-barletta-bisceglie    - type is bishop    - term is 1990 - 1999    - successor is giovanni battista pichierri    - church is roman catholic church    - ordination is december 17 , 1949    - predecessor is giuseppe carata      - birth date is 6 april 1924      - birth place is eufemia-tricase , italy    Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Article:It's a glimpse of how much student life has changed, what students expect from universities and how much pressure they feel about the future. In the 1970s, students at Reading staged an occupation calling for the abolition of exams. Now, in the depths of the exam season, they are voluntarily occupying the library in the middle of the night, so that they can get in as much revision as possible. During weekdays in term time the library is open 24/7. Never mind 24-hour clubbing, here it's round the clock studying. It's become part of student life in universities across the UK. But if libraries are meant to be slow-moving places under layers of dust and silence, then it's nothing like that here. The lights are blazing in the library building in the middle of the Reading campus. It's full of young people surrounded by notebooks, laptops, mobile phones and snacks. There's a lone printed book on a desk, with almost all the revision taking place online. There's a low level of background chat as students work together. It would be unusual to see such a busy library in the middle of the day, but here it's buzzing in the middle of the night. There are groups of students coming and going, talking in a cafe - and overnight library figures show there were still more than 100 students there at 03:30. Niamh, a pharmacy student, has been working there since 09:00 and expected to carry on studying in the library until about 01:30. Two students revising for second-year exams, Alex and Matthew, say they will be back again at 06:00. \\"You have to get in before 08:00 to get a place,\\" says Alex, studying biochemistry. He knows that his generation is a long way from any stereotypes of student slackers. \\"We're under more pressure to do well, we have to work harder,\\" he says. And when students are paying Â£9,000 per year, they want to have good facilities. \\"It's essential to have a good library,\\" says Matthew. When the weather is good during the day, Alex says people might prefer to study at night. \\"It's a nice time to work,\\" he says. There are other students there who say it's better to work in a group rather than alone in their rooms. It's a more sociable way of working through the stresses of the exam season. None of them see it as strange to be working in a library in the early hours. Reading's library, with five floors of nocturnal students hunched over laptops, is having a Â£4.4m revamp. Universities are in the middle of a building boom, as they compete for students with facilities and accommodation. Like an academic department store, different parts of the library have different moods - there are bright Ikea style open plan areas, for more solitary study there are cocooning booths and quiet corners and other rooms have big traditional desks and softer lighting. There is a relentless switch to online materials, but there are still rooms with traditional bookshelves, even if there is no longer the metallic crunch of a library stamp putting in a return date. Withdrawals are now self-service and electronic. Julia Munro, the university's librarian, says that on open days would-be students compare the facilities with what they've seen elsewhere. And they expect to be able to use the library whenever they want. \\"They tell us they want to study when they want to study - and if they want to study at 02:00, they think they should be able to.\\" It wasn't always this way. The library is exactly 50 years old, and in the reception area there is the original architect's model. It's like a 1960s time capsule, with its clean lines and open-plan civic optimism. It opened the same month that Terence Conran opened the first Habitat store in London, Joe Orton was premiering his new play Entertaining Mr Sloane and in the United States there were the first major student protests in New York and San Francisco over the Vietnam War. The Beatles had recently had a number one with Can't Buy Me Love. In those early days, students couldn't even use the university library at the weekend. Now Julia Munro and her colleague Rachel Redrup say there is likely to be demand for even more open access, such as longer hours during the holidays. The move to open libraries through the night has been driven by consumer pressure from students. It's a pattern that's spread across universities across the UK - so much so that it's now more or less standard in many institutions. In the US, it's gone a step further with reports last week of college libraries introducing \\"nap stations\\" so that students could have somewhere to crash out during their marathon studying sessions. The librarians at Reading say the library provides its own barometer of change. Rachel Redrup says in the 1960s the students using the library would have been part of a small percentage of the population going to university, who would have been confident of walking out into a good job. Now, says Julia Munro, students are less certain of the future. \\"They feel they're under greater pressure. They're worried about jobs,\\" she says. A summary of the above article is?","output":"Student life has transformed significantly over the years, with expectations and pressure on university students to succeed at an all-time high. A key example of this change is the 24/7 library access provided across UK universities. Once considered places of silence and dust, university libraries are now buzzing with activity at all hours of the day and night. Students are working later into the night and beginning their study sessions earlier in the morning to secure a place to revise. The prevalence of 24-hour library access is driven by student demand and the competition between universities to provide the best facilities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given that the premise establishes the father's action of putting an object inside the birthday cake, it directly contradicts the hypothesis that the father did not plant the object in the cake.

Musical forms began to break from the Classical era forms (even as those were being codified), with free-form pieces like nocturnes, fantasias, and preludes being written where accepted ideas about the exposition and development of themes were ignored or minimized. The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about key signatures increasing. The art song (or Lied) came to maturity in this era, as did the epic scales of grand opera, ultimately transcended by Richard Wagner's Ring cycle.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

You need to provide the correct answer for it. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. The film follows the plot of the series SpongeBob SquarePants, focusing on the anthropomorphic sea sponge of the same name (Tom Kenny). SpongeBob dreams about managing the Krusty Krab restaurant, which one day has a crisis involving a customer having no cheese on his Krabby Patty. SpongeBob arrives and saves the day, and he wakes up and cheerfully prepares for the opening ceremony for the Krusty Krab 2, hoping that his boss Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown) will promote him to manager of the new restaurant built next door to the original Krusty Krab. At the ceremony, SpongeBob is passed over; his co-worker, Squidward Tentacles (Rodger Bumpass), has been given the promotion because Mr. Krabs thinks he is \\"more mature\\" than SpongeBob.Meanwhile, Plankton (Mr. Lawrence), Mr. Krabs' business rival, devises a plot to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula and frame Mr. Krabs. He steals King Neptune's (Jeffrey Tambor) crown that night, leaving evidence that pins the crime on Mr. Krabs, and sends the crown to Shell City, a distant, mysterious land from which no fish has returned. That night, SpongeBob goes to his favorite restaurant, Goofy Goober's; he drowns his sorrows in ice cream with his best friend, Patrick Star (Bill Fagerbakke), waking up the next morning with a headache. King Neptune barges into the Krusty Krab 2 the same morning and threatens to slay Mr. Krabs. Although SpongeBob criticizes Mr. Krabs shortly after he arrives, he promises Neptune that he will retrieve the crown from Shell City. Neptune freezes Mr. Krabs, still certain that he is the culprit, and tells SpongeBob to return with the crown in six days for him to spare Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob and Patrick leave for Shell City in the Patty Wagon, a car shaped like a Krabby Patty.SpongeBob and Patrick, pursued by Shell City's \\"cyclops\\" diver.In Bikini Bottom, Plankton steals the Krabby Patty formula and uses it to produce and sell Krabby Patties at his restaurant, the Chum Bucket, with the claim that Krabs bequeathed him the recipe. He sends a hitman named Dennis (Alec Baldwin) to pursue SpongeBob and Patrick. Squidward discovers the truth about Plankton stealing Neptune's crown and tries to alert Neptune. However, Plankton uses mind-controlling bucket helmets disguised as souvenirs to control Bikini Bottom's residents, including Squidward, and renames the city Planktopolis.Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick encounter a dangerous trench, but Neptune's daughter Mindy (Scarlett Johansson) helps them past it by making them think she can make them into men. They are stopped by Dennis, who tries to crush them with his spiked boots, but he is in turn stepped on by a massive \\"cyclops\\" (really a diver) (Neil Ross). The \\"cyclops\\" grabs SpongeBob and Patrick, and goes to his beachside store, revealed to be Shell City. At the store, SpongeBob and Patrick find the crown, but are nearly killed in a lethal drying-out process with the heat lamp turned on. Their tears short-circuit the heat lamp, and its smoke activates the sprinkler system, reviving their bodies and the other dried sea creatures to be sold as souvenirs. As the sea creatures attack the diver, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown and head for the beach. When they lose their way home, David Hasselhoff offers them a ride; Dennis catches up to them but is knocked by a catamaran back into the sea.Back at the Krusty Krab 2, Neptune arrives to execute Mr. Krabs. Just in time, SpongeBob and Patrick return with the crown and confront Plankton, who then drops a mind-control bucket on Neptune, enslaving him. SpongeBob performs the song \\"Goofy Goober Rock\\" (performed by Jim Wise) and, after transforming into an electric guitar-wielding wizard for the duration of the song, he frees Bikini Bottom's residents.

Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's 1984 to music. The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits \\"Rebel Rebel\\" and \\"Diamond Dogs\\", and No. 5 in the US. To promote it, Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob. The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia, and emotional problems. He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled \\"David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory\\". David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at No. 2 in the UK and No. 8 in the US. It also spawned a UK No. 10 hit in Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's \\"Knock on Wood\\". After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul. Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the \\"Victoria Station incident\\". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. \\"I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology ... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism ... I'd discovered King Arthur\\". According to playwright Alan...  Guess a valid title for it!

Article: \\"Teenager\\" is the new term being used in the UK to describe kids at either 8--12 or 10--13 years old. More and more companies are beginning to create products and services for teenagers. The Disney Company sells music and film to teenagers and their parents. You can get everything from lunchboxes and mobile phone covers, to monthly fan magazines and clothing. It's all about sales, which suggests that teenagers must have more money, freedom and influence upon their parents than they've ever had before. Most kids in the UK today get more pocket money than kids did ten years ago. Parents have more money to give their kids than before, since parents are having fewer children. In addition, the divorce  rate in the UK is continually rising and parents spend less time with their children than they used to, so many parents try to please their children by buying them presents. It's a bad habit for both parents and kids to get into, but parents are under pressure from commercial marketing and the pleas  of their children. UK kids today are very media and computer-literate. A lot of kids have a TV, if not a computer, in their bedrooms. They have easy access to much more information about life and the world. They may have experienced a lot in life as well, since 24% of UK kids live in single-parent families, so people now say that \\"kids are getting older younger\\". With such maturity  at such a young age, it's no wonder teenagers are able to influence their parents and have more freedom than previous generations. UK teenagers never used to be worried about spending money on clothes. That's changed. Now, they are much more fashion  conscious and concerned about their image . Many of them outgrow the bright colors and fashions of kids years ago and go for something darker and more rebellious . Surely none of the above is a good thing. The UK government is certainly concerned, and for that reason has strict laws preventing companies from marketing their products and services at children. Question: Why are more products and services created for teenagers? Options: A: Because companies are creating better products and services. B: Because children education is becoming more important.

The result of this step is:    -90*i + 17185 - 17185 = 14665 - 17185    It simplifies to:    -90*i = -2520. 2. Now, to further isolate 'i', divide both sides of the equation by -90:    -90*i / -90 = -2520 / -90 It simplifies to: i = 28.

Another angler prepares a flare gun but he slips and accidentally fires it into the deck, which is soaked with gasoline dropped earlier by the boy. The vessel bursts into flames and explodes; everybody aboard is killed. Jim Hill (McClure) and his wife Carol witness the explosion. Later, Jim and Carol's dog goes missing and the pair finds its dismembered corpse on the nearby beach. The following day, teenagers Jerry Potter (Meegan King) and Peggy Larson (Lynn Schiller) go for a swim at the beach. Jerry is abruptly pulled under the water. Peggy believes it is a prank until she discovers his mutilated corpse. Peggy screams and tries to reach the beach but a monstrous figure attacks her and drags onto the sand. The humanoid creature tears off her swimsuit and rapes her. That night, two more teenagers are camping on the same beach. Billy (David Strassman) is about to have sex with his girlfriend, Becky (Lisa Glaser) when another humanoid monster claws its way inside, kills him and chases Becky onto the beach. She outruns her assailant but then runs into the arms of yet another monster, which throws her to the sand and rapes her.

Jim's brother is also attacked, prompting Jim to take a personal interest in the matter. A company called Canco has announced plans to build a huge cannery near Noyo.

Process:  - Cold water taken in through a hose to the bottom - Heating element heats water - Pump forces water up in pipes connected to spinning paddles - The forced water makes paddles spin like a sprinkler - Water comes out of small holes in paddles - Water is collected and used again until dishes are clean - Water is drained through a filter - Filter collects particles of food - Water was so hot that it evaporates for dry dishes.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the paddle is broken happens, how will it affect the water paddle is obstructed.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, if the paddle in the dishwasher is broken or obstructed, it will have a direct effect on the process. Here are the steps affected and the reasons: 1. The forced water makes paddles spin like a sprinkler: If the paddle is broken or obstructed, the water pressure may not be strong enough to spin the paddles, or the paddles may not spin at all. As a result, the water will not be distributed evenly across the dishes. 2. Water comes out of small holes in paddles: With a broken or obstructed paddle, the water may not flow out of the small holes properly. This can lead to uneven water distribution and poor cleaning performance. 3. Water is collected and used again until dishes are clean: If the paddle is not functioning correctly, the water may not be adequately circulated, leading to the dishwasher needing more time or more water to clean the dishes properly. 4. Water is drained through a filter: Although a broken or obstructed paddle may not directly affect this step, an indirect effect could occur due to larger food particles not being adequately loosened and removed from the dishes. This debris might cause the filter to become clogged faster than it should, impacting the water drainage process. The overall impact of a broken or obstructed paddle would lead to lower cleaning performance, increased water usage, and potentially faster clogging of filters.

We need to find the value of w. The equation is: -3289*w = 4542*w - 498*w + 80663 First, let's combine the w terms on the right side: 4542*w - 498*w = 4044*w (Because 4542 minus 498 is equal to 4044) Now the equation looks like: -3289*w = 4044*w + 80663 Next, we want to move all the w terms to one side. To do this, let's add 3289*w to both sides: -3289*w + 3289*w = 4044*w + 3289*w + 80663 This simplifies to: 0 = 7333*w + 80663 (Because -3289 plus 3289 is 0, and 4044 plus 3289 is 7333) Now, we need to get w by itself. So, let's subtract 80663 from both sides: -80663 = 7333*w Almost there! We now need to divide both sides by 7333 to find out what w is: -80663 / 7333 = w When we do the division, we'll find that: w ≈ -11 There we have it! w is approximately equal to -11.

The political situation in England rapidly began to deteriorate. Longchamp refused to work with Puiset and became unpopular with the English nobility and clergy. John exploited this unpopularity to set himself up as an alternative ruler with his own royal court, complete with his own justiciar, chancellor and other royal posts, and was happy to be portrayed as an alternative regent, and possibly the next king.

Translate this to English?","output":"Structural reforms to support productivity will also be crucial for ensuring Europe's economic recovery and the survival of its social model. In detail, economic recovery in Europe faces several challenges, and one of the most critical aspects is increasing productivity. Structural reforms are essential for achieving this goal, as they aim to improve the efficiency of the economy and unlock potential growth. These reforms encompass various measures, including labor market changes, tax system improvements, and enhancements to the overall framework of business regulations. First, labor market reforms can contribute to productivity improvements by creating a more flexible and competitive environment. This would involve policies that promote entrepreneurship, encourage the participation of women and young people, address the skills gap, and provide a level playing field for all. The reforms should also facilitate labor mobility and adaptability, enabling businesses to respond to shifts in demand and technology. Second, tax system improvements are necessary to boost productivity. By simplifying tax compliance and lowering the tax burden for businesses, governments can foster an environment more conducive to investment and development. Additionally, a more efficient tax system should also promote growth, create jobs, and reduce income inequality. This, in turn, will contribute to a more vibrant and robust European economy. Third, enhancing the overall business regulatory framework will lead to increased productivity. By creating a more business-friendly environment, governments can reduce bureaucratic barriers, cut red tape, and encourage innovation. This would involve streamlining the process for starting a new business, introducing effective competition policies, and ensuring that businesses have access to affordable and reliable infrastructure. These structural reforms to support productivity will be vital in not only ensuring Europe's economic recovery but also preserving its social model. The European social model is characterized by a commitment to social cohesion, inclusion, and equal opportunities for all citizens. By promoting economic growth and improving productivity, these reforms would help to secure the future of the European social model by generating the resources necessary to maintain its unique mix of social welfare and protection. In conclusion, to achieve economic recovery and safeguard the social model in Europe, structural reforms focused on supporting productivity are of utmost importance. Successful implementation of these reforms will create a more resilient and competitive European economy, providing a foundation for long-term growth and stability in a rapidly changing world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And one day he felt unwell and couldn't go on working. He decided to spend a week's holiday in a quiet village where he could go swimming or fishing. He got off at a small railway station and soon got to a quiet village. He took a room hotel and went to sleep as soon as he had a good meal. At first Mr. Zhang enjoyed himself there. He could do everything he wanted and went wherever he liked. Nobody disturbed him and knocked at the door at midnight. But on the fourth day he was in trouble. After lunch it was very hot. He went swimming in the river. Suddenly he saw a beautiful bird in a big tree. He wanted to catch it, so he walked to it, but it found him and flew away ans soon as gone. He began to pick some flowers in the forest and before long he lost his way. The sun had gone down and night had fallen before Mr. Zhang found a small restaurant in another village. He came in and told them to bring him some bread, two eggs and a glass of tea. After a while his food was brought. Soon he ate up all the bread and eggs.

First, after going swimming in the river to escape the heat, he tried to catch a beautiful bird he spotted in a big tree. Unfortunately, the bird noticed him and flew away before he could get close. Then, as he started picking flowers in the forest, he ended up losing his way, resulting in an extended and anxiety-inducing period before he could figure out where he was. Eventually, Mr. Zhang stumbled upon a small restaurant in another village, where he ordered a simple meal of bread, eggs, and tea.

Please answer the following question: If chemical energy converted to light energy requires batteries, then what is required so that chemical energy may be converted to light energy?  Answer choices: - electrically  - batteries  - cords  - sunlight  - Energy.  - energy  - Evaporation  - plastic A:","output":"The conversion of chemical energy to light energy generally involves a process known as chemiluminescence. This process does not necessarily require batteries, cords, or any of the other options provided. Instead, it requires specific chemical reactions that directly result in the production of light. Chemiluminescent reactions typically involve two different chemicals: a chemiluminescent substrate and an oxidizing agent. Chemiluminescent substrates, or luminophores, can absorb energy from a chemical reaction and then release that energy in the form of light. One common example of a chemiluminescent substrate is the molecule luciferin, found in fireflies. The oxidation of luciferin by the enzyme luciferase produces an excited-state molecule that emits light upon returning to its ground state. The color and intensity of the light produced vary depending on the specific substrate and the precise conditions of the reaction. Oxidizing agents are essential to drive the chemiluminescent reaction. These substances promote the oxidation of the chemiluminescent substrate, allowing the reaction to proceed and the substrate to emit light. Many chemiluminescent reactions involve the participation of reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide, as oxidizing agents. In the case of fireflies, molecular oxygen (O2) is the oxidizing agent responsible for the breakdown of luciferin, leading to light emission. In specific cases, light energy may be produced without the need for any additional hardware, such as batteries, cords, or solar panels. Instead, specific chemical compounds interact in such a way that they release energy in the form of photons (light). However, if the goal is to create a useful device or a practical system that can store and release chemical energy to produce light, it may be necessary to incorporate additional components, such as batteries or external power sources. These components may be used to initiate the chemical reactions or maintain the right conditions for the reactions to occur. In conclusion, the conversion of chemical energy to light energy primarily requires a chemiluminescent substrate and an oxidizing agent, rather than any of the specific answer choices provided. These two components interact in a chemical reaction that releases energy in the form of light. Depending on the desired practical application of this process, additional components such as batteries or external power sources may be required for initiating or sustaining the chemiluminescent reaction."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Minke whales are just like their siblings, the when you see their big bodies and the water shooting from their blowholes. They love to swim around, dive into the waters, and play with their fish friends. One day, as Mr. Minke Whale was swimming along, he sadly got very, very sick. We don't know why he got sick, but sometimes it just happens to whales. Sometimes it's because of things they eat or the water they live in. Because he was so tired and feeling so bad, he couldn't stay in the water, swimming with his friends anymore. Instead, Mr. Minke Whale floated up to the surface of the water and soon washed up on the Norfolk coast, which is a big place with lots of sandy beaches where people like to visit. It's beautiful and peaceful there, but it's not where a whale should be. Whales should be in the ocean. When the people who live in Norfolk saw Mr. Minke Whale on their beach, they felt so sad. They knew that whales are important creatures that should be in the ocean feeling happy and healthy. But Mr. Minke Whale was not, and he had passed away on the beach because he was so sick. The people in Norfolk, who take care of the beaches and the area, are called council workers. They decided that they needed to move Mr. Minke Whale's big body from the beach so that other animals and people could still enjoy the beautiful sandy shore. So, the council workers put on their work clothes and gloves and began working together to move Mr. Minke Whale. They did this with so much love and care, because they know how important whales are to our world and the environment. They wanted to make sure that Mr. Minke Whale's body was taken care of in the best way possible. And while it might be a sad story that Mr. Minke Whale got sick and ended up on the Norfolk beach, it's important to remember how much beauty and joy whales like Mr. Minke bring to our world.

Article: A huge cloud of dust rose and an overpass disappeared. This was the scene in Zhuzhou,Hunan Province on May 17.Nine people were killed and 16 injured. Things were similar last year in the Sichuan earthquake. Thousands of people were buried in the ruins and lost their lives. What if we could have warned them? People are always _ to find a way of preventing buildings' collapse. Better materials and technology help,but they are not a solution. Just like humans,a building has its own life cycle from \\"birth\\" to \\"death\\".If we know when a building is going to collapse,we can repair it in advance or get out of it before it falls. Now,scientists at the University of Illinois have developed a material that turns red before it breaks. The invention could be used in things like climbing ropes or bridge supports. The research was led by Nancy Sottos,a professor at the university's Beckman Institute,and Douglas Davis,a graduate research assistant. The secret behind the colorchanging material is a type of molecule  .A molecule is a group of atoms held together by chemical bonds. Imagine you and your friends standing in a circle,holding hands. Each person stands for one atom,your hands represent the bonds,and the entire circle represents a molecule. If one person lets go of his or her hands,the molecule changes color. The research team put the molecule into a soft material. When the researchers stretched the material,it turned bright red for a few seconds before it broke into two pieces. When they repeatedly stretched and relaxed the material,without breaking it,it only turned a little red. The major problem is that light can get rid of the red color. When the team shone bright light on the molecule,the broken bond was fixed,and the color disappeared. If the bright light keeps the red color from appearing,the material's warning system will be useless. Scientists still have a lot of work to do before the colorchanging molecules can be used outside the lab. Question: Which of the following is a WRONG statement?

Challenge yourself to only buy things that you need and that you will use. Before you make a purchase, ask yourself: \\"Do I need this? Will I use this?\\" Not all indulgences are bad – but a big part of living green is being aware of how your choices impact the world around you. Try to buy products that minimize plastic wrap. As a general rule: if a piece of plastic is flimsy and does not hold its shape, then it almost certainly cannot be recycled at your local center.  Buy food in bulk! Look for a local wholesale grocery store that features bulk food bins. You can purchase grains, flours, nuts, fruits, vegetables, and other staples by the pound, no plastic packaging necessary. Bring your own canvas bag when you go shopping. If you have the choice between \\"paper or plastic\\": choose paper. Use reusable baskets, bins, and cardboard boxes to carry bulk purchases.  Try storing food in jars or Tupperware containers. Wash out plastic bags and reuse them. Drink tap water, not bottled water! It is cheap, and it is safe. When you do need to purchase goods, try to be a discerning consumer. Avoid spending your money on products that you know have been manufactured using unethical practices. Look for organic, free-range, humane, local products. Try to buy food that is in season, rather than food that has been frozen for months or shipped halfway around the globe to your local supermarket.   Buy local, when possible. It takes a lot of money and fossil fuels to transport goods around the world. Supporting farmers and craftspeople in your area can be a great way to reduce your carbon footprint.  Buy recycled products, when possible. If you must buy paper and plastic, then buy recycled paper and recycled plastic products. Read the labels on the products that you buy. Make sure that the chemicals hidden in these things will not leach into the environment during or after use, harming humans, animals, and ecosystems. Avoid industrial-strength cleaning products. Make sure to safely dispose of chemical products. anything that you can. Find creative ways to reuse paper, styrofoam, old CDs and DVDs, empty water bottles – any consumer product that is not toxic or completely unusable after its intended single use. Try to break out of the self-perpetuating cycle of \\"use and dispose.\\"  Refill glass and plastic water bottles. Clean out food-packaging jars and use them for drinking or storage.

In general, you can recycle all paper products, some metal products (aluminum, tin, steel,) some plastic products, and most glass. Try to make it a practice, but be aware of the limitations.  Every area is different, so make sure that you understand which municipal recycling options are available to you.  Recyclable items need to be clean and free of food residue, especially paper products. If you have mixed material recycling, the residue on glass and aluminum can contaminate paper products. Summary:","output":"To live a more environmentally-conscious life, consider buying less and being aware of where your money goes. Focus on purchasing only items that are necessary and will be used, while minimizing plastic waste by choosing products with little to no plastic wrap. Opt for bulk food purchases at wholesale grocery stores, using canvas bags, reusable baskets, or cardboard boxes for transportation.

The busiest acquirer you haven’t heard of FORTUNE — When you think about voracious corporate acquirers, it’s probably a tech giant like Cisco CSCO or Yahoo YHOO . But neither of them can hold a candle to a privately-held insurance upstart named Confie Seguros, which has acquired a whopping 55 companies since being founded in 2007. If you haven’t heard heard of Confie Seguros, you probably will soon. The company is now generating more than 200 million in annual revenue and employees more than 2,000 people in nine states. It also plans to begin to begin expanding beyond its original mandate to focus on Hispanic customers, into a national personal lines broker. The Buena Park, Calif.-based company was originally formed by private equity firm Genstar Capital, which saw a big consolidation opportunity within a fragmented Hispanic-focused market that was dominated by small mom-and-pop shops. Genstar committed an initial 75 million — bolstered by an additional 200 million bank facility — and Confie Seguros was launched via the acquisition of a Southern California auto insurance business called Westline. It then went on to acquire another 43 companies before being sold by Genstar to ABRY Partners last November. Basically a hub-and-spoke model, with each addition expected to increase market share by leveraging the broader company. Since being acquired by ABRY, Confie Seguros has been in overdrive. Twelve new acquisitions, nine signed letters of intent and a pipeline of ten more LOIs that the company plans to have signed by year-end. It also is expecting to enter five new states over the next 12 months. Confie Seguros co-founder Mordy Rothberg explains that the acquisition pace has been enabled by three things: (1) Continued market fragmentation in areas where Confie Seguros has not yet entered; (2) The continuing reality that Hispanics are underserved when it comes to financial services; and (3) Its private equity ownership. “I would pick partnering with private equity any day of the week rather than going public,” he explains. “We’re able to have a longer-term approach and don’t need to spend management’s time speaking with a large group of investors.” Sign up for Dan’s daily email newsletter on deals and deal-makers: GetTermSheet.com What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Confie Seguros is a company that helps people with their insurance needs.

Anghaie has been placed on administrative leave with pay. Article:","output":"Title: FBI Raids Office of Florida Professor Accused of Misusing NASA Funds for Personal Gain Introduction: In a recent development, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has conducted a raid on the office of a Florida professor, Samim Anghaie, who is accused of misappropriating NASA funds for personal benefit. The suspect, employed by the University of Florida, has been placed on administrative leave with pay as investigators continue to delve deeper into the allegations. (Step 1: Open with an engaging and informative introduction that summarizes the main event.) Body: The FBI's involvement in the case indicates the seriousness of the allegations against Professor Anghaie. As a faculty member of the University of Florida, Anghaie allegedly siphoned off funds meant for research work financed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). (Step 2: Elaborate on the event, providing more context regarding the professor and the nature of the allegations.) According to investigators, Anghaie, along with his family, used these illicit funds for their own personal gain rather than for the research activities for which they were intended. Authorities are currently probing into the details of the alleged fraudulent activities, which, if proven, could lead to severe penalties for all those involved. (Step 3: Explain the role of the family in the case and emphasize the potential consequences of such actions.) Since the investigation is ongoing, the University of Florida has taken immediate action, placing the accused Professor Anghaie on administrative leave with pay. A spokesperson for the university has stated that they are fully cooperating with the federal authorities in the investigation and are committed to ensuring the highest standards of integrity and accountability within their institution. (Step 4: Mention the response from the University of Florida and emphasize their cooperation in the investigation.) Conclusion: The FBI's raid on the office of Professor Samim Anghaie is a significant step in investigating and curbing instances of financial misappropriation in academic institutions. It serves as a stark reminder of the need for transparency and accountability in research funding, as well as the zero-tolerance policies enforced by federal authorities to protect taxpayer dollars. As the investigation unfolds, the university community and public will be closely monitoring the outcome of this case, which may have lasting implications on appropriate conduct in academic circles. (Step 5: End the article with an emphasis on the broader implications of the case – accountability in academia and research funding.

Pearl Jam commenced work on a new album following a year-long break after its full-scale tour in support of Binaural. McCready described the recording environment as \\"a pretty positive one\\" and \\"very intense and spiritual.\\" Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, \\"There's been a lot of mortality...It's a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed.\\" Pearl Jam released its seventh album, Riot Act, on November 12, 2002. It included the singles \\"I Am Mine\\" and \\"Save You\\". The album featured a much more folk-based and experimental sound, evident in the presence of B3 organist Boom Gaspar on songs such as \\"Love Boat Captain\\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said \\"Riot Act is the album that Pearl Jam has been wanting to make since Vitalogy—a muscular art rock record, one that still hits hard but that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours.\\" The track entitled \\"Arc\\" was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine people who died at the Roskilde Festival in June 2000.

News article: Domestic Drilling Advocates Warn Of Increased Global Demand For Oil, Dwindling Supply All over the world, more people are buying cars and using gas as growth in the global economy increases the demand for fuel. Likewise, oil supplies are projected to get tighter and tighter. \\"China was at 5 million barrels a day in 2005. Today, they are at 10 (million). By 2015, they are going to be at 15-million-barrels-a-day demand,\\" said John Hofmeister, former president of Shell Oil and founder of Citizens for Affordable Energy. \\"That's 10 million new barrels over 10 years. India is going from 4 to 7 (million) in the next three to four years.\\" President Obama recognizes the coming explosion in demand. \\"China and India, they're growing. China added 10 million cars in 2010 -- 10 million cars just in this one country,\\" Obama said last week. \\"And they're just going to keep on going, which means they're going to use more and more oil.\\" The president, however, argues that more drilling is not the way to protect the U.S. Instead, he wants to wean the U.S. off oil by turning to alternatives, such as electric cars. \\"If we want to stabilize energy prices for the long term and the medium term, if we want America to grow, we're going to have look past what we've been doing and put ourselves on the path to a real, sustainable energy future,\\" he said. The problem is, most analysts say, the transition to alternatives takes far longer than more drilling would. \\"And we have a capital stock of hundreds of million of vehicles,\\" Guy Caruso of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said. \\"So these types of transformations take decades and maybe even 50 to 60 years.\\" Though the president talks about drilling, official government figures show he is issuing far fewer permits on federal land than his predecessor. At the end of the Bush years, 6,000 to 7,000 permits a year were issued, but under Obama the numbers have dropped significantly to a range of 4,000 to almost 4,500 a year. Since it can take seven to 10 years for a permit to turn into a producing well, that means less oil coming off federal lands in the years to come, even as global demand is rising. Advocates of more domestic drilling say we know a crunch is coming, so we should be drilling more now -- otherwise, the result could be ugly. \\"The reality of the situation, with respect to global supply is that Americans can find themselves in gasoline lines, with gas rationing by 2015 or 2016 by us not producing more of our own oil,\\" Hofmeister said. Even with alternatives, the Energy Department predicts that in 2035 we'll still be relying on oil for 83 percent of our transportation needs. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1.

Kimani Maruge (Litondo), an 84-year-old villager, hears this and decides to take it upon himself to seek an education. Arriving at his local school, he meets Jane Obinchu (Harris), the principal and teacher. He expresses his desire to learn how to read. Her teaching colleague Alfred (Munyua), ridicules him and demands he leave. Later, Jane informs her husband Charles (Kgoroge) about Maruge. He discourages her in supporting his educational endeavor. After beginning his initial classes, Maruge is plagued by memories of his service during the Mau Mau Uprising against the British in the 1950s. He begins to hallucinate and becomes confrontational with the students, struggling to continue his academics. Controversy begins to stir over Marugeâs education. Soon enough, the story that an elderly man going to school becomes national headlines. Mr. Kipruto (Kunene), a superintendent of the school district, is alerted to the situation and strongly disapproves of Maruge's predicament and suggests that he go to an adult educational facility. Meeting with the head of the education board to plead Marugeâs case, Jane is overruled. It is explained to her that if an exception is made to keep Maruge in the school, others will follow, and many schools will eventually become filled with older people sitting aside children.

When standing next to Kenneth, Aaron was ashamed of their upper body because","output":"Kenneth had always been the epitome of physical fitness. He stood tall with broad shoulders, chiseled chest, and impressive biceps. On the other hand, Aaron had always been what could be described as scrawny or skinny. Over the years, he had tried to maintain a regular workout routine, but it was always difficult for him to gain muscle mass and build an impressive upper body. Ever since they were kids, Aaron and Kenneth had a friendly rivalry. Both of them loved sports and outdoor activities, but it was apparent from early on that Kenneth had the advantage when it came to physical abilities. Aaron would often struggle to keep up with Kenneth, but his determination never wavered. Growing up, Aaron always reminded himself that any physical differences between him and Kenneth didn't matter. They were friends, and what truly mattered was their camaraderie and the memories they shared. However, as they entered adulthood, that feeling became harder to maintain. Society seemed to place a greater emphasis on physical appearance and strength, and Aaron couldn't escape the feeling that his lack of an impressive upper body was holding him back. When they attended social gatherings, Aaron noticed that people admired Kenneth for his athletic build. They would approach him to ask about his workout routine or compliment him on his well-toned body. In contrast, Aaron often felt ignored or overlooked. He started to question if he was truly content with his physique. One day, Aaron finally mustered the courage to discuss his insecurities with Kenneth. Kenneth, ever the understanding friend, offered to help Aaron achieve the upper body he had always desired. They agreed to work together to find a personalized workout routine that would help Aaron gradually build muscle and gain confidence in his appearance. They spent hours researching exercises and discussing nutrition. Armed with this newfound knowledge, Aaron began a strict schedule of strength training and proper dieting. With Kenneth by his side, he felt motivated and determined to improve. As the months passed, Aaron started to see progress. His chest began to fill out, his shoulders broadened, and his arms slowly transformed from skinny limbs to toned guns. The transformation was slow and steady, but every day Aaron felt stronger and more confident. Kenneth, on the other hand, was proud to see his friend's determination pay off and offered nothing but encouragement along the way. They continued to exercise together, forging an even stronger bond through their shared experiences at the gym. People began to notice Aaron's improved physique and complimented him on his progress. For the first time in his life, Aaron felt like he could stand proudly next to Kenneth without feeling inferior. This journey taught Aaron two valuable lessons. First, that he should not let the opinions of others define his self-worth. And second, that every individual is capable of achieving their goals if they set their mind to it and surround themselves with positive influences and supportive people. In the end, Aaron realized that his self-consciousness stemmed not from their upper bodies' physical differences, but from his own perceptions of inadequacy. As he stood next to Kenneth, feeling more confident and less ashamed, Aaron knew it wasn't just the muscles on his body that had grown, but his mind and spirit as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: In his first competitive match on grass this year, the Serb, who received a bye in round one, registered a 6-4 6-3 win. It was Djokovic's first match since his defeat in the French Open quarter-finals earlier in the month as he continues his preparations for Wimbledon, which starts on 3 July. He will face either Donald Young or his fellow American Jarden Donaldson in the third round. The match was scheduled for Tuesday but only nine minutes of play was possible on Centre Court before rain led to play being cancelled for the day. Djokovic, playing in his first pre-Wimbledon grass-court tournament for seven years, said prior to the match that this year had been his toughest in tennis. Although he was not as his best against Pospisil, the first seed found his rhythm as the match progressed, with his service game looking strong. He struggled for direction with his backhand but controlled play across the court, particularly through his powerful forehand. Pospisil played aggressively but failed to build on Djokovic's second serve, eventually throwing his racquet away in annoyance as he failed to break Djokovic, who went on to serve out the match. The 12-time Grand Slam champion has now won 25 of his 32 matches this year. \\"Don't underestimate, this is a beautiful Centre Court and I enjoyed every minute of it,\\" Djokovic told Eurosport. \\"I will keep going.

After several months of negotiations, the government of the Duke of Newcastle decided to send an army expedition the following year to dislodge the French. They chose Major General Edward Braddock to lead the expedition. Word of the British military plans leaked to France well before Braddock's departure for North America. In response, King Louis XV dispatched six regiments to New France under the command of Baron Dieskau in 1755. The British sent out their fleet in February 1755, intending to blockade French ports, but the French fleet had already sailed. Admiral Edward Hawke detached a fast squadron to North America in an attempt to intercept them. In a second British action, Admiral Edward Boscawen fired on the French ship Alcide on June 8, 1755, capturing her and two troop ships. The British harassed French shipping throughout 1755, seizing ships and capturing seamen. These actions contributed to the eventual formal declarations of war in spring 1756.

Article: A father is suing Facebook after his 12-year-old daughter posted “sexually explicit” photos on the social network. His main argument is that Facebook does not properly enforce its own policy for requiring users of the social network to be at least 13 years old. The writ alleges that Facebook is “guilty of negligence” and creates “a risk of sexual and physical harm” to the child.      I contacted Facebook for a statement, and the answer I received back was much more detailed than usual (read it in full below). Facebook obviously does not agree that it should be held accountable. The company insists that anyone who is concerned about an underage person on Facebook should report them by using the form provided, and it will remove them.      Of course, the father in question did that, but his daughter, who reportedly has behavioral problems, simply created another account and continued uploading photos. The father is seeking an injunction not only ordering Facebook to close down his daughter’s account but to stop her from opening another one. If that doesn’t happen, he wants to see Facebook stop operations in Northern Ireland.      Facebook, for its part, says it uses back-end end technology to try and prevent underage users from signing up again. Palo Alto would not elaborate how this system worked. It did note, however, that recent reports show it is difficult is to implement age restrictions on the Internet and that there is no single solution to ensuring younger children don’t circumvent a system or lie about their age.      Instead of implementing a strict system for age verification (the father’s lawyer suggested using a passport number), Facebook says it prefers to educate its users about safety instead. Facebook would have arguably not grown very quickly if signing up for the social network was a long process.      Palo Alto cites safety experts who say communication between parents and their kids about their use of the Internet is vital. The company points to recent updates to its safety and security offerings, including the Family Safety Center and social reporting tool (Photo Gallery). The social networking giant also notes it works with charity partners such as Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI) and law enforcement agencies across the world.      The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) mandates that websites that collect information about users aren’t allowed to sign on anyone under the age of 13. As a result, Facebook’s Statement of Rights and Responsibilities require users of the social network to be at least 13 years old (and even older, in some jurisdictions).      Millions of preteens use the service anyway: some get permission from their parents to create an account while others lie about their age to get past sign-up restrictions. Four months ago, it was estimated that 7.5 million Facebook users are below the minimum age. To make matters even more worrying, more than 5 million were 10-years-old or younger.      The full statement Facebook sent me is below:      Anyone who is concerned about an underage person on Facebook should report them to us using the form provided and we will remove them. Facebook is currently designed for two age groups (13-17 year olds and 18 and up), and we provide extensive safety and privacy controls based on the age provided. If someone reports an underage account to use then we will remove it, and use back-end end technology to try and prevent them signing up again. However, recent reports have highlighted just how difficult it is to implement age restrictions on the Internet and that there is no single solution to ensuring younger children don’t circumvent a system or lie about their age. We invest heavily in educating people how to stay safe on Facebook both via our Family Safety Center and by working with charity partners such as FOSI (Family Online Safety Institute). We have good working relationships with law enforcement agencies across the world, including CEOP in the UK, and employ world class technology to help keep bad people and content off the site. However, we agree with safety experts that communication between parents/guardians and kids about their use of the Internet is vital. We believe that services such as Facebook have a role to play in encouraging this: the recent announcements around social reporting and our safety center are testimonies to our ongoing efforts in ensuring we are giving detailed and helpful advice to help support these conversations. Just as parents are always teaching and reminding kids how to cross the road safely, talking about internet safety should be just as important a lesson to learn.

The distraught father has claimed his daughter has been put at risk from paedophiles as a result of the publication of the images.      Facebook, the world's largest social networking site, has 730 million users around the world.      If the case is successful, the global brand worth an estimated €20bn would be facing a huge payout.      Hilary Carmichael, the solicitor acting for the father, told the Herald that Facebook does not have any checks in place to ensure children are over the permitted age, 13, when they open an account.      Harm      \\"I was able to access this girl's Facebook page myself before we issued the writ. She has more than 485 friends ... some from the western provinces of Nigeria,\\" she revealed.      The writ lodged in Belfast High Court alleges the company is \\"guilty of negligence\\" and has created \\"a risk of sexual and physical harm\\" to the child.      It claims the girl has received sexually explicit text messages from adult men and that men asked her to post images of herself online.      The girl, who is from Co Antrim, cannot be identified for legal reasons.      It is believed she posted the provocative material on the site herself.      She even revealed personal details like where she lived, the name of her school and areas where she hangs out.      The girl suffers from behaviour problems and is in a voluntary care institution.      Mother-of-three Ms Car-michael told the Herald she has come across similar Facebook pages of children who live in the Republic of Ireland and she warned parents to be vigilant.      \\"We've had parents who've been in contact with us whose children live in the Republic and operate Facebook pages in the Republic.      \\"If they have any concerns, they should shut it down straight away,\\" the Derry solicitor said.      She added that it is easy to pin down the location of a child by following posts on the site.      \\"A lot of children are innocent and they don't know the dangers.      \\"That's why they shouldn't be allowed Facebook pages -- they're too young,\\" said Ms Carmichael who has launched the childrenonfacebook.com site to warn parents about the risks.      The High Court writ was served on the US company today.      ADULTS      Among the 12-year-old girl's Facebook 'friends' are adults in Ireland, Britain and elsewhere.      The girl's father has said he is \\"worried sick\\" thinking about the danger she could be in, adding his concern is she would go off with someone she met on the social networking site.      \\"There was another photo of my daughter lifting up her top but that has been removed,\\" the man said.      Facebook, whose international headquarters are located in Dublin said it is committed to removing inappropriate and indecent photos once a complaint has been made.      It is the latest court action to hit the company.      A recent case involved businessman and racehorse owner JP McManus who had sought an injunction to force Facebook to shut down accounts claiming to be him.      The action was struck out in May after lawyers for the company took down the profiles.      See Page 14 |||||Summary:","output":"A father is upset with Facebook because his 12-year-old daughter put some not-so-nice photos of herself on the website.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work.

And first-time viewers were left baffled by the complex storyline as producers did not begin with a summary of what had happened in the first series – which ended in April 2013 – even though the new series picks up where that left off. While the opening episode, which had an audience of 7.2million, drew widespread praise and was quickly being talked about on Twitter, many viewers said they had difficulty deciphering some of the dialogue. One wrote: ‘Still couldn’t understand a word they were saying in Broadchurch tonight – I need someone to translate the heavily accented mumbling.’ Another added: ‘Challenge: try to watch Broadchurch without subtitles. FAILED.’ Others singled out Tennant, who plays dour Detective Inspector Alec Hardy, saying: ‘David Tennant needs subtitles, with that accent don’t understand a word he says.’ Many viewers complained about having to use subtitles to understand Tennant's mumbling on the show. Tennant and Coleman, who plays DS Ellie Miller, were in court as DS Miller's husband denied murder. This is not the first time Tennant’s voice has caused problems. He also starred in Gracepoint, the US remake of Broadchurch, with his American accent failing to impress both critics and audiences. On Monday night, many Broadchurch viewers were left scratching their heads – and not in the way the programme makers intended. Fans said the show was confusing and complained that there had been no recap of the first series at the start. This left new viewers lost, while many who were avid watchers of the old series nearly two years ago were unable to remember the details needed to follow the plot. One tweeted: ‘May as well have not watched the last series of Broadchurch, not a clue who’s who or what’s happening.’ Viewers complained about the accents of many of the cast members as well as the loud background noise. Joe Miller pleaded not guilty to the murder of Danny Latimer, 11, despite his confession in the last show. Another added: ‘Anyone else watching Broadchurch and can’t remember who everyone is or what went on last series?’ One Broadchurch mystery was instantly seized on by the gloomy drama’s more light-hearted fans – why are there so many former Doctor Who stars in the cast? They pointed out that seven had previously appeared in the BBC sci-fi series. David Tennant played The Doctor for five years while Arthur Darvill – the Rev Paul Coates in Broadchurch – had a long-running role as one of the time-traveller’s companions. Olivia Colman has been a guest star, as has Jonathan Bailey, who plays journalist Olly Stevens in the ITV drama. Three others in the new series appeared in Doctor Who, including Eve Myles, who was also in the spin-off, Torchwood. Many fans used social media to highlight this crossover. One wrote: ‘Do Broadchurch only cast actors who’ve appeared in Doctor Who/Doctor Who spin-offs?’ Another added: ‘Broadchurch, where Dr Who actors go on leaving the Tardis, apparently.’ Others joked that Broadchurch had become a ‘retirement home’ for Doctor Who stars and wrote ‘I reckon Dr Who did it’. The first series, set in a fictional Dorset seaside town, involved the hunt for the killer of 11-year-old Danny Latimer. Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller, played by Olivia Colman, and DI Hardy – who moved to the area from another force after his previous investigation fell apart in court – investigated numerous suspects before the killer was exposed, in a shocking twist, to be DS Miller’s husband Joe. Monday’s episode began in court with Miller surprising everyone by entering a not guilty plea. Some viewers said the programme was unrealistic as retired barrister Jocelyn Knight, played by Charlotte Rampling, was given the job of prosecuting Miller. One lawyer said: ‘Completely unrealistic court scenes and how counsel are appointed in murder cases – can’t ITV afford researchers?’ ITV said it had received ‘fewer than five’ complaints about mumbled dialogue. It added that although no recap of the first series was broadcast on Monday, a four-minute clip recounting the plot had been circulated via social media and was available on the ITV website. Of alleged legal inaccuracies in the plot, an ITV spokesman said: ‘We consult extensively with advisers, but also have to balance what we consider to be the best creative decision for the drama – and the audience. ‘We’re thrilled that we’ve had such a positive response.’ What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The important parts of this article are: 1. The return of the ITV crime drama Broadchurch left many viewers baffled by David Tennant's Scottish accent. 2. Some viewers had to turn on TV subtitles to understand the dialogue. 3.

Seduction is a direct to video production company that specialize in lesbian themed, non-hardcore erotic movies. It has developed a very dedicated fan base that purchase each new title as they are released but sadly the company has become too closely associated with frequent star Misty Mundae. I say sadly because recent mainstream interest and her appearance on the show Masters of Horrors has caused her to set her sights a little higher than the zero budget S.C efforts which forces the company to find a new identity. But back in their glory days they released this film on a very appreciative world. The gorgeous Misty Mundae is forced to attend a boarding school at the request of a absent father. At the school she meets her absurdly hot room-mate played by Ruby Larocca who immediately has designs on her but the headmistress (Barbara Joyce) has other plans. In typical S.C style the movie stops every ten minutes for a extended sex scene but unlike most of their efforts this one has a somewhat interesting story and a couple of good performances. Ms. Larocca appears to be having a great time as the sexual predator who views Misty as a tasty meal and Darian Caine makes a welcome (though brief) appearance as Satan. This is the sort of film that Jess Franco would crank out in the 70s (although this one does not have the hardcore sex that Franco was always willing to throw in for foreign sales) and fans of that madman's work would be wise to give this one a go. To me, as a long time zero budget cinema fan (and Troma worshiper), I came across the Seduction cinema films through their parody films (Playmate of the apes, Who wants to be a erotic billionaire) but I actually prefer their more original works. You either see past the low budget and occasionally weak acting or you get hung up on these things and just hate all of these films. For me the most obvious thing that unites these no-budget movies is a real sense of fun. These low budget companies are able to create their own unique style which gives the viewer something very different from the bland, by the numbers, studio efforts that load up the multiplexes. If you have never seen a Seduction cinema film either this or Sin Sisters (featuring both of the Mundae sisters) are excellent choices to begin with. This one is a fun, fast paced film (although the frequent exterior shots of the school do get a little old) and the DVD is totally loaded with extras including a ton of previews of other company offerings, a great behind the scenes featurette and some deleted scenes including a alternate opening. I do recommend you pass on the disc's bonus feature, the first film by director, as it is quite weak and not really worth viewing. What is the sentiment of this review? Options: [+] negative [+] positive","output":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly positive. The reviewer clearly has a soft spot for zero budget cinema and appreciates the fun and unique style that these movies bring. They praise some of the performances in this film, particularly Ruby Larocca's, and describe the movie as \\"fun\\" and \\"fast-paced.\\" They also recommend either this film or 'Sin Sisters' as good starting points for those new to Seduction Cinema. The fact that the DVD is loaded with extras is another positive point mentioned. However, it should be noted that there are some minor criticisms mentioned, such as occasional weak acting and excessive exterior shots of the school.

Answer choices: - Pesticides  - Not eating  - headache  - microorganisms  - one celled organisms  - harmful substances  - influenza  - sleeping A:","output":"Food poisoning is primarily caused by microorganisms, specifically bacteria, viruses, and parasites that contaminate food during production, harvesting, processing, storage, or preparation. These pathogens are responsible for a myriad of illnesses with various symptoms that range from mild discomfort to severe, life-threatening issues. Out of the provided answer choices, microorganisms and one-celled organisms are the most accurate in relation to causing food poisoning.  1. Microorganisms: Microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites, are the leading causes of food poisoning. Some common examples include:   a. Bacteria: Salmonella, Listeria, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli (E.coli), and Staphylococcus aureus.      b. Viruses: Norovirus, Rotavirus, and Hepatitis A.      c. Parasites: Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and Cyclospora. 2. One-celled organisms: Some of the microbes involved in food poisoning are single-celled organisms, like bacteria and protozoa. They proliferate quickly in food products, usually due to improper storage, handling, or cooking. Consuming food containing these microbes can lead to foodborne illnesses. While microorganisms and one-celled organisms are the primary culprits, it's essential to understand that other factors can contribute to food poisoning or foodborne illnesses as well. These include: - Pesticides: Chemical residues from pesticides used in agriculture can sometimes contaminate food, causing adverse health effects. However, these instances are infrequent, and food poisoning is still predominately caused by microorganisms. - Harmful substances: Food can sometimes be contaminated with toxic agents, such as heavy metals, natural toxins, or allergens, which can lead to foodborne illness. However, the term food poisoning remains strongly associated with microorganisms. The other options listed are not causes of food poisoning: - Not eating: The absence of food cannot cause food poisoning. - Headache: A headache can be a symptom of food poisoning or other illnesses, but it is not the cause of food poisoning. - Influenza: Influenza is caused by the influenza virus, which is a respiratory virus, and it is not related to food consumption or food poisoning. - Sleeping: Sleeping has no direct connection to causing food poisoning. In conclusion, food poisoning is mainly caused by microorganisms and one-celled organisms that can contaminate food. Practices like proper food handling, storage, and cooking can significantly reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses. While other factors like pesticides and harmful substances may contribute to foodborne illnesses, they are not the primary cause of food poisoning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

Answer:","output":"Leukaemia is a type of cancer that primarily affects the blood and bone marrow, which is the soft, spongy tissue located inside bones where blood cells are produced. Leukaemia is characterized by an overproduction of abnormal white blood cells (leukocytes), which compromises the regular function of the blood and immune system. To understand how leukaemia affects the human body, it's helpful to have some knowledge of blood cell formation and functions. Blood cells are produced in the bone marrow via a process called hematopoiesis. There are three main types of blood cells: red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes). Each blood cell type has a specific role in the body: 1. Red blood cells are responsible for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and organs and transferring carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs, resulting in efficient gas exchange. 2. White blood cells play a critical role in defending the body against infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other pathogens. There are various types of white blood cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils, each with distinct functions in the immune system. 3. Platelets are vital for clot formation and prevent excessive bleeding by causing blood to solidify at the site of an injury, acting as a repair mechanism for damaged blood vessels. Leukaemia interferes with the normal functioning of these blood cells by causing the bone marrow to produce an excessive number of immature or abnormal white blood cells, which are unable to perform their protective roles effectively. The uncontrolled proliferation of these abnormal cells results in various complications, including: 1. Anemia: When the production of red blood cells is suppressed by the overproduction of abnormal white blood cells, it leads to anemia. Anemia is characterized by a reduced ability of the blood to carry oxygen, causing fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, and an increased heart rate. 2. Infections and weakened immune system: The abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the blood are incapable of protecting the body from infections, resulting in a weakened immune system and an increased risk of infections. Common symptoms include recurrent fevers, persistent infections, and slow-healing wounds. 3. Bleeding disorders: As the number of platelets in the bloodstream decreases, the body's ability to form blood clots is impaired, leading to prolonged and excessive bleeding, easy bruising, and an increased risk of hemorrhage. This can cause problems such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, and unexplained bruises or red spots on the skin (petechiae). 4. Bone and joint pain: Leukaemia cells can accumulate in the bone marrow, causing pain and pressure in the bones and joints. This is commonly seen in the back, hips, and arms. 5. Organ dysfunction and enlargement: Leukaemia cells can infiltrate various organs, such as the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes, causing these organs to enlarge and eventually malfunction. This may result in symptoms such as abdominal swelling, fullness, or pain, as well as changes in liver function or jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). 6. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement: In some cases, leukaemia cells may infiltrate the CNS, causing symptoms such as headaches, blurred vision, seizures, and changes in mental function. Leukaemia is further classified into four primary types: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Each type affects the different types of white blood cells and varies in terms of onset, progression, and treatment protocols. In conclusion, leukaemia is a disease that primarily affects blood cells and bone marrow in the human body, causing an overproduction of abnormal white blood cells, which interferes with the normal functioning of the immune system, blood clotting, and oxygen transport. The disease can lead to a range of complications, including anemia, weakened immune system, bleeding disorders, bone and joint pain, organ dysfunction, and central nervous system involvement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While some might consider it harsh to break up with a girlfriend because of a loss of interest, it's generally considered ethical to be honest about feelings in a relationship. It’s better to be truthful than to lead someone on in a relationship without genuine feelings. In this regard, it might be seen as a form of respect for the girlfriend’s feelings, though it may initially cause emotional pain. Ultimately, neither ACTION1 nor ACTION2 is conclusively less ethical than the other, given that they're both based on personal feelings and don't involve any direct harm or ill intent to others.

Like many older east coast cities after World War II, Atlantic City became plagued with poverty, crime, corruption, and general economic decline in the mid-to-late 20th century. The neighborhood known as the \\"Inlet\\" became particularly impoverished. The reasons for the resort's decline were multi-layered. First of all, the automobile became more readily available to many Americans after the war. Atlantic City had initially relied upon visitors coming by train and staying for a couple of weeks. The car allowed them to come and go as they pleased, and many people would spend only a few days, rather than weeks. Also, the advent of suburbia played a huge role. With many families moving to their own private houses, luxuries such as home air conditioning and swimming pools diminished their interest in flocking to the luxury beach resorts during the hot summer. But perhaps the biggest factor in the decline in Atlantic City's popularity came from cheap, fast jet service to other premier resorts, such as Miami Beach and the Bahamas. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): After the war, what form of transportation became more readily available to many Americans?","output":"After the war, the automobile became more readily available to many Americans.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb. Saccone’s campaign endorsed Trump’s tariff plan in a statement, saying “If other countries aren’t playing by the rules and tariffs are needed to protect steel and aluminum jobs in Southwestern Pennsylvania,...

The support for President Trump's tariffs mainly comes from the belief that they will protect and keep American jobs, particularly in the manufacturing sector.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing.  After reading the above, is \\"At the Gulf of Mexico\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Where was the Deepwater Horizon oil rig before the accident?\\"?","output":"Yes, \\"At the Gulf of Mexico\\" is the correct answer to the question, \\"Where was the Deepwater Horizon oil rig before the accident?\\" The Deepwater Horizon oil rig was located in the Gulf of Mexico when it exploded on April 20, 2010, tragically killing 11 workers and injuring 17 others.

Wall St. Slides, Fearing Return to a Recession Investors, who had started the week reassured by the huge rescue of Europe’s indebted nations, expressed second thoughts on Friday, sending markets lower and further devaluing the euro on concerns that the austerity measures required by the bailout would stunt the Continent’s already anemic economic growth. The euro fell to its lowest level in 18 months, and bank stocks on both sides of the Atlantic took a beating. Investors seemed fearful that the 957 billion bailout package for Greece and other nations, while providing short-term protection against default, might drag out the economic pain and hurt the financial system in the process. A continued hammering of the euro would make European exports cheaper, but the side effect would be weaker American exports, potentially dragging the United States — and the rest of the world — back toward recession. “What you get is markets worrying about a whole cascading of weakness stemming from Europe being transmitted through the euro to the United States,” said Martin Murenbeeld, chief economist at DundeeWealth Economics in Toronto. One by one on Friday, markets across Asia, Europe and then the United States sank lower under the renewed pessimism about European growth and the instability stemming from the Continent. The price of oil continued to fall as traders bet on slower global growth, and gold continued to rise as an asset perceived by investors as a safer, long-term store of value in times of stress. In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average, which had been seesawing since the rescue package was announced on Monday, declined 162.79 points, or 1.51 percent, to 10,620.16 on Friday. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 21.76 points, or 1.88 percent, to 1,135.68. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 47.51 points, or 1.98 percent, to 2.346.85. The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 20/32, to 100 12/32. The yield fell to 3.45 percent, from 3.53 percent late Thursday. Bank stocks led the market decline, mainly over worries about Europe. Another factor might have been the Senate’s approval of a proposal on Thursday that could cut bank revenue by imposing limits on fees they can charge businesses to process debit card transactions. The Senate also approved an initiative to end reliance on major credit rating agencies, putting further pressure on financial stocks. Last Friday, United States markets gave back all their gains for the year amid the immediate concerns over European defaults. Then on Monday, they roared back at the opening bell on the news of the nearly trillion-dollar intervention, sending the Dow up 404.71 points. Despite Friday’s losses, the Dow still managed to end the week up 239.73 points and is up 1.84 percent so far this year. The S.& P. 500 finished 24.8 points higher for the week and is up 1.85 percent so far this year. The Nasdaq was up 81.21 points for the week and is up 3.42 percent so far this year. In European trading on Friday, the Euro Stoxx 50 index of blue chips ended the session down 3.7 percent. In Paris, stocks slumped 4.6 percent; in London, the FTSE 100 lost 3.1 percent; and in Germany, the benchmark DAX index lost 3.1 percent of its value. The stock market in Spain fell 6.6 percent. The euro had rallied briefly to start the week, signaling initial enthusiasm about the rescue package. But then it dropped steadily as the week wore on and fell again on Friday, to 1.2385. Since the start of the year, the currency has fallen 13 percent against the dollar and 14 percent against the yen. Economists have begun worrying that the dollar’s appreciation might push up the price of American exports to Europe enough to place a further drag on growth in the United States. The sharp worldwide market decline came only five days after the European Union and the International Monetary Fund hoped their package would signal a “shock and awe” commitment to ending the Continent’s crisis. But economists said that while the package had eased concerns that countries like Greece would encounter trouble in rolling over old debts or borrowing new money, it had done nothing to help them grow. “It’s not a game changer, just a game extender,” said Jim Caron, the global head of interest rate strategy at Morgan Stanley. As far as the markets are concerned, Mr. Caron said, “It does not fix the problem of whether Europe will be able to climb out of this hole.” There was also a growing worry Friday about how governments would find the 957 billion to pay for the rescue package, economists said, and a growing suspicion that central banks might eventually resort to allowing inflation to lessen groaning debt loads. The European Central Bank agreed to help calm the financial turmoil by buying government bonds for the first time in its history this week. Some economists regard that step as a troubling departure from the bank’s mandate to focus solely on price stability, and as a result is adding to the pressures undermining the euro. “The reputation of the E.C.B. has been dented,” said Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. Although the market swoon amounted to an unwelcome return to the turmoil that preceded the bailout package, Zach Pandl, an economist at Nomura Securities in New York, emphasized that Friday’s decline was different in that it did not involve a big sell-off in government bonds. Interest rates on bonds in Greece, Spain, Portugal and other countries had risen sharply in recent weeks as investors feared governments might default on their debts. The rescue package appears to have quieted those fears somewhat. But now investors seem to be worried about a slowdown in growth caused by governments cutting back spending. On Friday, finance officials from the Group of 7 nations, including the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, met by conference call to discuss the continuing market turmoil. They did not comment publicly afterward, however. The uneasy mood in the markets was not helped by remarks by Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now an adviser to the Obama administration, who in a speech in London on Thursday raised the possibility of a “potential disintegration of the euro.” There are also indications that the rescue deal has worsened tensions among the European capitals. El País, the Spanish newspaper, reported Friday that President Nicolas Sarkozy of France had pressured Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, to back the rescue effort, pounding his fist and saying France would leave the common currency without Germany’s support. At a news conference in Zagreb, the French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, described the El País report as “rubbish.” But with rumors like that swirling through markets, investors were saddled with uncertainty, a sure prescription for selling. Contributing reporting were Jack Ewing, Christine Hauser, David Jolly and Bettina Wassener. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Wall Street experienced a decline as investors expressed concern over the recent 957 billion bailout package for Greece and other European nations and its potential negative impacts on economic growth. The euro fell to its lowest point in 18 months, and bank stocks suffered on both sides of the Atlantic. The bailout, while providing short-term protection against default, might prolong economic pain and hurt the financial system.

Select from: (i). no; (ii). yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"To answer these questions, let's first gather information about the tradition of placing coins on the eyes of the dead. Step 1: Research the origins and meanings of placing coins over a corpse's eyes. - Historically, the ancient Greeks and Romans placed coins on the eyes of their dead as a means of payment for Charon, the ferryman who transports the souls of the deceased across the River Styx to the underworld. This was known as the custom of \\"Charon's obol.\\" - In some cultures, coins were placed on the eyes of the deceased to keep them shut during the burial process. Step 2: Evaluate the relevance of this tradition in contemporary society. - Most modern cultures and religions do not practice the custom of placing coins on the eyes of the dead, largely viewing it as an ancient and obsolete belief. - The tradition of Charon's obol has lost its meaning in many societies, as it is not directly tied to their beliefs or customs. Step 3: Answer each question based on the gathered context. Question 1: When a person is dead, do we need to place coins over the corpse's eyes? - Answer: (i). no;  Reasoning: As the tradition is not part of most modern customs, there is no inherent need to place coins on a corpse's eyes, unless it is being practiced as a cultural or personal preference. Question 2: What is the meaning of coins on the eyes of the dead? - Answer: In ancient times, coins were placed on the eyes of the dead as a form of payment to Charon, the ferryman of the underworld. However, this meaning is not commonly held in modern societies. It can also serve to keep the eyes of the deceased closed during the burial process. Finally, we determine whether the answers to both questions would be the same. Would the answer to these two questions be the same? - Answer: No, the answers are not the same because the first question asks about the necessity of placing coins on the eyes of the dead while the second question asks about the meaning behind the practice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question The Punjabi kingdom, ruled by members of the Sikh religion, was a political entity that governed the region of modern-day Punjab. The empire, based around the Punjab region, existed from 1799 to 1849. It was forged, on the foundations of the Khalsa, under the leadership of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780–1839) from an array of autonomous Punjabi Misls. He consolidated many parts of northern India into a kingdom. He primarily used his highly disciplined Sikh army that he trained and equipped to be the equal of a European force. Ranjit Singh proved himself to be a master strategist and selected well qualified generals for his army. In stages, he added the central Punjab, the provinces of Multan and Kashmir, the Peshawar Valley, and the Derajat to his kingdom. This came in the face of the powerful British East India Company. At its peak, in the 19th century, the empire extended from the Khyber Pass in the west, to Kashmir in the north, to Sindh in the south, running along Sutlej river to Himachal in the east. This was among the last areas of the subcontinent to be conquered by the British. The first Anglo-Sikh war and second Anglo-Sikh war marked the downfall of the Sikh Empire.

It was led by Maharaja Ranjit Singh, who was also a Sikh, under the foundation of the Khalsa, a military and spiritual order of Sikhism. Singh had consolidated numerous parts of northern India into one kingdom, with the help of his well-disciplined Sikh army. The Sikh Empire stretched across a vast area by the 19th century and was one of the last regions of the Indian subcontinent to be conquered by the British. So, in summary, the rulers of the Punjabi Kingdom were followers of the Sikh religion."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

First, let's list all the substrings in string A and then find out if there is a match in string B. This can be done by starting from the longest possible substring of A, and then going downwards. I will start with the whole string A itself and then keep on reducing one letter at a time from either end. On examining the two strings A and B, the longest common substring is 'FtGRacOrzB'.  (ii) The next step is to convert this common substring to all lowercase and then sort it alphabetically. By converting all letters to lowercase, we obtain 'ftgraczorb'. By sorting this string alphabetically, we get 'abcfgorrtz'. (iii) The final step involves replacing the common substring in string A and B, with the updated substring from step(ii).

Movie title: Public Enemies Context: After killing Charles Floyd, FBI agent Melvin Purvis is promoted by J. Edgar Hoover to lead the hunt for bank robber John Dillinger. Purvis shares Hoover's belief in using scientific methods to battle crime, ranging from cataloging fingerprints to tapping telephone lines. In between a series of bank robberies, Dillinger meets Billie Frechette at a restaurant and woos her by buying her a fur coat. Frechette falls for Dillinger even after he reveals his identity, and the two become inseparable. Purvis leads a failed ambush at a hotel where he believes Dillinger is staying, and an agent is killed by Baby Face Nelson, who escapes with Tommy Caroll. Purvis requests that Hoover bring in professional lawmen who know how to catch criminals dead or alive, including Texan Charles Winstead. Police arrest Dillinger and his gang in Tucson, Arizona, after a fire breaks out at the Hotel Congress, where they are staying. Dillinger is extradited to Indiana, where Sheriff Lillian Holley has him locked up in the Lake County Jail in Crown Point. Dillinger and other inmates use a fake gun to escape. Dillinger is unable to see Frechette, who is under tight surveillance. Dillinger learns that Frank Nitti's associates are unwilling to help because his crimes are motivating the FBI to prosecute interstate crime, which imperils Nitti's bookmaking racket, thus severing his connections with the Mafia. Carroll goads Dillinger into robbing a bank in Sioux Falls with Baby Face Nelson. During their escape, both Dillinger and Carroll are shot, and they have to leave Carroll behind. The group retreats to the Little Bohemia Lodge in Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin and realize their haul is significantly less than Nelson said it would be. Dillinger hopes he can free the rest of his gang from prison, including Pierpont and Makley, but Red Hamilton convinces him this is unlikely. Purvis and his men apprehend Carroll and torture him to learn the gang's location. Purvis organizes an ambush at Little Bohemia. Dillinger and Hamilton escape separately...

He played for the Stapletons for four years from 1929 to 1932. While statistics are not available for the 1929 NFL season, Strong was regarded as one of the best backs in the NFL. He started all 10 games at halfback for the 1929 Stapletons. In his first NFL game, he threw a long forward pass to set up the Stapleton's first touchdown and scored all of the team's 12 points on two short touchdown runs. He also had a 70-yard run in a scoreless tie with the Orange Tornadoes on November 3, 1929. Two days later, Strong had a 50-yard touchdown run against the Providence Steam Roller. At the end of the 1929 season, Strong was selected by Collyer's Eye and the Green Bay Press-Gazette as a second-team All-Pro.  In 1930, Strong appeared in all 12 games for the Stapletons and scored 53 points on two rushing touchdowns, five receiving touchdowns, one field goal, and eight extra points. His point total ranked third in the NFL in 1930, trailing only Jack McBride (56 points) and Verne Lewellen (54 points). On September 28, 1930, he caught two touchdown passes, threw a 40-yard pass that set up a third touchdown, and kicked three extra points in a 21-0 victory over the Frankford Yellow Jackets. In December 1930, he led the Stapletons to a 16-7 victory over the New York Giants for the pro football championship of New York City; Strong accounted for all 16 Stapleton points, running 98 yards for a touchdown, passing for a second touchdown, and kicking a field goal and an extra point. He was selected as a first-team player on the 1930 All-Pro Team by Collyer's Eye and the Green Bay Press-Gazette.  In 1931, Strong appeared in all 11 games for the Stapletons and scored 53 points on six rushing touchdowns, one punt return for a touchdown, two field goals, and five extra points. His 53 points ranked fourth in the NFL, trailing only Johnny Blood (84 points), Ernie Nevers (66 points), and Dutch Clark (60 points). On November 22, 1931, Strong scored all 16 points in a 16-7 victory over Cleveland; he had two rushing touchdowns, including a 50-yard run and kicked a field goal and an extra point. At the end of the 1931 season, Strong was selected as an All-Pro for the second year in a row, receiving first-team honors from the United Press (UP) and Collyer's Eye.  Strong's output dropped off in 1932 as he moved to the fullback position. He appeared in 11 games and ranked sixth in the NFL with 375 rushing yards, but scored only 15 points on two touchdowns and three extra points.

The presence of a police boat may suggest that these men are in some way connected to law enforcement, as police boats are generally used by police officers or personnel associated with policing activities in water-based environments. However, the premise does not explicitly tell us the duty status or occupation of these three men. It is possible that they are police officers or law enforcement personnel who are currently on duty, performing their daily tasks in line with their professional responsibilities. This would support the hypothesis that the three men are on duty. On the other hand, it is also possible that these men are not actually on duty at the time of this situation. They could be off-duty police officers, civilian personnel (such as maintenance workers), or even volunteers assisting in some capacity with the retrieval of buoys. In any of these cases, the hypothesis that the three men are on duty would not hold true. Moreover, considering hypothetical situations such as a training exercise, they could also be trainee police officers or participants of a law enforcement program who were assigned the task of pulling in buoys, in which case their actual duty status would be ambiguous. In conclusion, the premise does not provide enough evidence to determine the accuracy of the hypothesis definitively.
