The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who approached Henry Grinnell, the philanthropic shipping magnate who had funded several previous expeditions? , can you please find it?   In July 1873 the U.S. Navy dispatched USS Juniata to Greenland, to search for survivors from the Polaris expedition which had disintegrated after the death of its leader, Charles Francis Hall. Juniata's second-in-command was George W. De Long, a 28-year-old graduate of the United States Naval Academy, making his first visit to the Arctic. Ice conditions prevented Juniata from advancing beyond Upernavik; De Long volunteered to take the ship's tender, a small steamer named the Little Juniata, in the hope of finding survivors at Cape York, a further 400 nautical miles (740 km) north.The attempt failed; Little Juniata faced extreme weather conditions, and was forced to retreat a few miles from Cape York. De Long returned to Juniata in mid-August, having found no trace of the Polaris crew—who had meanwhile been rescued by the Scottish whaler SS Ravenscraig—but the experience had profoundly affected his outlook. Having earlier described the Greenland coast in a letter to his wife Emma as \\"a dreary land of desolation ... I hope I may never find myself cast away in such a perfectly God-forsaken place\\", he returned home captivated by the Arctic. Emma wrote: \\"The polar virus was in his blood and would not let him rest\\".The abortive Little Juniata mission brought De Long to public notice, and he saw himself as a possible leader of the next U.S. Arctic expedition. He approached Henry Grinnell, the philanthropic shipping magnate who had funded several previous expeditions. Grinnell was not prepared to offer financial support, instead advising De Long to approach James Gordon Bennett Jr., owner and publisher of the New York Herald and a known sponsor of bold schemes. De Long met Bennett in New York early in 1874; the newspaperman was impressed by De Long, and assured him that his Arctic ambitions would have the enthusiastic support of the Herald. In the meantime De Long had applied to the Navy Department for an Arctic command, a request that he was informed would \\"receive due attention\\". The answer to this question is:","output":"George W. De Long"},{"instruction":"Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The popularity of lip pencils and crayons is soaring, I suspect it’s because they’re just so easy to use. I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: The area will hold up to 230 vehicles - in effect a two-and-a-half mile queue. Mrs May said 8,000 migrant attempts to cross the Channel to the UK were foiled between 21 June and 11 July, when ferry strikes in France exacerbated problems. Transport bosses said migrant numbers in Calais had risen from 600 in January to 5,000 - and that figure was growing. Mrs May told the Commons hauliers had been subjected to \\"repeated attempts by illegal migrants who attempt to stow themselves away in their vehicles\\". The new zone should provide protection for lorries and their drivers by \\"removing them from the open road where they can become targets for migrants\\", said Mrs May. She said the security zone should \\"transform protection\\" for hauliers. Her announcement came as transport bosses appeared before the Home Affairs Committee to answer questions about the crisis. Kent Police Chief Constable Alan Pughsley told MPs there had been a \\"significant increase\\" in the number of migrants found hiding in vehicles in the UK over the past month. He said: Mr Pughsley said he believed strike action by French ferry workers during that time was a \\"contributing factor\\" to the numbers because it meant \\"easier access\\" for people to trains or lorries. John Keefe, director of public affairs at Eurotunnel, said the 5,000 figure had grown from an estimated 600 migrants in January, and the rise was \\"continuing apace\\". \\"We have never seen numbers like this before and we have not in the past seen the degree of organisation that goes with the numbers either,\\" he said. He said a secure zone would not solve the issue, adding: \\"As soon as you remove an opportunity, the organised criminals who are managing the migrant attacks are moving to the next opportunity - to the next weak spot.\\" Road Haulage Association chief executive Richard Burnett said the situation was \\"out of control\\" and criticised the fact the secure zone would not be in place until the autumn. \\"This isn't fast enough. We've got drivers being threatened with bars and knives. We've had an example of a driver being threatened with a gun,\\" he said. \\"We've got a problem right now. This is unprecedented and it's escalating. We need action now.\\" The \\"write-off\\" of products due to contamination by migrants entering vehicles could be £1bn a year, he said, adding: \\"There are full loads that are being destroyed.\\" Last week a migrant from Eritrea died attempting to board a freight shuttle headed to Britain. The death came days after about 150 migrants tried to storm the Channel Tunnel terminal in France. The strike by French ferry workers at the end of last month forced the suspension of Channel Tunnel services. It closed the Port of Calais and resulted in thousands of lorry drivers being stuck on the roads into Calais. This led hundreds of migrants to try to board UK-bound lorries. Mrs May said British and French authorities had been working together for months to improve security at Calais. Some £12m will spent on work to reinforce security in northern French ports, including new fencing and work to improve traffic flow and Border Force controls, which would be completed next month, she said. Other security measures already announced include a £2m upgrade of detection technology, £1m extra for dog searches and new fencing in Calais. UKIP's migration spokesman, Steven Woolfe, said the government was \\"waking up to the crisis\\" but called for more UK border personnel in Calais and said the UK should negotiate a scheme where migrants can be returned immediately to France if they have entered the UK illegally. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Britain's border was the scene of a \\"terrible crisis\\" where lives were being lost and people were being injured. Summary:","output":"There are many cars and trucks going between the UK and France. Some people called migrants want to go to the UK, but they don't have permission. They try to hide in the trucks to get there. The UK government wants to help the truck drivers by making a safe area for them to park so the migrants can't get in. This is a big problem and many people are trying to find ways to fix it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

By Frank Coletta for Daily Mail Australia The Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory is a party divided again today with Member for Daly, Gary Higgins, refusing to attend all meetings, after an alleged homophobic slur against his son by Deputy Chief Minister Dave Tollner. Parliamentary colleagues have confirmed Mr Higgins' stance. He's informed party officials that he does not want to present at future meetings where Mr Tollner be in attendance. According to the NT News, the territory's Deputy Chief Minister is accused of calling Joshua Higgins a 'pillow biter' and 'shirt lifter'. Scroll down for video Three of the party's indigenous members  quit the party, pushing Mr","output":"Tollner's leadership into further turmoil. Tensions have risen between various factions of the Country Liberal Party as they grapple with the fallout from this scandal. Gary Higgins' decision to boycott all meetings where Tollner is present highlights the deep-rooted animosity and mistrust within the party that threatens to undermine its overall unity and effectiveness. The situation is further complicated by the fact that three indigenous members, who contributed significantly to the party's diversity and representation, have chosen to quit the party in the wake of this controversy. Their resignation has not only created a significant vacuum in the party's leadership but also raised questions about the party's commitment to inclusivity and upholding the values it claims to represent. In the light of these developments, it is clear that the Country Liberal Party must take immediate steps to address this crisis and repair the damage caused by the alleged homophobic remarks of the Deputy Chief Minister. The party leadership could consider initiating mediation between Mr. Higgins and Mr. Tollner in an attempt to resolve the dispute and heal the rift within the party. Furthermore, party officials should seriously consider implementing a code of conduct or sensitivity training for all party members in order to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future. Moving forward, the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory must also focus on restoring the trust of its constituents and proving that it remains committed to representing a diverse range of interests and viewpoints. This can be achieved through transparent and open communication with the public, combined with a demonstrated effort to promote diversity within the party's ranks. In conclusion, the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory is currently dealing with a significant challenge as a result of the alleged homophobic remarks made by the Deputy Chief Minister, Dave Tollner. This incident has caused deep divisions within the party and led to the resignation of several members, including Joshua Higgins' father, Member for Daly, Gary Higgins. In order to regain the trust of its members and the wider public, the party must take decisive action to address this scandal, promote diversity and foster an inclusive environment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They are observing the speed of the particles in the gases to see how fast they are moving. Gas A has particles moving very quickly, but Gas B has particles that are hardly moving at all.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which gas is at a lower temperature?  Hint: We discussed earlier some basic principles about the behavior of gases called the kinetic-molecular theory. Among other things, this theory suggests that gas molecules are in constant motion, and the average speed of the individual gas particles is dependent upon temperature – the higher the temperature, the faster the molecules move. It is not just gas particles that are in constant motion. The molecules and ions that make up liquids and solutions are also continually moving in nearly random directions. As a result, molecules and ions in a solution will collide with one another fairly frequently. As with gases, a temperature increase will produce an increase in the average particle speed.","output":"Based on the information provided and the hint about the kinetic-molecular theory, we can determine that gas with particles moving more slowly is at a lower temperature. In this case, that would be Gas B. The kinetic-molecular theory states that gas molecules are constantly in motion, and the speed of the individual gas particles depends on the temperature. A higher temperature corresponds to faster molecule movement, while a lower temperature results in slower molecule movement. In the given scenario, Gas A has particles that are moving very quickly, which indicates that it is at a higher temperature. On the other hand, Gas B has particles that are hardly moving, which suggests that it is at a lower temperature. This principle can also be applied to liquids and solutions, where a temperature increase leads to an increase in the average particle speed. Understanding the relationship between temperature and particle speed is crucial in many scientific applications, including heat transfer, chemical reactions, and even weather patterns. Scientists use the kinetic-molecular theory and its related principles to study and predict the behavior of various substances and phenomena under different temperature conditions. In conclusion, Gas B is at a lower temperature in comparison to Gas A, as it has particles that are hardly moving at all. This observation is consistent with the kinetic-molecular theory, which posits that the average speed of gas particles directly correlates with temperature."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: During the game, three Bears players fell to injury; Bears rookie Gabe Carimi was lost for the season with a knee injury, receiver Earl Bennett was lost for a few weeks, and safety Major Wright sustained a head injury after colliding with Saints tight end Jimmy Graham. The Bears were only able to muster one takeaway by cornerback Charles Tillman, who stripped the ball from Mark Ingram and recovered at the Bears 9-yard line. Saints quarterback Drew Brees' 79-yard touchdown pass to Devery Henderson was the longest that the Bears allowed since 2008 against the Vikings. The Bears had also been able to convert only 2 of 12 third down attempts, compared to New Orleans, who converted 8 of 17. In 2012, the Bears were considered as one of the possible targets of the Saints bounty program because of the injuries to Carimi and Wright, and Jay Cutler was sacked 6 times, and was kicked in the throat.

Please answer this question: when was hong kong given back to china?","output":"Hong Kong, a region with an intriguing and complex history, was handed back to China on July 1, 1997. This significant event marked the end of British colonial rule that had lasted for over 150 years and signaled the beginning of Hong Kong's reunification with mainland China. The roots of Hong Kong's colonization can be traced back to the First Opium War, which occurred between 1839 and 1842. This conflict, mainly due to the dispute over British trade and China's sovereignty, ended with the signing of the Treaty of Nanking in 1842. The treaty saw China ceding the island of Hong Kong to the United Kingdom in perpetuity. Later, following the Second Opium War, the Kowloon Peninsula was ceded to Britain via the Convention of Peking in 1860. Lastly, in 1898, the British and Chinese governments signed the Second Convention of Peking, granting Britain a 99-year lease of the New Territories, comprising areas north of Kowloon Peninsula and various surrounding islands. Over the years, as Hong Kong experienced significant growth and underwent rapid development, it emerged as a global financial and trade hub. Under British rule, the region had thrived on the principles of free market capitalism, rule of law, and limited government interference. However, the expiration of the 99-year lease in 1997 posed a challenge for the British administration. Recognizing that Hong Kong's New Territories were pivotal to the region's prosperity, both in economic and geographical terms, the British government entered into negotiations with China regarding the future of Hong Kong. In 1984, the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed, which stipulated that Hong Kong would be returned to China on July 1, 1997. The declaration also introduced the concept of \\"One Country, Two Systems,\\" allowing Hong Kong to retain its capitalist economy, legal framework, and political structure for 50 years after the handover. To facilitate this arrangement, the Hong Kong Basic Law was drafted, serving as a mini-constitution for the region, effective from the handover date. Thus, on July 1, 1997, amidst a grand transfer ceremony, attended by international dignitaries such as China's President Jiang Zemin and Britain's Prince Charles, Hong Kong officially transitioned from British rule to Chinese sovereignty and became the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How to gift a vehicle  Verify ownership.  This sounds obvious, but the first step before you can give away a vehicle is to make sure that you are the legal owner. To do that, you must have the title. Answer:","output":"The title is a certificate that you should have received from the dealer, probably after you paid off all the loans. The title will name the rightful owner or owners of the vehicle.  Once you have confirmed that you possess the title and are the legal owner of the vehicle, you can proceed with gifting it to someone else. Follow these steps to complete the process: 1. Transfer the title: To gift the vehicle, you will need to transfer the title to the recipient. This process typically involves completing a title transfer form, which is available at your local DMV or vehicle registration office. Fill out the required information, including the vehicle's VIN, your personal information, and the recipient's information. Both you and the recipient must sign the form. If there are multiple owners listed on the title, all owners must sign the transfer form. 2. Remove the license plates: You will need to remove the license plates from the vehicle before giving it away. Typically, you will keep the plates and surrender them to your local DMV or motor vehicle agency. The recipient will need to obtain new plates for the vehicle when they register it under their name. In some cases, the license plates may be transferable, depending on your state's specific regulations. 3. Complete a bill of sale (if required): Some states require a bill of sale as part of the vehicle transfer process. The bill of sale typically includes information about the car, such as the make, model, year, and odometer reading. It also lists the names and addresses of both the buyer and seller (in this case, the recipient and you). Finally, it describes any terms of the sale or gift, and both parties must sign it. Check with your state's DMV website to see if a bill of sale is necessary. 4. Report the gift to your state's motor vehicle agency: Depending on your state, you may need to report the gift to the appropriate agency. This typically involves completing a gift declaration form with the vehicle's information, your information, and the recipient's information. Both parties must sign the declaration. 5. Provide the recipient with all appropriate paperwork: Once the title transfer form, bill of sale (if required), and gift declaration (if required) are completed and signed, provide the original documents to the recipient. Make sure to keep copies of all documents for your records. 6. The recipient registers the vehicle: The final step is for the recipient to take all of the completed paperwork to their local DMV or motor vehicle agency to register the vehicle under their name. They will need to pay any applicable registration fees and obtain new license plates if the plates were not transferable. By following these steps, you can successfully gift a vehicle and ensure that the new owner has the proper documentation to register and operate the vehicle legally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

PUBLISHED:. 08:30 EST, 30 April 2013. |. UPDATED:. 10:15 EST, 30 April 2013. It seems there is only one thing more irritating than the rotund opera singer from the Go Compare TV commercials – any attempt to do away with him. Two commercials where the character was attacked drew more complaints than any other to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) last year. The Italian character, Gio Compario, created by Welsh singer Wynne Evans, was designed to be deliberately annoying as he repeatedly blasted out the company jingle. Scroll down for videos. An ad showing Go Compare's opera-singing character Gio Compario being kicked in the stomach by Stuart Pearce generated over 1,000 complaints. Opera singer Gio Compario lies injured on the ground. Viewers complained the ad was potentially harmful to children. Stuart Pearce as he appears in the ad. Unsurprisingly, the price comparison website thought the nation would welcome a series of creative and funny efforts to wipe him off our TV screens. However, it appears many were upset by the dastardly comic book methods they came up with. The first commercial featured former England left back, Stuart Pearce, who is famous for his hefty left foot, aiming a football at the annoying Gio. More than 1,000 people complained that kicking a football into the singer’s stomach was likely to set a bad example to children. The ASA disagreed, insisting most people would understand it was light-hearted and comical. The second commercial saw Sue Barker, the BBC sports presenter and former tennis player, firing a rocket launcher at the character in a bid to kill him off. This time there were 797 complaints from people who were unhappy at the suggested violence. Again the ASA backed the company, saying the images were clearly meant to be a joke, while Gio was unharmed. The two commercials feature at the. top of a list of the ten most complained about advertisements of 2012 in. the watchdog’s annual report published today. In. third place was a more serious advertisement by Channel 4 for its. controversial series, My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, which was deemed to have. sexualised a teenage girl. The poster showed the 15-year-old. blonde, who was heavily made up, spilling out of a low cut top that. revealed her breasts and cleavage. The. broadcaster was also criticised over a second poster of a 10-year-old. boy with an aggressive expression which was deemed to have stereotyped. youngsters from the traveller community. One commercial saw Sue Barker, the BBC sports presenter and former tennis player, firing a rocket launcher at the Go Compare character in a bid to kill him off. The watchdog’s annual report reveals that it rejected the vast majority of the 31,298 complaints received about 18,990 ads last year. Among those to be cleared were images of a naked rambler character in a TV ad for Richmond ham, which provoked complaints from more than 300 viewers that it was unsuitable to be seen by children. Asda came under fire last Christmas for a commercial that suggested the job of preparing for the festivities was essentially woman’s work. Women complained it promoted sexist stereotypes while men, including Fathers for Justice, were unhappy that it failed to recognise the value of dads. However, the ASA sided with the supermarket which produced research showing that mums really do carry the burden of organising Christmas. The organisation received more than 300 complaints about advertisements on the YouTube channel of the Paddy Power betting firm, which poked fun at transsexuals. It could not make a ruling as the firm is based in Ireland, however it did censure the firm over a similar commercial that appeared on British TV. Surprisingly, the St John’s Ambulance was responsible for one of the most controversial advertisements of the year. Its TV ad showed a man and his family coping with his diagnosis, treatment and eventual recovery from cancer, only for him to die by choking to death on a piece of food. More than 144 complained, however the ASA ruled the strong storyline was justified because it carried an important message that relatively simple first aid techniques can prevent a tragedy. Other commercials in the top ten, included a Morrisons ad where a dog was apparently being fed Christmas pudding, which might be harmful, and a Kellogg’s cereal ad which some thought was distressing because it showed a man being attacked by a snake. The ASA partly upheld complaints about a TV ad for the Kayak Software Corporation which showed a man receiving brain surgery. Some viewers thought the theme was distressing. The watchdog’s work led to just 3,700 ads being changed or withdrawn last year. Its chairman, Lord Smith, the former Labour Culture Secretary, said: ‘We want to make sure that consumers aren’t being misled, misinformed, harmed or offended. ‘They need to be able to make proper, informed choices about what products and services are available to them. And we want to make sure that there is a fair comparison between advertisers, so that responsible marketing isn’t being under-cut by the irresponsible.’ 1.

Channel 4's Big Fat Gypsy Wedding (373 complaints, upheld in part)Poster sexualised girl of 15; poster showed aggressive young boy, stereotyped travellers. A poster advertising the forthcoming season of Channel 4's Big Fat Gypsy Wedding series generated 373 complaints due to the sexualised image of a 15-year-old girl. 4. Kerry Foods Richmond Ham, (371 complaints, upheld in part)Naked. rambler viewed as upsetting for children. Criticism of nudity rejected. Claim that meat was ‘Britain’s only ham’ was misleading. A naked rambler in a Kerry Foods ad for Richmond Ham was criticised for potentially upsetting children. 5. Paddy Power (Transsexual theme, 311 complaints, out of remit)Commercial on YouTube channel made fun of transsexuals. No ruling as company registered in Ireland. A Paddy Power ad with a transsexual theme angered viewers, who lodged over 300 complaints, but no ruling was made as the company is registered in Ireland. 6. Kellogg’s Crunchy Nut cereal (234 complaints, not upheld)Man attacked by snake as he tried to capture it in kitchen. A Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal ad generated 234 complaints by people who were alarmed by the sight of a snake attack on a man in his kitchen. 7. Morrisons (234 complaints, not upheld)Dog apparently being fed Christmas pudding, which could be harmful. A dog apparently being fed Christmas pudding in a Morrisons ad caused concern among animal lovers. 8. ASDA (620 complaints, not upheld)Mum seen doing all the hard work to prepare for Christmas. An Asda ad in which a mother is seen doing all the hard work to prepare for Christmas was deemed offensive by viewers. 9.

Given the question \\"What is the relationship between the two speakers?\\" and the answer \\"They are strangers.\\", write a conversation that might have happened. Answer:","output":"Step 1: Introduce the two speakers For a conversation between two strangers, it is important to create a scenario where they have a reason to engage in conversation. A common setting for this interaction could be a public place, such as a bus stop or a coffee shop.  Step 2: Initiate the conversation One of the speakers will need to initiate the conversation by asking a question or making an observation about the surroundings. The other speaker should respond in a manner that suggests they are open to conversation, despite being strangers. Step 3: Exchange basic information In order to demonstrate that the two speakers are strangers, they should briefly exchange some basic personal information. This should be kept minimal, as strangers typically divulge little about themselves. Step 4: Display informal politeness and curiosity Since the speakers are strangers, they should exhibit a level of politeness in their conversation. The tone should remain casual and any inquiries about each other should remain surface-level. Step 5: End the conversation The conversation should come to a natural close, ensuring that it remains clear that the two speakers were strangers when they first started talking. It's important to maintain the sense that they have just met and maintain their stranger status. Based on these considerations, here is a sample conversation: Speaker 1: \\"Excuse me, do you know when the next bus is supposed to arrive?\\" Speaker 2: \\"I think it should be here in about 5 minutes.

Write the answer: At which university did British spies Burgess, Blunt, Maclean and Philby meet?","output":"British spies Guy Burgess, Anthony Blunt, Donald Maclean, and Kim Philby, collectively known as the \\"Cambridge Five,\\" met at the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, England. The University, founded in 1209 and boasting a rich history of academic excellence, unknowingly became the breeding ground for some of the most notorious double agents of the 20th century. The Cambridge Five were recruited by Soviet intelligence during the 1930s while they were studying at the University of Cambridge. The University had a strong intellectual tradition, with many leftist groups and associations active on its premises. This created a milieu in which radical and progressive ideas could take root among the students, presenting Soviet intelligence with an opportunity to seek potential recruits who were sympathetic to the communist cause. Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, and Kim Philby studied at Trinity College, one of the largest and most renowned of the colleges at the University of Cambridge. Meanwhile, Anthony Blunt pursued his education at the same university but attended Trinity Hall College. These young men developed ties with the British establishment, becoming part of the bureaucratic machinery that made critical decisions during and after World War II. It is important to note the different years of enrollment at the University of Cambridge for each member of the Cambridge Five. Burgess began his studies in 1930, Philby in 1932, Blunt in 1931, and Maclean in 1934. Despite these differences in their enrollment years, they all shared left-leaning political ideations and intellectual curiosity which ultimately led to them forging connections during their time at the University. While it is not known exactly when and under which circumstances they all met, it is apparent that their association at the University of Cambridge was instrumental in the formation of this notorious spy ring. Throughout their careers, the Cambridge Five provided valuable information to the Soviet Union, betraying the British intelligence service MI5, MI6, and the Foreign Office. Their actions allowed the Soviet Union to stay informed on important Anglo-American strategies and secrets, significantly impacting the course of global events during the early stages of the Cold War. In conclusion, the University of Cambridge was the pivotal meeting place for the British spies Burgess, Blunt, Maclean, and Philby. The nurturing environment of intellectual and political exploration at one of the world's most prestigious educational institutions allowed these young men to forge strong relationships and align their ideals with the Soviet cause. This ultimately led to the creation of one of the most infamous spy rings in history, the Cambridge Five, whose actions had a profound impact on international relations during their time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: When Darrell Issa goes fishing Darrell Issa is about to reach a regrettable milestone. The California Republican is one summons away from issuing his 100th subpoena since becoming chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform committee in 2011 — all of them without a committee vote and the vast majority without the concurrence of the committee’s ranking Democrat. Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation’s capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000. The “unilateral subpoenas,” as they are known, are a departure from the way the committee has conducted its investigations for decades and an echo of the late Clinton years, when conspiracy-minded Chairman Dan Burton fired off more than 1,000 subpoenas (including one to the wrong man because of mistaken identity) and established his investigative bona fides by shooting a melon to reenact the death of Clinton friend Vince Foster. The careless use of the subpoena — the power to compel a witness’s appearance or the production of documents — has discredited Issa’s chairmanship by politicizing his probes from the start. His unilateral style has also been a leading contributor to the overall toxicity in politics by turning his committee into a forum for partisan clashes over Benghazi, Libya, the Internal Revenue Service and Eric Holder’s Justice Department. The latest showdown will come Wednesday: Senior White House official David Simas has been ordered by Issa, under a unilateral subpoena, to testify about political activities Issa alleged are illegal. In recent weeks, Issa has issued two unilateral subpoenas to compel the testimony of Secretary of State John F. Kerry over Benghazi, and another subpoena to force the testimony of the IRS commissioner (even though the official had offered to testify voluntarily.) This is not what the oversight committee was supposed to be. Though it has long bestowed unilateral subpoena power on the chairman, the committee didn’t issue a single unilateral subpoena from the 1950s until the mid-1990s, according to Phil Schiliro, who served as the committee’s Democratic staff director for a decade beginning in 1997. In the eight years after Burton’s chairmanship, virtually all of the 78 subpoenas issued (under Republican Chairman Tom Davis and Democratic Chairmen Henry Waxman and Edolphus Towns) were done either with the minority’s consent or with a committee vote. Davis and Waxman managed to cooperate even on highly charged matters such as the Jack Abramoff and Pat Tillman investigations. “Henry and I had an exceptional relationship,” Davis told me. “It’s the way it ought to work.” Schiliro said 43 of Waxman’s 46 subpoenas were issued with Davis’s consent, and the other three were put to a vote. The act of justifying a subpoena to the committee “forces collaboration,” he said, and “goes to whether there is a legitimate investigation or not.” Issa’s deputy staff director, Frederick Hill, said Democrats as well as Republicans have used unilateral subpoenas. Hill also said that Issa, unlike his immediate predecessor Towns, consults with the minority before each subpoena. Without the minority’s signoff and without even a public debate on the merits of a subpoena, the unilateral subpoena is a way to float allegations in lieu of investigative spade work. This generates complaints about “fishing expeditions” from those who receive the subpoenas — and counter accusations of “cover-ups” when an administration resists. Issa’s Benghazi probe has been typical of this approach. He used his subpoena with a heavy hand: He ordered Ambassador Thomas Pickering, who led an administration probe into the Benghazi attacks, to submit to a private interview, even though Pickering had volunteered to testify publicly. Issa coupled that with unfounded allegations, declaring his “suspicions” that then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told the Pentagon to “stand down” rather than help Americans in Benghazi. Likewise, Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) , vying to succeed Issa as chairman next year, said he found it “disgusting” that a special operations team was “told to stand down” rather than assist in Benghazi. But declassified testimony released last week by the House Armed Services Committee disproved such allegations. Military officials up and down the chain of command testified — voluntarily — that they received rapid approval to mobilize assets during the attack and that two quick-reaction teams had been alerted for deployment. The head of a four-man team in Tripoli that was allegedly told to stand down testified that he received no such order and that his orders to remain in Tripoli rather than fly to Benghazi were “instrumental” in saving the life of a wounded American evacuated from Benghazi. Armed Services Chairman Howard “Buck” McKeon (R-Calif.), whose committee conducted a more responsible Benghazi investigation than Issa’s, says he’s “pretty well been satisfied that . . . we probably couldn’t have done more than we did.” The testimony should satisfy Issa too — if his real purpose is to answer questions and not to issue subpoenas.

Bolile neurodegenerative reprezintă una dintre principalele cauze pentru handicap și dependență la persoanele în vârstă și se preconizează că numărul persoanelor care suferă de demență s-ar putea dubla până în 2020. Translate this to English?","output":"Neurodegenerative diseases represent one of the main causes of disability and dependence in elderly individuals, and it is predicted that the number of people suffering from dementia could double by 2020.  Neurodegenerative diseases are a group of disorders characterized by the gradual and progressive loss of neurons in the brain, which results in impairments in cognitive, motor, and sensory functions. These diseases can have a severe impact on the quality of life of the affected individuals, their families, and healthcare systems. Some of the most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The exact cause of these diseases is still not fully understood, but several factors have been identified, including genetic predispositions, environmental factors, and lifestyle choices. Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Common symptoms include memory loss, confusion, disorientation, and difficulties in carrying out daily tasks. Parkinson's disease is primarily a movement disorder that involves progressive degeneration of the part of the brain that controls movement. The most common symptoms are tremors, muscle stiffness, and slowness of movement. It can also lead to cognitive and psychological problems. Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. The immune system attacks the protective coating of the nerves, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, muscle weakness, and problems with coordination and balance. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a rapidly progressive neurological disease that involves the degeneration of nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscles. People with ALS may experience muscle weakness, slurred speech, and difficulty swallowing and breathing. The increasing prevalence of these diseases has significant implications for healthcare systems, governments, and societies worldwide. The need for research to develop new treatments and potentially prevent these diseases is urgent, as the global population continues to age, and the number of people affected by neurodegenerative diseases is expected to rise dramatically. As the statement mentions, it is anticipated that the number of people living with dementia could double by 2020, highlighting the importance of addressing this growing issue. Although there is no cure for most neurodegenerative diseases, early diagnosis and interventions can help improve the quality of life of those affected and potentially slow the progression of the disease. This highlights the need for public health initiatives to support early detection, improve patient care, and invest in research and development to find new treatments and potential future solutions for these debilitating conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Q: What are are segmented invertebrates in phylum annelida called?    Choices:  - flatworms  - fungi  - corals  - annelids  A: The answer is:","output":"Annelids Segmented invertebrates found in the phylum Annelida are called annelids. To provide a comprehensive understanding of annelids, let's delve into their characteristics, classification, and some examples. Characteristics of Annelids: 1. Body segmentation: Annelids exhibit metamerism, which is the division of their body into multiple, similar segments (called metameres) that are lined up in a linear fashion. This segmentation provides flexibility and improved locomotion. Each segment has a coelom, an internal body cavity filled with fluid. 2. Bilateral symmetry: These organisms display bilateral symmetry, meaning that their body can be divided into two equal and identical halves through a vertical plane. 3. Muscular system: Annelids possess a well-developed muscular system, consisting of both longitudinal and circular muscles. These muscle layers help in contracting and expanding the body segments, allowing for efficient movement. 4. Nervous system: Annelids have a central nervous system that consists of a brain (cerebral ganglia) and a ventral nerve cord running along the length of the body. 5. Body covering: The outer body surface of annelids is covered with moist, permeable skin, which facilitates gas exchange and sometimes even bears external structures like bristles, known as chaetae or setae. 6. Reproduction: Annelids can reproduce both asexually through regeneration and sexually through gamete production. Most annelids are hermaphroditic, meaning that one organism possesses both male and female reproductive organs. Classification of Annelids: The phylum Annelida is subdivided into three main classes: Polychaeta, Oligochaeta, and Hirudinea. 1. Polychaeta: This class includes marine worms, commonly known as bristle worms. Polychaetes have a well-developed head region with sensory organs and frequent parapodia (fleshy, lateral extensions) on each body segment, which bear chaetae.    Examples: Nereis (clam worm), Arenicola (lugworm), Aphrodite (sea mouse), and Sabella (feather-duster worm). 2. Oligochaeta: This class consists of earthworms and some freshwater worms. Oligochaetes lack well-developed head structures and parapodia. Their chaetae are small and simple, and they mostly live in burrows within soil or sediments.    Examples: Lumbricus terrestris (common earthworm), Tubifex (sludge worm), and Eisenia fetida (red wiggler). 3. Hirudinea: Leeches belong to this class. They have a flattened body, no chaetae, and typically possess suckers on both anterior (mouth) and posterior (ventral) ends, which they use to attach to their hosts during blood-feeding.    Examples: Hirudo medicinalis (medicinal leech) and Haemopis (horse leech). In conclusion, the segmented invertebrates in phylum Annelida are called annelids. They exhibit distinct characteristics such as body segmentation, bilateral symmetry, well-developed muscular and nervous systems, and moist skin covering. Annelids can be further classified into polychaetes, oligochaetes, and hirudineans, each with unique morphological features and preferred habitats."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Work activities and tasks - these relate to the specific actions and assignments carried out in the process of program delivery. 3. Program delivery - this involves successfully executing a plan, project, or initiative according to its intended purpose. Based on these components, the premise implies that there is an innate tendency for work activities and tasks to naturally group together, leading to the efficient execution of a program. Now, let's consider the hypothesis: 1. Work activities - this overlaps with the premise, referring to actions and assignments carried out in the process of program delivery. 2. Administrative and management tasks - these are specific types of work activities that involve organizing, coordinating, and overseeing resources, processes, and people to achieve program delivery goals. Connecting the premise with the hypothesis, we can infer that if work activities naturally aggregate for program delivery, and if administrative and management tasks are types of work activities, then including these tasks within the natural aggregation supports the efficient execution of a program. To further delve into this relationship, we must examine the roles of administrative and management tasks in program delivery. Administrative tasks usually involve activities like record-keeping, documentation, scheduling, communication, and procurement. These are essential in maintaining the structure and organization that guides a program towards its objectives. Management tasks, on the other hand, involve decision-making, goal-setting, resource allocation, delegation, team coordination, and monitoring performance. These tasks are crucial in ensuring that the program stays on track, adapts to any changes, and achieves its intended outcomes. Considering that administrative and management tasks are integral to successful program delivery, it is reasonable to assume that they are part of the natural aggregation of work activities and tasks. Without these tasks, the program would likely lack the necessary structure and direction, leading to inefficiencies and potential failure. In conclusion, if we accept the premise that there is a natural aggregation of work activities and tasks for program delivery, and given the importance of administrative and management tasks in this process, it is indeed valid to infer that the hypothesis, \\"Work activities include administrative and management tasks\\" holds true. Efficient program delivery requires not only the execution of tasks related to the program's core objectives but also the presence of supportive work activities such as administration and management to ensure a well-organized, coordinated, and goal-oriented approach."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The scene continues with the intensified sound of clanging weights, a testament to the strenuous workout the pair of men are undertaking. Sweat beads are dripping off their foreheads, highlighting the effort they're pouring into lifting their respective weights. They're lost in their workout routine, focused only on their desired results. They exhale heavily with each lift, the only sound of life in the otherwise still weight room. The man on the chair is taking his rest, his gaze fixed on his companion struggling with his barbell. Suddenly, the door swings open on its hinges and a third man walks in. His eyes are shining with determination, and his muscular body leaves no doubt of his capabilities. He carries an air of visible confidence. The resonating echo of the door closing behind him snaps the two men to attention from their exercises. The newcomer spots the heavy barbell, and his eyes glimmer at the challenge. It's the kind of weight a professional would handle, and with a glance between the two men, he steps up to the mat. The standing man, his arms now shaking noticeably, sets the bar back down and moves aside. Now, it is the man from the door who is standing on the mat about to jerk the bar. The newcomer then attempts the weight and struggles at first. His arms shake slightly under the pressure, and his breaths become deeper and heavier. However, it's clear that the newcomer is not willing to give up. With an audibly determined grunt, he powers through the resistance and raises the weight in the air. The two men watched with awed expressions as the weight that previously seemed unmovable now levitates under the impressive strength of the newcomer. Yet, with a soft cry of surprise, the bar slips from his grip and clatters back onto the mat, causing the room to shudder. To lighten the mood, the second man steps onto the mat, now clear of the fallen weights. Amused grins appear on the faces of his companions as he begins doing lift lifts in front of them, his muscles flexing with well-practiced ease. However, wanting to add a dash of surprise into his exhibit, the man suddenly leaps up and does a flip mid-air. The feat is met with widened eyes, promptly turning into impressed confirmation. The room is subsumed with hearty laughter, breaking the room's previously intense atmosphere with light-hearted camaraderie. In the end, all three men bond over their shared passion for strength training. This unexpected encounter becomes the starting point of a shared companionship through strenuous workout sessions, heartfelt encouragement in the face of challenges, and an occasional show-off of their amazing physical feats. They continued their workout routines, knowing now that they are not alone in their journey, helping and pushing each other to reach their potential."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person whose relationship with Shostakovich's was tender?  Stalin's death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to Testimony, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich's most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the \\"desk drawer\\" works. During the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as \\"tender\\". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been \\"deeply disappointed\\" in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later. In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics. (His '\\"Theme from the film Pirogov, Opus 76a: Finale\\" was played as the cauldron was lit at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.) In 1959, Shostakovich appeared on stage in Moscow at the end of a concert performance... Answer:","output":"The first name of the person whose relationship with Shostakovich was tender is Galina.

In the middle of a duel with a wronged husband, he manages to reconcile the couple and get them out of his rooms before they discover a more recent conquest hidden behind a door. Meanwhile, Chatellerault, another courtier, has been rejected by the beautiful Roxalanne, whose family opposes the king. Chatellerault returns to find the court laughing at him, and he bullies Bardelys into a bet that he cannot win and marry Roxalanne. His honor at stake, Bardelys travels to Roxalanne's castle, but is wounded en route and is mistaken for a rebel leader. He keeps up the ruse, as Bardelys' womanizing reputation would interfere with his plans. But, falling in love with Roxalanne, he cannot bring himself to marry her under a false name, and plans to return to announce that he's lost the bet. His refusal to pledge his love upsets Roxalanne, who turns him over to the king's guards.

One night after winning a game, Monty and his best friend, the Bulls' catcher, Spike Nolan (John Candy), are hitting on two women at a local bar. When they try to leave with them, they're confronted by two large men who claim they are the women's husbands. Monty and Spike are punched out by the men and a large bar brawl starts. They are later arrested and thrown in jail. Their coach, Charley, tells them that management has decided to kick them off the team. In court, Monty tries to explain the fight to the judge, who is wholly unsympathetic. The photographer that had been following Monty suddenly rises and tells the judge that he represents an unidentified party that will post bail for both Monty and Spike if they plead guilty.J.B. Donaldo (Joe Grifasi) (the same photographer from the courtroom) takes them to New York City with him. At the Manhattan law office of Granville & Baxter, Brewster is told that his recently deceased great-uncle Rupert Horn (Hume Cronyn), whom he has never met, has left him his entire fortune because Monty is his only living blood relative (by way of Monty's grandmother, Rupert's half-sister), but with several conditions.Rupert's last will is on film and features the wheezy and ill-tempered Rupert himself.

Brewster is challenged to either take 1 million upfront (as part of a 'Wimp' clause) or spend 30 million within 30 days to inherit 300 million.

He is not allowed to tell anyone about the deal, and he can only gamble away 5% of the total (1.5 million) and donate 5% to charity. Additionally, he cannot spend the money frivolously or waste it on items that may later become assets. In order to make a well-informed decision about whether to invest in this film proposal, let's analyze a few critical aspects of the movie: 1. Genre and target audience: Brewster's Millions is a comedy film that follows the story of Monty Brewster as he navigates through various challenges in spending the money within the given stipulations. The target audience for this type of movie would likely be people who enjoy lighthearted comedies with elements of drama, adventure, and personal growth. This would likely include both young and adult viewers, making it a potentially broad audience. 2. Cast and crew: The film stars Richard Pryor as Monty Brewster and John Candy as his best friend, Spike Nolan. Both are well-known and talented comedic actors who have the ability to carry the film and appeal to a wide variety of audiences. The movie also has a competent crew, including the director, scriptwriters, and production team, which contributes to the overall quality of the film. 3. Box office potential: Given its popular genre, talented cast, and engaging storylines, Brewster's Millions has the potential to perform well at the box office. Comedy films generally have mass appeal, and this particular movie has a charming and intriguing plot that should keep audiences interested and entertained. 4. Distribution and marketing: The success of a movie also heavily depends on its distribution and marketing strategy. If the film can secure a good distribution deal, it will have greater visibility and reach, resulting in higher ticket sales and revenue. Additionally, a well-planned marketing campaign will create buzz and generate interest among potential viewers, leading to an increase in demand for the movie. 5. Risk vs. reward: As with any investment, there is some level of risk involved. Investing in the film industry can be unpredictable, with some movies unexpectedly becoming huge blockbusters, while others fail to make a mark. It's essential to weigh the potential risks against the potential rewards and decide if the investment aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. To answer the initial question about who has no concept of money, at the beginning of the film, it could be argued that Monty Brewster has a limited understanding of money as he is not wealthy and has never been placed in a position of handling a vast sum. However, throughout the movie, he learns valuable lessons about the value of money, responsibility, and the importance of maintaining relationships. Based on these factors, as an investor, you should carefully consider the genre, target audience, cast, crew, box office potential, distribution, marketing, and overall risk vs. reward before making a decision on whether or not to invest in this film proposal. Reviewing these aspects will give you a clearer picture of the movie's potential success and help you make a well-informed investment decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Plot title: Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (May 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Soren, a young barn owl, lives in the Tyto Forest with his family: his father, Noctus; his mother, Marella; his older brother, Kludd; his younger sister, Eglantine; and Mrs. P, the family's nest maid, a kindly blind snake. Soren enjoys listening to the 'Legends of Ga'Hoole,' which are mythical tales of warrior owls called the Guardians who fight against the Pure Ones. Kludd berates his brother's dreams, having grown tired of listening to the stories. When their father teaches them the first steps to flying, Kludd becomes jealous of Soren's natural branching ability. Later, when practicing branching while their parents are hunting, Kludd pushes Soren off a branch which forces them both to fall to the ground. They are attacked by a Tasmanian devil but are saved, and then kidnapped, by two owls, Jatt and Jutt. Along the way, more owlets are revealed to have been kidnapped. Soren meets Gylfie, a young elf owl who is also kidnapped. At St. Aegolius, the owlets are greeted by Nyra, who says that they will be divided into either soldiers or 'pickers'. When Soren and Gylfie protest, they are sorted as pickers while Kludd, who betrays Soren, is sent to be a soldier. Soren and Gylfie avoid being 'moon-blinked' (a catatonic state induced by sleeping under a full moon), while the others do not know and become moon-blinked. They are forced to 'pick' through owl's pellets, scouring for bits of metal 'flecks', which are being used to build a superweapon. They are spotted by Grimble, a boreal owl, who reveals that he works under the Pure Ones only to keep his family safe and that he isn't really a Pure One at all. He teaches them to fly, but Nyra finds out whilst coming to invite Soren to become a soldier. Kludd decides to stay behind and become a Pure One, despite Soren's pleas for him to come with him. Grimble... My question: Who defeats Grimble in battle? A:","output":"Grimble, the Boreal Owl who had been reluctantly serving the Pure Ones in order to protect his own family, is ultimately defeated in battle by Nyra. Nyra is a formidable owl who is one of the leaders of the Pure Ones, a group of owls seeking to cause disruption and chaos. When Grimble is caught teaching Soren and Gylfie how to fly - counter to the Pure Ones' intentions - he is exposed as a traitor. In hopes of creating a distraction to allow Soren and Gylfie to escape, Grimble enters into a fight with the Pure Ones. For the Boreal Owl, this act is a final opportunity to resist the oppressive force he has been forced to serve. During the ensuing battle, Nyra, who had earlier discovered Grimble's act of treason, confronts and fights him. Despite his bravery and skills, Grimble is overmatched by Nyra. It illustrates the twisted values of the Pure Ones and underscores the high stakes for anyone who seeks to oppose them. It also makes a hero out of Grimble for his courageous act of sacrifice, further deepening the tragedy of his defeat. Thus, the demise of Grimble serves as a turning point in the story, sparking further motivation for Soren and Gylfie in their mission against the Pure Ones."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who did Sam hire to impersonate Gloria? Movie title: Body Double Movie plot: Jake Scully (Craig Wasson) is a struggling actor who has lost his role as a vampire in a low-budget horror movie after his claustrophobia thwarts shooting. After returning home to discover his girlfriend cheating on him, he is left without a place to stay. At a method acting class he meets Sam (Gregg Henry) who closely monitors Scully's revelation of his fears and the childhood cause of his claustrophobia. They go to a bar where Scully is offered a place to stay; Sam's friend has left town temporarily and needs a house-sitter for his ultra-modern home in the Hollywood Hills. During the tour of the house with Scully, Sam is especially ecstatic about one feature: a female neighbor, Gloria Revelle (Deborah Shelton), who erotically dances at a specific time each night. Sam has even set up a telescope which Scully cannot resist using voyeuristically to watch her. One night he sees Gloria being abused by a boyfriend. When she goes shopping the next day, Scully decides to follow her. Gloria makes calls to an unknown person promising to meet them. Scully also notices a disfigured \\"Indian,\\" a man he had noticed watching Gloria a few days prior. Scully follows her to a seaside motel where apparently Gloria has been stood up by the person she was there to meet. On the beach the Indian suddenly snatches her purse. Scully tries to pursue him but in a nearby tunnel his claustrophobia restrains him and Gloria walks him out of it. They begin to impulsively and passionately kiss before she retreats. That night Scully is again watching through the telescope when the Indian returns. The man is seen breaking into Gloria's home. Scully races to save her but is attacked by Gloria's vicious dog. Gloria is brutally murdered by the Indian with a huge handheld drill.     Chemosphere, the ultramodern house used in Body Double Scully is then left to alert the police, who assume it was simply a fumbled robbery. Detective McLean (Guy Boyd), however, becomes suspicious of him after finding a pair of Gloria's panties in his pocket. Although... A:","output":"No I can't"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral - A fossil is formed -   Question: suppose the climate warms happens, how will it affect MORE fossils forming.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"Climate change, specifically global warming, can have a significant impact on the formation of fossils. By increasing the planet's average temperature, various environmental alterations can occur, affecting the processes that lead to fossilization. Therefore, the answer is neither A, B, or C because global warming could both increase and decrease fossil formation in certain areas, depending on several factors. Here is a more detailed explanation: 1. Impacts on animal and plant population: Warmer climates might alter the distribution of flora and fauna in different ecosystems. In some cases, a higher concentration of organisms in specific areas may increase the chances of fossil formation. However, for sensitive species that cannot adapt to new environmental conditions, population decline can lead to reduced fossil generation. 2. Changes in deposition environments: Climate change can bring about alterations in sea levels, precipitation patterns, and sedimentation rates. If sea levels rise, there might be more opportunities for organisms to be preserved in marine sediments, potentially boosting fossil formation. However, the locations and circumstances under which this might occur will not be uniform – in some places, erosional forces could dominate, wiping away any potential fossils. 3. Flood events and rapid burial: The increasing occurrence of extreme weather events could lead to more instances of mass mortality, resulting in the quick burial of numerous organisms. Such rapid entombment can create ideal conditions for fossilization. However, it is essential to recognize that such circumstances might not contribute to a sustained increase in fossils, but pockets of exceptionally preserved specimens in the geological record. 4. Decomposition rates: Warmer temperatures can also affect the rate of decomposition for plant and animal remains. In some cases, higher temperatures might speed up the process, decreasing the likelihood of fossil formation. However, in environments where a combination of factors inhibits decomposition (e.g., low oxygen levels in the sediment), the aforementioned influence might not play as significant a role. 5. Shifts in vegetation: Climate-driven changes in vegetation can impact the preservation potential of organic remains. For instance, forests reducing in size, undergoing transformation, or experiencing species turnover might lead to different rates and types of fossilization in terrestrial environments. In conclusion, the increased rate of global warming can influence fossil formation in numerous ways. The actual impact on the number of fossils created is complex and can vary depending on factors such as population dynamics, sedimentation rates, and environmental changes. Hence, it is challenging to classify the overall impact as more, less, or no effect – instead, the relationship between global warming and fossil formation is both intricate and spatially varied."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. SUBSCRIBE      For decades, Hollywood producer Bob Weinstein appeared to live in the outsize shadow of his older brother, Harvey. Harvey Weinstein was the public face of the studios they co-founded, a fixture on the Oscar circuit and a major player in Democratic political circles. Bob Weinstein, by contrast, seemed to shy away from the glare of fame.      \\"My style is more low-key. Outside of the movie business I tend to be known as the 'quiet brother,' which is fine by me,\\" Bob Weinstein wrote in an essay for Vanity Fair in 2003. \\"It actually works out for the best that only one of us likes the spotlight. There wouldn't physically be enough room in it for both.\\"      But this month, following bombshell reports alleging that Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed and assaulted dozens of women over decades, Bob Weinstein has been forced into the center of a roiling scandal, emerging as a vehement critic of his embattled brother even as he also faces an allegation of sexual misconduct.      Harvey and Bob Weinstein after the red carpet opening of the movie \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" in Los Angeles in November 2011. J.Emilio Flores / Corbis via Getty Images file      Bob Weinstein, 63, blasted Harvey Weinstein, 65, last Thursday as a \\"very sick man\\" and a \\"world class liar\\" whose remorse rings \\"hollow.\\" Just five days later, Variety reported that Amanda Segel, a former executive producer of the sci-fi series \\"The Mist,\\" claimed that Bob Weinstein made repeated romantic overtures to her and would not take no for an answer.      \\"Bob kept referring to me that he wanted to have a friendship,\\" Segel told Variety. \\"He didn't want a friendship. He wanted more than that. My hope is that 'no' is enough from now on.\\"      Bert Fields, a lawyer for Bob Weinstein, denied the allegations.      \\"Variety's story about Bob Weinstein is riddled with false and misleading assertions by Ms. Segel and we have the emails to prove it,\\" he said in part, adding: \\"There is no way in the world that Bob Weinstein is guilty of sexual harassment.\\"      A representative for Harvey Weinstein has said \\"any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.\\"      Both brothers have also come under fresh scrutiny for their brash tactics, which some have called abusive, at their firms, Miramax and The Weinstein Company. The brothers’ behavior is recounted in \\"Down and Dirty Pictures,\\" a 2004 book by veteran entertainment journalist Peter Biskind.      Movie mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg, who condemned Harvey Weinstein following explosive reports in The New York Times and The New Yorker, leveled harsh words this week at Bob Weinstein, saying he had significant \\"issues\\" with him when they worked together in the 1990s.      \\"Bob Weinstein was genuinely abusive with people in my company,\\" Katzenberg, the former chairman of Walt Disney Studios, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. (Disney acquired Miramax in 1993.)      \\"There's the fascinating thing about this,\\" Katzenberg said, apparently referring to the overall scandal. \\"The one person who did reveal himself in an unacceptable way to me was, in fact, Bob.\\" ||||| Now, the alleged misconduct threatens to take down everything they've built. Although Bob Weinstein said he took steps in recent years to distance himself from his disgraced brother, their fates may be intertwined. Some people close to the company say it will be difficult for Bob Weinstein to retain a leadership role in the Weinstein Co. — if it survives at all. And the Weinstein name may be forever tainted, making it difficult for him to start fresh in Hollywood. ||||| The Weinstein Co. exec insists he had no idea about \\"the type of predator that he was\\" and is sickened by Harvey’s seeming lack of remorse. \\"I want him to get the justice that he deserves.\\"      For nearly 30 years, Bob Weinstein has lived in the shadow of his older brother Harvey. While Harvey, 65, was the very public face of Miramax and then The Weinstein Co. from Sundance to Cannes to Hollywood, palling around with stars and schmoozing Oscar voters, Bob, 62, has served on TWC's board and tended to Dimension, their genre label, turning out movies like the Scream and Scary Movie franchises that routinely made more money than all but Harvey's biggest hits.      Now, in the wake of the dozens of allegations charging Harvey with three decades of sexual harassment, abuse and even rape, he is out, fired from the company he co-founded with Bob in 2005. And Bob, thrust into an unaccustomed limelight, is forced to try to pick up the pieces amid the growing chaos. He insists that the company — which is expected to undergo a name change — can survive. But four of his fellow board members have resigned, and his COO David Glasser and other key members of his 150-employee staff have yet to commit to stay with the company. Amid widespread predictions that The Weinstein Co. will be forced to shut down or sell all or parts, Bob maintains, \\"There is a plan to come out on the other side.\\"      But right now, even as he struggles to right the company (of which he and Harvey each own about 20 percent), Bob is also coping with his own sense of shame and betrayal, expressing sympathy for Harvey's victims while also questioning whether he should have done more in the face of Harvey's alleged abusive behavior. Bob, who worked mostly in Los Angeles while Harvey presided over TWC's New York offices, says he's barely spoken to his brother over the past five years. \\"I could not take his cheating, his lying and also his attitude toward everyone,\\" he says. While Bob says he knew his brother was unfaithful to wife Georgina Chapman, he insists he had no idea about \\"the type of predator that he was\\" and is sickened by Harvey's seeming lack of remorse. \\"I have a brother that's indefensible and crazy,\\" says Bob, adding, \\"I want him to get the justice that he deserves.\\"      Amid the chaos and uncertain future at TWC, Bob agreed to a 45-minute phone interview with The Hollywood Reporter. During the talk, he often became emotional when discussing his brother and the company they co-founded. He refused to discuss certain specifics, such as the claim in The New York Times that he and the board were aware of Harvey's settlements with women during Harvey's most recent contract negotiation, or the fate of certain TWC movies, such as the year-end title The Current War. But he opened up on the personal aspect of the scandal and said he believed the Film Academy should expel his \\"sick and depraved\\" brother.      How do you assess what has happened?      I find myself in a waking nightmare. My brother has caused unconscionable suffering. As a father of three girls, I say this with every bone in my body — I am heartbroken for the women that he has harmed. I'm a fighter. For my entire adult life, I fought for the films I want to see the light of day. I have fought for my employees, who have dedicated their lives to achieving the vision of this company that me and my brother founded. But I cannot fight what is indefensible.      The members of the board, including myself, did not know the extent of my brother's actions. I know him on a personal level better than anyone. It's hard to describe how I feel that he took out the emptiness inside of him in so many sick and depraved ways. It's a sickness but not a sickness that is excusable. It's a sickness that's inexcusable. And I, as a brother, understood and was aware as a family member that my brother needed help and that something was wrong.      I was also the object of a lot of his verbal abuse — at one time physical abuse. And I am not looking for one bit of sympathy from anyone. I do not put myself in the category at all of those women that he hurt. But it's a complicated situation when it's your brother doing the abusing to you as well. I saw it and I asked him to get help for many years. And that's the truth. He avoided getting the help. We begged him.      This hurts, but I don't feel an ounce of remorse coming from him, and that kills me, too. When I heard his written, lame excuse … Not an excuse. When I heard his admission of feeling remorse for the victims and then him cavalierly, almost crazily saying he was going to go out and take on the NRA, it was so disturbing to me. It was utter insanity. My daughters all felt sick hearing this because we understood he felt nothing. I don't feel he feels anything to this day. I don't.      One question that is on everybody's mind: He is your brother — how in the world did you not know this was going on?      First of all, let me tell you something that people don't know. For the last five years, I've probably talked to my brother 10 times on any personal level. That's the fracture that's gone on. Since Dimension started, we ran two separate companies. So many of the people that he does business with — actors, actresses — I've never even met and they know it. I wanted to lead a separate existence. So we were leading two separate divisions.      I actually was quite aware that Harvey was philandering with every woman he could meet. I was sick and disgusted by his actions. But that's the extent of what [I knew]. I said, \\"Harvey, you're just cheating. Why do you constantly cheat?\\" I could see it. But I wasn't in the room with him.      For me, I thought he was literally just going out there cheating in a pervasive way. It wasn't like he even had a mistress. It was one after another and that I was aware of. But as far as being in a room and hearing the description in The New York Times? No way. No F-in' way was I aware that that was the type of predator that he was. And the way he convinced people to do things? I thought they were all consensual situations.      I'll tell you what I did know. Harvey was a bully, Harvey was arrogant, he treated people like shit all the time. That I knew. And I had to clean up for so many of his employee messes. People that came in crying to my office: \\"Your brother said this, that and the other.\\" And I'd feel sick about it.      Why did you tolerate his behavior?      Because it didn't rise to a certain level. I would often counsel people and say, \\"You know what, you have a choice here. Leave. Leave, please leave.\\" I don't know why some of them stayed. So I would just try to mend a broken fence. There is no mending this. This is not a broken fence. [But] I will not quit and leave the business that I built, rightfully so, and leave the films and filmmakers that I was involved in.      When you guys were negotiating Harvey's 2015 employment contract …      That I'm not gonna [discuss]. I'm sorry, I'm not gonna be litigated in this article. There is an investigation going on, let that investigation take its course.      Do you think Harvey should be kicked out of the Academy?      Yes, I do. I was gonna actually write [to the Academy]. And I will do it. I am gonna write a note to them saying he definitely should be kicked out of the Academy.      You issued a statement earlier today saying that the company is not for sale despite reports that it could be shut down or its parts sold off. If it's not for sale, what is the plan to salvage this company?      We are thinking about how to do that. We had an employee meeting the other day, all 180 of the employees. And me and David Glasser addressed them all. Talk about emotions cascading. These innocent people are hurt, so many of them not knowing anything about my brother's behavior.      But I was touched because — and I did not know this was coming — they said, \\"We don't want Harvey to have the last word on this company. We want to stay. We believe in the films, we believe in you, Bob, David Glasser, we believe in ourselves. And we definitely don't want to let him win.\\" And that's a part of the human story that nobody is hearing.      I know they're saying, \\"Shut this company down.\\" Well, they didn't shut Fox News down, they didn't shut NBC down. My brother is the one that should pay with everything. And I mean literally — whether it's criminal or otherwise — I will be supportive of all of that. But I don't think the people that are the employees of this company or the company itself should pay.      Harvey was the face of the company. That's what he loves. It's actually part of his whole thing, being famous. This brother is not that brother. This brother made just as much money, ran a successful division, more successful financially than Harvey's. But I'm a different guy and I run it differently and people know it and they know I can be successful and we don't need to do any of the Harvey stuff. And there is a plan. All I'm trying to do right now is go forward, figure out a plan, me and David Glasser and the board members have an idea of what we'd like to do, that we think would be the responsible thing to do for all the critics, rightfully so, with regards to the TWC side and yet for people to keep their jobs. And the pieces of the business that still can be resurrected and continue, we think that they should.      Do you have a new name for the company?      We're coming up with one. And it won't be familial, I promise you that.      Any effort to keep the company going will depend on financial backing. Aren't the finances of this company in trouble?      We have good enough finances, the banks gave us their support today.      What does that mean?      With scandal, sometimes people can just say, \\"We don't want to be associated.\\" They're supporting us. And in terms of surviving, we have enough good product and things on our slate. We are moving quickly, and there are people interested in participating financially on the condition, rightfully so, that Harvey Weinstein is out for good.      But you have people like Lin-Manuel Miranda trying to get In the Heights extricated from the company. You have Disney dropping you guys from producing Artemis Fowl. Apple and Amazon have scrapped big TV projects. Collaborators are turning their backs on you. How do you survive that?      We will, is my answer, and there are a lot of things in process with regards to a lot of those kinds of things that will get resolved in an amicable way and a good financial way. I really don't want to get into the particulars of any one situation. All I can say is that there is a plan to come out on the other side. And also the other side that makes the public rightfully feel happy that what Harvey stood for exists no longer. The public deserves that. The victims deserve that. Everybody deserves that.      Those bankers, they look at my slate and they know that I've made them money for many, many years. And lately I have had a cold hand, there is no two ways about it, on the Dimension side, but I have a fuckin' great slate coming up and they're aware of it. And this is a business where all the sudden you walk into Stephen King's It one day. And things change. It is that kind of business. I have Six Billion Dollar Man, I'm closing a deal on it. I have Paddington 2, Paddington 3 is coming two years later. I'm back in the wheelhouse of what I've done.      And when I'm back on, there is money to be made, there's jobs to be had. Harvey knew how to take credit, win his awards. But for me, there are no Academy Awards. Bob's not going to the Golden Globes or the Oscars unless somebody invites me.      There have been reports that Jay Z might buy Harvey's stake in the company …      I'd love nothing more than that, but as far as I know, that is not a fact.      There are predictions for a raft of civil litigation against the company and against Harvey personally. How can the company withstand that?      That's for lawyers and people like that to go deal with. That's what they do. And things end up getting resolved, they do. My hope is that the community will allow us the time to get it right for those that deserve to continue on. That's all I can say and that's what I'm trying to do. But it's going to take time. I cannot do it in a week.      Has anyone in Hollywood reached out to you with support?      Yes, they have. David Glasser had a meeting with David Hutkin, who is the CFO, and the banks have been supportive. They want to see us succeed and they see that there is a product line of many movies on my side, TV shows that have been done. That they say this company can still be viable. And there have been other people that have been supportive, other companies that are doing business with us, that are sticking by us.      What about the talent agencies? They are going to be key to any company going forward. Have they expressed support?      There have been men and women, actresses, actors, directors, but especially women I would say, who are so properly disgusted with my brother's actions. Their attitude is when there is finally the entire divorce, when there's the plan in place, when there is the separation in place …      I have a reputation that's different than Harvey, obviously, and I work differently than him. And David Glasser is his own man. We have our own status in the industry. And they're saying we will give the two of you a chance. You have to make the separation. [With] my brother having contractual financial rights in this company, the divorce is going to be as speedy as we can make it. It's in process.      But Harvey's going to fight his firing.      Anybody can do what they want to do. I cannot control other people's actions. But he was fired by the board, okay? I was on that board. I fired him. He can fight. It will be a losing fight.      He may be fired but he still maintains his ownership interest in the company, correct?      That is correct and we are going to seek to sever that. It can't be done that quickly. But I am on it 24/7 and so is David Glasser and so is the board of directors that remain and so are the shareholders. This is being dealt with.      Given your relationship with Harvey, there is a contingent out there who believe that you were responsible for the leak of this information, especially the internal HR memo that made it to The New York Times. Is that true?      That's totally untrue. I could take a lie detector test on that. I didn't and, you know, Harvey is suspicious of everybody. People that are liars — lying to his wife, to his children, to everyone — well, they have to turn around and say, \\"Who stabbed me?\\" It's unbelievable that even to this moment he is more concerned with who sold him out. I don't hear concern or contrition for the victims. And I want them to hear that. Harvey has no remorse whatsoever. I have spoken to him two times [since news broke], hoping to hear, \\"Oh, my God, what have I done?\\" I didn't hear that.      What did you hear?      I heard a guy who still was fighting to get back and I was disgusted by it. Do you know how disgusted I am? I divorced my brother five years ago. Literally. And those that know me personally in this company understood how I could not take being around him on any level. And certainly my daughters and my family knew it. I could not take his cheating, his lying and also his attitude toward everyone. I had to divorce myself to survive. Nobody is perfect. I'm not perfect. If I made mistakes, I apologize to everyone for not standing up stronger and sooner. But if you want to take my head and the company's and everybody else's. … If I lose at the end of the day, then I lose it. But I'll fight for what I believe is right. And I'll apologize for my own lack of strength at times.      Do you believe that the 2015 incident with model Ambra Battilana and the NYPD investigation derailed the deal for ITV to acquire the company's TV division?      Again, this is where I draw the line in terms of getting into a specific. I don't want to comment on that kind of specific.      I'll ask a general question then: Do you believe that Harvey's antics hurt the business in the past?      I'm being honest. I don't know what hurt or didn't. I haven't had a relationship with him as a brother for many, many years. But I'm ashamed that he is my brother, to be honest, and I am ashamed that these are his actions. I'm not thinking at this moment about dissecting what may or may not have affected any past situation. I'm so in the here and now and feel sick.      Mira Sorvino came out and told her story [in The New Yorker]. I have been a personal friend of Mira for the last several years. We reconnected when I rented a house in Malibu. Mira, her husband and her kids have come over and spent many hours together with us. [But] she never told me. And now I literally was texting with her, and she said, \\"Are you mad at me?\\" And I said, \\"Mad at you? I'm so proud of you, but I feel sick that you had to hold that kind of thing in.\\"      [Harvey] should never be allowed back, ever. Ever. He lost his rights. He didn't lose his rights to be rehabilitated as a human being. But as far as being in this town again? I mean, give me a break.      What do you think Harvey will do with the rest of his life?

Q:Information:  - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack.  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.  - The United States Maritime Service (USMS) was established in 1938 under the provisions of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936. The mission of the organization is to train people to become officers and crewmembers on merchant ships that form the United States Merchant Marine per Title 46 U.S. Code 51701. Heavily utilized during World War II, the USMS has since been largely dissolved and/or absorbed into other federal departments, but its commissioned officers continue to function as administrators and instructors at the United States Merchant Marine Academy and the several maritime academies.  - The United States Maritime Commission (MARCOM) was an independent executive agency of the U.S. federal government that was created by the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, passed by Congress on June 29, 1936, and replaced the United States Shipping Board which had existed since World War I. It was intended to formulate a merchant shipbuilding program to design and build five hundred modern merchant cargo ships to replace the World War I vintage vessels that comprised the bulk of the United States Merchant Marine, and to administer a subsidy system authorized by the Act to offset the cost differential between building in the U.S. and operating ships under the American flag. It also formed the United States Maritime Service for the training of seagoing ship's officers to man the new fleet.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - USNS Kingsport ( T - AG - 164 ) was built as SS Kingsport Victory , a United States Maritime Commission VC2 - S - AP3 ( Victory ) type cargo ship . During the closing days of World War II the ship was operated by the American Hawaiian Steamship Company under an agreement with the War Shipping Administration . After a period of layup the ship was operated as USAT Kingsport Victory by the Army under bareboat charter effective 8 July 1948 . When Army transports were transferred to the Navy 's Navy 's Military Sea Transportation Service the ship continued as a cargo transport as USNS Kingsport Victory ( T - AK - 239 ) . On 14 November 1961 , after conversion into the first satellite communication ship , the ship was renamed Kingsport , preclassifird as a general auxiliary , and operated as USNS Kingsport ( T - AG - 164 ) . Assigned to duty supporting the U.S. Army Satellite Communications Agency USNS Kingsport was further modified and , in August 1963 while in Lagos harbor , transmitted the first satellite voice call between heads of state when John F. Kennedy and Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar Balewa aboard Kingsport spoke in a two - way call . A demonstration of transmission of oceanographic data was made between a research vessel off Africa via the ship and satellite to Washington . The first air to ship satellite communication took place when Navy aircraft off Virginia established voice communication with Kingsport which was off Morocco . Further satellite communications work took place in the Pacific and Indian Oceans . Kingsport then supported Project Gemini into March 1966 . After conversion from satellite configuration , particularly removal of the large and very visible dome , Kingsport was engaged in acoustic work for the Navy supporting undersea surveillance programs .  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - Vice Admiral Emory Scott Land (January 8, 1879  November 27, 1971) was an officer in the United States Navy, noted for his contributions to naval architecture, particularly in submarine design. Notable assignments included serving as Chief of the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair during the 1930s, and as Chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission during World War II.  - The War Shipping Administration (WSA) was a World War II emergency war agency of the US government, tasked to purchase and operate the civilian shipping tonnage the US needed for fighting the war. Both shipbuilding under the Maritime Commission and ship allocation under the WSA to Army, Navy or civilian needs were closely coordinated though Vice Admiral Emory S. Land who continued as head of the Maritime Commission while also heading the WSA.  - The United States Merchant Marine refers to either United States civilian mariners, or to U.S. civilian and federally owned merchant vessels. Both the civilian mariners, and the merchant vessels, are managed by a combination of the government and private sectors, and engage in commerce or transportation of goods and services in and out of the navigable waters of the United States. The Merchant Marine primarily transports cargo and passengers during peacetime; in times of war, the Merchant Marine can be an auxiliary to the United States Navy, and can be called upon to deliver military personnel and materiel for the military. Merchant Marine officers may also be commissioned as military officers by the Department of Defense. This is commonly achieved by commissioning unlimited tonnage Merchant Marine officers as Strategic Sealift Officers in the Naval Reserves.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the name of the person whose camera got smashed but his photographic film survived the impact?, using the article: American pressmen had been alerted to an upcoming Buddhist demonstration to coincide with Double Seven Day at Chanatareansey Pagoda in the north of Saigon. The nine-man group, which included Arnett, Browne, AP photographer Horst Faas, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer and photographer Joseph Masraf waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhist monks, numbering around 300, filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngo Dinh Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around 20 centimetres (8 in) taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas swinging his arms, reportedly saying \\"Get back, get back, you sons of bitches, or I'll beat the shit out of you!\\" Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a power pole and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face.

Context: Some economists have stated that Reagans policies were an important part of bringing about the third longest peacetime economic expansion in U.S. history.  During the Reagan administration, real GDP growth averaged 3.5%, compared to 2.9% during the preceding eight years.  The annual average unemployment rate declined by 1.7 percentage points, from 7.2% in 1980 to 5.5% in 1988, after it had increased by 1.6 percentage points over the preceding eight years.  Nonfarm employment increased by 16.1 million during Reagans presidency, compared to 15.4 million during the preceding eight years, while manufacturing employment declined by 582,000 after rising 363,000 during the preceding eight years. Reagans administration is the only one not to have raised the minimum wage.  The inflation rate, 13.5% in 1980, fell to 4.1% in 1988, due to the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates (prime rate peaking at 20.5% in August 1981).  The latter contributed to a recession from July 1981 to November 1982 during which unemployment rose to 9.7% and GDP fell by 1.9%. Additionally, income growth slowed for middle- and lower-class (2.4% to 1.8%) and rose for the upper-class (2.2% to 4.83%). Question: Which class income growth rate slowed in 1982 during Reagan economic policies: middle, lower, or upper?

Her 17-year-old brother Mark is a nerdy high school student who plays clarinet in a garage band and shuns girls in order to prepare for college. Dawn's younger sister, 8-year-old Missy, is a spoiled, manipulative little girl who pesters Dawn and dances around the house in a tutu. Their mother is a shrewd woman who always dotes on Missy and sides with her in disputes with Dawn. Their father is a meek, immature, selfish man who sides with Dawn's mother in arguments with Dawn. Mark is the only one in the family who is even remotely friendly or respectful to Dawn and even that isn't saying a whole lot. Dawn's only friend is an effeminate fifth-grade boy named Ralphy, with whom she shares a dilapidated clubhouse in her backyard. At school, Dawn is verbally bullied by literally every student she comes into contact with. She is teased and ridiculed and her locker is covered in graffiti. After her teacher unfairly keeps her after school, she is threatened with rape by a bully named Brandon McCarthy, who also has trouble socializing. At home, Dawn's mother punishes her for calling Missy a lesbian and refusing to be nice to her (the same verbal way that other students at the school call Dawn). Dawn is suspended for three days after she accidentally hits a teacher in the eye with a spitball. She refuses to tell her parents or the school principal about the bullying, aware that it will only lead to worse bullying for herself. Brandon's first attempt to rape Dawn after school fails, but he orders her to meet him again. After she complies, he takes her to an abandoned field. Instead of forcing himself upon her, Brandon starts an earnest conversation with her and kisses her.

Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Constipation is not a glamorous topic, but it’s certainly important, especially in older adults. As anyone who has experienced occasional — or even chronic — constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being. Constipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as: * Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits * Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful * Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia * Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) * Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel * Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation Fortunately, it’s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation. This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia. The trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary. Personally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them. Also, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation. For instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those. In short, if you’re an older adult, or if you’re helping an older... Question: What are some side effects of constipation in the elderly?

In Beijing, the gateway for flights to Pyongyang, Rodman told Reuters he was on another \\"basketball diplomacy tour\\" and would not be discussing the release of Bae. \\"I'm not going to North Korea to discuss freeing Kenneth Bae,\\" Rodman told Reuters in a telephone interview before he left Beijing for Pyongyang. \\"I've come out here to see my friend (Kim) -- and I want to talk about basketball,\\" he added. In May: Rodman asks","output":"Kim Jong Un to release Kenneth Bae Upon his arrival in North Korea, Dennis Rodman was greeted by a group of North Korean officials and a swarm of international journalists. The media continued to question Rodman about his intentions regarding Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American missionary who was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in North Korea after being accused of trying to topple the government. During the first few days of his trip, Rodman stuck to his plan of focusing on basketball diplomacy. He participated in several events and held workshops for North Korean basketball teams, which included an exhibition game played in front of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un, who also happens to be a basketball fan. Despite his earlier statements, it seemed that Rodman could not shake off the issue of Kenneth Bae. He was repeatedly asked by journalists if he would use his influence and close relationship with Kim Jong Un to seek Bae's release. Additionally, Bae's family and supporters in the United States had expressed their hope that Rodman would raise the issue during his visit. In response to the mounting pressure from various parties and realizing that he could potentially use his unique position to make a difference, Rodman decided to address the issue in a meeting with Kim Jong Un after the exhibition game. Rodman expressed his concerns about Bae's well-being and imprisonment, emphasizing that releasing Bae would be seen as a significant goodwill gesture by the United States and the international community. Kim Jong Un, seemingly touched by Rodman's concern and having developed a mutual respect for the former basketball star, agreed to consider the release of Bae but needed to consult with his advisors first. Rodman, while cautious, was optimistic about the outcome and promised to continue pushing for Bae's release. Upon returning to the United States, Rodman revealed his efforts to help secure Bae's freedom in an exclusive interview with CNN. While some praised his actions, others criticized him for not having a solid plan or background in diplomacy. Shortly after Rodman's trip, the North Korean government announced that it would release Kenneth Bae on humanitarian grounds. Though they did not directly attribute his release to Rodman's intervention, it was widely speculated that the high-profile visit played a key role in securing Bae's freedom. Rodman's basketball diplomacy visit was seen as controversial by some but ultimately led to Bae's release, opening the door for future diplomatic negotiations between North Korea and the United States. Meanwhile, Rodman continued his efforts to use sports as a means of bridging cultural gaps and fostering understanding between nations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rapid eye movements in sleep and wakefulness      To compare neuronal activity underlying REMs in sleep and wakefulness, we conducted full-night (421±20 min (mean±s.e.m.)) polysomnographic sleep studies with adjacent epochs of wakefulness (n=13 participants), as well as recordings during controlled visual stimulation (n=9 participants) and an eye-movement paradigm (one participant), in 19 neurosurgical patients with intractable epilepsy. Participants were implanted with depth electrodes (Fig. 1a–c) that recorded depth EEG and spiking activity during sleep and wake from 600 units (355 putative single units, 245 multi-unit clusters), as described thoroughly elsewhere20. Stability of unit recordings across several hours was assessed in detail (Supplementary Fig. 1). Recordings also included synchronized scalp EEG, electrooculogram (EOG), electromyogram and continuous video monitoring. Sleep–wake stages were scored following established guidelines21. Sleep architecture and power spectra of scalp EEG were in general agreement with typical findings in healthy young adults.      Figure 1: Data overview and eye movement detection. (a) Set-up for polysomnographic sleep and wake recordings. (b) Illustration of flexible probes used for recording depth EEG (blue: platinum contact) and unit activity (green: microwires). (c) Medial view of depth electrode locations (purple dots) spanning multiple brain regions. (d) REM detection: first row, raw EOG showing two typical REMs in REM sleep. Second row, band-pass filtered (0.1–3 Hz) EOG with thresholds set at mean+2 s.d. (black lines). Third row, detection of epochs crossing the threshold in one EOG channel (green dots). Fourth row, detection is confirmed with opposite polarity in second EOG channel (yellow dot). Fifth row, verification that epoch is free of epileptic spikes in high-pass filtered trace. Sixth row, visual confirmation of REM onset. (e) Occurrence of REMs across vigilance states (mean±s.e.m., n=11/12/13 in REM sleep, wake and Non-Rapid Eye Movement sleep, respectively).

(g) Example of EOGs (top, red/blue), depth EEG (brown) and unit spiking activities in the MTL (black lines) during 20 s of wakefulness. Vertical green lines depict detections of REM onsets.

Full size image (123 KB) Figures/tables index      Next      REMs were detected in EOG traces in a semi-automatic fashion (see Methods section, Fig. 1d–f). REMs were selected for further analysis when at least 20 events were detected for a given subject and sleep stage (n=12 and 11 individuals for wakefulness and REM sleep, respectively). On an average, 3.7±0.8 and 2.6±0.5 REMs per minute were detected in REM sleep and wakefulness, respectively, while detection in NREM sleep was not significantly different from zero (Fig. 1e; P=0.17, Mann–Whitney U-test, n=13 patients), attesting to a low rate of false detections. The relatively low density of REMs in wakefulness likely reflects the experimental setup (overnight recordings in darkness) and EOG measurements that best capture saccades with a large horizontal component (see Supplementary Note for further details).      The morphology of REMs in sleep and wakefulness was highly similar (Fig. 1f), in line with previous studies4, 22. For example, when subtracting the EOG traces of w-REMs and s-REMs, no statistical differences were found (paired t-test, n=11 pairs, α=0.05, False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons).      Modulation of neuronal activity during REMs      We set out to examine if neuronal activity, especially that occurring in MTL regions, including the amygdala, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus (Table 1), is robustly modulated in concert with REMs, and to what extent such activity is reminiscent of visually evoked activity in wakefulness. To this end, we compared neuronal activity during (a) REM sleep (‘s-REMs’), (b) spontaneous REMs in wakefulness (‘w-REMs’) and (c) during a controlled visual stimulation paradigm in which subjects maintained fixation during short (200 ms) presentation of images. Figure 1g depicts representative traces of eye movements along with simultaneously recorded neuronal activity and depth EEG in the MTL. As can be seen, in some cases, REMs were associated with modulations in spiking activity.      Table 1: Bi-phasic single-unit modulation around REMs is more prevalent in the MTL compared with frontal regions. Full table Figures/tables index      We proceeded to quantify the REM-related changes in neuronal activity across the entire data set, and further compared such activities to visually evoked responses to pictures of faces and places (n=133 responsive neurons out of 1,457 overall; 27 sessions in eight individuals, see Methods section). A triggered-averaging analysis was performed around REM onsets, as well as following controlled visual stimulation (Fig. 2). We examined simultaneously recorded scalp EEG (n=12, 10 and 4 electrodes located at Pz in wake, sleep and visual experiment, respectively), depth EEG (n=53 (13 patients), 51 (11 patients) and 13 (2 patients) recording sites in wake, sleep and visual experiment, respectively) and spiking activity within the MTL (n=437, 349 and 1,049 in wake, sleep and visual experiment, respectively).

Note the reduction in firing rate (−400 to 0 ms) and increased activity (150–550 ms) relative to REM onsets, and similar increased activity upon visual stimulation (right).

Error bars denote the s.e.m. across patients (a,b), dEEG channels (c) or REMs (d,e). Full size image (151 KB) Previous      Figures/tables index      Next      Scalp event-related potentials (ERPs) around REMs (Fig. 2b) during both sleep and wakefulness revealed a waveform in line with previous studies23, consisting of an initial transient peak before saccade onset ((−25 to 0)ms, P<0.001, one-tailed t-test compared with a (−800 to −400)ms baseline) followed by a second positive component ((50–200)ms P<0.001). Following controlled visual stimulation, the scalp ERP exhibited a more delayed positive component ((200–600)ms, P<0.05; Fig. 2b, right). In the depth EEG (‘dERP’), robust evoked potentials were found across MTL regions in relation to REMs with a similar positivity around 150 ms as found in the scalp EEG (P<0.01, Fig. 2c). This component was absent during visual presentation without eye movements (P>0.8, Fig. 2c, right). Notwithstanding, a late negativity ((300–400)ms, P<0.05) was observed within the MTL after REMs in sleep and wakefulness, as well as after the presentation of images with fixation. Since depth EEG signals were referenced to ear lobes (thereby attenuating ocular artifacts24), the presence of robust dERPs in the MTL (and especially components occurring hundreds of milliseconds after eye movement onsets) suggests an underlying modulation of neuronal activity upon REMs in both sleep and wakefulness, whose late component is reminiscent of visual-evoked activity.      Most importantly, single-unit spiking activity was robustly modulated around REMs, and this modulation was highly similar across wakefulness and REM sleep. A pattern consisting of a reduction in firing rate just before REM onsets, followed by subsequent increased spiking was observed in the average activity of all recorded units in wakefulness. A similar albeit weaker modulation was likewise observed in the average activity across all units during REM-sleep (Supplementary Fig. 2a, n=412 and n=318 in wakefulness and sleep, respectively). We searched for neurons whose activity was significantly modulated in any direction and at any time interval around REMs (see Methods section and Supplementary Fig. 2 for full details of selection process). From this unbiased approach, the stereotypical bi-phasic pattern of activity emerged in both sleep and wakefulness (Supplementary Fig. 2b). We then focused on the units showing this bi-phasic pattern in MTL regions specifically for further analysis (see Methods section and Fig. 2d,e for MTL population average and representative neurons, respectively) since neurons that showed bi-phasic modulations around REMs were more readily observed in the MTL (Table 1, 24% of all MTL units in wake (n=79 in 10 patients) and 18% in REM sleep (n=47 in 9 patients)) compared with frontal lobe regions (13% in wake and 12% in REM sleep). In contrast, non bi-phasic modulation profiles were observed as frequently across regions (Table 1). Along the same line, when searching for bi-phasic activity profiles around random time points (instead of real REMs), a significantly lower proportion of MTL neurons was found (one-tailed paired Mann–Whitney U-test, P<0.01, see Supplementary Material) but the proportion of frontal lobe neurons did not show such a difference (P=0.9). The higher proportion of bi-phasic modulations in the MTL argues against a global non-specific activity pattern.      Finally, the temporal dynamics of increased MTL firing following REMs was reminiscent of neuronal responses in the controlled visual experiment (Fig. 2d,e, right), although these were of stronger amplitude (P<0.001)—a difference to be expected given that stimuli were specifically selected to drive strong responses in the recorded neurons (Methods section). On an average, around REMs, bi-phasic neurons reduced their firing by 11% in sleep and 7% in wake at −200 ms (P<0.005, t-test) and increased their firing by 17% in sleep and 22% in wake at +250 ms (P<0.001, t-test). The post-REM increase coincided in time with the negativity observed in the dERPs. The pre-REM reduction in firing was unrelated to effects of previous REMs, as it was similarly observed also when focusing on ‘isolated’ REMs that did not occur in succession (not shown). In addition, visual responses were substantially later in time, peaking at 300 ms after image onset, whereas post-REM activity peaked around 250 ms after REM onset (equivalent roughly to 150 ms after eventual fixation25). In summary, REMs in both sleep and wakefulness were associated with multiple signatures of transient neuronal activities in the MTL that were similar across vigilance states and reminiscent of visually evoked activity.      To further investigate to what extent REM-related effects were driven by motor aspects of eye movements (‘corollary discharge’) versus visual-like aspects, we further divided wakefulness into putatively ‘visual’ and ‘non-visual’ periods based on behavioural notes (for example, watching television or meeting family in a well-lit room as ‘visual’ versus lying with open eyes in a dark room as ‘non-visual’, see Supplementary Methods). The rate of w-REMs in ‘visual’ periods was significantly greater than in ‘non-visual’ periods (14.7±14.6 versus 0.7±2.8 REMs per minute, P<0.05, Mann–Whitney U-test). Analysis of evoked potentials (Fig. 3) revealed that both ‘visual’ and ‘non-visual’ epochs were associated with a significant suppression of firing rates prior to REM onsets (difference from baseline: P<0.01, between ‘visual’ and ‘non-visual’: P=0.09, Mann–Whitney U-test, N=110 units and 140 REMs across eight patients). However, only ‘visual’ epochs showed a robust increase in neuronal activity after REM onsets within the MTL (difference between ‘visual’ and baseline: P<0.05; ‘non-visual’ and baseline: P=0.33). Similarly, dERPs of ‘visual’ and ‘non-visual’ differed in their late negative potential (Fig. 3a), which was present only for ‘visual’ REMs (significant difference observed 375–475 ms after REM onset, t-test, P<0.05, FDR correction). Moreover, a controlled paradigm during wakefulness in one individual further compared neuronal modulations occurring around w-REMs with closed eyes or during darkness with saccades towards visual targets (or passive fixation). Interestingly, already at the level of EOG waveforms, eye movements with open eyes and those occurring during REM sleep were highly similar, whereas w-REMs with closed eyes during wakefulness had markedly slower kinematics (Fig. 3b). Intracranial-evoked potentials in the MTL revealed a negative deflection following image presentation that also resembled those found after REMs (shown in Fig. 2c). This negative deflection was significantly attenuated during w-REMs without visual input (Fig. 3b). Taken together, these results suggest that neuronal modulations within the MTL after REMs cannot be solely explained by a motor corollary discharge (see also Discussion).

In particular, a robust and recently described feature of human MTL responses to visual stimulation is the significant correlation between the latency and the selectivity of neuronal spike trains, reflecting a hierarchical processing mode: a longer latency from image presentation is more readily found in neurons responding to fewer images26. We thus examined the presence and precise onset of spike trains in individual trials following spontaneous REMs in sleep and wakefulness, as well as following controlled visual stimulation.      In MTL neurons, spike trains were detected in 23.3±1% (mean±s.e.m.) and 19.6±1% of REMs in wakefulness and sleep, respectively (N=209 and 152 units, respectively). Despite the small subset of REMs associated with spike trains, these events accounted well for the overall increase in firing rate (see Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, the increase in firing rate for REMs associated with spike trains was correlated across vigilance states even when regressing out the mean firing rate of each unit (Spearman's partial correlation: r=0.28, P<0.01, n=131 units in eight patients). Furthermore, we found a significant correlation between the average latency of firing rate increase in each MTL neuron (after REM onset) and its selectivity (tendency to increase firing rates only after a small subset of REMs, Methods section). Figure 4a–c present this correlation for w-REMs (Spearman's rank correlation, r=0.26, P=10−4, n=209 in 10 patients), s-REMs (r=0.33, P=10−6, n=152 in 10 patients), and controlled visual stimulation (r=0.48, P=10−8, n=142 in 9 patients). Crucially, when applying the same analysis on random time points during REM sleep (not associated with eye movements), latency and selectivity were not significantly correlated (P=0.3 and P=0.9 for sleep and wake), indicating that this relation occurred at specific moments, rather than reflecting basic properties of neuronal firing such as the average discharge rate. Moreover, in those cases where the same neurons were recorded in both wakefulness and REM sleep, the selectivity of neurons was highly correlated across vigilance states (r=0.71, P=10−23, n=131 units in eight patients, Fig. 4d) such that neurons that were highly selective in their visual responses in wake also showed spike trains following few s-REMs. This relation was conserved even when taking into account the average firing rate of these neurons (partial correlation: r=0.51, P=10−11, n=131 units in eight patients). The average latencies of neurons were also correlated across vigilance states (r=0.20, P=0.02, n=131 units in eight patients); however, this correlation was not significant when regressing out the average firing rate (partial correlation: r=0.09, P=0.3, n=131 units in eight patients).      Figure 4: Comparison of transient spike-train properties in REM sleep and wakefulness. (a–c) Scatter plot of spike-train latency (ordinate) versus selectivity (abscissa, percent of trials eliciting a spike-train after REMs or image presentations) in w-REMs (a), s-REMs (b) and in the visual stimulation experiment (c). Low selectivity: neurons responds to all REMs/pictures; high selectivity: neurons responds to few REMs/pictures. Selectivity in c is restricted to a limited number of discrete values due to the use of six images in the image presentation experiment. Note that in all three conditions a robust correlation was observed, indicating the existence of hierarchical processing along the visual-mnemonic axis. Such correlation could not be revealed in random time points during REM sleep and wake. (d) Selectivity following REMs is correlated in the same neurons across wakefulness and sleep (Spearman's rank correlation, r=0.71, P=10−23; partial correlation taking average firing rate into account: r=0.51, P=10−11). ***P<0.001. Full size image (136 KB) Previous      Figures/tables index      Next      Finally, it is well established that theta (4–8 Hz) oscillations prevail in the MTL during both wakefulness and REM sleep27 and that the phase of theta oscillations is reset with engagement of visual-mnemonic mechanisms in humans28 and monkeys29. We found comparable phase resets around 2–6 Hz (‘human theta’, see ref. 30) in s-REMs and w-REMs. A brief and broadband reset was visible at REM onsets (potentially reflecting a myogenic contamination) followed by a delayed, sustained and frequency-specific increase in phase coherence around 2–6 Hz (see Methods section and Fig. 5a,b). Such theta-band coherence was correlated across vigilance states (Pearson’s r=0.27, P<0.05, see Supplementary Methods). Following controlled visual stimulation, stronger phase reset was observed in the MTL and the maximal effect occurred at similar time–frequency windows (Fig. 5c). When considering MTL regions separately (Fig. 5d), hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus showed strong phase resets, while the entorhinal cortex did not show phase coherence above chance levels. These effects were consistant across vigilance states (analysis of variance, effect of regions: P<0.005, F=4.8; effect of state: P=0.4, F=0.6). Similar differences between the theta-phase coherence across MTL regions were observed during controlled imaged presentation. The stronger and delayed effects during controlled visual fixation (in comparison with REMs) mirrored those found in dERPs and single-unit firing rates (Figs 2 and 3). Thus, the temporal dynamics of MTL activity were similar during REM sleep and during visual processing in wakefulness, possibly reflecting a partial conservation of the hierarchical processing in the visuo-mnemonic pathway. ||||| Seeing an imaginary scene (Image: Victor Habbick Visions/Getty)      Your body may be still, but as you dream, your eyes can flicker manically. The rapid eye movement stage of sleep is when we have our most vivid dreams – but do our flickering eyes actually “see” anything?      It is a question psychologists have been asking since REM sleep was first described in the 1950s, says Yuval Nir at Tel Aviv University in Israel. “The idea was that we scan an imaginary scene,” says Nir. “It’s an intuitive idea, but it has been very difficult to provide evidence for it.”      Until now, much of the evidence has been anecdotal, says Nir. “People who were woken up when their eyes were moving from left to right would say they were dreaming about tennis, for example,” he says.      Advertisement      More evidence comes from a previous study that monitored the sleep of people who have a disorder that means they often physically act out their dreams. Their eye movements matched their actions around 80 per cent of the time – a man dreaming about smoking, for example, appeared to look at a dream ashtray as he put out a cigarette.      But most of the REM sleep these people had was not accompanied by body movements, making it hard to know for sure. And other researchers have argued that the eye flickers can’t be linked to “seeing” anything because rapid eye movements happen in both fetuses and people who are blind – neither group would have experience of vision and so wouldn’t be expected to move their eyes to follow an object, for example.      In the mind’s eye      To investigate further, Nir and his colleagues monitored people who have epilepsy and have electrodes implanted deep into their brains to help with treatment.      These electrodes were mostly in the medial temporal lobe, a region that responds strongly to pictures, and allowed the team to record the activity from around 40 neurons in each volunteer’s brain as they slept. They found that activity seemed to spike around a quarter of a second after an eye flicker, just as it did when the volunteers saw an image when awake. “It is very plausible that they are looking at a dream image,” says Nir.      “It is extremely interesting… that these eye movement produce something like visual processing during dreaming,” says Michael Czisch at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich, Germany. He thinks we might see visual scenes as a side effect of when memories are replayed during sleep.      Because the researchers didn’t wake their volunteers, they can’t be sure what they were dreaming, Nir says. “But we are sure that the brain is alternating between different mental imagery,” he says. “Every time you move your eyes, a new image forms in the mind’s eye.”      Journal reference: Nature Communications, DOI: 10.1038/ncomms8884 ||||| Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Time for a change of scene?      For the first time, scientists have recorded from individual brain cells during the dreaming phase of sleep.      After each rapid eye movement (REM) they recorded bursts of activity that match what happens when we are awake and we see - or imagine - a new image.      They suggest that these well-known flickering movements accompany a \\"change of scene\\" in our dreams.      The recordings were made from patients with electrodes implanted in their brains to monitor seizures.      \\"It's a unique opportunity to look at what's happening inside the human brain,\\" Dr Yuval Nir, from Tel Aviv University in Israel, told the BBC. \\"We're very thankful to the epilepsy patients who volunteered to take part.\\"      Dr Nir worked with colleagues from France and the US on the study, which is published in the journal Nature Communications.      Next slide please      Over the course of four years they worked with 19 different patients, recording from electrodes in several different brain areas but largely within the medial temporal lobe.      This is not a part of the brain directly involved in vision, Dr Nir said.      \\"The activity of these neurons doesn't reflect image processing. It's more about signalling to the brain about a certain concept.      \\"You can close your eyes and imagine Queen Elizabeth, and these neurons will fire. This activity implies a refresh of the mental imagery and the associations.\\"      When the patients were awake and shown a picture, especially one associated with a memory, the researchers saw a particular pattern of activity.      \\"About a 0.3 seconds after the picture appears, these neurons burst - they become vigorously active,\\" Dr Nir explained. \\"This also happens when people just close their eyes and imagine these pictures, or these concepts.\\"      Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption This is the first study to record from individual brain cells during REM sleep      Intriguingly, he and his colleagues spotted a \\"very, very similar pattern\\" during sleep. In particular, these bursts arrived just after eye movements during REM sleep.      This is the phase of sleep in which we dream, and it is characterised by these occasional, very quick eye movements.      It has long been thought that these movements might reflect the visual component of dreams, but there has been no clear evidence for this - until now, Dr Nir said.      \\"We are intimately familiar with the activity of these neurons. We know they are active every time you look at an image, or when you imagine that image. And now we see them active in a similar way when you move your eyes in REM sleep, so it becomes very probable that the eye movements represent some type of reset, or 'moving onto the next dream frame'.      \\"It's almost like when I was growing up and we had slide projectors. You move to the next dream slide, if you like.\\"      Switching not scanning      This could help to explain why unborn babies and blind people also move their eyes during REM sleep, he added.      \\"Even people who are congenitally blind... can still dream about their aunt coming to visit from Florida: her voice, the emotions and all the associations that go with that.      \\"And when the dream changes from meeting this aunt to, say, taking your dog for a stroll in the park, then the brain activity changes and this happens in sync with eye movements.\\"      Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Our eyes flicker in spurts during the dreaming phase of sleep      Other sleep researchers welcomed the findings. Prof Jim Horne, who established the Sleep Research Centre at Loughborough University, said the study fits with our improving understanding of REM sleep.      He also emphasised that flickering of a dreamer's eyes, which only happens in brief spurts, does not mean they are surveying a scene.      \\"The eye movements are not actually scanning your dream - they're reorienting your visual thoughts,\\" Prof Horne told BBC News.      \\"This study endorses other findings that REM sleep has many similarities to wakefulness.      \\"I see REM sleep as rather like the screensaver on your computer; all you need is the touch of a button and your computer leaps to life. It's very close to wakefulness. Non-REM sleep is more like when you switch your computer off, and waking up requires a process of rebooting.\\"      Prof William Wisden, a neuroscientist at Imperial College London, was also convinced by the similarity of brain activity between awake and REM states - but he said there are bigger questions still to answer.      \\"The most fascinating question of all is why do we have to have REM sleep? Why does our brain have all this circuitry to do that?      \\"This paper doesn't answer that, but it does emphasise how similar being awake and in REM sleep are, for particular circuits in the brain.\\"      Follow Jonathan on Twitter ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Scientists in France, the United States and Tel Aviv University have provided the first evidence of a new image appearing in a person's dream.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Facts on Poe in honor of the anniversary of his death It was 166 years ago on Wednesday that the world lost Edgar Allen Poe for evermore. Poe, who was 40 years old when he died in 1849, was known for penning haunting stories of dubious women, mad murderers and brain-twisting enigmas. His wild tales also pioneered the shape of the modern-day detective story and launched the science-fiction genre. Here are some other facts about the writer behind classics “The Tell-Tale Heart” and “The Raven”: 1. After the death of his mother, Poe and his sister moved to Richmond, Virginia, to live with other families, according to the Edgar Allan Poe Museum. Poe adopted his new family's surname, Allan, as his middle name. 2. Poe lived across the street from his teenage sweetheart, Elmira, according to the Poe Museum. Despite being secretly engaged, both ended up marrying other people after Elmira's parents broke off the relationship. Poe, then 27, married his cousin, Virginia Clemm — who was 13 years old. After Poe's wife died, Poe and Elmira began a relationship again and were engaged before his untimely death. 3. Four days before his death, a delirious Poe — who was wearing another person’s clothes — was found in a Baltimore gutter by a local newspaper writer, according to Smithsonian Magazine. He was supposed to be in Philadelphia but instead went missing for a week. He stayed in this delirium and experienced hallucinations until his death. It remains a mystery how Poe ended up in Baltimore. 4. During the hallucinations he experienced prior to death, Poe called out \\"Reynolds,\\" according to the magazine. But no one recalled the name. 5. The cause of Poe’s death remains unexplained. Officially, he died from the swelling of the brain, but it was unknown what caused the swelling. There has been multiple speculation including theories of murder and rabies. 6. Poe was originally buried in an unmarked grave in Baltimore — but two decades after his death, a monument was funded through donations. The remains of Poe were taken from their original location of the family plot and put in the front of the cemetery under the monument along with his wife and mother-in-law (who was also his aunt). 7. Dubbed the Poe Toaster, a mystery person began a tradition in 1949 of leaving a somewhat empty bottle of cognac and three roses on Poe's grave Jan. 19 for Poe's birthday, according to society. The toasting ceased in 2009, although others took it upon themselves to continue the tradition in 2012, but are considered Faux Toasters.","output":"On the anniversary of Edgar Allan Poe's death, we explore some lesser-known facts about his life.

Millions of employees in a workplace pension scheme are to be freed from punitive curbs on savings imposed by Brussels. Earners were limited to £4,600 a year in contributions as part of the government-backed National Employment Savings Trust (NEST). They were also barred from transferring old company pensions into the scheme or taking it with them if they moved jobs. Pensions Minister Steve Webb (pictured) said: 'By convincing Europe to support us on this, we’ve achieved a victory for consumers' But after a year of negotiation, the European Commission has agreed to lift the restrictions in a ‘victory’ for employees, ministers will announce today. Pensions Minister Steve Webb said: ‘This is a common sense decision which will help people to save and give certainty and confidence to employers choosing to use NEST. ‘By convincing Europe to support us on this, we’ve achieved a victory for consumers.’ However, savers will have to wait until April 1, 2017 for the changes to kick in. The low-cost, not-for-profit pension was designed for small businesses and low to moderate earners who could not afford to pay into more expensive company pensions. More than 1.5million workers have joined since 2012 – and the figure is expected to reach four million in the next three years. The European Commission imposed restrictions because of fears that a state-funded pension scheme could distort or threaten competition from private pension firms. Frances O’Grady, general-secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said it was ‘great news for savers’ Mr Webb said it had put many businesses off because it would have meant running two parallel pensions – one for higher earners and NEST for low-income staff. Relaxing the rules meant workers could avoid having ‘pensions scattered all over the place’, which risked people losing track of their savings, he said. The move comes after pressure from union and employer groups, the National Association of Pension Funds, NEST and criticism from MPs on the Work and Pensions Select Committee. Frances O’Grady, general-secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said it was ‘great news for savers’. ‘It was always ridiculous that people could not save as much as they wanted into NEST,’ she added. Mr Webb defended the 2017 deadline, saying Parliament was ‘littered’ with legislation that had been rushed through and blamed the delay on lengthy consultations with the pension industry and Eurocrats. NEST was introduced alongside automatic enrolment, which forces every boss to pay into a pension for workers who are over 22 and earn at least £10,000 by 2018. Highlights:","output":"1. The European Commission has agreed to lift restrictions on the National Employment Savings Trust (NEST) pension scheme. 2. This means employees will no longer be limited to £4,600 a year in contributions and can transfer old company pensions into the scheme. 3. The changes will take place on April 1, 2017. 4.

One of the most adverse impacts of poor waste management, especially municipal waste, is the incidence and prevalence of diseases such as malaria and respiratory problems, as well as other illnesses through the contamination of ground water. Biomedical wastes pose great danger in Bangladesh too as a report estimated that 20% of the biomedical waste is \\"highly infectious\\" and is a hazard since it is often disposed of into the sewage system or drains.[6]  Such poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of the residents and a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related with this problem\\".[7]  With regards to the living standards, solid waste leads to blockage in the drainage system which leads to flooding in the streets. Consequently, mosquitoes and bad odour are among the negative impacts resulted.[7]  The hospital in Y city had a good disposal site in which they disposed of Biomedical wastes, but the hospital in the neighboring city X had big problems, because the biomedical waste contaminated the ground water and affected the population.

But UKIP's spokesman on migration Steven Woolfe MEP said there is no room in the party for xenophobic comments. UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill said Mr Bennett's comments are not the views of the party. Mr Bennett was quoted in WalesOnline saying: \\"I think in Cardiff the starkest area which has changed completely is City Road. \\"That's probably where we have a multiplicity, a melting pot of different races all getting on each other's nerves, I think, and certainly causing lots of problems because of different cultural attitudes, very visible problems of rubbish which is being left on the street uncollected all the time.\\" Mr Bennett was asked on BBC's Daily Politics what evidence he had for his claim. He said: \\"I haven't got any firm evidence to give you now.\\" He said he had sent a draft legal letter to UKIP, saying \\"if they try to deselect me without due process they will face a legal action from me for lost earnings of Â£300,000\\". Mr Woolfe told BBC's Daily Politics: \\"It's not for me to actually make the deselection process. \\"That will be the NEC and I understand that they will do so.\\" The MEP added: \\"If he has also said that in terms of the language that you blame migrants or those who come to this country for all the ills of this country, if there is a tone of any form of racism in there whatsoever I will be demanding that the NEC takes the strongest terms possible to deal with this man. \\"I would ask those who have examined him and approved him that they too should be reprimanded by the NEC because there is no room in this party... for anyone who makes any racist, xenophobic or other types of comments\\". Nathan Gill, leader of UKIP Wales, said the NEC have ratified the candidate lists \\"subject to a final ongoing assessment which we are in the middle of and which takes place right up until the paperwork is presented to the electoral offices\\". \\"The comments that Mr Bennett made, [and] also his performance in the media, will play a major part in that assessment,\\" he said. Mr Gill said he didn't share \\"any of the views that Mr Bennett has expressed about immigration in Cardiff. We as a party are not anti-immigration, we are anti uncontrolled immigration and uncontrolled immigration only. We want an Australian-style points based system.\\" \\"Mr Bennett has expressed his own views and they are clearly not the views of the party,\\" he added. A UKIP Wales source called for his deselection. He said it was \\"absolutely crazy\\" to blame immigration for rubbish, and said a lot of candidates wanted the issue \\"dealt with properly\\", although he had a right to a \\"fair trial\\". The source also criticised the fact that Mr Bennett had spoken about immigration \\"when it isn't a devolved issue\\". UKIP's central office has told BBC Wales that it \\"will not make any comment about the matter until they have spoken with Mr Bennett\\".

The state is offering a 1 million purse to anyone who can come up with a way to keep interloping Asian carp out of the Great Lakes, Michael Eckert reports for the Port Huron Times Herald. The pesky fish, which the Michigan Department of Natural Resources describes as having the ability to cause \\"economic, ecological, and human health harm,\\" may be placing a 7 billion fishing industry at stake, as well as 38 billion from tourism and water recreation, per the DNR's \\"Invasive Carp Challenge\\" page. Eckert has a couple of proposals of his own, though based on the column's tone, it doesn't appear he expects either one to be scooped up. One option, he says: Fill the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal that connects the Mississippi River Basin to the Great Lakes—and which basically serves as a conduit for the carp to infiltrate—with sand (an option others have suggested as well). But Eckert notes that those opposed to the plan cite the increased transportation costs for some local businesses that would result. His second plan, and probably more of a long shot: Convince Lansing to give up its annual revenue to pay anglers to take the carp out. \\"It worked for wolves,\\" he says. Meanwhile, the Lansing State Journal discusses a documentary by two filmmakers who grew up in the region on all of the different invasive species in the Great Lakes. (The Army has said getting rid of the carp could take 25 years.) Expand this summary.","output":"The state of Michigan is offering a 1 million reward for a solution to prevent invasive Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes. The fish pose a threat to the 7 billion fishing industry in the area, as well as 38 billion from tourism and water recreation, according to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The DNR describes the Asian carp as having the potential to cause \\"economic, ecological, and human health harm\\". Currently, the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal serves as an entry point for the fish into the Great Lakes from the Mississippi River Basin. One proposal to combat the problem is to fill the canal with sand, but opponents argue it would increase transportation costs for local businesses. Another suggestion is for the government to allocate revenue to pay anglers to remove the carp."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

You are given a new situation: Two farms used AM fungi for the plants. Brown farm also decided to grow cover crops on those parcels of land to help mycorrhizal growth. Orange farm didn't grow cover crops.  and a hint : Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.  Please answer this question : Which farm didn't provide extended time for AM fungi growth into the autumn? Answer:","output":"Orange farm didn't provide extended time for AM fungi growth into the autumn because they did not grow cover crops on their parcels of land. Growing cover crops helps in promoting mycorrhizal growth throughout the autumn, winter, and spring, leading to a more extensive hyphal network and better crop yield."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Earlier, Wales' Jamie Jones beat David Gilbert 6-2, while Scot Higgins saw off Mark Allen 6-3 to earn a last-eight tie with world number one Mark Selby in York. Belgium's Luca Brecel beat world number 19 Stephen Maguire 6-3. Williams' progress means Wales have two quarter-finalists in the UK Championship for the first time since he and Matthew Stevens in 2001. Highfield showed impressive calmness and consistency against the 1999 and 2002 champion, but Williams kept in touch and held his nerve to close out victory in an error-strewn decider. \\"I am just happy to get over the line,\\" said 41-year-old Williams. \\"I was so nervous. I was twitching all over the place at the end and so was he. \\"I am looking forward to playing him [Ronnie]. It will be a great occasion. He is the best player to ever pick a cue up.\\" World number 39 Jones profited from some sloppy potting to go 3-0 up against Gilbert, but missed a simple red in frame four to give the world number 21 a boost prior to the interval. Jones responded with a break of 96 and got the snooker he required as he won frame six on the black, before closing out victory. The 28-year-old will play Hong Kong's Marco Fu in Friday's evening session. Higgins, 41, is one of the tour's form men, winning both the China Championship and Champion of Champions in November. But Northern Irishman Allen overturned a 2-0 deficit with breaks of 78, 105 and 65 to go ahead. Higgins, a 28-time ranking event winner, levelled with a brilliant 101 and, after clinching a tense seventh frame, he closed out victory over the world number 10 with breaks of 68 and 90. \\"I will need to play a lot better than I have this week to win the next match,\\" said world number four Higgins. \\"I felt good at 2-0. But for the next two or three frames my concentration went haywire. I left easy chances and he was feeding off that. \\"I needed some help from Mark and I got it and that changed the game again.\\" Higgins' fellow Scot Maguire scored successive tons to tie the scores at 2-2 against world number 31 Brecel.

The word \\"punto\\" in Spanish can refer to a physical location or a perspective or standpoint.  Thus, the English translation would also depend on the context in which the sentence is used, as certain terms and phrases might be translated differently depending on that context.

The phone has failed to meet my expectations on several fronts, and I feel obliged to share my grievances in this review. 1. Performance: The biggest letdown about the XYZ Smartphone is its subpar performance. The device is painfully slow and unresponsive, often taking several seconds to load applications and switch between screens. I've even experienced multiple instances of applications crashing and the phone freezing, requiring me to restart it. 2. Battery Life: Battery life is another significant issue with this smartphone. On a full charge, it barely lasts me half a day with minimal usage, and if I attempt to run multiple apps or use GPS navigation, the battery drains at an alarming rate. This lack of battery life becomes a huge inconvenience as I constantly need to carry a power bank or charger with me wherever I go. 3. Camera Quality: For a smartphone that touts its camera as a standout feature, I was extremely disappointed with the picture quality. The images often appear washed out or overly grainy, especially in low-light conditions. Moreover, the autofocus is slow and frequently fails to produce sharp images, making it a frustrating experience when trying to capture spontaneous moments. 4. Build Quality & Design: The build quality of the XYZ Smartphone leaves a lot to be desired. The phone feels cheap in the hand due to its flimsy plastic body, and the buttons on the side offer little tactile feedback. Furthermore, the device is quite bulky and doesn't have an ergonomic design, making it uncomfortable to hold for extended periods. 5. Software & User Interface: Lastly, the software and user interface of the XYZ Smartphone are far from impressive. There are numerous bloatware apps pre-installed on the device, which are difficult to remove and only serve to slow down the phone. Additionally, the interface itself is cluttered and unintuitive, making it challenging to navigate for both new and experienced smartphone users. In conclusion, I would strongly advise against purchasing the XYZ Smartphone due to its lackluster performance, poor battery life, disappointing camera, and substandard build quality. There are far better options available in the market that offer a much more satisfying user experience at a similar price point."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer this question: Born at Pau in France which general later became King of Sweden?","output":"Charles XIV John was born on January 26, 1763, in Pau, France, and later became the King of Sweden and Norway. His original name was Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte, and he was a prominent French military general during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. His rise to the Swedish throne was an extraordinary turn of events in European history. Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte initially pursued a career in the law before enlisting in the French army in 1780. He advanced through the ranks during the French Revolution, fighting in several key battles such as the Battle of Fleurus and the Battle of Hohenlinden. In 1794, he was promoted to general and, by 1804, he had become one of the eighteen Marshals of France under the Napoleonic Empire. Despite his affiliations with Napoleon, Marshal Bernadotte maintained a certain distance from his political ambitions. His relations with the Emperor often fluctuated between trust and tension. Nevertheless, he continued to serve in various military capacities, including the Peninsular War and the War of the Fifth Coalition. In 1810, a major turning point in Bernadotte's life occurred when the childless King Charles XIII of Sweden sought an heir. The influential Swedish baron Carl Otto Mörner proposed Bernadotte as a candidate for the Swedish throne, citing his military prowess and reputation as a humane and fair commander. Surprisingly, Napoleon agreed to the idea, despite Bernadotte's resistance. On August 21, 1810, the Swedish Riksdag of the Estates elected Bernadotte as Crown Prince. He adopted the name Charles John (Karl Johan in Swedish) and converted from Catholicism to Protestantism as part of the condition for his acceptance as heir to the throne. In 1813, he became regent of Sweden as King Charles XIII’s health declined. During the final years of the Napoleonic Wars, Charles John, as Crown Prince of Sweden, allied with Russia, Prussia, and the United Kingdom in the Sixth Coalition against France. His forces fought alongside those of the other coalition members, contributing to Napoleon’s eventual defeat in 1814. In 1818, following the death of King Charles XIII, Charles John ascended to the throne as Charles XIV John of Sweden and Charles III John of Norway. His reign lasted until his death on March 8, 1844, and was marked by a strong focus on domestic development, fostering economic growth, and maintaining peace in turbulent Europe. In conclusion, Charles XIV John, originally known as Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte of France, was born in Pau, France, and later became the King of Sweden and Norway. His transition from French military general to Scandinavian monarch showcases the extraordinary circumstances of his life and the interconnected nature of European politics during the early 19th century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

My experience has been somewhat unsatisfactory, which is why I'm giving it a 2-star rating. First off, the app seems to consume a significant amount of battery on my device. I don't recall facing such an issue with other similar apps. Moreover, the performance isn't as smooth as I'd like it to be, with occasional lagging and crashes. While the user interface is quite intuitive, the overall functionality is very limited. The app is missing many essential features, and the ones that are present don't operate as efficiently as they should. Another issue that needs attention is the frequency of updates. Although updates are supposed to improve the app, I haven't noticed any significant changes or improvements with each new version so far.

News article: Email 1K Shares      [WASHINGTON, DC] At approximately 10:22am EST an email address assigned to a Sparrow Project volunteer received a communique by a party identifying itself as the decentralized hacker collective, Anonymous. The communique details a planned effort by the groups’s affiliates online to disrupt the online streaming and syndication of the President’s State of the Union Address, scheduled for 9pm EST.      The communique goes on to elaborate that this action is in response to a proposed executive order that would reinstate the most protested elements of the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Information Act (CISPA).      In 2012 a synergistic movement of progressives, legislative reformers, online activists, and autonomous hackers successfully defeated CISPA and another controversial bill, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA).      Many credit Aaron Schwartz and the group which he cofounded, Demand Progress, with coordinating the successful campaign to stop these bills.      The following is the communique in its entirety, edit marked in red.      BEGIN COMMUNIQUE      Article II, Sector 3 of the US Constitution, says the President “shall from time to time give to Congress information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.” At 9PM Eastern Standard Time, February [12], 2013 President Obama has planned to address a joint session of Congress to deliver the State of the Union Address. The following day, President Obama will be introducing an executive order, purportedly aimed at bolstering U.S. cybersecurity, after repeated failed attempts to pass legislation through Congress. Anonymous has reached a verdict of NO CONFIDENCE in this executive order and the plans to reintroduce the CISPA bill to Congress on the same day. As such, President Obama and the State of the Union Address will be BANISHED from the Internet for the duration of live delivery. So as not to infringe upon the President’s free speech, subsequent broadcasts will be allowed to pass unhindered. This action is being taken to underline a fact that appears to be sorely unrecognized by the Obama Administration — that the Internet is a sovereign territory, and does not fall under the jurisdiction of any nation state. We are the natives of this space, and its guardians, and we will fight until death to protect it as a neutral grounds for the unhindered interaction of all members of the human race, so long as they themselves act in harmony with this inviolable principle. Our determination is that President Obama is acting in direct contravention of this principle, and his brief exclusion is an educational, rather than a punitive measure. We hope that its lesson will be learnt. Punitive measures have not been ruled out. — Anonymous      END COMMUNIQUE ||||| Anonymous has made a grand claim ahead of Tuesday night's State of the Union address. In a communiqué posted on AnonRelations.net and spread through Anonymous' social media channels, the hacker collective announced it \\"will form a virtual blockade between Capitol Hill and the Internet\\" such that \\"there will be no State of the Union Address on the web tonight.\\"      What exactly Anonymous has in store for this evening is not detailed in the communiqué, nor is it clear whether hackers could indeed disrupt the feeds screening President Obama's speech online. However, the communiqué took the opportunity to decry the president for some of the worst civil liberties and privacy abuses perpetuated by his administration and to renew the hackers' tribute to the late Aaron Swartz.      The message reads:      Tonight, the President of the United States will appear before a joint session of Congress to deliver the State of the Union Address and tomorrow he plans to sign an executive order for cyber-security as the House Intelligence committee reintroduces the defeated CISPA act which turns private companies into government informants. He will not be covering the NDAA, an act of outright tyrannical legislation allowing for indefinite detention of citizens completely outside due process and the rule of law. In fact, lawyers for the government have point-blank refused to state whether or not journalists who cover stories or groups the Government disfavors would be subject to this detention. He will not be covering the extra-judicial and unregulated justifications for targeted killings of citizens by military drones within the borders of America, or the fact that Orwellian newspeak had to be used to make words like “imminent” mean their opposite. He will not be covering Bradley Manning, 1000 days in detention with no trial for revealing military murders, told that his motive for leaking cannot be taken into consideration, that the Government does not have room for conscience. He will not be covering the secret interpretations of law that allow for warrant-less wiretapping and surveillance of any US citizen without probably cause of criminal acts, or the use of Catch-22 logic where no-one can complain about being snooped on because the state won’t tell you who they’re snooping on, and if you don’t know you’re being snooped on, you don’t have a right to complain. We reject the State of the Union.      In a separate communiqué emailed out and picked up by activist publicity group the Sparrow Project, Anonymous again announced plans to disrupt SOTU online. In this email, however, Anonymous note that they plan to allow \\"subsequent [SOTU] broadcasts will be allowed to pass unhindered\\" after the live speech has concluded, \\"So as not to infringe upon the President’s free speech.\\" The statement adds: \\"This action is being taken to underline a fact that appears to be sorely unrecognized by the Obama Administration — that the Internet is a sovereign territory, and does not fall under the jurisdiction of any nation state.\\"      What precise interventions Anonymous can make during the address remains to be seen, but at this point #OpSOTU, as it is named, is a playful rallying cry to challenge abuses of executive power. The communiqué closes, \\"For freedom, for Aaron Swartz, for the Internet, and of course, for the lulz.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A group of hackers, called Anonymous, is planning to try and stop the President's State of the Union Address from being shown on the internet.

A slave could have a spouse and child, but the slave family was not recognized by the state, and the master could scatter the family members at any time. Slaves had fewer judicial rights than citizens and were represented by their master in all judicial proceedings. A misdemeanour that would result in a fine for the free man would result in a flogging for the slave; the ratio seems to have been one lash for one drachma. With several minor exceptions, the testimony of a slave was not admissible except under torture. Slaves were tortured in trials because they often remained loyal to their master. A famous example of a trusty slave was Themistocles's Persian slave Sicinnus (the counterpart of Ephialtes of Trachis), who, despite his Persian origin, betrayed Xerxes and helped Athenians in the Battle of Salamis. Despite torture in trials, the Athenian slave was protected in an indirect way: if he was mistreated, the master could initiate litigation for damages and interest (δίκη βλάβης / dikē blabēs). Conversely, a master who excessively mistreated a slave could be prosecuted by any citizen (γραφὴ ὕβρεως / graphē hybreōs); this was not enacted for the sake of the slave, but to avoid violent excess (ὕβρις / hubris).Isocrates claimed that \\"not even the most worthless slave can be put to death without trial\\"; the master's power over his slave was not absolute. Draco's law apparently punished with death the murder of a slave; the underlying principle was: \\"was the crime such that, if it became more widespread, it would do serious harm to society?\\" The suit that could be brought against a slave's killer was not a suit for damages, as would be the case for the killing of cattle, but a δίκη φονική (dikē phonikē), demanding punishment for the religious pollution brought by the shedding of blood. In the 4th century BC, the suspect was judged by the Palladion, a court... The answer to this question is:","output":"The court that exiled people in ancient Athens was called the Palladion. This court dealt with various matters, including cases related to the murder or mistreatment of slaves, and it had the authority to exile individuals as a form of punishment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. The doctors probably spent how long trying to save Santa? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - A couple of hours. - not enough information - All night. - Several days.

Aquino III’s hand in advancing his political agenda, according to early unofficial election returns on Tuesday that showed his political allies poised to take control of the Senate. Mr. Aquino was not up for re-election in the vote on Monday. He has three years remaining in his six-year term and is not permitted to run again. But the midterm election was seen as crucial for consolidating his power over the unwieldy Philippine legislature to advance his anticorruption and economic-growth program and to influence the choice of his successor. The Philippines is one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, and international organizations and ratings agencies have credited Mr. Aquino’s policies for that success. “This victory in the Senate means he will not be a lame-duck president,” said Ramon C. Casiple, the executive director of the Institute for Political and Electoral Reform in Manila. “He can use his popularity and control of the government to pursue his agenda and affect the 2016 presidential election.” At stake in the election on Monday were 12 of the 24 Senate seats and all 229 seats in the House of Representatives. The election also covered 18,000 local political posts, including provincial governors. With 69 percent of the vote counted, nine pro-administration Senate candidates were ahead. Their victory would increase the number of Mr. Aquino’s allies in the chamber to 13 from 4 and give them the power to choose the next Senate president. Final Senate results were expected by late Wednesday. Mr. Aquino’s political opponents have noted that although the economy has expanded, job growth has been flat and poverty levels have not improved. His critics also say corruption remains endemic, particularly low-level graft that most directly affects the poor. In campaign rallies for his political allies, Mr. Aquino responded that in his remaining three years in office, his government would focus on extending the benefits of economic prosperity to the country’s poor and on continuing to crack down on corruption. The shift in power in the Senate would give Mr. Aquino extraordinary control over the government, Mr. Casiple said. His allies’ gains in the Senate would be complemented by the traditional control that the administration has over the House of Representatives. Though the results of many races were still unclear on Tuesday, party alliances are less significant in the House, Mr. Casiple said. House members rely on national government money to finance projects in their districts, giving the administration considerable leverage over the body. In addition to his expected control of both houses of Congress, Mr. Aquino is seen as having significant influence over the judiciary. Last year, he led a successful effort to remove the chief justice of the Supreme Court for his failure to disclose assets, which allowed the president to appoint the current leader of the court. Other notable election results included the fiercely contested mayor’s race in Manila, where former President Joseph Estrada ousted the incumbent, Alfredo S. Lim. Mr. Estrada, a former action movie star who was removed from the presidency after being accused of corruption, remains a popular political figure. Imelda R. Marcos, the former first lady, appeared headed for re-election to the House of Representatives. Her daughter Imee Marcos was re-elected governor of Ilocos Norte Province, the birthplace of her father, Ferdinand E. Marcos, the former president who died in exile in Hawaii in 1989. Former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, despite remaining in detention in a government hospital on corruption charges, appeared set for a landslide re-election as the Congressional representative in her home district of Pampanga. The election on Monday saw less violence and fewer delays than in years past. The police reported at least seven election-related deaths, all of which occurred in the country’s restive south.

Q:Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What carried meaning for Victoria? Context: His birthday (14 December 1895) was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather, Prince Albert, the Prince Consort. Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been \\"rather distressed\\". Two days later, he wrote again: \\"I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name Albert to her\\". Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: \\"I am all impatience to see the new one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good\\". Consequently, he was baptised \\"Albert Frederick Arthur George\\" at St. Mary Magdalene's Church near Sandringham three months later.[a] As a great-grandson of Queen Victoria, he was known formally as His Highness Prince Albert of York from birth. Within the family, he was known informally as \\"Bertie\\".

Please answer the following question: Process:  - A person takes in oxygen through their nose or mouth - The oxygen travels into the body - Breaks down into glucose - Carbon dioxide is produced by the glucose breakdown - The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body through the nose or mouth.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose during fermentation happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen reaching the body.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The human body requires a continuous supply of oxygen to maintain the health and function of our cells and tissues. When we breathe in, we inhale oxygen which then travels into our lungs and is transported by red blood cells to our tissues. However, perturbations such as the presence of fermentation might affect the amount of oxygen reaching the body. To assess the effect of this perturbation, it is essential to understand the relationship between the primary process (breathing) and the hypothesized perturbation (fermentation). Fermentation is a metabolic process that occurs in some microorganisms, such as yeast and bacteria, as well as in human cells under certain conditions. It involves the conversion of glucose and other sugars to generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) without the need for oxygen. There are two main types of fermentation: alcoholic fermentation and lactic acid fermentation. In alcoholic fermentation, glucose is converted to ethanol and carbon dioxide, whereas, in lactic acid fermentation, glucose is converted to lactate. Now, let's evaluate the possible interactions between the respiratory process and the presence of fermentation in our initial scenario: 1. In the case of fermentation happening within human cells, it might occur under anaerobic conditions, which means the cells have an insufficient oxygen supply. It is important to note that anaerobic respiration or fermentation is considerably less efficient than aerobic respiration in generating ATP. This situation could arise due to decreased blood flow or impaired lung function, which prevents adequate oxygen transportation. As a result, the body would experience a reduced energy supply, potentially leading to fatigue and other symptoms. This example highlights an indirect effect of fermentation on the breathing process as it is caused by an underlying condition that affects oxygen supply rather than fermentation directly impacting oxygenation. 2. Fermentation involving microorganisms in the human body could potentially compete with human cells for oxygen, leading to limited oxygen availability. This situation might occur during severe infections when the microbial population grows rapidly and consumes significant amounts of oxygen, leaving less for human cells to utilize. In this case, the perturbation would have a direct effect on the breathing process by hampering the body's ability to efficiently use oxygen. Considering both scenarios mentioned above, it can be concluded that the presence of fermentation can indeed have an effect (both direct and indirect) on oxygen transportation and utilization in the human body. If fermentation reduces the availability or consumption of oxygen, it could lead to an overall decrease in the efficiency of the body's metabolic processes, impacting energy production and overall health. The degree of this effect would depend on the extent and duration of the perturbation caused by fermentation and the body's ability to compensate for any oxygen deficiencies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She was commissioned to the Royal Navy and took over as HMS \`\` Tattoo '' on 26 October 1943 .","output":"Yes, the two sentences can be considered as paraphrasing each other. Paraphrasing means that the same information or message is conveyed using different words or structure, while maintaining the original meaning.  In the first sentence, \\"She was commissioned to the Royal Navy and transferred as HMS 'Tattoo' on 26 October 1943,\\" the term \\"transferred\\" is used which indicates that the control or ownership of the entity being referred to as 'she' (probably a ship given the mention of Royal Navy and HMS Tattoo) was passed on or changed. In the second sentence, \\"She was commissioned to the Royal Navy and took over as HMS 'Tattoo' on 26 October 1943,\\" the term 'took over' is used to express a similar concept as 'transferred as', in this context, conveying the idea that 'she' (assuming it to be a ship), started to be known or operated as HMS Tattoo starting from that date.  In both sentences, the entity being referred to as 'she' is commissioned to the Royal Navy and becomes HMS 'Tattoo' on the same date, i.e., 26 October 1943. Thus, the essence or core information of the two sentences remains the same, with slight variations in structure and choice of words, thereby making them paraphrases of each other.  To paraphrase effectively, one usually changes the sentence structure, shifts the voice from active to passive or vice-versa, uses synonyms or explains terminology. The exchanged use of words \\"transferred\\" and \\"took over\\" can be seen as the application of using synonyms while paraphrasing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You are given a new situation: Two neighboring countries with similar economies, followed different political and economical agendas. Niger developed its infrastructure and communications technology, while Nigeria didn't.  and a hint : Distance decay is a geographical term which describes the effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions. The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease.  With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1]  Please answer this question : Which country will be more developed as a consequence of their agendas? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information and the concept of distance decay, it can be inferred that Niger will likely be more developed as a consequence of their political and economic agendas. Firstly, let's break down the agendas followed by each country: - Niger focused on developing its infrastructure and communications technology. Infrastructure generally includes transportation systems, public services, and utilities, while communications technology encompasses advancements such as telephones, broadcasting, and the internet.    - Nigeria, in contrast, did not prioritize infrastructure and communications technology in their agenda. As a result, they may have fallen behind in terms of connectivity, resource distribution, and access to economic opportunities. Now, considering the concept of distance decay and its influence on the development of these countries, we can analyze some potential consequences of their respective agendas: 1. Connectivity: Niger's investment in infrastructure and communication technology enhances its ability to create and maintain cultural, social, and economic ties not only within the country but also beyond its borders. This accessibility to global markets can support its economy and improve the overall standard of living for its citizens. 2. Economic Growth: By prioritizing infrastructure and communication technology, Niger has created an environment that supports innovation and facilitates the flow of capital, labor, and resources, all of which contribute to economic growth. Improved infrastructure also attracts foreign direct investments, thus creating more job opportunities and boosting the country's economy. 3. Social Development: Improved communication technology fosters better access to information and knowledge, which can translate into benefits such as better healthcare, enhanced educational opportunities, and higher employment rates. These factors ultimately contribute to the social development of a nation. 4. Resilience to Distance Decay: Niger's focus on infrastructure and communication technology can mitigate the negative effects of distance decay. This is because faster travel and advancements in technology reduce the impact of distance on cultural, social, and economic interactions. In contrast, Nigeria's lack of investment in infrastructure and communication technology could hinder its development by limiting connections, impeding economic growth, slowing social development, and being more susceptible to the effects of distance decay. Therefore, as a consequence of their respective agendas, Niger would likely emerge as the more developed country. This is primarily due to its strategic focus on infrastructure and communications technology, which foster a stable economy, social development, and stronger resilience against the detrimental effects of distance decay."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Come with me, if you will, back to 2009: the ninth year of the third millennium and the year Owl City released its hit song “Fireflies.” “Fireflies” eventually reached the No. 1 slot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, in part because it presented the world with a new scientific conundrum: can fireflies hug?      Here’s the lyric that started it: “Cause I'd get a thousand hugs / From ten thousand lightning bugs / As they tried to teach me how to dance.” Yesterday, Owl City’s Adam Young attempted to explain his lyrics, in response to a fan who asked on Twitter, “Does each firefly hug you 1,000 times or do only 1/10th of the bugs give you a hug?”      Young gives us a lot to unpack here, so in the words of Lily Tomlin on the set of I Heart Huckabees, “Let’s just take it one fucking line at a time.”      “I was the recipient of 1,000 hugs from 10,000 lightning bugs for a grand total of 10,000,000 hugs.”      So what you’re saying is that each firefly hugged you 1,000 times. Got it.      “As the lyrics of the song clearly state, the average layperson would not believe their eyes if 10,000,000 fireflies were to illuminate planet Earth, nor would the average person conclude by natural instinct that 10,000 lightning bugs, acting as a collective group, are capable of embracing a human being 1,000 times without difficulty.”      First off, there are around 2,000 species of firefly, according to National Geographic, and some adult fireflies do not light up at all, according to Scientific American. The Photinus pyralis is the most common species in North America, and since West is from Minnesota, let’s assume we’re talking about that.      In a 1928 study titled “The Brightness of the Light of the West Indian Elaterid Beetle, Pyrophorus,” researchers E. Newton Harvey and Kenneth P. Stevens conclude that although the brightness of these “headlight bugs” varied greatly among individuals, the average brightness of a single beetle was around 0.0006 lumens of light.      From there, we can assume that 10 million fireflies, if producing a similar amount of light as the West Indian elaterid beetle, would produce around 6,000 lumens of light. According to the FTC, a standard 60-watt incandescent lightbulb produces around 800 lumens, which means that 10 million fireflies might produce the same amount of light as 7.5 lightbulbs.      Adam my boy, we’ve already gone off the rails here, and YET, in the second half of this thought you move even deeper into nonsense territory when you say that the lightning bugs act as a “collective group.” This throws into dispute your earlier insistence that you received 10 million hugs. Instead, a collective hug suggests you were hugged 1,000 times by a single firefly group, and not individually by each firefly.      “By the same token, a gathering of lightning bugs in such vast numbers form a sort of “swarm,” and a swarm can collectively surround a human and deliver a “hug” that a single firefly, acting according to the dictates of his own conscience, simply cannot.”      Again, if the swarm is delivering the hug, and a single firefly cannot act alone, then Adam Young did not receive 10 million hugs, he received 1,000.      Young probably wasn’t hugged at all, says Douglas Yanega, the senior museum scientist of the Entomology Research Museum at the University of California, Riverside. “You can be surrounded by fireflies if you are in a habitat that is full of snails, but they will not make physical contact with you in great numbers,” Yanega wrote in an email to The Verge. “Any ‘mass hugs’ are therefore purely metaphorical, like being hugged or kissed by a cloud of butterflies. It's a poetic metaphor, yes, but not a literal reality.”      In this section Young also makes the interesting decision to enter a debate about the nature of consciousness. In 2016, two professors at Macquarie University in Australia theorized that insects have “midbrain-like structures,” where it is thought that human consciousness also exists. One of the professors, Colin Klein, said that insects “plan, but don’t imagine,” according to Smithsonian Magazine.      What Young seems to be arguing is that a firefly is incapable of planning as an individual being, or perhaps experiences fear when confronted the possibility of performing a hug on its own. He does not back up his theories.      “This may seem inconceivable due to the firefly’s soft-shelled body, which is common among all winged beetles within the Lampyridae insect family.”      True.      “Members of the scientific community may be tempted to cast doubt upon the possibility of this exchange due to the immobility of the prothorax and pterothorax, in addition to the elytra protruding outward while a firefly is engaged in mid-flight. However, I can testify to the accuracy of this exchange.”      It seems strange to me that the man arguing in favor of firefly hugs would point out that their bodies may not be equipped for hugging. It serves no purpose in his overall argument, and instead appears to be an attempt to divert readers’ attention.      “I can furthermore add that while each individual hug took place, each firefly participated in the chemical reaction commonly known as bioluminescence in which the enzymes within the firefly, in the presence of oxygen, magnesium ions, and ATP, emitted a chemically produced light or “glow” because they were happy to be hugging me.”      “The only species of fireflies known to synchronize flashing usually do it while resting on vegetation,” says Yanega, our new entomologist friend. Only one species that he knows of does this in the US, in the Great Smoky Mountains, which are not in Minnesota. Even this species doesn’t synchronize very accurately — and they definitely don't do it while airborne. \\"Think of ‘The Wave’ being done in a sports arena, using cigarette lighters,\\" Yanega says. Even then, they still flash on and off, rather than remaining permanently on.      Additionally, we seem to have once again found ourselves circling the issue of insect consciousness. Here, Young asks us to further suspend our disbelief and accept that not only can fireflies experience happiness, but they can experience happiness from hugging him.      “Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any further questions! Stream “Fireflies” on Apple Music and Spotify!”      I’ve reached out to Owl City’s management company and will update if I hear back. And I did listen to “Fireflies” on Spotify, in preparation for this evaluation. The song still makes no sense. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| In a Facebook post that's gone viral, Young said that he was \\"the recipient of 1,000 hugs from 10,000 lightning bugs for a grand total of 10,000,000 hugs.\\"      \\"As the lyrics of the song clearly state, the average layperson would not believe their eyes if 10,000,000 fireflies were to illuminate planet Earth, nor would the average person conclude by natural instinct that 10,000 lightning bugs, acting as a collective group, are capable of embracing a human being 1,000 times without difficulty,\\" he said.      \\"By the same token, a gathering of lightning bugs in such vast numbers form a sort of 'swarm,'\\" the singer further clarified. \\"And a swarm can collectively surround a human and deliver a 'hug' that a single firefly, acting according to the dictates of his own conscience, simply cannot.\\"      Young acknowledged that this \\"may seem inconceivable due to the firefly’s soft-shelled body, which is common among all winged beetles within the Lampyridae insect family,\\" but that he \\"can testify to the accuracy of this exchange.\\"      \\"I can furthermore add that while each individual hug took place, each firefly participated in the chemical reaction commonly known as bioluminescence in which the enzymes within the firefly, in the presence of oxygen, magnesium ions and ATP, emitted a chemically produced light or 'glow' because they were happy to be hugging me,\\" Young concluded, along with a reminder to stream the song on Apple Music and Spotify. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Owl City's hit song \\"Fireflies\\" sparked a debate over whether fireflies can hug, based on the lyrics \\"Cause I'd get a thousand hugs / From ten thousand lightning bugs / As they tried to teach me how to dance.\\" Adam Young, the artist behind Owl City, attempted to explain his lyrics, suggesting that fireflies can collectively hug a person.

Most content management systems (CMS) have built-in cache clearing functions, while website owners using custom-built websites may need to manually clear the cache. 3. Request Indexing in Google Search Console: Once the content has been removed and the cache has been cleared, it's essential to submit a request to Google for re-indexing the updated web page. This can be done using the URL Inspection tool in Google Search Console. Input the updated URL, click the \\"Request indexing\\" button, and wait for Google to crawl and index the page. 4. Google's Web Crawlers: Google uses automated web crawlers (also known as \\"bots\\" or \\"spiders\\") to scan and index web pages. When a request for indexing is submitted, Google's web crawlers visit the updated web page and collect information about its content, structure, and links. This process can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days, depending on the complexity of the website and the number of pages to be indexed. 5. Updating the Search Index: After Google's web crawlers have completed their task, the search index is updated to reflect the changes made to the web page. The deleted content will no longer appear in search results. However, it's essential to note that variations in search rankings and appearance may occur during the transition period. 6. Monitoring the Results: Finally, closely monitor Google's search results to ensure that the deleted content remains absent. This entails regularly searching relevant keywords and phrases, and checking for the presence of the removed content. If the content reappears, it may be necessary to repeat the process or consult with a web professional to address more complex issues. By following these steps, you can ensure that once content has been removed and Google has noted the update, the information will no longer appear in Google's search results."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The lulling sound of the creek, the quiet rustling of the leaves, and the gentle tug of fish nibbling at their bait was an escape for Christopher, Danny, Olivia, and Melissa. While they bonded over their shared love for the sport, Adam found himself drawn to other pursuits. Adam was always more fascinated by technology and learning about the rapid advancements that kept him busy reading various articles on the subject. The mechanical world and its marvels were what piqued his interest. From gadgets and gizmos to the intricacies of computer programming, he was a whiz when it came to anything with a chip. It wasn't that Christopher and his friends didn't appreciate Adam's different hobbies; they just couldn't share the same excitement over an updated phone model or the newest software. Christopher would often invite Adam on their fishing trips in a bid to include him in their camaraderie. However, Adam would politely decline, already knee-deep in a coding project or researching the next big thing in technology. At one point, Melissa suggested that they make their usual weekend trips more interactive and engaging so that Adam might be more inclined to join. So, using Adam's expertise, they attempted to merge his passions with their love for fishing. The group decided to incorporate more tech-focused activities during their fishing trips, such as using a drone to map out their favorite fishing spots or experimenting with underwater cameras to peek at the fish they hoped to catch. They even tried their hand at building a remote-controlled bait dispenser, which would allow them to release the bait more efficiently. During these technology-infused fishing trips, Adam started to discover the allure of nature and seeing the excitement his friends had during their fishing adventures. In turn, Christopher, Danny, Olivia, and Melissa started to appreciate the thrill of invention and the fascinating fun that mastering new technology brought to the table. As time passed, the group began to bond over a shared appreciation for one another's passions. Their fishing trips turned into an amalgamation of old-fashioned pastimes mixed with modern tech marvels. These adventures became a source of enjoyment, learning, and collaboration, as they always aimed to invent and create new ways to make their fishing excursions even more exciting. Adam soon found himself enjoying every element of his friends' hobby - from the competitive spirit of trying to catch the biggest fish to the meditative calm of spending time surrounded by nature. Christopher and his friends were likewise thrilled with the ways technology could enhance their experience, opening their eyes to new possibilities and opportunities for their favorite pastime. Ultimately, the group's friendships deepened as they continued to share and exchange their experiences in their respective interests. The combination of Christopher's love for fishing and Adam's passion for technology had created a bridge between them, a unique space for both worlds to meet and thrive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the below context:  Many independent Chicago-based record labels were also getting their artists on the dance charts. Detroit DJ Terrence Parker uses his advanced turntablism skills and his focus on precision to blend hip hop music DJing styles, such as rhythmic scratching, in his house mixes. Fellow Detroit spinner DJ Minx is a notable woman house DJ. Her records on her Women on Wax label blend Parker-influenced turntablism precision with a funky style. In the UK, any house song released by a Chicago-based label was routinely considered a \\"must-play\\" at UK house music clubs. Paradise Garage in New York City was still a top club in the house era, just as it had been during the disco age. The emergence of Todd Terry, a pioneer of the genre, demonstrated the continuum from the underground disco approach which moved to a new house sound. Terry's cover of Class Action's \\"Weekend\\" (mixed by Larry Levan) shows how Terry drew on newer hip-hop influences, such as the quicker sampling and the more rugged basslines. In the late 1980s, Nu Groove Records launched and nurtured the careers of Rheji Burrell and Rhano Burrell, collectively known as Burrell (after a brief stay on Virgin America via Timmy Regisford and Frank Mendez). Nu Groove also had a stable of other NYC underground scene DJs. The Burrell's created the \\"New York Underground\\" sound of house, and they did 30+ releases on this label featuring this sound. In the 2010s, Nu Groove Record releases like the Burrells' enjoy a cult status among \\"crate diggers\\" and DJs. Mint-condition vinyl records by the Burrells from the 1980s can fetch high prices. By the late 1980s, house DJing and production had moved to the US's west coast, particularly to San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles, Fresno, San Diego and Seattle. Los Angeles saw am explosion of underground raves, where DJs mixed dance tracks. L.A. DJs Marques Wyatt and Billy Long spun at Jewel's Catch One.

The United States had issued a formal warning to the Taliban, and also to Sudan, that they would be held directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, wherever they occurred, carried out by the  Bin Laden network as long as they continued to provide sanctuary to it. For a brief moment, it had seemed as if the August strikes might have shocked the Taliban into thinking of giving up  Bin Laden. On August 22, the reclusive Mullah Omar told a working-level State Department official that the strikes were counterproductive but added that he would be open to a dialogue with the United States on  Bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan. Meeting in Islamabad with William Milam, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Taliban delegates said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking sanctuary but asked what would happen to  Bin Laden should he be sent to Saudi Arabia. Yet in September 1998, when the Saudi emissary, Prince Turki, asked Mullah Omar whether he would keep his earlier promise to expel  Bin Laden, the Taliban leader said no. Both sides shouted at each other, with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi government. Riyadh then suspended its diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime. (Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates were the only countries that recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.) Crown Prince Abdullah told President Clinton and Vice President Gore about this when he visited Washington in late September. His account confirmed reports that the U.S. government had received independently. Other efforts with the Saudi government centered on improving intelligence sharing and permitting U.S. agents to interrogate prisoners in Saudi custody. The history of such cooperation in 1997 and 1998 had been strained. Several officials told us, in particular, that the United States could not get direct access to an important al Qaeda financial official, Madani al Tayyib, who had been detained by the Saudi government in 1997.67Though U.S. officials repeatedly raised the issue, the Saudis provided limited information. In his September 1998 meeting with Crown Prince Abdullah, Vice President Gore, while thanking the Saudi government for their responsiveness, renewed the request for direct U.S. access to Tayyib. The United States never obtained this access. An NSC staff-led working group on terrorist finances asked the CIA in November 1998 to push again for access to Tayyib and to see \\"if it is possible to elaborate further on the ties between Usama bin Ladin and prominent individuals in Saudi Arabia, including especially the  Bin Laden family.\\" One result was two NSC-led interagency trips to Persian Gulf states in 1999 and 2000.

She said Moore groped and assaulted her in an attempt to have sex with her when she was 16. Moore was 30 at the time and an assistant district attorney.      Moore faces allegations of sexually harassing assaulting teenagers as young as 14 while he was in his 30s.      When Nelson first came forward, she showed the message at a press conference with Allred. She said he wrote the inscription in the weeks before he attacked her.      The yearbook has become a hot topic among Moore's supporters, who have questioned the authenticity of the signature.

In the Alabama Senate race, national Democrats and the liberal grassroots are treading lightly, trying not to sink Doug Jones' upset bid against Republican... (Associated Press)      MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — An attorney for a woman who says Roy Moore assaulted her when she was a 16-year-old waitress says a handwriting expert has confirmed that his inscription in her 1977 yearbook is authentic. Moore's campaign says the accuser's admission that she added the time and place of Moore's yearbook inscription in her own handwriting undermines her entire story.      Beverly Nelson's high school yearbook has become key evidence supporting her claim that the 34-year-old prosecutor was a regular at the Olde Hickory House restaurant where she worked as a teenager — and where she says he attacked her in his car after she accepted his offer of a ride home one cold winter night.      Moore has denied knowing Nelson, or the restaurant in Gadsden, for that matter.      With just days to go before Tuesday's voting in Moore's Senate race against Democrat Doug Jones, his campaign has been roiled by this and other accusations of sexual misconduct decades ago.      Moore has aggressively sought to discredit his accusers, suggesting that both establishment Republicans and liberals are behind the claims. Moore has posted on Twitter frequently about the yearbook, calling his signature a forgery.      The inscription reads, \\"To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say, 'Merry Christmas.'\\" It is followed by the signature \\"Roy Moore D.A.\\" and the notation \\"12-22-77 Olde Hickory House.\\"      Gloria Allred said Friday that a hired handwriting expert found the signature to be authentic.      \\"We think it's important evidence that supports Beverly's statements that Roy Moore asked to sign her yearbook when she was just 16 years old. And it demonstrates that when Roy Moore stated, quote, 'I do not know any of these women,' end quote, that statement does not appear to be true,\\" Allred said.      Allred acknowledged that Nelson added the date and restaurant name below the signature.      Moore's attorney Phillip Jauregui said Friday that this admission undermines the credibility of Nelson's account and shows that they weren't telling the truth at an initial press conference.      \\"What they said then was either a lie or what they said today was a lie. The voters are going to have to decide, were they lying then, or are they lying now?\\" Jauregui said.      He asked Allred to release the yearbook so an independent expert can evaluate the signature and notation.      \\"Until they release the yearbook, all we know is, they're not telling the truth and they've lied,\\" he said.      At a rally Friday night in Pensacola, Florida, President Donald Trump taunted Nelson.      \\"Did you see what happened today? You know, the yearbook? Did you see that? There was a little mistake made,\\" Trump said, shifting to a sing-songy voice. \\"She started writing things in the yearbook.\\"      Trump had reinforced his support for Moore earlier Friday by tweeting a similar message. ||||| Beverly Nelson, who accuses Moore of assaulting her when she was 16, made annotations on the message Moore, then 32, allegedly wrote in her 1977 yearbook      Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore has branded one of his accusers a liar, after she admitted adding notes to a crucial piece of evidence.      Steve Bannon champions Roy Moore and attacks Mitt Romney for not serving in military Read more      Moore faces – and denies – multiple accusations of sexual misconduct towards teenage girls decades ago, including one involving a 14-year-old.      Beverly Young Nelson was 16 when, she alleges, Moore groped her and tried to force her into a sex act in his car. Nelson has offered as evidence a 1977 high school yearbook that she says was signed by Moore. The inscription reads: “To a sweeter more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas. Christmas 1977. Love, Roy Moore, DA. 12-22-77 Olde Hickory House.”      Olde Hickory House was the restaurant in Gadsden, Alabama, where Nelson worked when Moore, in his 30s at the time, allegedly assaulted her. The entire note was initially implied to have been written by Moore, which he denied. Nelson acknowledged on Friday that the date and location annotations were hers.      “He did sign it,” she told ABC News.      When interviewer Tom Llamasput put to her, “And you made some notes underneath,” Nelson replied: “Yes.”            In a Friday afternoon press conference in Atlanta, the attorney Gloria Allred announced that the inscription and signature had been analysed by Arthur Anthony, a forensic document expert. In his report, which Allred presented to reporters, Anthony concluded that the note and signature belonged to Moore.      “The expert’s opinion is important [and] we hope that the voters of Alabama will take into consideration when they vote next Tuesday,” Allred said.      “We look forward to learning if Alabama voters will believe Roy Moore’s accusers or if they will ignore the evidence presented to them and instead elect a man who denies the allegations against him and who attacks those who dare to tell what they say is the truth about Roy Moore.”      We look forward to learning if Alabama voters will believe Roy Moore’s accusers or if they will ignore the evidence Gloria Allred, Nelson's lawyer      Allred brushed off claims from Moore supporters that Nelson’s admission undermined the authenticity of the yearbook entry.      “It is also a defamatory statement to accuse her of a crime,” Allred said. “So I would say that anyone who accuses her of a crime or me should proceed at their own risk and their own peril. And I would say such risk and such peril are significant under the circumstances.”      Nelson showed reporters the yearbook, turning to the page where she says Moore signed it. She also pointed to a photo of Moore’s wife, Kayla Moore, who Nelson said was in her class in high school.      “I am a Republican who supported Mr Trump for president,” Nelson said. “I did so because I thought that he cared about people like me. I am very disappointed that I was wrong.      “President Trump has chosen to support a powerful politician like Mr Moore over women like me who accuse Roy Moore of preying on them when they were in their teens.”      But the issue of the yearbook annotations was seized on by Moore. “Now she herself admits to lying,” read part of a tweet from his account. “Let’s count how many national outlets will ignore the fact that she admits to lying.”      At a press conference in Montgomery, lawyer Phillip Jauregui said that in her first media appearance with Nelson, Allred had claimed “with her client … nodding in agreement, that everything written on that page was written by Judge Moore. Well, today it’s a different story, isn’t it? They’re not saying that any more. They’re saying that parts of it were not written by Judge Moore.      “We suspected it back then and we demanded that they turn over the yearbook so that we could test the ink, test the writing and test everything. We renew that demand today: release the yearbook so that an independent expert – not your paid expert – an independent expert, a neutral third-party custodian can take it and look at the ink so we can find out: is the ink a month old or is it 40 years old?”      Jauregui added: “The truth is out there and until she releases the yearbook all we know is they’re not telling the truth and they’ve lied.”      He left the room with taking questions.      Moore was endorsed by Trump last weekend and is running ahead of Democrat Doug Jones in the polls ahead of Tuesday’s election.      Trump tweeted on Friday: “LAST thing the Make America Great Again Agenda needs is a Liberal Democrat in Senate where we have so little margin for victory already. The Pelosi/Schumer Puppet Jones would vote against us 100% of the time. He’s bad on Crime, Life, Border, Vets, Guns & Military. VOTE ROY MOORE!”      In her ABC interview, Nelson said: “Is the party more important really than what happened? I feel like my incident is being swept under the rug, literally, because he’s a Republican.”            Nelson, who went public after the Washington Post reported on allegations made by four women, added: “It sickens me to wonder what may go on with him if he gets into office.”      She said Moore offered her a ride home after work but instead parked the car and tried to assault her. He told her not tell anyone about the alleged incident, she said.      “He could be doing this still,” Nelson added. “We don’t know. And, then again, I hope that he’s changed. I pray that he’s changed. I really do.”      Moore has been embroiled in fresh controversy over comments he made at a rally in September. Asked by an African American member of the audience when he thought America was great, the former judge reportedly answered: “I think it was great at the time when families were united – even though we had slavery – they cared for one another. Our families were strong, our country had a direction.”      The president was set to hold a Friday night rally in Pensacola, Florida, near the Alabama border. ||||| Summary:","output":"A lady named Beverly Young Nelson said that a man named Roy Moore, who wants to be a senator, was not nice to her when she was 16 years old. She showed a message in her yearbook from 1977 that she says he wrote to her before he tried to hurt her. Some people said the message was fake, but Beverly said only a small part of it, where she wrote the date and place, was added by her. A person who knows about handwriting looked at the message and said Roy Moore did write the message.

Washington (CNN) -- The United States has lifted its ban on U.S. carriers flying to and from Tel Aviv, Israel. The Federal Aviation Administration's move came Wednesday night, a day and a half after it imposed the prohibition over security concerns amid renewed Mideast violence. Airlines moved quickly to restore service. Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and US Airways said Thursday they are resuming flights to Israel's busiest airport, Ben Gurion International. The European Aviation Safety Agency also has reversed its recommendation that airlines avoid flying to Ben Gurion. Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, lobbied Washington to reverse the extraordinary order the FAA put in place after a Hamas rocket struck close to the airport Tuesday. The FAA said it had worked with other","output":"U.S. government entities and reviewed intelligence assessments before deciding to lift the restriction. It also consulted closely with the Israeli government to evaluate the potential security risks, taking into account the measures that Israel had implemented to mitigate these risks. While security remains an ongoing concern, the FAA believes the threat level has diminished sufficiently to warrant a resumption of flights. It will continue to monitor the security situation and adjust its guidelines as necessary. The safety of passengers and crew members remains its top priority.  Justification: 1. The passage spoke about the lifting of a ban on U.S. carriers flying to and from Tel Aviv, Israel. 2. The FAA had imposed this act due to security concerns but lifted it after reassessment. 3. To logically continue the passage, it is necessary to elaborate on the steps the FAA took before lifting the ban. 4. Therefore, it would be reasonable to state that the FAA cooperated with other U.S. government entities, evaluated intelligence assessments, and consulted with the Israeli government. 5.

The Albanians first appear in the historical record in Byzantine sources of the late 11th century. At this point, they were already fully Christianized. Islam later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of Ottoman rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories. The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first atheist state. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but will not be attending the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership. Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the Sunni branch) are found throughout the country whereas Albanian Orthodox Christians as well as Bektashis are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country. The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society in the 19th century. The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh, was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010. Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania. The first full Albanian Bible to be printed was the Filipaj translation printed in 1990.

As I mentioned in my previous post on Sacré-Coeur, one of the other places I didn’t get a chance to see when I was in Paris last summer was the catacombs so I wanted to be sure to fit in a visit this time around. Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under).

According to the plot detailed here, the character who is killed by Armstrong and the farmer's wife is Hermann Gromek. Hermann Gromek (portrayed by Wolfgang Kieling) is an East German security officer assigned to the protagonist, Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman).  Armstrong, functioning as a double agent, is followed to a farm by Gromek. There, Gromek correctly deduces that Armstrong is a double agent and attempts to report this information to the police. However, before he is able to fully reveal Armstrong's true allegiance, a violent fight ensures that results in Gromek's death. Thus, it can be confirmed that Hermann Gromek is the character who was killed by Michael Armstrong and the 'farmer’s wife', whose real identity isn't explicitly provided in the plot, in the movie 'Torn Curtain'. Armstrong's motives for this murder would have been to protect his secret mission of gaining intelligence regarding the progress made by the East German scientific establishment—and more broadly, the Soviet Union—on anti-missile systems."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You may recall that I’d been helping out a local charity with their website? Well that is all completed now but I’ve had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. \\"Harekete geç. Which language is this?","output":"This phrase, \\"Harekete geç,\\" is in Turkish. Turkish is a prominent language spoken mainly in Turkey and Cyprus, as well as by diaspora communities in various countries. It belongs to the Oghuz branch of the Turkic language family and, like other Turkic languages, has agglutinative grammar, which means words are formed by adding various suffixes to word stems. The Turkish language, also known as Türkçe, adopts the Latin alphabet with a few modifications due to specific letters representing distinctive phonemes (speech sounds). Turkey made this shift from Arabic to the Latin alphabet in 1928 during the language reform that occurred after the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. The phrase \\"Harekete geç\\" can be translated as \\"Get moving\\" or \\"Take action\\" in English. It is a phrase often used to encourage someone to start something, whether it's initiating a project or beginning a journey. Turkish language history dates back to the Old Turkic or Gokturk script from the 8th century. Over time, it evolved through classic, middle, and new periods. The language's development was heavily influenced by interactions with various civilizations that ruled Anatolia, which is modern-day Turkey. Influences from different languages such as Arabic, Persian, and French contributed to Turkish vocabulary and its grammatical structure. As the Ottoman Empire expanded, the Ottoman Turkish language became a blend of Turkish, Persian, and Arabic features. Later on, the language reform led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk promoted the use of Turkish while replacing many loanwords with more native equivalents. Turkish is a phonetic language, which means each letter in the alphabet represents a specific sound. This feature provides consistency to pronunciation rules, and consequently, it's relatively straightforward for learners to read and pronounce Turkish words correctly. However, the grammar and complex sentence structures could pose challenges to non-native speakers. In terms of linguistic relations, Turkish is closely related to Turkmen, Azerbaijani, and Uzbek, but it is also distantly related to other Turkic languages like Kazakh and Kyrgyz. While most native Turkish speakers reside in Turkey, there's a growing diaspora population in countries like Germany, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom. In conclusion, \\"Harekete geç\\" is in Turkish, which is a Turkic language predominantly spoken in Turkey and Cyprus. The language has a rich history, influenced by various cultures and linguistic developments, and is closely related to several other Turkic languages. With Turkey's progressing role in regional and global affairs, Turkish has become an important language with increasing influence in Europe, Asia, and North Africa."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a more detailed and long answer: Hair color among Greeks has been a subject of interest for many researchers and is influenced by various genetic factors, including the interplay between multiple genes and gene-environment interactions. The distribution of hair color in Greece is not homogeneous across the country, with regional differences observed due to historical population movements and local environmental factors. Traditionally, Greeks have been categorized under the broader Mediterranean or Southern European group, sharing many phenotype traits with their neighbors, including Italians, Spaniards, and Portuguese. The predominant hair color among Greeks and Mediterranean people, in general, is dark brown to black, with an estimated prevalence of around 60-70%. Furthermore, light brown hair color has been observed in approximately 20-30% of the population, with the remaining population exhibiting light hair colors such as blonde or light ash brown. Notably, a noticeable proportion of Greeks, especially those from certain regions, exhibit lighter hair shades. For instance, the population of the Epirus region in Northwestern Greece and those residing in certain Aegean Islands demonstrate a higher prevalence of light hair colors, likely due to historical mixing with populations from Northern Europe and the Balkans. In line with these observations, a study published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology aimed to analyze the pigmentation phenotype of contemporary Greeks using objective measurements and found that light hair shades were not uncommon among Greeks, particularly among the younger generation. The study also revealed a gradient of hair color distribution with lighter hair more prevalent in participants from Northwestern Greece. In conclusion, the dominant hair color believed to be prevalent among Greeks is dark brown to black. However, regional differences and a significant percentage of individuals with lighter hair colors cannot be disregarded. To gain a more complete understanding of hair color prevalence in Greece, broader studies covering different geographic locations and diverse age groups are necessary."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Between 1987 and 2015, with a gap in 2010-12, he represented four constituencies as a Member of Parliament, elected as a candidate for the Labour Party and later the Respect Party. After becoming the youngest ever Chairman of the Scottish Labour Party in 1981, he became General Secretary of the London-based charity War on Want in 1983, remaining in the post until elected as MP for Glasgow Hillhead (later Glasgow Kelvin) at the 1987 general election. In 2003, Galloway was expelled from the Labour Party, having been found guilty by the party's national constitutional committee of four of the five charges of bringing the party into disrepute, including having called on Arabs to fight British troops. Context: In 1998, Galloway founded the Mariam Appeal which was intended, according to its website's welcome page in 1999, \\"to campaign against sanctions on Iraq which are having disastrous effects on the ordinary people of Iraq\\". The campaign was named after Mariam Hamza, a child flown by the fund from Iraq to Britain to receive treatment for leukaemia. The intention was to raise awareness of the suffering and death of hundreds of thousands of other Iraqi children, due to poor health conditions and lack of suitable medicines and facilities, and to campaign for the lifting of the Iraq sanctions that many maintained were responsible for that situation. In 1999, Galloway was criticised for spending Christmas in Iraq with Tariq Aziz, who was Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister at the time. In a 17 May 2005 hearing of the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Galloway stated that he had many meetings with Aziz, and characterised their relationship as friendly. In all, he has admitted to more than ten meetings with Aziz.  The fund received scrutiny during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, after a complaint that Galloway used some donated money to pay for his travel expenses. He responded by stating that the expenses were incurred in his capacity as the Appeal's chairman. Although the Mariam Appeal was never a registered charity and never intended to be such, it was investigated by the Charity Commission. The report of this year-long inquiry, published in June 2004, found that the Mariam Appeal was undertaking charitable work (and so ought to have registered with them), but did not substantiate allegations that any funds had been misused. It emerged some years later that Galloway had appealed in a letter dated 24 April 2003 to Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney-General, to stop the investigation into the Mariam Appeal. According to a report in The Times, after the letter was released under the Freedom of Information Act, Galloway falsely asserted that the Appeal \\"received no money from Iraq\\".  A further Charity Commission Report published on 7 June 2007 found that the Appeal had received funds from Fawaz Zureikat that originated from the Oil For Food programme, and concluded that:  Although Mr Galloway, Mr Halford and Mr Al-Mukhtar have confirmed that they were unaware of the source of Mr Zureikat's donations, the Commission has concluded that the charity trustees should have made further enquiries when accepting such large single and cumulative donations to satisfy themselves as to their origin and legitimacy. The Commission's conclusion is that the charity trustees did not properly discharge their duty of care as trustees to the Appeal in respect of these donations ... The Commission is also concerned, having considered the totality of the evidence before it, that Mr Galloway may also have known of the connection between the Appeal and the Programme.  Galloway, in response, stated: \\"I've always disputed the Commission's retrospective view that a campaign to win a change in national and international policy - a political campaign - was, in fact, a charity\\". Question: What was the appeal meant to do? Answer:","output":"The Mariam Appeal was created by George Galloway to raise awareness about the suffering of Iraqi people, especially children, due to poor health conditions and lack of suitable medicines and facilities. The appeal aimed to campaign against sanctions on Iraq that many believed were responsible for the situation. It was named after Mariam Hamza, a child who was flown from Iraq to Britain for treatment of leukemia, as an example of the hundreds of thousands of other Iraqi children in need."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person will try to exercise more happens, how will it affect LESS food being digested.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The perturbation you are suggesting is that a person exercises more, and you would like to know if this has any effect on the digestion process, specifically, if it results in less food being digested. Exercise can have both direct and indirect effects on the digestion process. 1. Direct effect: When a person exercises, their body's primary focus shifts towards providing energy to the muscles involved in the exercise, increasing blood flow and oxygen supply to these muscles. The body's response to exercise diverts blood flow away from the digestive system and redistributes it to the muscles. As a result, the digestive process may temporarily slow down due to reduced blood flow and therefore less efficient digestion of food. However, this effect is typically temporary, and once the exercise is completed, the blood flow to the digestive system should return to normal rates, allowing the digestion process to continue as usual. 2. Indirect effect: Engaging in regular exercise can improve overall gut health and digestion efficiency in the long run. Exercise helps maintain a healthy weight and prevent obesity, which in turn can reduce the risk of developing gastrointestinal problems. Additionally, exercise aids in the movement of food through the digestive tract and helps prevent constipation. Regular physical activity is also linked to a healthier gut microbiome, which plays an essential role in digestion and overall gut health. While it is possible that exercising more might temporarily slow down the digestion process, the indirect benefits of exercise have a more considerable overall positive impact on the digestive system. If a person is concerned about negative impacts on their digestion due to increased exercise, they should ensure proper nutrition, hydration, and gradually increase their exercise routine, allowing their body to adjust to the new demands."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Judy Chicago (born Judith Sylvia Cohen, July 20, 1939) is an American feminist artist, art educator, and writer known for her large collaborative art installation pieces about birth and creation images, which examine the role of women in history and culture. By the 1970s, Chicago had founded the first feminist art program in the United States. Chicago's work incorporates a variety of artistic skills, such as needlework, counterbalanced with labor-intensive skills such as welding and pyrotechnics. Chicago's most well known work is The Dinner Party, which is permanently installed in the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum. While at UCLA, she became politically active, designing posters for the UCLA NAACP chapter and eventually became its corresponding secretary. In June 1959, she met and became romantically linked with Jerry Gerowitz. She left school and moved in with him, for the first time having her own studio space. The couple hitch hiked to New York in 1959, just as Chicago's mother and brother moved to Los Angeles to be closer to her. The couple lived in Greenwich Village for a time, before returning in 1960 from Los Angeles to Chicago so she could finish her degree. Chicago married Gerowitz in 1961. She graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1962 and was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Society. Gerowitz died in a car crash in 1963, devastating Chicago and causing her to suffer from an identity crisis until later that decade. She received her Master of Fine Arts from UCLA in 1964.  While in grad school, Chicago's created a series that was abstract, yet easily recognized as male and female sexual organs. These early works were called Bigamy, and represented the death of her husband. One depicted an abstract penis, which was \\"stopped in flight\\" before it could unite with a vaginal form. Her professors, who were mainly men, were dismayed over these works. Despite the use of sexual organs in her work, Chicago refrained from using gender politics or identity as themes.  In 1965, Chicago displayed work in her first solo show, at the Rolf Nelson Gallery in Los Angeles; Chicago was one of only four female artists to take part in the show. In 1968, Chicago was asked why she did not participate in the \\"California Women in the Arts\\" exhibition at the Lytton Center, to which she answered, \\"I won't show in any group defined as Woman, Jewish, or California. Someday when we all grow up there will be no labels.\\" Chicago began working in ice sculpture, which represented \\"a metaphor for the preciousness of life,\\" another reference towards her husband's death.  In 1969, the Pasadena Art Museum exhibited a series of Chicago's spherical acrylic plastic dome sculptures and drawings in an \\"experimental\\" gallery. Art in America noted that Chicago's work was at the forefront of the conceptual art movement, and the Los Angeles Times described the work as showing no signs of \\"theoretical New York type art.\\" Chicago would describe her early artwork as minimalist and as her trying to be \\"one of the boys\\". Chicago would also experiment with performance art, using fireworks and pyrotechnics to create \\"atmospheres\\", which involved flashes of colored smoke being manipulated outdoors. Through this work she attempted to \\"feminize\\" and \\"soften\\" the landscape.  During this time, Chicago also began exploring her own sexuality in her work. She created the Pasadena Lifesavers, which was a series of abstract paintings that placed acrylic paint on Plexiglas. The works blended colors to create an illusion that the shapes \\"turn, dissolve, open, close, vibrate, gesture, wiggle,\\" representing her own discovery that \\"I was multi-orgasmic.\\" Chicago credited Pasadena Lifesavers, as being the major turning point in her work in relation to women's sexuality and representation.

Question: suppose If there is no water or fluid to drink happens, how will it affect If more fluid enters the body.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: less Step-by-step explanation: 1. The process begins with fluid waste entering the kidneys.  - Fluid intake is crucial in this process as it allows for the waste to enter the kidneys and be processed accordingly. 2. A processing moment in the kidneys allows waste and fluid to pass.  - If there is no water or fluid to drink, the body will have less fluid available to process the waste. 3. The kidneys prevent larger molecules from passing.  - This process remains unaffected as it relies on the kidney's ability to filter and not the amount of fluid intake. 4. Fluid goes back to the bloodstream.  - With less fluid available due to no water or fluid intake, less fluid will return to the bloodstream. This may lead to dehydration and reduced efficiency in detoxifying the body. 5. Bad waste is removed.  - This process relies on the available fluid to remove waste from the body. With less fluid to work with, the waste removal will be less efficient. 6. The final product is turned into urine.  - Less fluid intake will result in a decrease in urine production, as there is less fluid for the kidneys to process. In conclusion, if there is no water or fluid to drink, it will result in less fluid entering the body, which, in turn, will affect waste processing efficiency and urine production."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Read this: Genetics compression algorithms are the latest generation of lossless algorithms that compress data (typically sequences of nucleotides) using both conventional compression algorithms and genetic algorithms adapted to the specific datatype. In 2012, a team of scientists from Johns Hopkins University published a genetic compression algorithm that does not use a reference genome for compression. HAPZIPPER was tailored for HapMap data and achieves over 20-fold compression (95% reduction in file size), providing 2- to 4-fold better compression and in much faster time than the leading general-purpose compression utilities. For this, Chanda, Elhaik, and Bader introduced MAF based encoding (MAFE), which reduces the heterogeneity of the dataset by sorting SNPs by their minor allele frequency, thus homogenizing the dataset. Other algorithms in 2009 and 2013 (DNAZip and GenomeZip) have compression ratios of up to 1200-fold—allowing 6 billion basepair diploid human genomes to be stored in 2.5 megabytes (relative to a reference genome or averaged over many genomes).

Step 3: Check if our loop finds any factors that evenly divide the given number. If it does, the number is not a prime, and we can output 'No' and stop testing further. If the loop finishes without finding any factors, then 82613 is a prime number, and we can output 'Yes'. While checking divisions from 2 to 288 for 82613: - No factors are found during the loop. Since no factors were found during the check, this means 82613 is prime. Output: Yes"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data: Arròs negre, country, Spain; Arròs negre, ingredient, White rice. Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"Arròs negre is a traditional and popular Spanish dish that originates from the Valencia and Catalonia regions of Spain. The name 'Arròs negre' translates to 'black rice' in English, which is due to the signature dark color of the dish that comes from its main ingredient, squid ink. This dish holds an important cultural significance in Spain, as it is often served during family gatherings and festive occasions, reflecting the country's rich culinary history and passion for delicious, flavorful food. Ingredients and Preparation: Among the key ingredients of Arròs negre is white rice, which serves as the base component of this dish. The rice is typically short-grain, and it is essential to use a variety that is capable of absorbing the flavors and liquid without becoming too mushy. The most commonly used variety is Bomba rice, which is grown in the Valencia region, although other short-grain rice varieties can also be used if Bomba rice is not available. Besides white rice, the other essential ingredient in Arròs negre is squid ink. The ink imparts the dish's characteristic black color and lends a rich, earthy flavor profile, enhancing the overall taste immensely. Fresh squid and cuttlefish are used in the dish, as they provide the ink that colors the rice and infuse flavor into the dish. Apart from these main ingredients, the dish features a myriad of other ingredients that contribute to its complex flavor. These include garlic, onion, bell peppers, tomatoes, green peas, fish stock, and an assortment of spices like saffron, paprika, and cayenne pepper. The dish is often prepared using a large, shallow pan called a paellera, which allows for even heat distribution and perfect cooking of the ingredients. First, vegetables such as onions, garlic, and bell peppers are sautéed, followed by the addition of squid or cuttlefish and the squid ink. The rice is then added to the pan and coated in the ink mixture before being cooked in a well-seasoned fish broth. The dish is typically simmered until the rice is fully cooked and has absorbed the stock and flavors from the other ingredients. Variations and Serving Suggestions: While the traditional version of Arròs negre is enjoyed and cherished in Spain, there are numerous variations of the dish that add different ingredients to cater to regional tastes or personal preferences. Some people may include seafood like shrimp or mussels, while others may add vegetables like artichokes. The dish can also be adapted to cater to specific dietary requirements, such as substituting vegetable stock for fish stock in a vegetarian version. Arròs negre is best enjoyed hot, often served directly from the paellera in which it was cooked. It is typically accompanied by thick garlic aioli or a squeeze of fresh lemon to enhance the flavors of the dish. Paired with a simple green salad and crusty bread, Arròs negre makes for a satisfying and delightful meal that showcases the diverse culinary traditions and rich flavors of Spain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If \\"a man is underwater sitting at the bottom of the pool\\", can we conclude \\"The man is trying to hold his breath as long as possible.\\"?","output":"We cannot definitively conclude that \\"The man is trying to hold his breath as long as possible\\" based solely on the information given, which is \\"a man is underwater sitting at the bottom of the pool.\\" Here's a more detailed analysis of the possibilities and factors at play: 1. Holding breath for a challenge or training: The man could be holding his breath to see how long he can do so, as a self-imposed challenge or to train for activities like freediving or swimming. However, we cannot confirm this without more context. 2. Relaxation or meditation: Sitting at the bottom of a pool can be a form of relaxation or meditation for some people. Being submerged in water can provide a sense of tranquility and a unique sensory experience, helping the person to relax and clear their mind. Again, we cannot confirm this without additional information. 3. Performing a task underwater: The man could be underwater for a specific purpose, such as cleaning the pool, retrieving a lost item, or participating in an underwater activity. In such cases, he will hold his breath long enough to complete the task, but this does not necessarily mean he's trying to hold his breath for an extended period. 4. An accident or emergency: If the man is in distress and unable to rise to the surface, such as due to an injury or being trapped, he would need to hold his breath involuntarily but may not be purposefully attempting to hold his breath for as long as possible. Ensuring his safety would be the primary concern in this situation. 5. Breath-holding techniques or equipment: The man might be using techniques to hold his breath longer, such as hyperventilation or specific breathing methods practiced by freedivers. Alternatively, he could be using breathing equipment such as a snorkel or scuba gear, rendering the need to hold his breath less crucial. In conclusion, while it is a possibility that the man is trying to hold his breath as long as possible, there are many alternative reasons for a man being underwater and sitting at the bottom of the pool.

Carol has been visiting a psychoanalyst (George Rigaud) because of a string of disturbing dreams shes been having featuring her decadent neighbor, Julia Durer (Anita Strindberg). Julia's frequent, late-night parties infuriate and yet exite Carol, evoking images of wild sex-and-drug orgies.During a meeting between Edmund and Frank, they talk about their recent court cases in which Edmund asks Frank if he has been unfaithful to Carol, which Frank denies.

The cocky lead character beat the odds again, he then made a quip about ever rule having its what? - capsulize idea - train - suck - exception - anarchy  The best answer is Answer:","output":"The best answer is \\"exception\\". The saying that every rule has its exception is a popular adage that suggests, regardless of seeming infallibility or general applicability, every rule may have scenarios in which it does not apply. This phrase, in its essence, communicates nuances, versatility, and the unpredictability of life or situations.  The story sphere seems to revolve around a cocky lead character who continually triumphs against the odds. Such characters often exhibit smart witticism, audacity, or a knack for fortuitous turns of events. They typically captivate readers or viewers with their unorthodox approach to challenges, appearing to break the rules yet emerging victorious. By making a quip that every rule has its 'exception', the character is using humor and sarcasm to assert his rebellious streak. He seems to be decrying the status quo or established norms, presenting himself as the exception who doesn't adhere to traditional rules and regulations. The 'exception' in this case may symbolize a deviation from the normative, a breaking from tradition, an avant-gardism trait, or an innovative spirit. The term 'exception', in contrast to 'capsulize idea', 'train', 'suck', or 'anarchy', fits into this context more suitably. While the other words could be used metaphorically within certain contexts, they do not directly convey the implication of being an anomaly or 'exception' to the rule. 'Capsulize idea' may suggest a summarized or condensed notion, 'train' could denote instruction or a mode of transportation, 'suck' might express a negative sentiment, and 'anarchy' signifies lawlessness or disorder; none of these words inherently imply an exception to a rule. So, in the context of your scenario where the cocky lead character triumphs against odds and uses a quip about every rule, the phrase that completes the statement logically and congruently is \\"Every rule has its exception\\". Whether this signifies the character's audacious prowess, deviant strategies, or nonconformist thinking, it undoubtedly adds to his distinctive, rule-defying persona."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Classic Roker-isms that left “Today” producers wincing include when he insulted a woman by asking if her husband was her father, and telling a mother in the crowd on the “Today” plaza on Oct. 15 that her crying baby looked like a “Japanese anime.”      And let’s not forget the time when he famously joked about Ann Curry during a 2012 chat with Olympic rowers who said the crew throws a teammate into the water after a win. Al snorted, “Which is different than our tradition, which is to throw one of us under the bus.

Problem:Paragraph- Sent 1: Imagine you are standing in a farm field in central Illinois. Sent 2: The land is so flat you can see for miles and miles. Sent 3: On a clear day, you might see a grain silo 20 miles away. Sent 4: You might think to yourself, it sure is flat around here. Sent 5: If you drive one hundred miles to the south, the landscape changes. Sent 6: In southern Illinois, there are rolling hills. Sent 7: Why do you think this is? Sent 8: What could have caused these features? Sent 9: There are no big rivers that may have eroded and deposited this material. Sent 10: The ground is capable of supporting grass and trees, so wind erosion would not explain it. Sent 11: To answer the question, you need to go back 12,000 years. Sent 12: Around 12,000 years ago, a giant ice sheet covered much of the Midwest United States. Sent 13: Springfield, Illinois, was covered by over a mile of ice. Sent 14: Its hard to imagine a mile thick sheet of ice. Sent 15: The massive ice sheet, called a glacier, caused the features on the land you see today. Sent 16: Where did glaciers go? Sent 17: Where can you see them today? Sent 18: Glaciers are masses of flowing ice.  Question: What are glaciers and what affect do they have on land?. Solution:","output":"Part #1: Writing an incorrect answer Usage: Incorrect answer: Glaciers are large bodies of water that move slowly across land. Explanation: This meets the criteria because it is closely related to the actual definition of glaciers, but it incorrectly refers to them as water instead of ice. This will challenge students who didn't read the paragraph carefully. Part #2: Closely related to the content of the paragraph and/or the question Usage: Incorrect answer: Glaciers are winds that cause erosion of the land. Explanation: This meets the criteria because it is related to the content of the paragraph, specifically Sentence 10, which discusses wind erosion as a plausible explanation for the landscape features. However, this answer does not truthfully respond to the question about what glaciers are and their effect on the land. Part #3: Similar to the given correct answer Usage: Incorrect answer: Glaciers are masses of ice that slowly flow across the land, causing erosion and shaping the landscape. Explanation: This meets the criteria because it is similar to the correct answer, which describes glaciers as masses of flowing ice that caused the land features. However, this answer incorrectly implies that glaciers primarily cause erosion, rather than creating landscape features. Part #4: Prevent those who skip the paragraph from answering the question Usage: Incorrect answer: Glaciers are responsible for creating flat, rolling hills in southern Illinois. Explanation: This meets the criteria because someone who skipped the paragraph might think this is true, since the paragraph discusses a switch from flat land to rolling hills in southern Illinois. But actually reading the paragraph would show that glaciers are responsible for the overall landscape features, not just rolling hills in the south. Part #5: Not trivial and not easily eliminated without reading the paragraph Usage: Incorrect answer: Glaciers are masses of ice that melted 12,000 years ago, causing the flat landscape in central Illinois. Explanation: This meets the criteria because it includes details from the paragraph about the time frame of the glacier (12,000 years ago) and the resulting landscape (flat). However, without reading the paragraph, a student wouldn't necessarily know that the ice sheet covered much of the Midwest United States, not just Illinois, and that the glacier's melting caused various landscape features rather than just flatness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Bette Midler (; born December 1, 1945) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, comedian, and film producer. Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Midler began her professional career in several Off-Off-Broadway plays, prior to her engagements in Fiddler on the Roof and Salvation on Broadway in the late 1960s. She came to prominence in 1970 when she began singing in the Continental Baths, a local gay bathhouse where she managed to build up a core following. Since 1970, Midler has released 14 studio albums as a solo artist. Midler released a new Christmas album titled Cool Yule in 2006, which featured a duet of Christmastime pop standards \\"Winter Wonderland\\"/\\"Let It Snow\\" with Johnny Mathis. Well-received, the album garnered a Grammy Award nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album in 2007. The same year, Midler returned to the big screen, appearing in Then She Found Me, Helen Hunt's feature film directorial debut. Also starring Hunt along with Matthew Broderick and Colin Firth, the comedy-drama film tells the story of a 39-year-old Brooklyn elementary school teacher, who after years is contacted by the flamboyant host of a local talk show, played by Midler, who introduces herself as her biological mother. Critical response to the film was mixed; whereas some critics praised the film for having strong performances, others felt the film was bogged down by a weak script and technical issues.  Midler debuted her Vegas show titled Bette Midler: The Showgirl Must Go On at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace on February 20, 2008. It comprised The Staggering Harlettes, 20 female dancers called The Caesar Salad Girls and a 13-piece band. The show played its final performance on January 31, 2010, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music, or Comedy Special in 2011. Also in 2008, another compilation album by Midler, Jackpot: The Best Bette, was released. It reached number 66 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, and number six in the United Kingdom, where it was certified platinum for sales of over 300,000 copies. As her only film appearance that year, Midler had a small role in Diane English's comedy film The Women, starring Meg Ryan, Annette Bening and Eva Mendes among others. An updated version of the George Cukor-directed 1939 film of the same name based on a 1936 play by Clare Boothe Luce, the film was widely panned by critics, who found it \\"...a toothless remake of the 1939 classic, lacking the charm, wit and compelling protagonists of the original.\\"  Midler appeared on the Bravo TV show My Life on the D-List with Kathy Griffin in an episode that aired in June 2009. In December of the same year, she appeared in the Royal Variety Performance, an annual British charity event attended by Queen Elizabeth II. Midler performed \\"In My Life\\" and \\"Wind Beneath My Wings\\" as the closing act. In 2010, Midler voiced the character Kitty Galore in the animated film Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore. The film was a success, grossing 112 million worldwide. In November 2010, Midler released Memories of You, another compilation of lesser known tracks from her catalog. Midler was one of the producers of the Broadway production of the musical Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, which opened in February 2011.

Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made. The first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons. Firstly, it was my absolute favourite of all the Okoii products I tried; and secondly, it was actually the product that I was most fearful of trying. Why?

But one brand name is booming   in Japan during the economic slowdown--Mickey Mouse. According to the company that runs Tokyo Disneyland, Japan's busiest theme park will be more packed than ever over Christmas and New Year's Day.

The park's operator, Oriental Land Co, estimates   a record 26.5 million people will visit Tokyo Disneyland and its nearby sister park, Disneysea, during the financial year ending in March. The company is forecasting sales of a record 4.2 billion, up almost 10 percent. \\"In a way, the economy works well for Tokyo Disneyland,\\" said Hiroshi Watanabe, an economist at the Tokyo-based Daiwa Research Institute. \\"Because of the economic depression, people have stopped buying cars and houses or going to Hawaii, and Tokyo Disneyland offers an affordable and pleasant _ .\\" Around the world, Disney's theme parks have been a bright spot for the brand this year as people seem to look for an escape from bad times.

British Swimming is the latest body to investigate claims of \\"bullying\\", while several ex-riders have spoken of a \\"culture of fear\\" at British Cycling. \\"We must prove we can win medals with a duty of care,\\" Grey-Thompson said. Speaking at a debate organised by the BBC as part of its State of Sport coverage, she added: \\"We've proved we can win medals. I don't think having a duty of care diminishes our chances of winning. \\"We can't make it all warm and cuddly - because that is not what elite sport is. But it is about getting the best talent and not leaving athletes broken at the end of it.\\" Grey-Thompson's report - due for publication \\"imminently\\", she said -  was commissioned by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. \\"There are some really good sports out there; there are sports that need to do much more,\\" she added. \\"My report doesn't mention a sport in particular, it doesn't mention a particular person in it. It's about the principles of how sport should be as we go forward.\\" On Thursday, Wendy Houvenaghel became the latest high-profile cyclist to come forward with criticisms of British Cycling's World Class programme - following Jess Varnish, Nicole Cooke and Emma Pooley. Houvenaghel said a \\"medal at any cost\\" approach created a \\"culture of fear\\" at the organisation, which she accused of \\"ageism\\" and having \\"zero regard\\" for her welfare. Later on Thursday, BBC sports editor Dan Roan exclusively reported on British Swimming's investigation into multiple bullying claims made by Paralympians about a coach. Swimming was Britain's most successful sport at the Rio Paralympics. The British team won 47 medals - 16 golds of 152 available - and set eight world records. Media playback is not supported on this device Also speaking at Friday's debate, UK Sport chief executive Liz Nichol described the athletes' testimonies as \\"a wake-up call for sport\\". \\"We have to be much more aware of responsibilities, beyond the responsibility of helping athletes achieve what they all aspire to,\\" she said \\"It's clear it can be better, and it will be better. This is a big step-up for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics cycle.\\" UK Sport is the funding body for Olympic and Paralympic sports in Britain. When Nichol was asked whether linking funding to medal targets might have a negative effect on athlete welfare, she replied: \\"We don't reward success, we invest in potential. Speaking about British Cycling's 39-point action plan response to failures identified in a leaked draft report into its World Class Programme, Nichol added: \\"This is something that is very significant. \\"Every sport can learn from it and every sport should be looking at the cycling plan and checking to see if they are doing things properly. \\"Yes it is uncomfortable, but it is right that athletes are speaking out.

Process:  - The human body takes a breath inward - Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen - The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue -   suppose exercising more heavily happens, how will it affect \\"less oxygen being brought to the bodys cells\\".  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"Exercising more heavily affects the process by indirectly impacting a step of the process. When we exercise, the body demands more oxygen to produce energy for the muscles and maintain proper cellular function. In response to this increased demand, the body undergoes several physiological and respiratory changes to adapt and provide the needed oxygen to the body's cells. During heavy exercise, the respiratory rate and the depth of breaths increase. This means you take in more air and therefore more oxygen with each breath, which helps to ensure that the lungs can keep up with the body's increased oxygen demands. This affects the first step of the process where the human body takes a breath inward. The heart rate also increases when exercising. An increased heart rate results in a faster circulation of blood throughout the body, ensuring that red blood cells can deliver oxygen to the cells and tissues more quickly. This indirectly impacts the step in the process where red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach various tissues. Furthermore, during heavy exercise, the capillaries within the muscles dilate or widen to promote increased blood flow to the working muscles. This allows for more efficient oxygen exchange within the small capillaries where the heme release the oxygen. This indirectly impacts the step of the process in which oxygen is released and is transported to the cells within the tissue. It is worth noting that when exercising at very high intensities or for prolonged periods, it is possible that the body's oxygen needs may temporarily exceed its ability to deliver oxygen. In such cases, the body compensates by relying more on anaerobic (without oxygen) energy pathways. However, this is not a direct perturbation of the oxygen transport process; rather, it is a temporary adjustment to meet the increased demands of heavy exercise. In conclusion, exercising more heavily indirectly impacts the process of oxygen transportation in the body. Various physiological and respiratory adjustments are made to meet the increased oxygen demands of the body's cells, promoting overall efficiency in oxygen delivery and utilization during periods of intense exercise."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a short passage that may convey stereotype, anti-stereotype, or is unrelated.

Q: Passage: Hoping to rebound from their blowout loss at Green Bay, the Broncos returned home for an AFC West duel with the San Diego Chargers. The Chargers took the early lead in the first quarter, with a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Nick Novak. The Broncos grabbed the lead, when cornerback Cassius Vaughn returned an interception off Chargers' quarterback Philip Rivers 55 yards for a touchdown. The Chargers responded, with a 32-yard field goal by Novak. The Broncos extended their lead in the second quarter, with a 32-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. However, the Chargers would re-claim the lead, with a 2-yard touchdown run by Rivers, a 28-yard field goal by Novak, followed by a 42-yard touchdown pass from Rivers to wide receiver Malcom Floyd, giving San Diego a 23-10 halftime lead. The Broncos benched quarterback Kyle Orton in favor of Tim Tebow. After a scoreless third quarter, the Chargers added to their lead, with a 51-yard field goal by Novak. The Broncos responded, when Tebow scrambled for a 12-yard touchdown (with a two-point conversion run by running back Willis McGahee), then threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to running back Knowshon Moreno (with a failed two-point conversion attempt), to pull the Broncos to within 26-24 with just over three minutes left in the game. The Chargers responded, with a 35-yard field goal by Novak. The Broncos tried to rally with 24 seconds remaining in regulation, but Tebow's last-second desperation pass into the end zone was unsuccessful, sealing the win for San Diego.

At his news conference, Trump said the war games were expensive, provocative and inappropriate. ​Later, a Pentagon spokesman said Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was \\"not surprised\\" by Trump's concession ending the war games and had been consulted, including discussions with Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. \\"We welcome the outcomes,\\" the defense spokesman said. \\"We support them.\\" Trump struck an optimistic tone about his talks with Kim. \\"My meeting with Chairman Kim was honest, direct and productive.

Input: Passage: Charles V returned to Spain on July 16, 1522.  Acts of repression and retaliation against former comuneros did occur, but only sporadically.  Embarrassingly large numbers of important people had supported the comuneros, or at least were suspiciously slow to declare allegiance to the king, and Charles thought it unwise to press the issue too much. Back in Valladolid, Charles declared a general pardon on November 1.  The pardon gave amnesty to everyone involved in the revolt with the exception of 293 comuneros, a small figure given the huge number of rebels.  Both Pacheco and Bishop Acuña were among the 293 excluded from the pardon.  More pardons were issued later, after pressure from the Cortes; by 1527, the repression was completely at end.  Of the 293, 23 were executed, 20 died in prison, 50 purchased amnesty, and 100 were pardoned later.  The fates of the rest are unknown. Output:","output":"1.

Available options: 1). no; 2). yes;","output":"2). yes; Both statements convey the same meaning but with a slight difference in structure. Both describe the outcome of the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia, which resulted in a shift of leadership and a change in the country's political affiliations. In the first sentence, \\"The 2003 Rose Revolution replaced Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili with Eduard Shevardnadze, who has promoted closer ties with western institutions including NATO,\\" the main event is depicted as the Rose Revolution, which took place in 2003. This sentence suggests that the revolution led to a change in the Georgian leadership, with Mikheil Saakashvili being replaced by Eduard Shevardnadze as the president. The sentence then continues to describe the new president's motive as promoting closer ties with western institutions, including NATO. However, the second sentence, \\"The Rose Revolution of 2003 replaced Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze with Mikheil Saakashvili, who has promoted closer relations with Western institutions, including NATO,\\" states the same event, the 2003 Rose Revolution, but phrases it more clearly than the first. In this sentence, it is directly explained that the Rose Revolution resulted in Eduard Shevardnadze being replaced by Mikheil Saakashvili as the president of Georgia. The rest of the sentence, like the first one, elaborates on the new president's objective - to promote closer relations with Western institutions, including NATO. It is clear that both sentences refer to the same historical event, the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia, and its implications for the country's leadership and international affiliations. The only difference is the sentence structure, but the overall meaning remains consistent between the two statements.

Step 2: Understand the hypothesis The hypothesis states that an action ('increment it') must be taken if a particular scenario occurs. Here, \\"must\\" implies a necessity or an obligation. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis The premise talks about a possibility of increasing something, while the hypothesis talks about a necessity to increment it under a specific scenario. Although there is a relation between both statements as they discuss increasing or incrementing something, the premise does not provide enough information to conclude that the hypothesis is true.

During the long sea voyage, Capt. Christopher Jones falls in love with Dorothy Bradford, the wife of William Bradford. The love triangle is resolved in a tragic way at the film's conclusion.  Ship's carpenter John Alden -- said to be the first person to set foot on Plymouth Rock in 1620—catches the eye of Priscilla Mullins, one of the young Pilgrims following William Bradford.  Alden ultimately wins Priscilla in another, if subtler, triangle with Miles Standish.   Lloyd Bridges provides comic relief as the first-mate Coppin, and child star Tommy Ivo gives a touching performance as young William Button, the only passenger to die on the actual voyage across the storm-swept Atlantic, who, according to this film, wanted to be the first to sight land and to become a king in the New World. \\"I'm going to be the first to see land.

Information:  - A pub, or public house, is an establishment licensed to sell alcoholic drinks, which traditionally include beer, ale and other brewed alcoholic drinks. It is a relaxed, social drinking establishment and a prominent part of British culture, Irish culture, New Zealand culture and Australian culture. In many places, especially in villages, a pub is the focal point of the community. In his 17th century diary Samuel Pepys described the pub as \\"the heart of England.\\"  - Samuel Pepys (; 23 February 1633  26 May 1703) was an administrator of the navy of England and Member of Parliament who is most famous for the diary that he kept for a decade while still a relatively young man. Pepys had no maritime experience, but he rose to be the Chief Secretary to the Admiralty under both King Charles II and King James II through patronage, hard work, and his talent for administration. His influence and reforms at the Admiralty were important in the early professionalisation of the Royal Navy.  - Introduction. An award is something given to a person, a group of people, or an organization to recognize their excellence in a certain field; a certificate of excellence. Awards are often signified by trophies, titles, certificates, commemorative plaques, medals, badges, pins, or ribbons. An award may carry a monetary prize given to the recipient; for example, the Nobel Prize for contributions to society or the Pulitzer Prize for literary achievements. An award may also simply be a public acknowledgment of excellence, without any tangible token or prize of excellence.  - A resource is a source or supply from which benefit is produced. Resources are two types based upon their availability they are renewable and non renewable resource s.Typically resources are materials, energy, services, staff, knowledge, or other assets that are transformed to produce benefit and in the process may be consumed or made unavailable. Benefits of resource utilization may include increased wealth or wants, proper functioning of a system, or enhanced well being. From a human perspective a natural resource is anything obtained from the environment to satisfy human needs and wants. From a broader biological or ecological perspective a resource satisfies the needs of a living organism (see biological resource).  - Leadership is both a research area and a practical skill encompassing the ability of an individual or organization to \\"lead\\" or guide other individuals, teams, or entire organizations. The literature debates various viewpoints: contrasting Eastern and Western approaches to leadership, and also (within the West) US vs. European approaches. US academic environments define leadership as \\"a process of social influence in which a person can enlist the aid and support of others in the accomplishment of a common task\\". Leadership seen from a European and non-academic perspective encompasses a view of a leader who can be moved not only by communitarian goals but also by the search for personal power.  - In game theory and economic theory, a zero-sum game is a mathematical representation of a situation in which each participant's gain or loss of utility is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the utility of the other participants. If the total gains of the participants are added up and the total losses are subtracted, they will sum to zero. Thus, cutting a cake, where taking a larger piece reduces the amount of cake available for others, is a zero-sum game if all participants value each unit of cake equally (see marginal utility).   - A drinking establishment is a business whose primary function is the serving of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. Some establishments may also serve food, or have entertainment, but their main purpose is to serve alcoholic beverages. There are different types of drinking establishment ranging from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed \\"dive bars\\", to 5,000 seat beer halls and elegant places of entertainment for the elite. A public house, informally known as a \\"pub\\", is an establishment licensed to serve alcoholic drinks for consumption on the premises in countries and regions of British influence. Although the terms are increasingly used to refer to the same thing, there is a difference between pubs, bars, inns, taverns and lounges where alcohol is served commercially. A tavern or pot-house is, loosely, a place of business where people gather to drink alcoholic beverages and, more than likely, also be served food, though not licensed to put up guests. The word derives from the Latin \\"taberna\\" and the Greek \\"\\"/taverna.  - A game is structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).  - An alcoholic drink, or alcoholic beverage, is a drink that contains a substantial amount of ethanol (informally called \\"alcohol\\"), a depressant which in low doses causes euphoria, reduced anxiety, and sociability and in higher doses causes intoxication (drunkenness), stupor and unconsciousness. Long-term use can lead to alcohol abuse, physical dependence, and alcoholism.  - The National Pub of the Year is an annual competition held by CAMRA in February that finds the best pub in the UK . Established in 1988 , the competition helps to highlight quality pubs around the UK that are worth seeking out and visiting . Each year , each local CAMRA branch nominates one pub in their area to be entered . These 200 pubs then go through to the regional competition , which then whittles down to 4 pubs to go to the national final . The pubs in the national final are evaluated on : Quality of the Real Ales served Value for money Atmosphere Interior decoration Customer service and welcome  - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties.  - Beer is the world's oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic drink; it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea. The production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of starches, mainly derived from cereal grainsmost commonly malted barley, although wheat, maize (corn), and rice are widely used. Most beer is flavoured with hops, which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings such as herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and replaced with forced carbonation. Some of humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer and beer parlours, and \\"The Hymn to Ninkasi\\", a prayer to the Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.  - Competition is, in general, a contest or rivalry between two or more organisms, animals, individuals, economic groups or social groups, etc., for territory, a niche, for resources, goods, for mates, for prestige, recognition, for awards, for group or social status, or for leadership and profit. It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared, where one's gain is the other's loss (a zero-sum game).    What entity does 'national pub of the year' has the relation 'instance of' with? A:","output":"The 'National Pub of the Year' has a relation 'instance of' with an \\"award\\" or \\"competition.\\" It is an annual event that recognizes the best pub in the UK based on various criteria such as the quality of real ales, customer service, atmosphere, and overall value for money.

Your dietitian may also recommend increasing your daily caloric intake by incorporating more nutrient-dense and energy-rich foods such as whole grains, healthy fats, and fruits or vegetables in their recommended forms for dialysis patients. Furthermore, they may suggest the inclusion of regular snacks between meals or incorporating nutritional supplements to help you reach your desired weight more effectively. Being mindful of portion sizes and adhering to the prescribed meal timings also enables better weight management.  Additionally, gaining weight when on dialysis may require a focus on physical activity and muscle strengthening exercises to ensure increased weight is gained in the form of lean body mass rather than fat. Your dietitian might coordinate with your healthcare team and an exercise professional to design an exercise program tailored to your specific needs and limitations, effectively complementing your individualized meal plan. Regular monitoring of your weight, overall health, and nutritional status is crucial in ensuring the effectiveness of your weight gain plan. This will allow your dietitian to make necessary adjustments in response to your body’s changing requirements and medical condition. Your healthcare team will continuously evaluate your bloodwork, including evaluating protein and nutrient levels, to ensure proper nutrient balance and adapting your plan as needed for optimal results. In summary, when aiming to gain weight while on dialysis, it is vital to seek the guidance and ongoing support of your registered dietitian who will facilitate the development of a personalized meal plan, recommend appropriate exercise regimens, and closely monitor your progress to ensure safe and healthy weight gain tailored to your unique situation. Remember to always communicate any concerns regarding your weight management, as they are essential partners in your health journey and ultimate well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This culinary delight brings together the irresistible taste of bacon and the spongy sweetness of a cupcake to create a harmonious blend of flavors that will have you wondering why you didn't try this sooner. Follow these easy steps to whip up a batch of tempting bacon-infused cupcakes that are perfect for any occasion. Preparing the Ingredients Before delving into the art of baking these unique cupcakes, gather all the necessary ingredients. You will need: - Bacon rashers (preferably thick-cut) - Cupcake mix or ingredients for making cupcakes from scratch - Eggs - Coffee - Buttermilk - Vegetable oil - Frosting - Chopped bacon for garnish Begin by cooking the bacon rashers to your desired level of crispiness. Drain the cooked bacon on a paper towel and let it cool. Once cool, roughly chop the bacon into small pieces. Set aside. Preparing the Cupcake Batter Creating an aromatic and well-balanced bacon-infused cupcake begins with the perfect batter. Add all the dry ingredients required for the cupcakes into a large mixing bowl. This may include flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt, depending on the specific recipe you are using. In a separate mixing bowl, combine the wet ingredients – eggs, coffee, buttermilk, and vegetable oil. The coffee will enhance the flavor profile of these cupcakes without overpowering the bacon. Similarly, buttermilk adds a moist texture and a slight tangy flavor to the mix, which complements the bacon's saltiness. Whisk the wet ingredients together until it becomes a smooth mixture. Slowly incorporate the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, stirring gently until the batter is uniformly mixed and free of lumps. Then, sprinkle ¾ of the chopped bacon into the cake batter and gently fold, ensuring that the bacon pieces are evenly distributed. Baking the Cupcakes Preheat your oven according to the cupcake recipe you're using (usually 350°F or 175°C). Line a cupcake tin with cake cases or silicone cups. Carefully pour the batter into the prepared cake cases or silicone cups, filling them about ¾ full to allow room for the cupcakes to rise. Place the loaded cupcake tray into the preheated oven. Bake the cupcakes for the recommended time mentioned in your recipe, typically 15-20 minutes. You can check the readiness of your cupcakes by inserting a toothpick or skewer into the center of a cupcake – if it comes out clean or with a few moist crumbs, the cupcakes are ready. Cooling and Frosting the Cupcakes Once the cupcakes have finished baking, remove the tray from the oven and allow it to cool for at least five minutes. Gently take the cupcakes out of the tray and place them on a cooling rack to cool completely. This step is crucial, as attempting to frost warm cupcakes will result in the frosting melting and becoming a mess. When the cupcakes have cooled completely, it's time to frost them. Select your preferred frosting, such as cream cheese, chocolate, or vanilla. Using a piping bag fitted with an appropriate nozzle or a flat spatula, frost the cupcakes in a decorative and appealing manner. For a finishing touch, sprinkle the remaining chopped bacon over the frosted cupcakes. Conclusion Bacon-infused cupcakes provide a unique combination of flavors that are sure to impress your friends and family. This savory-sweet delight will undoubtedly become one of your favorite desserts to share at gatherings, parties, or to enjoy by yourself. The blend of bacon and cupcakes is truly a match made in culinary heaven. Don't hesitate to indulge in this mouth-watering treat – you've earned it."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: I heard that Tracy was nowhere to be seen as they looked everywhere for her.  And I was wondering What does Tracy need to do before this? The answer is:","output":"Before Tracy found herself in a situation where she was nowhere to be seen and people were frantically searching for her, there are several steps and precautions she could have taken to ensure her safety, effective communication, and ease of finding her if needed. While it is not always possible to predict the circumstances that led to her disappearance, here is a detailed list of actions she could have taken prior to this event: 1. Inform someone before leaving: Tracy should have let a close friend, family member, or coworker know where she was going, with whom, and the approximate duration of her outing. By providing necessary information about her whereabouts, she would lessen the likelihood of any potential confusion or panic. 2. Have a plan in place: It's important to establish a proper plan and timeline for any outing, especially if Tracy is visiting a new and unfamiliar place. She should have researched the location, the routes she would take, any potential hazards, and notable landmarks she could use for easier navigation. 3. Carry personal identification and emergency contact details: Tracy should always have her ID, driver's license, or any other forms of identification, along with her emergency contact details (e.g., a close family member's phone number) with her. This information can be crucial in case of an emergency or if someone finds her belongings. 4. Keep her cell phone charged and easily accessible: A fully charged cell phone is an indispensable safety tool. Tracy should have ensured her phone was charged before leaving, and she should have kept it within easy reach. That way, she could easily stay in contact with others or even use various location-sharing applications to let her friends or family know her location. 5. Establish regular check-ins: Tracy could have set up regular check-ins with someone she trusted. She could have agreed to send text messages, make phone calls, or use other forms of communication at specific time intervals to provide updates on her whereabouts and overall well-being. 6. Use the buddy system: If possible, Tracy should have opted to go with a group or at least one other person. Large groups tend to be easier to spot, and having more people can lower the risk of losing someone. 7. Dress appropriately: Wearing bright or distinctive clothing can make it easier for others to notice and locate her in a crowd or a busy area. In addition, dressing for the weather and terrain conditions is important for overall safety and comfort during any outing. 8. Learn basic navigation skills and carry some navigation tools: Tracy could have equipped herself with knowledge of basic navigation skills like reading maps, using a compass, or even relying on natural navigational cues. Carrying a physical map or compass may further reduce the risk of getting lost. 9. Be mindful of time: It's essential for Tracy to keep track of time throughout her excursion. By doing so, she can ensure that time does not slip away, leading to concerns from her friends or family and potential search efforts. By implementing these safety measures and effective communication strategies before her outing, Tracy could have significantly reduced the chances of being lost or unreachable, and in turn, minimized the need for an exhaustive search for her."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a summary based on this article: In this family photo provided by Kevin Smith are Peggy and Kevin Smith of Dayton, Nev. Peggy was 4 months old when her father, Pfc. John Eddington, was killed in action in World War II. Seven decades... (Associated Press)      A World War II soldier's heartfelt letter to his daughter has finally reached her, seven decades after it was written.      Peggy Eddington-Smith received the letter penned by her father, Pfc. John Eddington, as well as his Bronze Star and Purple Heart medals, during an emotional ceremony Saturday in Dayton, Nev., about 40 miles southeast of Reno.      The father she never met wrote the three-page letter shortly after she was born and shortly before he died in Italy in June 1944. He sent it while stationed in Texas, just before he was sent overseas.      Getting his medals was nice, but the letter meant more because it made her feel closer to her father, Eddington-Smith said. She knew little about him since her mother could rarely bring herself to discuss the love of her life.      \\"The letter gave me more knowledge of who he was,\\" she told The Associated Press. \\"He poured out his heart to me, and a lot of men don't put that kind of emotion in writing. I'm just overwhelmed by everything, trying to absorb everything.\\"      Donna Gregory of St. Louis found the soldier's letter and other World War II memorabilia in a box 14 years ago while helping her then-husband clean out his grandparents' home in Arnold, Mo., a St. Louis suburb.      Gregory's voice cracked with emotion as she read the letter Saturday, bringing tears to Eddington-Smith and many in the crowd of about 150.      The soldier devoted the first page to his wife, saying he hoped she did not find it \\"silly\\" that he was writing a letter to a child who could not read.      Addressing the next two pages to his \\"darling\\" daughter, he wrote that while she may not see him \\"for some time,\\" he wanted her to know that she was always on his mind.      \\"I love you so much,\\" the letter says. \\"Your mother and daddy ... are going to give you everything we can. We will always give you all the love we have.\\"      Eddington urged his daughter to \\"always treat your mother right. You have the sweetest mother on the Earth.\\"      He closed the letter by writing, \\"I love you with all my heart and soul forever and forever. Your loving daddy.\\"      Eddington-Smith and Gregory are unsure what connection the soldier had to the couple who owned the house where his memorabilia was found. Eddington was from Leadwood, Mo., about 75 miles southwest of St. Louis.      Gregory tracked down Smith in June after a search that involved libraries and the Internet. Both women cried during their initial phone conversation that left the daughter shocked by the items' discovery.      Eddington-Smith knew her father died in the war. She was unaware of the letter and other contents of the box, including 16 letters from Eddington to his mother, his draft card and military dog tags, his high school diploma and newspaper clips.      An only child, she grew up in St. Louis and lived there until her mid-20s. She moved with her four children to Nevada in 1972 after a divorce. Her mother, Helen, never remarried and died in 1997.      \\"I would ask my mother why she didn't get remarried and her only comment was that she found the perfect man and will never again find the perfect man,\\" Eddington-Smith said.      ___      Associated Press Correspondent Jim Salter in St. Louis contributed to this story. ||||| Over 12 years ago, In Donna Gregory's home of her ex-husband she discovered a box with the words “War Department” on it. Inside was personal letters and something else very special. Here is her story.      “It was in the closet of his grandparents room. When I got to the bottom the box I discovered to my amazement, a PURPLE HEART medal was inside. No one in my ex husband's family could tell me who this soldier was or why his grandparents had the Medal and Letters.      I took the box home with me that day and my journey began. I spent countless hours researching who this soldier was, where he was killed, where was he buried? Was he married? Did he have children? What I discovered was a heartbreaking truth.      Yes, he was married and had one infant daughter that he never got to meet. Her name was Peggy Arlene Eddington, born Feb 5, 1944. Her father Pvt. John F. Eddington was killed a short four months later in Italy, on June 27, 1944. I was able to find that he was buried at Jefferson Barracks here in St Louis, MO. He was originally from a nearby small town called Leadwood, MO. I tracked his daughter to Nevada but never could find      current residence for her.      A few months ago I finally decided to widen my search in hopes of finding his daughter before something happened to her. I am proud to say, IT WORKED! After a lot of friends and complete strangers started spending time doing their own searches and seeking information, it all started coming together, one lead, led to another.      Within a few weeks I had found her grandson, which led me to her son and then to Peggy! I was overjoyed! See, the thing I haven’t explained yet is I have spent years haunted by a TWO PAGE LETTER written on Feb 27, 1944 (Peggy at that time was only three weeks old) by her father from Italy. It said,”how much her daddy loved her” and other heart warming things. He was killed just a short four months after writing that letter. Peggy never knew this letter existed until I spoke with her on the phone. She has never seen her father’s Medal!      Now, My friends began helping me raise money to get to Nevada. One of my friends sent the story to our local television station for this “PAY IT FORWARD” segment. Here is a link to the story and video of them surprising me in my office.      I would love to meet up with some VETS or members of your organization and ride along the day I actually get to deliver the items to Peggy at her home. (Heck even if anyone along my route would like to take the journey with me from Missouri to Nevada, how awesome would that be?)      I would like to be the one to personal hand her father’s letter to her, but It would be MY HONOR to maybe have a WWll Vet or someone from the military actually hand the medal to her! She Lives in Dayton, NV near Carson City.”      Does your organization have contacts that could help me organize something like this? I would very much like to make this a special day for a woman that never knew her father, never even knew these items existed until now… Email or call me if you think you want to help me make this a day her and her family will never forget!      I look forward to hearing back from you, Thank you for all you do!!      Donna Gregory      Here is the amazing follow up: Donna reached out to Dan Rash and the VFW Riders in Virginia City and Dayton for help and they were very happy and honored to respond.

Cans of soft drinks at 28°C are lowered into the stream. Which of the following will most likely occur? Available options: --The soft drink cans will absorb cold energy from the stream's water.; --The cans will cool until their temperature is the same as the stream's.; --The temperature of the soft drinks will not change since the cans are sealed.; --The temperature of the cans will decrease to freezing as long as the stream is flowing.;. Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step. 1. The soft drink cans will absorb cold energy from the stream's water. Cold energy is not a scientifically valid term. Heat transfer occurs when there is a difference in temperature. In this case, the heat from the soft drink cans will transfer to the cooler stream water. 2. The cans will cool until their temperature is the same as the stream's. This option seems plausible. The temperature of the soft drink cans is higher than the temperature of the stream water. The cans will lose heat to the cooler water until they reach thermal equilibrium, meaning both the cans and the water will be the same temperature. 3. The temperature of the soft drinks will not change since the cans are sealed. This option is incorrect. Sealed or not, heat can still transfer between the soft drinks and the surrounding environment. The aluminum cans are good conductors of heat, allowing heat to transfer between the soft drinks and the stream water. So, the temperature of the soft drinks will change. 4. The temperature of the cans will decrease to freezing as long as the stream is flowing. This option is also incorrect. The cans' temperature will reach equilibrium with the stream water temperature, which is 18°C, not freezing (0°C). Based on the analysis of each option, the most likely outcome is: Answer: --The cans will cool until their temperature is the same as the stream's."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(2). positive.","output":"The sentiment of the tweet \\"@Darth_Disco i bet you know some s club moves....\\" can be described as positive, which corresponds to option (2). Here is a detailed analysis of the sentiment: 1. Tone: The tone of the tweet does not explicitly convey any harsh, insulting, or deprecating words. The mention of \\"s club moves\\" refers to a dance group which is known for upbeat and catchy music. Therefore, the tone appears to be light-hearted and potentially complimentary. 2. Context: The context of the tweet revolves around dance moves and the assumption that the receiver (@Darth_Disco) might know some S Club dance moves. This statement showcases that the sender is trying to associate the receiver with an entertaining and dynamic activity which is typically associated with positive sentiment. 3. Sarcasm and Irony: Although it is important to consider the possibility of sarcasm or irony in tweets, in this case, there are no definitive signs indicating that the tweet is intended to be sarcastic or ironic. In the absence of such indications, the tweet is more likely to have positive sentiment. 4. Emoticons and abbreviations: The tweet does not contain any emoticons or abbreviations which might give a clearer idea of the sentiment.

I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds!

Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no' Input: CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : Recently I've developed a good interest for backpacking and camping; hiking trails. In my excitement I've told my girlfriend about my plans, which involves hiking around 10-15 miles per day for a couple of days strait in order to finish a section of a trail I selected.  She was excited about the idea, but didn't feel like she is capable of walking that specific distance every day. I didn't really dare to tell her I wanted to do this alone, since she sometimes is really afraid I want to do these things just to be away from her, when in reality I really just want to do these things because I think they're interesting and challenging. So what I did was try and alter the plans so she would be able to join me, where I dialed back the distance walked every day and included a hotel stop along the way. The hike would be spread out over one week in total, and she felt like she would maybe be capable of this. Since she told me this I've spent some time on searching for good gear, with which we could do this together.  For context, we've lived together for 1 year now and shared one big vacation together and several other smaller trips. We've recently bought a car and are planning to go on a road trip with just the two of us in summer. I'm really looking forward to spending that time together.  When I get excited about something I really dig into it and I've spent a good portion of my time last week reading into proper hiking gear for two people. My girlfriend thinks I am diving too deep into it, and she is doubting my wish to want to do the hike this year. She was trying her best to change my mind and give me alternatives, which didn't involve thru-hiking (which I really want to do). On my end, I'm really excited and almost feel like I can't wait a couple of years before I undertake such an endeavour.  My girlfriend thinks me wanting to hike alone is an early sign of me wanting to break up with her, which I don't agree with, it's just something I really feel like I would want to do alone. Being in nature, away from civilization, for a certain period of time - being alone and having to rely completely on yourself, that just feels right to me.  Maybe I should have been honest from the start, and tell her I really wanted to do this alone. I recognize that, but I am just wondering if the idea of wanting to hike alone makes me an asshole to begin with? Is it weird to take a one-week holiday alone when you're in a starting relationship? Especially in order to do something that is really going to challenge me on a very personal level? I don't have a good reference point to compare myself to, so I'm really wondering what other people would say.  TLDR; I want to hike alone, my girlfriend doesn't want me to and thinks of it as an early sign of me wanting to break up with her.

Hair-pulling: 'My hands were my enemies' (CNN) -- Christina Pearson was half-bald at age 13. She just couldn't stop pulling her hair, and ended up taking out every lock from the tops of her ears to the crown of her head. Trichotillomania is such a stigmatizing disorder that people will go to great length to hide it, experts say. \\"It was absolutely terrifying because I was a very bright child, and doing great in school,\\" she said. \\"The doctor had no idea what it was.\\" Pearson continued pulling her hair throughout her teens, 20s, and early 30s. It wasn't until she was 33 that she learned her condition had a name: trichotillomania. She became inspired to start an organization, called the Trichotillomania Learning Center, to help other sufferers of the disorder. It turns out that this condition, characterized by the urge to pull hair from one's body, affects about 2 to 4 percent of the population, according to the Trichotillomania Learning Center. A new study published this week in the Archives of General Psychiatry may hold promise for those who compulsively pull their hair. Researchers say participants who took an antioxidant called N-acetylcysteine, sold over the counter at vitamin stores, had significant improvement over patients who took placebos. The dietary supplement used in the study is known for its benefits to the kidneys and liver, said lead author Dr. John Grant at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, who is on the advisory board of the Trichotillomania Learning Center. More recently it has been shown to affect glutamate, a chemical messenger in the brain that seems to be involved in compulsive repetitive behaviors, he said. The sample size was small -- 50 people -- but the study has generated enthusiasm among trichotillomania researchers. \\"This is one of the bigger advances we've had within this field in a long time,\\" said Doug Woods, associate professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. Psychologists are still debating how to categorize trichotillomania, Woods said. Many believe it is related to obsessive compulsive disorder, but others liken it to addictions or impulse control disorders. Researchers are unsure of exactly what goes on in the brain with this disorder. Some people with trichotillomania feel pleasure in pulling hair, while others describe it as \\"calming,\\" and still others have no idea why they do it, Grant said. There may be differences in the brain pathways among people with the condition, he said. For Pearson, pulling hair up made her feel as if her whole nervous system lit up, she said. \\"Basically my fingers would search for a texture, a certain type of hair, when I found it, I would pull it out,\\" she said. \\"I would feel like I had found gold.\\" The condition affects primarily women and usually begins in childhood or adolescence, Woods said. The term, coined in 1889 by a Greek physician, comes from the Greek words for its features: \\"tricho\\" means \\"hair,\\" \\"till\\" means \\"to pull,\\" and \\"mania\\" means \\"frenzy.\\" Long before the disorder had a name, the idea of compulsive hair-pulling had been known for hundreds of years, Woods said. The two main kinds of medications that have been used for trichotillomania are selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors -- SSRIs, used for depression -- and the OCD drug chlorimipramine, Woods said. The antidepressants may help patients' anxiety and depression but don't actually help the pulling, whereas chlorimipramine has been shown to dampen the pulling impulse somewhat. But the treatment that has demonstrated the most effectiveness so far is behavior therapy, Woods said. The dietary supplement probably will not replace the need for behavioral therapy, but future research may find that they two approaches work well together, Grant said. Before trying N-acetylcysteine, people should consult their physicians, particularly to determine whether there are interactions that the supplement could have with other medications the patient already takes, Grant said. Experts say there are still many people who compulsively pull their hair and don't know that they are not the only ones. Trichotillomania is such a stigmatizing disorder that people will go to great lengths to hide it -- to explain bald spots to acquaintances, some patients will lie and say they had cancer, Woods said. \\"I have talked to patients who have pulled for 25 years, and their husbands don't even know it, they hide it so well,\\" he said. People with the disorder don't just pull from their heads -- they also pull hair from their eyebrows, eyelashes, and pubic regions, Woods said. Living with the disease, Pearson at times felt suicidal. She dropped out of high school because she was terrified of her friends finding out. \\"There was a time in my early 20s when I really, seriously considered, could I cut my hands off and live my life?\\" she said. \\"My hands were my enemies, because they pulled my hair.\\" To manage her condition 18 years ago, Pearson tried relaxation techniques for the situations that led to her pulling. For example, she tended to pull her hair while driving, so she bought thin leather gloves and told herself that she could not remove them -- or pull her hair -- until she turned the car off. Today, there are many more strategies available to help people identify the triggers for hair-pulling and figure out the best way to control the impulses in those situations, Pearson said. The Trichotillomania Learning Center has assisted more than 100,000 people in some way since 1991, Pearson said. The organization holds conferences, retreats, professional training sessions, and other programs to help people manage the disorder. The center also helps health care professionals learn about treating people for the condition. \\"To experience the entrapment of this type of compulsion, and then to experience the freedom of living without it is a gift I wish for everyone,\\" Pearson said.

Which language is this?","output":"The text \\"Tvoje máma je v pohodě, a ty máš mně\\" is in Czech, a West Slavic language spoken primarily in the Czech Republic. Czech is closely related to Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian. In this particular sentence, the speaker is saying something along the lines of \\"Your mother is fine (or cool), and you have me.\\" The speaker may be trying to convey that the listener's mother is doing well, and the speaker is there to support the listener. This could be a friendly or comforting statement. Czech is a highly inflected language, which means that words change their forms due to grammatical functions, such as case, gender, and number. This makes Czech quite complex in grammar compared to other languages like English. Czech uses the Roman alphabet, with additional diacritic marks placed on some vowels and consonants to indicate changes in pronunciation. Czech has a rich history and dates back to the early Middle Ages when Latin was replaced by the Old Church Slavonic in the region. Over the years, the language has evolved through many stages, such as Old Czech, Middle Czech, Early Modern Czech, and the contemporary Czech that is spoken today. Czech literature and culture have played a significant role in the development of European culture, producing renowned authors like Franz Kafka, Milan Kundera, and Václav Havel. The language is also known for its remarkably precise pronunciation, which has led to the development of a unique form of theater called \\"black light theatre.\\" In this theatrical form, artists perform in a darkened room illuminated only by ultraviolet lamps, creating an overall mesmerizing visual experience. Overall, the Czech language is an essential part of Slavic and European linguistic and cultural heritage, with its unique grammar, history, literature, and cultural contributions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.  Greg and Frank were two friends that studied natural sciences. One day, Greg decided to start reading about natural selection. His friend Frank decided to read more about populations that displayed natural selection more sparingly. They both learned lots of new interesting facts.  Which friend learned less about animals that survive in greater numbers? Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's review what Greg and Frank studied: Greg studied natural selection, which is a process determining the survival and reproduction of organisms with beneficial heritable traits. Organisms that possess these traits tend to survive in greater numbers. Frank studied populations where natural selection occurred less frequently, so he learned about instances where the impact of natural selection on the organisms' survival rate was less significant.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: It's possible to avoid a serious sin but still do? Context: Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders. When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin—usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah's Witness doctrines—a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt, provide help and possibly administer discipline. Disfellowshipping, a form of shunning, is the strongest form of discipline, administered to an offender deemed unrepentant. Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home, and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged. Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \\"losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [the shunned individual] to come 'to his senses,' see the seriousness of his wrong, and take steps to return to Jehovah.\\" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior. Members who disassociate (formally resign) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned. Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced. Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service, but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship. Marking, a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship, is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin.[note 4] The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, it's possible to avoid a serious sin but still do something that requires discipline. In the context provided, two forms of disciplinary actions that are lesser than disfellowshipping are mentioned: Reproof and Marking. Reproof is given to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin, resulting in a temporary loss of privileges of service but no restriction of fellowship. Marking, on the other hand, entails curtailing social but not spiritual fellowship when a baptized member persists in a course of action that violates Bible principles but is not considered a serious sin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have one, an Mayan flute, with gold in, what is their story? I have a Mayan snake flute, with gold inlaid, what is its story? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, both questions are inquiring about the same information. They both ask about the story or history behind a Mayan flute with gold inlay, specifically a snake flute. The only difference is in the phrasing of the questions. To answer the question, I will research the history of Mayan flutes, focusing on those with snake themes and gold inlay. Step 1: Research Mayan flutes Mayan flutes were wind instruments used by the ancient Mayan civilization in Central America. They were often associated with religious rituals and festivities, and were made from a variety of materials including bone, wood, and clay. Step 2: Gather information on snake-themed Mayan flutes The snake symbolized many things in Mayan culture, including rebirth, transformation, and the Earth. As a result, snake-themed flutes were likely used to invoke these meanings during ceremonies, performances, and rituals. Step 3: Focus on the role of gold in Mayan flutes Gold was an important material in Mayan culture, symbolizing power, wealth, and divinity. Inlaid gold on a Mayan flute would have increased its prestige, denoting it as a valuable and sacred item. Based on the research, it can be concluded that the Mayan snake flute with gold inlay is an artifact from the ancient Mayan civilization, probably used in religious rituals and ceremonies due to its snake design and gold inlay. The snake theme would have invoked the various symbolic meanings associated with snakes in Mayan culture, such as rebirth, transformation, and the Earth, while the gold inlay reflected the flute's elevated status as a sacred and valuable object."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

This decision might have initially been difficult, but Adam ultimately understood that it was crucial to prioritize his overall health and well-being over immediate preferences or desires. In making this conscious choice, he was able to balance both his love for animals and ensure a comfortable environment within his living space. While both dogs and cats make for fantastic pets, they can impact individuals differently. Some people often experience allergies that are triggered by various factors, including pet dander, hair, or saliva. In Adam's case, it was essential to take these factors into consideration when deciding which pet to ultimately adopt. Although it's generally thought that cats are more likely to cause allergic reactions in people, this is not always the case. In fact, some cats may indeed be less allergenic than others, making it possible for individuals like Adam to enjoy the perks of pet ownership without all the sneezing and itching that can ensue. Certain breeds, such as the hypoallergenic Siberian or the hairless Sphynx, are known to be less likely to provoke allergies in humans. Contrastingly, although dogs can bring immense joy and companionship, they too can cause allergies in certain people. The allergens produced by dogs – specifically, proteins found in their skin cells, urine, and saliva – can trigger various reactions in those sensitive to these proteins. Depending on the breed, size, and amount of shedding, certain dogs may provoke stronger allergic reactions than others. Knowing that the cat he intended to adopt had a lower likelihood of causing allergies, Adam proceeded with the adoption. He remained mindful of maintaining a clean environment, investing in strategies to minimize potential allergy triggers. For instance, regular grooming and bathing of the cat, frequent vacuuming, and the use of air purifiers can all contribute to a more allergy-friendly environment. Ultimately, Adam's decision to adopt a cat over a dog proved to be the right one for him. Not only was he able to provide a loving home to a feline in need, but also successfully managed to prevent any troublesome allergic reactions. As the bond between Adam and his new companion grew, so did his confidence in the choice he had made. It was clear that the love, loyalty, and warmth shared between them were genuinely priceless, making it abundantly clear that Adam had made a well-informed and wise decision in adopting his charming, endearing, and allergy-friendly feline."},{"instruction":"Question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Hypothesis: Mrs. Lynde gave them cake","output":"Based on the provided context, we cannot draw the hypothesis that Mrs. Lynde gave them cake.  The context focuses on a conversation involving Davy coming home from the Boulter place and his encounter with Mrs. Lynde and another woman in the Hollow. Davy mentions that he had tea at Milty's and felt that Mrs. Boulter was mean as she didn't provide enough food, specifically no preserves or cake. The context states that Anne advises Davy not to criticize any food offered when visiting. However, no information is provided regarding Mrs. Lynde giving them cake. The only reference to cake in the text is related to the complaint about Mrs. Boulter not serving it. Thus, based on the context provided, it would be incorrect to draw the hypothesis that Mrs. Lynde gave them cake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Settled by the Celts, invaded by the Romans and the Normans, and ruled by the English, Wales' population has regularly changed over the ages. Wales, particularly South Wales, became a melting pot of European nationalities and cultures. At first workers from England, Ireland and the rural areas of Wales rushed into the coalfields of South Wales. By 1911, workers from Ireland, Italy and Spain had joined the industrial workforce there. Many of these newcomers were prepared to work for less pay. But during this period, workers, dissatisfied with regular pay cuts, poor safety, the growing trend of employers to pay workers with tokens  , which could only be spent in the company store, returned to the land. In 1891, the rural population of Wales was about 616,000 and by 1911 just over 649,000 people lived and worked in these areas. The rural population continues to grow slowly even today. People from richer parts of the UK, particularly southern England, are buying holiday or retirement homes in Wales. In some areas this has led to a shortage of affordable housing for local people. This, combined with the lack of employment prospects in rural Welsh communities, has started a new movement of people in search of jobs and homes into the towns and cities of Wales and to other parts of the UK and Europe. As so many Welsh people have migrated to other countries over the last 200 years, it's really no surprise that many visitors come to see friends and  s -- there were 229,000 visitors in 1998. These visitors strengthen their links to their land of origin and continue to support the Welsh economy. During the hot summer days, about 28% of the visitors visit the countryside and nearly 70% visit the seaside. Options: A Tourism, the main economic source of Wales. B Wales, a land with a promising past and future. C Wales, the biggest melting pot of Europe. D Wales, a land with a population on the move. Answer: D Wales, a land with a population on the move.

Today, we're going to learn how to write a super fun poem. A poem is a group of words that we put together to share our thoughts, feelings, or stories in a creative way.  Here are some helpful tips to make your poem extra special: 1. Use rhyming words for rhythm:  Rhyming words are words that sound the same at the end, like \\"cat\\" and \\"hat\\" or \\"tree\\" and \\"bee.\\" When you use these words in your poem, it makes a fun, bouncy rhythm. This rhythm can make your poem more enjoyable to read or listen to, just like a cool song! 2. Write with metaphors and similes: Metaphors and similes are ways to make your poem really colorful and exciting. They help us compare things in a creative way. For example, if you want to describe a bright, sunny day, you could say, \\"The sun was a big, shiny smiley face in the sky.\\" That's a metaphor! A simile is when we use the words \\"like\\" or \\"as\\" to compare things. For example, \\"The sun was as warm as a cozy blanket.\\" 3. No worries about length: Don't worry if your poem is very short or very long. What's important is that it comes from your heart and tells the story or feeling you want to share. Some poems are only a few words, and others take up many pages. Just let your creativity guide you! 4. Revise your first draft: After writing your poem, take a little break and then come back to read it again. This will help you see if you want to change anything or add more details. It's okay to make changes to your poem, as this helps make it even better! 5. Create a final draft: After making any changes or improvements, you're ready to write the final draft of your poem. This is your chance to make sure all your words look neat and tidy, like a beautiful picture made of letters. You can even add fun decorations or illustrations to go with your poem! So, little poets, now you know some tips to write a super fun and creative poem. Remember, the most important thing is to have fun and let your imagination go wild. Happy writing!"},{"instruction":"Process:  - You eat food - Your stomach digests the food - Sugars from food enter your bloodstream - Insulin helps turn sugars into energy - Insulin helps your body store the energy in fat, muscle and liver cells -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose You are more anorexic happens, how will it affect LESS use of insulin in the body.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of being more anorexic can have an effect on the process and possibly lead to less use of insulin in the body. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by severe calorie restriction, fear of weight gain, and an unhealthy obsession with body weight and shape. Due to a lower intake of food and nutrients, individuals with anorexia are likely to have a reduced need for insulin, as there is less sugar entering the bloodstream from the digestion of food. This could have several indirect effects on the process: 1. Reduced energy levels: With less sugar being converted into energy, the body may experience fatigue and a feeling of weakness. 2. Slowed metabolism: Since the body is getting less energy from food, it could slow down the metabolism in an attempt to preserve the limited energy stores. 3. Muscle wasting: If the body is not getting enough energy from food, it may begin to break down muscle to provide the necessary energy. 4. Hormonal changes: A lack of nutrients and energy could cause the body to enter a state of starvation, leading to hormonal imbalances and potential disruptions of normal bodily functions, such as menstrual cycles in women. 5. Altered brain function: Reduced insulin levels and energy stores can impact the brain and lead to cognitive impairments, such as difficulty concentrating and memory problems. Additionally, the relationship between anorexia nervosa and insulin resistance is complex. Some studies suggest that individuals with anorexia may develop insulin resistance due to the stresses placed on the body during periods of severe calorie restriction. This could further reduce the body's ability to use insulin effectively."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices:  - heart attack - falling down - weight loss - stitches - exhaustion  The rationale to choose \\"stitches\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The most likely result of falling in gravel while running is the need for stitches, among the options provided - heart attack, falling down, weight loss, stitches, and exhaustion.  Falling in gravel can result in a person getting cuts, scrapes, and abrasions due to the rough and uneven surface of the gravel. Additionally, the small stones present in the gravel can cause the wounds to be deeper and more significant than those caused by falling on a smooth surface. Consequently, this may lead to the need for stitches to close any deep gashes and promote healing. Stitches are used to hold the edges of a wound together, allowing the skin and underlying tissues to heal properly and minimize scarring. Although it is true that falling down is an apparent consequence of tripping while running, the given options seem to assume that a fall has already occurred. Therefore, taking that context into consideration, \\"falling down\\" would not be considered an outcome of the fall itself but rather a part of the incident. A heart attack is not a likely result of falling in gravel while running, as it is usually caused by a blockage in the blood supply to the heart muscle. Factors such as an unhealthy diet, smoking, and lack of physical activity are more closely related to heart attacks. Though falls can happen due to a heart attack if one experiences it while running, the falling itself doesn't generally cause a heart attack in an otherwise healthy person. Weight loss is also an unlikely result of falling in gravel while running, as it would require a sustained effort toward exercise and a proper diet. Weight loss is a long-term goal and cannot be achieved simply by experiencing a fall. Of course, engaging in regular running as a form of exercise can contribute to weight loss, but the fall itself is not a direct factor in losing weight. Lastly, exhaustion may result from running in general, but it is not a direct outcome of falling in gravel. A person might feel physically and emotionally drained after a fall, but the exhaustion of recovering from the fall is separate from the overall exhaustion caused by running. Furthermore, exhaustion is temporary, whereas stitches may be needed to address a serious injury resulting from the fall. In conclusion, among the provided choices, \\"stitches\\" is the most likely and logical result of falling in gravel while running due to the nature of the gravel surface causing potential deep cuts and abrasions that may require medical intervention."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: ROLAND NARROWED HIS EYES AND STARED UPWARD INTO THE DARKNESS, across the top of Mont Segur toward the Cathar fortress. Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered. Roland caught a glimpse of the sergeant's horrified face and heard his scream as the boulder struck him, crushing him to the ground. How long did it take the boulder to hit the sergeant?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: Russian academics are calling for a scientific probe into claims of a 'Siberian Loch Ness monster' in one of the world's remotest lakes. Researchers using underwater scanners have found evidence of 'Nesski' - measuring up to 33 feet in length - in the deep waters of Lake Labynkyr, says a new report. Intriguingly, the evidence is at a lake where native Evenk and Yakut people have long claimed an underwater creature lurks. Proof: This photograph, said to be the head of the underwater beast, is being used as evidence to prove the existence of a Siberian Loch Ness monster. The evidence includes a picture which, it is claimed, shows the monster, says the Siberian Times. Known as ‘the Devil', testimony dating back to the 19th century says the monster has enormous jaws. Associate Professor Lyudmila Emeliyanova, of Moscow State University, told The Siberian Times that on her own scientific mission to Labynkyr she recorded ‘several seriously big underwater objects’ with sonar readings. Images have also recently emerged from a 2006 scientific trip to the lake when strange objects - one of 21ft 4in (6.5 metres) in length - were recorded on a Humminbird Piranha MAX 215 Portable fish-finder at a depth of 138 to 197 feet. Territory: Lake Labynkyr in Siberia, the alleged home of a giant 'Nesski' monster. Based on the sonic readings, researchers drew how the creature might look in real-life on the fish-finder's screen. ‘It was our fourth or fifth day at the lake when our echo sounding device registered a huge object in the water under our boat,\\" said Dr Emeliyanova of her own close encounter. It was clearly alive and too large to be one of the dozen or so known fish species in the lake. ‘The object was very dense, of homogeneous structure, surely not a fish nor a shoal of fish, and it was above the bottom,\\" she said. ‘I was very surprised but not scared nor shocked, after all we did not see this animal, we only registered a strange object in the water. But I can clearly say - at the moment, as a scientist, I cannot offer you any explanation of what this object might be.’ Lady in red: The echo device shows a mysterious shape and the scientists made a drawing, right in red, of what Nessie's Russian cousin might look like. Nesski caught: The device, normally used to find and trace fish movements discovered a strange dense object in the lake. Artists impression: The scientists have made a drawing of a not-so-happy monster on the screen. Other similar findings since her 2002 mission mean that a new scientific mission to discover the truth is essential, said Dr Emeliyanova, a biogeographer. ‘I believe there is a mystery in this lake because there is no smoke without fire,’ she said. She was told an account of two fishermen who were ‘in a 10 metre long boat when suddenly the bow began to rise as if somebody was pushing it from under the water. 'It was a heavy boat, only a huge and strong animal can do such a thing. The fishermen were stuck by fear. They did not see anything, no head, no jaws.’ Another 'sighting' came when a group of Russian geologists were fishing in the lake. ‘Suddenly those in the boat started screaming - apparently they saw a huge head of some creature. Others, who were waiting for them on shore, started shooting, and scared the creature away,’ said a witness. Monster or myth?: The local population have given testimonies on the monster they call 'the Devil' since the 19th century. A 1953 sighting of a 'monster' in neighbouring Lake Vorota by respected Soviet geologist Viktor Tverdokhlebov was initially covered up by the Soviet authorities. But now Dr Emeliyanova wants to investigate a theory that the two lakes are linked by underground tunnels. Strangely, despite being close to Oymyakon, the coldest inhabited town on Earth, the lake does not freeze completely in winter. There has been speculation in Russia  that Labynkyr and Vorota might be inhabited by a school of ichthyosaurs, prehistoric marine reptiles resembling dolphins or sharks, or  plesiosaurs, a popular theory concerning 'Nessie' in Scotland which is often depicted with a long neck. Another version is that relic killer whales could have become marooned in Labynkyr when it was attached to the sea. Some accounts even suggest the 'creature' makes a hideous primeval cry as it attacks its prey. ‘Personally, I do believe that when the information about something strange circulates among local people for so many years, it just can't be groundless, it means something is there,’ said Dr Emeliyanova. ’I know the local people very well - they are ingenuous but they do not lie.’ She stressed: ‘There are many lakes in Yakutia and around the Indigirka River, hundreds of them, big and small, their shores are more or less populated, but all the talk is about Labynkyr and Vorota lakes, and it has gone on for many dozens of years. 'It makes us think about it. And these stories about the local monster are older than those about the Loch Ness monster.’ Highlights:","output":"Russian scientists are investigating claims of a 'Siberian Loch Ness monster' in Lake Labynkyr.

She appears to have contracted a cold during her trip. Her six-year-old son from a previous marriage, Clark, also becomes sick and is sent home from school. Beth's condition worsens and two days later she collapses with severe seizures. Her husband, Mitch, rushes her to the hospital, but she dies of an unknown cause. Mitch returns home and finds that Clark has also died from a similar infection. Mitch is placed in isolation, but seems to be immune to the disease. He is released and returns home to his teenage daughter Jory, though they are unsure if she's inherited his immunity. She decides to stay with her father regardless. Mitch struggles with learning his wife was unfaithful, and protecting his daughter from infection. Meanwhile, everyone who had contact with Emhoff begins to spread the disease around the world. In Atlanta, representatives of the Department of Homeland Security meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever of the CDC and fear that the disease is a bio weapon terror attack over the Thanksgiving weekend. Dr. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears, an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, to Minneapolis to begin investigating. Mears traces the outbreak to Emhoff, but after setting up triage camps in large venues, Dr. Mears becomes infected. Her evacuation is postponed, as airports close ahead of a quarantine. She later dies and is buried in a mass grave. As more and more people become infected with no cure in sight, social order begins to decay, with rampant looting of stores and homes.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Record numbers of A-level students 'to be rejected from university' By Graeme Paton and Rachel Cooper Published: 10:00PM BST 26 Jun 2009 Research by The Daily Telegraph suggests demand for degree courses has surged by almost 65,000, even though few extra places are available. With the deadline for applications looming on Tuesday, numbers are believed to be up 11 per cent across Britain. The Conservatives warned a \\"major crisis\\" was looming as thousands more people push for university amid dire warnings of long-term job shortages. Vice-chancellors admitted entrance criteria would be dramatically tightened up, with the number of places handed out through clearing slumping to a new low. Many students missing conditional offers by a single grade, who would have been accepted in the past, could now be rejected, they said. More straight-A candidates will also miss out as the most sought-after universities fall back on interviews and entrance tests to find the best candidates. Universities have already been warned they face fines for over-recruiting this year. The pressure on places has been fuelled by a sharp rise in applications from mature students. Cambridge's four colleges which cater exclusively for over-21s all reported significant rises, with St Edmund's alone reporting a 52 per cent increase. But the Commons skills select committee warned this week that only 3,000 extra places across Britain would be made available in September - potentially leaving more than 60,000 without a place. This is on top of some 110,000 rejected every year after failing to meet entry requirements, applying too late or dropping out of the process. Amanda Brook, head of student recruitment at Exeter, said: \\"We have certainly had to reject more students who did not meet our AAA offers as we were only able to make offers at the very top of the range. Inevitably we will have to be stricter with those who miss their offer.\\" Professor Les Ebdon, vice-chancellor of Bedfordshire University, said: \\"We could see tens of thousands of students missing out on a place at their preferred university because they have missed their offer by one or two grades. Universities are going to be more nervous about letting people in.\\" Roderick Smith, admissions director at Birmingham, said there was a nine per cent rise overall, including a 65 per cent rise in the number of students studying economics. \\"In previous years, about 80 per cent of applicants would have been made an offer for that subject, but now only half of applicants will be made an offer,\\" he said. \\"We are having to assess people much more rigorously because we know we can't take more people. We're looking for the best students, with the best academic record and the right combination of A-levels. We're most definitely having to reject people who in the past would have been made an offer.\\" The ultimate deadline for applications is the end of June. Last year, 588,689 people applied for full time undergraduate courses. After accounting for students failing to make the grade or rejecting offers, a total of 456,627 gained places. The Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) warned that applications were up by almost nine per cent by the end of March compared to the same period in 2008. But research by The Telegraph suggests numbers have surged further in the last three months. A survey of 50 institutions shows an average 11 per cent rise which would result in 64,755 extra applicants this year. The research covered a range of small, specialist universities, former polytechnics and elite institutions. It follows pressure from Labour on teenagers to go on to university in recent years, combined with the lack of unskilled jobs for school-leavers in recession. Ministers originally promised 10,000 additional places would be created this year. But Phil Willis, chairman of the Commons skills select committee, said only 3,000 would be available for full-time undergraduates. Other places are likely to go to part-time students, while money is also used by universities who over-recruited last year. Newer universities, many of which specialise in work-based courses leading directly to a job, experienced the biggest rises. Bedfordshire reported a 28 per cent increase and applications to Portsmouth were up 23 per cent. Buckinghamshire New University reported a 33 per cent rise. Popular universities, such as Exeter and Leicester, saw applications rise 18 per cent while Oxford increased by 12 per cent. Applications soared among mature students, many of whom have been left without work in the recession - potentially squeezing out those joining straight from school or college. Worcestershire University reported a 37 per cent increase in applications from mature students. David Willetts, the Conservative shadow skills secretary, said: \\"Photos on A-level results day of pretty young women jumping for joy after receiving their A-level results will probably be replaced the next day with pictures of the same people in tears because they can't get into university. We have a major crisis looming and we'll have many students with very good A-level grades missing out.\\" A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: \\"Next year there will be more students going to university than ever before, taking advantage of the record number of funded places on offer. There will be 40,000 more accepted applicants than just three years ago – and right now there are 300,000 more students in system since 1997. \\"Getting a place at university has always been, and should be, a competitive process. But there are a variety of options on offer for young people, including part-time study, apprenticeships and foundation degrees.\\"","output":"This news article is about how many students who want to go to university might not be able to because there are not enough spots available. The number of people applying to college has gone up a lot, but the number of spots in the colleges hasn't changed too much. This means that even really smart students who could have gone to college before might not be accepted now. The government said there would be some extra spots, but not enough for everyone who wants to go.

Laura's heart pounded in her chest as she stared at the barrel of the gun, mere inches away from Felicia's temple. Although the weapon wasn't directed at her, Laura was acutely aware that a single twitch of the gunman's finger could mean instantaneous death for her best friend. The three of them stood in the dimly lit alley, their shadows casting eerie patterns on the damp pavement. Felicia's eyes were wide with fear, her face draining of color as her gaze remained fixed on the cold steel pressed against her skull. The gunman, a tall man with piercing blue eyes and a weathered face that hinted at years of hardship and cruelty, locked eyes with Laura. He sneered, his voice dripping with malice. \\"What's it gonna be, kid?\\" he growled, nodding toward the small bag of diamonds that lay on the ground between Laura and Felicia. The diamonds had been their ticket out of the slums. They had planned their heist meticulously, analyzing and plotting every move for months before finally carrying it out. The high-end jewelry store in the heart of the city had only been the beginning; what they hadn't anticipated was the wrath of a notorious crime boss who held a stake in the store's profits. Now, with the lives swaying precariously in the balance, Laura was faced with an unthinkable decision. She glanced at the precious stones and then at Felicia, swallowing hard. \\"Take the diamonds, please,\\" Laura managed to choke out, struggling to keep her voice steady. \\"Just don't hurt her.\\" The gunman's eyes sparkled with cruel amusement as he extended his left hand to pick up the bag of diamonds, while his right hand maintained a firm grip on the gun. \\"You made a wise choice,\\" he said with an evil grin. He took a step back, keeping the gun trained on Felicia. \\"Now, I hope you both learned your lesson.\\" For a split second, Laura thought she saw an opportunity. A fleeting chance to disarm the man and reclaim their stolen prize. But the risk was monumental; if she failed, Felicia would pay the price. With a deep breath, Laura forced her body to relax, making a conscious effort to ignore the searing outrage coursing through her veins. She watched helplessly as the gunman tucked the bag of diamonds into his coat and adjusted the weapon against Felicia's head. This was it; they would leave the alley empty-handed and broken, never to taste the freedom they had so desperately sought. But fate had other plans. As the gunman was about to turn and walk away, Felicia suddenly swung her elbow, connecting it with the man's ribs. The unexpected blow caught him by surprise, causing the gun to misfire and skid out of his grasp. The three of them froze, momentarily stunned by the turn of events. Laura leapt into action, grabbing the gun before the man had time to react. She aimed it at him, her hands shaking as she snarled through gritted teeth. \\"No more playing games. This ends now.\\" The criminal sneered, his eyes flicking between Laura and Felicia, before ultimately landing on the weapon in Laura's grasp. Seeing that he had no way to gain the upper hand, he raised his hands in surrender. \\"Fine,\\" he spat, venom tainting his voice. \\"Enjoy your tainted victory. I won't be far behind.\\" The girls exchanged hurried glances as the man backed away, his gaze remaining on the gun leveled at him. As soon as he had vanished from sight, they bolted in the opposite direction, adrenaline coursing through their veins. It wasn't the outcome they had envisioned, but through their strength and determination, Laura and Felicia escaped with their lives.

First he saw a Leeuwenhoek microscope, which was labeled as item A, then he saw a compound microscope of Leeuwenhoek's time, which was labeled as item B. At the very end of his museum tour he saw a modern compound light microscope, which was labeled as item C.

Leeuwenhoek developed an interest in microscopy and ground his own lenses to make simple microscopes. Leeuwenhoek was so good at making lenses that his simple microscopes were able to magnify much more clearly than the compound microscopes of his day. His microscope's increased ability to magnify over 200x is comparable to a modern compound light microscope. Compound microscopes , which are microscopes that use more than one lens, had been invented around 1595 by Zacharias Jansen, a Dutch spectacle-maker.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What were the names of the two overdrive pedals used by Mudhoney?, using the article: Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers  and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\".  In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\"., what would be the answer ?

Thus, it might be better read 'only one eye for one eye'. The idiomatic biblical phrase \`\`an eye for an eye'' in Exodus and Leviticus (עין תחת עין‬, ayin tachat ayin) literally means 'an eye under/(in place of) an eye' while a slightly different phrase (עַיִן בְּעַיִן שֵׁן בְּשֵׁן, literally \`\`eye for an eye; tooth for a tooth'') is used in another passage (Deuteronomy) in the context of possible reciprocal court sentences for failed false witnesses.

Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to \\"fly\\" through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The biggest part in keeping a bird light enough to fly is their lightweight skeleton. This, along with adaptations such as large flight muscles (pectoralis and supracoracoideus), modified forelimbs (wings) that serve as aerofoils, and specific wing shapes and sizes contribute to their ability to maintain flight efficiently. These adaptations help birds in various activities such as breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance while conserving energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

There were many questions at the time about whether Jessica would be able to live a \\"normal\\"  life.  However,  Jessica ' s father said ,  \\"I have never shed a tear about her birth condition. \\"  With the  support of her parents and family, Jessica became confident in herself as an adult and continued to  explore the world with her feet.        As a child, Jessica studied dance in her home town. When the first performance arrived, she  asked to be put in the back row. Her dance teacher told her there was no back row. Nervously, she  took the stage with the other students and performed her routine. When she finished, the applause from the audience gave her encouragement and the confidence to continue dancing for 14 years.       After graduating from high school, Jessica attended the University of Arizona, where she earned a bachelor' s degree in Psychology. When talking about her major, she frequently explainsthat psychology has a great effect on her life, helping her out of a physical limitation.

To elaborate, let us analyze both the sentences closely: Sentence 1: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SAMPLE REPORT (continued) This sentence is the title or heading of a research and development report, possibly a continuation of a previous part of the same report. It does not provide any information about the actions or intentions of any individuals, and it does not mention anything about writing drafts. Sentence 2: They wanted to write a draft first. This sentence implies that a group of people (they) had the intention to write a draft version of a document before proceeding with further actions. It does not specify whether the document is related to the research and development report mentioned in Sentence 1 or if it is a separate document altogether. The relationship between the two sentences is unclear. While it is possible that Sentence 2 refers to the people involved in writing the research and development report mentioned in Sentence 1, there is not enough evidence or context provided to confirm this. The sentences do not explicitly mention that the draft being referred to in Sentence 2 is for the same research and development report, nor do they indicate if the group of people in Sentence 2 are the same people responsible for the report in Sentence 1.

My wedding experiences were both very different, even though I cried at both ceremonies. At my first wedding, I had been doing a lot of manual labor in the day prior to the wedding. Unfortunately, I did not have any gloves, and I ended up getting a lot of blisters on my hands. By the evening of the wedding, these blisters were very painful to touch. My bride was wearing what I thought to be an elaborate wedding dress. It was pretty, and it had a lot of buttons on it. Little, white, cloth covered buttons. These buttons were also a part of her sleeves and gloves. During the ceremony, she was holding my hands very tightly, and it hurt. I mean, it really really hurt! I didn’t want to pull my hands away, as the gesture could be misconstrued, and I might hurt her feelings. So, I stood and held hands with her, enduring the pain. Although I managed to remain silent, I couldn’t keep the tears from falling down my face. The more I cried, the harder she squeezed and the more painful it was. She always thought that I was crying due to emotion on our wedding day, and I never told her any differently — I didn’t want to hurt her feelings. Some years after that lengthy incarceration ended, I was fortunate to wed again. I had not done any manual labor before our wedding day. My hands were fine. Also, my bride did not have a lot of intricate buttons on her dress, nor did she wear gloves or even have sleeves. We were wed on a beach, just the two of us. No one else was in attendance. We had written our own vows, in fact, our own ceremony, including our own rituals. And yes, I cried, because I was / am so in love with my bride.

I started with a sorted function which takes the list of dictionaries and a key function as arguments. 2. The key function is a lambda function that takes each dictionary as an argument and returns a tuple with two elements, the first is the value of the 'first' key and the second is the value of the 'second' key. 3. The sorted function takes the tuples returned by the key function and compares them one by one. Since comparison of tuples is element-wise, it first compares the values for the 'first' key and if they are equal, it moves on to compare the values for the 'second' key. 4. The sorted function returns the list of dictionaries sorted by their 'first' key from smallest to largest. In case of equal 'first' key values, it sorts them by their 'second' key. 5. Negative numbers are already considered smaller than positive numbers during comparison, so they automatically come before positive numbers in the sorting process. The result for the provided list of dictionaries would be: [{'first': -86, 'second': 60}, {'first': -37, 'second': 28}, {'first': -23, 'second': -83}, {'first': -5, 'second': -40}, {'first': 22, 'second': 50}, {'first': 31, 'second': -81}, {'first': 31, 'second': -4}, {'first': 32, 'second': 88}, {'first': 34, 'second': -28}]"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Some birds like eating locusts. but birds cannot easily catch them. Why? It is because locusts change their colors together with the change of the colors of crops. When crops are green, locusts look green. But as the harvest time comes, locusts change to the same brown color as crops have. Some other pests with different colors from plants are easily found and eaten by others. So they have to hide themselves for lives and appear only at night. If you study the animal life, you'll find the main use of coloring is protecting themselves. Bears, lions and other animals move quietly through forests. They cannot be seen by hunters. This is because they have the colors much like the tree. Have you ever noticed an even more strange act? A kind of fish in the sea can send out a kind of very black liquid when it faces danger.

A navy of 10,000 vessels, including Pecheneg allies, landed on the Bithynian coast and devastated the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus. The attack was well-timed, perhaps due to intelligence, as the Byzantine fleet was occupied with the Arabs in the Mediterranean, and the bulk of its army was stationed in the east. The Rus’ burned towns, churches, and monasteries, butchering the people and amassing booty. The emperor arranged for a small group of retired ships to be outfitted with Greek fire throwers and sent them out to meet the Rus’, luring them into surrounding the contingent before unleashing the Greek fire. Liutprand of Cremona wrote that \\"the Rus', seeing the flames, jumped overboard, preferring water to fire. Some sank, weighed down by the weight of their breastplates and helmets; others caught fire.\\" Those captured were beheaded. The ploy dispelled the Rus’ fleet, but their attacks continued into the hinterland as far as Nicomedia, with many atrocities reported as victims were crucified and set up for use as targets. At last a Byzantine army arrived from the Balkans to drive the Rus' back, and a naval contingent reportedly destroyed much of the Rus' fleet on its return voyage (possibly an exaggeration since the Rus' soon mounted another attack). The outcome indicates increased military might by Byzantium since 911, suggesting a shift in the balance of power. Why did the attack by the Rus go so well on the coast at the start?","output":"Okay little buddy, let me explain this to you. A long time ago, in the year 941, there was a group called the Rus. They had a big leader named Igor, and they wanted to attack a place called Constantinople. They did this because they wanted to have the right to trade things with other people. So, the Rus gathered up a really big group of ships, about 10,000 of them, and they had some friends called the Pechenegs to help them too. They chose the perfect time to attack because the people in Constantinople, called the Byzantines, were busy fighting other battles. Their ships were far away in another sea, and their soldiers were in a different place too. Because of this great timing, the Rus easily arrived on the shore and began destroying cities and hurting people. The people who lived there weren't ready to fight, so it was easier for the Rus to hurt them. That's why the attack went so well for the Rus at the start."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Input: Paragraph- Sent 1: Responding to a wave of public dismay over the first designs for rebuilding Lower Manhattan, Gov. George Pataki has sent word that it's time to go back to the drawing board. Sent 2: It is the right message, sent while it is still early enough to do something constructive about the disappointing quality of the work so far. Sent 3: The governor, like Mayor Michael Bloomberg, now seems committed to creating a better mix of uses for ground zero, and a 24-hour community in Manhattan's downtown. Sent 4: While rethinking the plans will delay the original rebuilding schedule slightly, it does not need to stall progress if the governor keeps the pressure on the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Sent 5: New York cannot afford to have a gaping hole that mocks the city and its process for rebuilding what was destroyed. Sent 6: Pataki openly questioned the Port Authority's requirement that any plan for the site replace all the office, hotel and retail square footage lost in the attack on Sept. 11. Sent 7: More than anything else, that specification limited the designs to the undistinguished options presented two weeks ago. Sent 8: Renegotiating that issue with the World Trade Center leaseholders should begin immediately. Sent 9: Opening the process to other designers, both here and internationally, will help separate this urban plan from the ordinary. Sent 10: The city also needs to begin openly discussing what happens underground, in particular with the transportation network. Sent 11: At this point, planners have focused on short-term repair of PATH and subway lines, with medium-range proposals being shopped in Washington that could untangle the disorganized web of subway lines downtown. Sent 12: Within the next few weeks the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. and the Port Authority should offer some bigger ideas about how to connect the downtown area better to the rest of the region. Sent 13: Lowering West Street alongside the World Trade Center site and building a park or esplanade on top is another option that has been popular with those reviewing the first six public proposals. Sent 14: But it would be expensive, and the governor, the mayor and their friends in Washington will have to look at long-range ways to pay the bill. Sent 15: Pataki's recent remarks are a sign that he understands how central the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan will be to his own political legacy. Sent 16: Now he needs to follow through with action, to keep demonstrating that his core concern is coming up with the best possible plan, not simply keeping the issue on hold until after this fall's election.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? If you are experiencing back pain and want to use an ice pack to relieve it, you can either make an ice pack or purchase one. From commercial packs to bags of frozen vegetables, any choice you make can help you alleviate discomfort and reduce inflammation.  You can purchase commercial ice packs specifically designed for the back at many pharmacies and medical supply stores. Make a slushy ice pack by pouring three cups (710 ml) of water and one cup (237 ml) of denatured alcohol in a large freezer bag. Wrap it inside another freezer bag to avoid spilling. Place it in the freezer until it is a slushy consistency. You can put small ice cubes or crushed ice in a plastic bag to make an ice pack. You can also use a bag of frozen vegetables, which may nicely fit the contours of your back. Before you apply your ice pack, wrap it in a towel or cloth. Not only can this keep you from getting wet and keep the pack in place, but may also protect your skin from becoming numb or getting ice burn or even frostbite. It’s especially important to wrap a commercial blue ice pack in a towel. These are colder than frozen water and can cause frostbite. You want to be comfortable while you ice your back. Finding a comfortable place where you can lie or sit can help you relax, relieve discomfort, and get the full benefits of icing.  It may be easier to lie down while icing your back. Be sure to keep your knees slightly bent to relieve pressure off of your lower back. You can also place an ice pack on a chair and hold it in place by wedging it between your back and the chair back. You may need to add a towel between the ice pack and the chair so it doesn’t slip around. Once you’re comfortable, place the ice pack on the area of your back that is causing you pain. This may offer you some immediate pain relief and reduce inflammation that is exacerbating your discomfort.  Keep the pack on the affected area for no more than 20 minutes per session. Less than 10 minutes may be ineffective but too much time can cause damage, so shoot for 15-20 minutes. Doing it for longer than 20 minutes can damage skin (cryoburn) and underlying tissues.  You can use the ice pack after activity or exercise, but don’t use it beforehand. This may prevent your brain from receiving important pain signals to stop.  If your pack doesn’t cover the entire area causing you pain, you can do spot ice treatments to get relief. Practice relaxing and taking deep breaths while you’re using the ice pack to relieve more tension. Use a guided meditation if it helps you feel more therapeutic effects. You can also use elastic wrap or shrink wrap to hold the pack in place. Try taking an over-the-counter pain reliever along with your ice treatments. Using this combination may relieve your pain more quickly and also help control inflammation.  Take acetaminophen, ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen sodium to help relieve your back pain.  NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium may also help relieve inflammation. Ice is most effective for back pain in the days immediately following when you first notice pain. Keep applying the ice until you no longer have pain, or see a doctor if it persists.  You can ice your back up to five times a day with at least 45 minutes in between treatments.  The continued icing keeps your tissue temperatures low and may help reduce inflammation and pain. Consult with your doctor if icing doesn’t help after a week or your pain becomes unbearable. She may be able to treat the pain more effectively and quickly, and can also identify any underlying causes that may be causing you discomfort.

State governments, coastal cities, and local authorities have been put on high alert, engaging in disaster management plans to ensure public safety and minimize potential damage to properties and infrastructure. Formed in the Pacific Ocean, Tropical Storm Frank has been closely monitored by meteorologists and weather agencies, who predict that it may intensify further as it approaches Mexico. With sustained wind speeds of up to 60 miles per hour (95 kilometers per hour), the storm poses a significant threat to the country's western coastline. Frank is expected to produce heavy rainfall, dangerous storm surges, strong winds, and flash flooding in affected areas. The NMS has extended warnings to include all coastal areas of the Mexican states of Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco, with the possibility of extending these alerts to neighboring regions if the storm shifts course. In the meantime, state governments are collaborating with local authorities to develop and implement evacuation plans, prepare emergency shelters, and distribute supplies to at-risk communities. Residents are being urged not to underestimate the power of the storm and to take all necessary precautions in anticipation of its arrival. In response to the approaching storm, tourism authorities in Mexico have issued travel advisories for tourists planning to visit the affected areas. They advise against non-essential travel to these regions until the storm has dissipated and cleanup efforts have concluded. Vacationers currently in the affected regions are urged to stay informed about the developing weather conditions and to abide by any warnings or evacuation orders issued by the local authorities. Cruise lines and airlines serving these destinations have been alerted to the potential for cancellations or delays, and travelers should consult with their providers for information on schedule changes and refund policies. Tropical Storm Frank's encroachment upon the Mexican coast also raises concerns over possible economic and environmental impacts. Agriculture, a vital industry in these coastal states, may suffer damage to crops due to flooding and high winds. The storm may further disrupt fishing and marine operations, leading to a decrease in the supply of fresh seafood and placing pressure on local industries. To mitigate the environmental impact of the storm, clean-up crews stand ready to address possible oil spills, debris, or other disruptions to coastal ecosystems. In the current hurricane season, Tropical Storm Frank serves as a stark reminder of the potentially destructive power of nature. As warnings are extended in preparation for the storm's landfall, it is crucial for governments, communities, and individuals to work together to minimize the hazards associated with this weather event. It is hoped that with effective planning, prompt action, and public cooperation, the human and material toll of Tropical Storm Frank can be minimized and lasting harm prevented."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She became a feature writer for the Office of War Information, and then a reporter for Amerika, a publication of the U.S. State Department. While working there she met Robert Hyde Jacobs Jr., a Columbia-educated architect who was designing warplanes for Grumman. They married in 1944. Together they had a daughter, Burgin, and two sons, James and Ned. They bought a three-story building at 555 Hudson St. Jane continued to write for Amerika after the war, while Robert left Grumman and resumed work as an architect.  The Jacobses rejected the rapidly growing suburbs as \\"parasitic\\", choosing to remain in Greenwich Village. They renovated their house, in the middle of a mixed residential and commercial area, and created a garden in the backyard.  Working for the State Department during the McCarthy era, Jacobs received a questionnaire about her political beliefs and loyalties. Jacobs was anti-communist, and had left the Federal Workers Union because of its apparent communist sympathies. Nevertheless, she was pro-union and purportedly appreciated the writing of Saul Alinsky; therefore she was under suspicion. On March 25, 1952, Jacobs delivered a now-famous response to Conrad E. Snow, chairman of the Loyalty Security Board at the United States Department of State. In her foreword to her answer, she said:  The other threat to the security of our tradition, I believe, lies at home. It is the current fear of radical ideas and of people who propound them.

Question: What does Ludovic wish to live as? Title: My Life in Pink Movie plot: When the Fabre family move into their dream house with wonderful neighbors, everything seems perfect except for one thing â the youngest child Ludovic wishes to function as a girl; while he was born a boy, he feels that he is a girl and wants to live as a female. The rest of the family humor him as best they can, rationalizing that Ludovic is only trying to find his identity and will soon be over it . Trouble begins when Ludovic befriends JÃ©rÃ´me, the son of her father's boss, and expresses a desire to marry him when Ludovic is finally a girl. When visiting JÃ©rÃ´me's house, Ludovic enters his sister's room and puts on one of her dresses, not realizing that the sister is deceased and the room was merely kept in memory of her. JÃ©rÃ´me's mother sees this and she and the rest of the neighbors are horrified. The community turns against Ludovic and, by extension, the rest of the Fabre family. After Ludovic stands in as Snow White in a school play, the parents of the other students send in a petition to have him expelled. Ludovic's father, under strain as an employee of JÃ©rÃ´me's father, is unable to cope and causes conflict within the family. After a particularly bad argument, Ludovic attempts to mend the situation by hiding in a freezer to commit suicide. He is found in time and allowed to wear a skirt to a neighborhood party. While the other neighbors greet him warmly, Ludo's father gets fired the next day and finds his house spray-painted with graffiti. Ludo runs out of the house, distraught. Hanna, Ludovic's mother, blames him for everything that has gone wrong. She wants to set Ludo straight, so she cuts his hair to make him look like his brothers. Ludo grows resentment towards his mother for doing this, ultimately deciding that he wants to live with his grandmother. When Ludo and his grandmother go visit his parents one weekend, the father announces that he has a new job, but it is out of town and they have to move.

Background: Ryan was born in Refugio, south of Victoria in south Texas, the youngest of six children, to Lynn Nolan Ryan Sr. (1907-1970), and the former Martha Lee Hancock (1913-1990). The senior Ryan operated a newspaper delivery service for the Houston Post that required him to rise in the early morning hours to prepare 1,500 newspapers for delivery over a 55-mile route. The children were expected to help with the daily tasks. Context: Nolan Ryan's post-retirement business interests include ownership of two minor league teams: the Corpus Christi Hooks, which play in the Class AA Texas League, and the Round Rock Express, a Class AAA team in the Pacific Coast League. Both teams were affiliates of the Houston Astros, for whom Ryan also served as a special assistant to the general manager until selling his interest in the team in the off-season between 2004 and 2005. He became the president of the Texas Rangers in 2008. The Express became the Rangers' AAA affiliate beginning in 2010; the Hooks are still the Astros' AA affiliate and were purchased by the Astros in 2013 when Nolan's son, Reid Ryan, took office as President of the Houston Astros.  Ryan threw out the ceremonial first pitch before Game 3 of the 2005 World Series between the Astros and the White Sox, the first World Series game ever played in Texas. That game went 14 innings, equaling the longest in innings in World Series history (at 5:41, it was the longest in time). ESPN wryly suggested the Astros might have needed to pull the 58-year-old Ryan out of retirement if the game had gone much longer.  Ryan has co-written six books: autobiographies Miracle Man (with Jerry Jenkins, 1992), Throwing Heat (with Harvey Frommer, 1988) and The Road to Cooperstown (with Mickey Herskowitz and T.R. Sullivan, 1999); Kings of the Hill (with Mickey Herskowitz, 1992), about contemporary pitchers; and instructional books Pitching and Hitting (with Joe Torre and Joel Cohen, 1977), and Nolan Ryan's Pitcher's Bible (with Tom House, 1991).  In addition to his baseball activities, Ryan was majority owner and chairman of Express Bank of Alvin but sold his interest in 2005. He also owned a restaurant in Three Rivers, Texas. He served on the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission from 1995 to 2001. He appeared as a TV spokesman for Advil for several years, promoting the pain medication he recommended for his own arm. He also has appeared in various television commercials shown in the Texas market.  After retiring from baseball, Ryan teamed up with the federal government to promote physical fitness. His likeness was used in the \\"Nolan Ryan Fitness Guide\\", published by The President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports in 1994. Ryan suffered a heart attack on April 25, 2000, and had to receive a double coronary bypass. Question: what did he retire from?

Bagge , a student of Werner Heisenberg for his doctorate and Habilitation , was engaged in German Atomic Energy research and the German nuclear energy project during the Second World War . He worked as an Assistant at the Kaiser - Wilhelm - Institut für Physik in Berlin . Bagge , who became associated professor at the University of Hamburg in 1948 , was in particular involved in the usage of nuclear power for trading vessels , and he was one of the founders of the Society for the Usage of Nuclear Energy in Ship - Building and Seafare . The first German nuclear vessel , the \`\` NS Otto Hahn '' , was launched in 1962 . A research reactor was installed in Geesthacht near Hamburg at about the same time which has over the years formed into a center for materials research with neutrons .  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Quantum mechanics (QM; also known as quantum physics or quantum theory), including quantum field theory, is a branch of physics which is the fundamental theory of nature at small scales and low energies of atoms and subatomic particles. Classical physics, the physics existing before quantum mechanics, derives from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid only at large (macroscopic) scales. Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum and other quantities are often restricted to discrete values (quantization), objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave-particle duality), and there are limits to the precision with which quantities can be known (Uncertainty principle).   - In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, nuclear fission is either a nuclear reaction or a radioactive decay process in which the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts (lighter nuclei). The fission process often produces free neutrons and gamma photons, and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay.  - Habilitation is a post-doctoral qualification or academic degree at some European and Central Asian, North African, and Latin American universities. It is conferred for a habilitation thesis based on independent scholarship, which was reviewed by and successfully defended before an academic committee in a process similar to that of a doctoral dissertation. In some countries, a habilitation degree is a required formal qualification to independently teach and examine a designated subject at the university level.  - An urban area is a human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment.  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - The Spree is a river that flows through the Saxony, Brandenburg and Berlin states of Germany, and in the Ústí nad Labem region of the Czech Republic. Approximately in length, it is a left bank tributary of the River Havel, which itself flows into the Elbe and then the North Sea. It is the river on which the original centre of Berlin was built.  - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances.  - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.  - Werner Karl Heisenberg (5 December 1901  1 February 1976) was a German theoretical physicist and one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics. He published his work in 1925 in a breakthrough paper. In the subsequent series of papers with Max Born and Pascual Jordan, during the same year, this matrix formulation of quantum mechanics was substantially elaborated. In 1927 he published his uncertainty principle, upon which he built his philosophy and for which he is best known. Heisenberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1932 \\"for the creation of quantum mechanics\\".  - Coburg is a town located on the Itz river in the Upper Franconia region of Bavaria, Germany. Long part of one of the Thuringian states of the Wettin line, it joined Bavaria by popular vote only in 1920. Until the revolution of 1918, it was one of the capitals of the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Through successful dynastic policies, the ruling princely family married into several of the royal families of Europe, most notably in the person of Prince Albert, who married Queen Victoria in 1840. As a result of these close links with the royal houses of Europe in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Coburg was frequently visited by the crowned heads of Europe and their families.  - The European Plain or Great European Plain is a plain in Europe and is a major feature of one of four major topographical units of Europe - the \\"Central and Interior Lowlands\\". It is the largest mountain-free landform in Europe, although a number of highlands are identified within it.  - Max Born (11 December 1882  5 January 1970) was a German physicist and mathematician who was instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics. He also made contributions to solid-state physics and optics and supervised the work of a number of notable physicists in the 1920s and 1930s. Born won the 1954 Nobel Prize in Physics for his \\"fundamental research in Quantum Mechanics, especially in the statistical interpretation of the wave function\\".  - A chemist (from Greek chm (ía) alchemy + -ist; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English.  - Ernst Pascual Jordan (18 October 1902  31 July 1980) was a theoretical and mathematical physicist who made significant contributions to quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. He contributed much to the mathematical form of matrix mechanics, and developed canonical anticommutation relations for fermions. While the Jordan algebra is employed for and is still used in studying the mathematical and conceptual foundations of quantum theory, it has found other mathematical applications.  - Neustadt bei Coburg (also written \\"Neustadt b. Coburg\\") is a town in the district of Coburg in northern Bavaria, Germany. It is situated 15 km northeast of Coburg, as its name indicates.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The Nobel Prize in Physics is a yearly award given by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for those who conferred the most outstanding contributions for mankind in the field of physics. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895 and awarded since 1901; the others being the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Literature, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.  - Otto Hahn, , (8 March 1879  28 July 1968) was a German chemist and pioneer in the fields of radioactivity and radiochemistry. He was exclusively awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1944 for the discovery and the radiochemical proof of nuclear fission. He is referred to as the father of nuclear chemistry.  - The Nobel Prize in Chemistry is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists in the various fields of chemistry. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895, awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. This award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on proposal of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry which consists of five members elected by Academy. The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. The first Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded in 1901 to Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, of the Netherlands, \\"for his discovery of the laws of chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure in solutions.\\"    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'occupation' with 'physicist'. The answer is:","output":"Werner Karl Heisenberg"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Two women go into a doctor's office for a routine physical. As is usual for a physical, the doctor takes a blood sample from both women to analyze for any issues. Upon looking at the blood, the doctor notices that Jan's platelet count is low, but other than that her blood is fine. Marcia's platelet count is not low and she has no other issues.  Which woman is less likely to have hemophilia? A:","output":"Before answering the question, let's first understand what hemophilia is and its relationship with platelet count. Hemophilia is a genetic bleeding disorder that affects the body's ability to clot blood properly. It is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of clotting factors, specifically factor VIII (Hemophilia A) or factor IX (Hemophilia B). These clotting factors help blood to clot and are essential for preventing and stopping bleeding, especially after an injury. Hemophilia is more common in males than in females, as it is an X-linked recessive disorder, meaning that males with the affected gene on their X chromosome will express the condition, while females with one affected gene usually become carriers. Now, let's discuss platelet counts and their role in blood clotting. Platelets, also known as thrombocytes, are small cell fragments that play a crucial role in blood clotting. When an injury occurs and a blood vessel is damaged, platelets gather around the site of the injury and clump together to form a clot to prevent excessive bleeding. A normal platelet count ranges from 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood. A low platelet count, or thrombocytopenia, can increase the risk of bleeding, but it is caused by factors unrelated to hemophilia, such as bone marrow disorders, certain medications, or an autoimmune condition. In this scenario, Jan has a low platelet count, while Marcia's platelet count is within the normal range. However, a low platelet count is not indicative of hemophilia, as hemophilia is caused by a deficiency in clotting factors, not a deficiency in platelets. Therefore, having a low platelet count does not make Jan more likely to have hemophilia. Since both women have no other issues with their blood, and given the information provided, there is no basis for determining that one woman is less likely to have hemophilia than the other. It is important to note that, in general, women are less likely to have hemophilia than men due to the nature of the genetic inheritance, but without further information, it is not possible to definitively say which woman mentioned is less likely to have hemophilia. The platelet count difference does not provide enough evidence to make this determination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Traffic is still an important indicator of a good business, whether with or without SecondLife search. Make this lower case.","output":"Giving away a few Linden Dollars can serve multiple purposes in Second Life, a virtual world where users can socialize, create, and trade using the in-world currency called Linden Dollars (L). One of the main reasons users may choose to give away Linden Dollars is to draw attention and promote their in-world offers, products, or services. By giving away Linden Dollars, they can effectively generate interest and encourage other users to explore their offerings. Traffic is a crucial component in the success of any business, both in the real world and within virtual platforms such as Second Life. A higher traffic volume within a virtual shop or service implies that more users are visiting and interacting with the establishment, which can lead to increased sales and better brand exposure. Second Life tracks the number of users visiting a location within a particular time frame and labels this metric as \\"traffic\\" in the search results. Many businesses in Second Life aim to increase their traffic numbers, as it directly influences the visibility and search ranking of their location. A higher search ranking can attract even more visitors, creating a cycle that, in turn, increases brand exposure and sales. To give away Linden Dollars effectively, consider these strategies: 1. Host promotions and events: Announce special promotions or host events that offer Linden Dollars as rewards or giveaways. This will entice users to visit your location and participate in the activities, ultimately increasing traffic and potential revenue. 2. Offer incentives to loyal customers: Reward long-term or loyal patrons with occasional Linden Dollar incentives. This recognition not only keeps them engaged but also encourages their peers to visit and potentially become loyal customers themselves. 3. Collaborate with other businesses: Partner with other in-world establishments to cross-promote your location and jointly give and receive Linden Dollar incentives. This collaboration expands your reach, and by combining resources, both businesses can experience increased traffic. 4. Use social media and groups: Leverage the power of social media and in-world groups to announce your Linden Dollar giveaways. This helps in reaching a wider audience and ensures that maximum users are aware of your promotions. 5. Track the results: Monitor the impact of your efforts on traffic levels and sales. By evaluating the data, you can finetune your strategies and determine the most effective ways to distribute Linden Dollars to boost your business. To summarize, giving away Linden Dollars in Second Life can serve as a powerful tool for generating traffic and expanding awareness of your products or services. By offering promotions and incentives that incorporate Linden Dollars, you can create a positive cycle of increased traffic and revenue, boosting your business's success within the virtual realm of Second Life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I dried off and got a coke out of the cooler. It was getting to be another Texas scorcher, and the sunlight bouncing off the surface of the lake felt like it had needles in it. My mouth was dry from breathing canned air and the carbonation burned like fire. Winslow, from the sheriff's office, sat down next to me. 'I appreciate this, Dan,' he said. 'No problem.' Sam Winslow and I had grown up together about twenty miles outside Austin in a little town called Coupland. We'd fought a lot as kids, and there were still plenty of differences in our politics and educations. But being on the police and fire rescue squad had brought me closer to him again, and I was glad of it. A private detective needs all the friends he can get. 'What do you make of it?' I asked him. 'Accidental drowning, looks like.' I raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything. 'He's got a bump on the head that could have come off a rock. We'll see what the coroner says.' 'Any idea who he is?' Winslow shook his head. He'd gained weight in his face recently and his jowls vibrated with the gesture.

Additionally, it's one of the three official languages of Luxembourg and a co-official language in the Opole Voivodeship in Poland.  As for the dialects of German, they vary vastly from place to place, with certain dialects being practically unreachable to most standard German speakers. However, the standardized form, Hochdeutsch, is widely taught in schools and commonly used in formal settings, the media, and literature. And about German literature, it possesses a rich historical tradition with significant contributions from renowned figures such as Thomas Mann, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and Friedrich Schiller.  Furthermore, the German language is known for constructing long, compound words due to its morphological structure. It's reported that there's no limit on how long these compounds can be, and they often result in vocabulary that very precisely describes a specific concept or phenomenon. For example, \\"Donaudampfschiffahrtselektrizitätenhauptbetriebswerkbauunterbeamtengesellschaft,\\" which is recognized by the Guinness World Records as the longest German word in everyday use, translates to \\"Association for Subordinate Officials of the Main Maintenance Building of the Danube Steam Shipping Electrical Services.\\" Your provided text roughly translates to: \\"Since this is the case, and since President Berlusconi has expressed that a number of critical points that were previously there have been positively dealt with in Brussels - 82 points were mentioned - it would be sensible to consolidate this now to maintain the momentum.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A few weeks later, she hires her henchmen, Jasper and Horace, to steal them. When Scotland Yard is unable to find them, Pongo and Perdita use the \\"Twilight bark\\", a canine gossip line, to ask for help from the other dogs in London. Colonel, an old sheepdog, along with his compatriots Captain, a gray horse, and Sergeant Tibbs, a tabby cat, find the puppies in a place called Hell Hall (Cruella's abandoned and dilapidated family estate, also known as The De Vil Place), along with many other dalmatian puppies that she had bought from various dog stores. When Tibbs learns they are going to be made into dog-skin fur coats, Colonel quickly sends word back to London. Upon receiving the message, Pongo and Perdita leave town to retrieve their puppies. Winter has come, and they have to cross the Stour River which is running fast and laden with slabs of broken ice. Meanwhile, Tibbs overhears Cruella ordering Jasper and Horace to kill the puppies that night out of fear the police will soon find them. In response, Tibbs attempts to rescue them while Jasper and Horace are preoccupied watching television, but they finish their show and come for them before he can get them out of the house. Pongo and Perdita break in and confront Jasper and Horace just as they are about to kill the puppies. While the adult dogs attack them, Colonel and Tibbs...

I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: The French Connection Movie plot: In Marseille, an undercover detective is following Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey), a wealthy French criminal who runs the largest heroin-smuggling syndicate in the world. The policeman is assassinated by Charnier's hitman, Pierre Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi). Charnier plans to smuggle 32 million worth of heroin into the United States by hiding it in the car of his unsuspecting friend, French television personality Henri Devereaux (FrÃ©dÃ©ric de Pasquale). In New York City, detectives Jimmy \\"Popeye\\" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and Buddy \\"Cloudy\\" Russo (Roy Scheider) are conducting an undercover stakeout in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. After seeing a drug transaction take place in a bar, Cloudy goes in to make an arrest, but the suspect makes a break for it, cutting Cloudy on the arm with a knife. After catching up with their suspect and severely beating him, the detectives interrogate the man, who reveals his drug connection. Later, Popeye and Cloudy go out for drinks at the Copacabana, where Popeye notices Salvatore \\"Sal\\" Boca (Tony Lo Bianco) and his young wife Angie (Arlene Farber) entertaining mob members involved in narcotics. They decide to tail the couple, and soon learn that the Bocas, who run a modest newsstand luncheonette, have criminal records: Sal for armed robbery and murder, and Angie for shoplifting. The detectives suspect that the Bocas, who frequent several nightclubs and drive expensive cars, are involved in some kind of criminal operation. They soon establish a link between the Bocas and lawyer Joel Weinstock (Harold Gary), who is part of the narcotics underworld. Soon after, Popeye learns from an informant that a major shipment of heroin will arrive in the New York area. The detectives convince their supervisor, Walt Simonson (Eddie Egan), to wiretap the Bocas' phones, and they use several ruses to obtain additional information. Popeye and Cloudy are joined in the investigation by a federal agent named Mulderig (Bill Hickman). Popeye and Mulderig dislike each other based on having worked together in... My question: Why does Charnier want to conclude the deal quickly? A:","output":"Charnier wants to conclude the deal quickly for several reasons.  Firstly, the drug trade, particularly at the level of an international heroin-smuggling syndicate, is a high-risk business. The longer it takes to finalize a deal, the more time law enforcement has to catch wind of the operation and potentially disrupt or dismantle it. By moving quickly, Charnier can minimize the likelihood of drawing attention to his criminal activities, whether from rival criminals or law enforcement. Secondly, in the underworld of drug trafficking, reputation is crucial. Charnier has been successful so far as a wealthy French criminal running the largest heroin-smuggling syndicate in the world, and to maintain that position, he must continue to demonstrate his ability to conduct transactions efficiently and effectively. A swift and successful deal will not only keep his current customers satisfied but also attract new clients who seek a reliable and discreet supplier. Furthermore, time is money in the illegal drug trade, and the quicker Charnier can turn over his product, the faster he can reinvest his profits into new shipments, contacts, or infrastructure that can help expand and solidify his criminal empire. A speedy deal allows Charnier to maintain a continuous flow of income and reinvest profits to stay ahead of his competition and law enforcement. Additionally, Charnier's plan to smuggle the heroin into the United States by hiding it in the car of his unsuspecting friend, French television personality Henri Devereaux, adds a degree of time sensitivity to the operation. Charnier must work within the constraints of Devereaux's schedule and make sure the heroin is transported and offloaded before Devereaux becomes aware of the illicit cargo or before anyone connected to Devereaux has a chance to uncover the hidden drugs. Lastly, Charnier's hitman, Pierre Nicoli, has assassinated an undercover detective in Marseille. This act could attract significant unwanted attention from law enforcement agencies, both in France and internationally. With increased scrutiny on Charnier's activities, it is crucial for him to conclude the deal as promptly as possible before authorities can connect the dots and link him and his operation to the murder. In conclusion, Charnier wants to conclude the deal quickly to minimize risks, maintain his reputation, maximize profits, work within the constraints of his smuggling plan, and avoid detection by law enforcement, especially in light of the recent assassination of an undercover detective."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Beijing (CNN) -- The policeman tapping on our car window makes it clear we are in a no-go area before placing his hand over the lens of our camera. Later, filming across the road, a Chinese soldier approaches and makes it clear it is time to move on. Things are tense around the Japanese embassy in Beijing.

Problem:Context_1 : Griffon is a steel Dive Coaster roller coaster located at the Busch Gardens Williamsburg amusement park in James City County, Virginia, United States. Designed by Bolliger & Mabillard, it is 205 ft high, and is the second-fastest (71 mph ) Dive Coaster built. The roller coaster features two Immelmann loops, a splashdown, two vertical drops and was the first of its kind to use floorless trains. Griffon was announced to the public on August 23, 2006 and opened on May 18, 2007 to positive reviews by both newspapers and enthusiasts. In 2007, \\"Amusement Today\\"' s annual Golden Ticket Awards voted it the third-best new steel roller coaster of that year and the 27th-best steel roller coaster. It was voted the 33rd-best steel roller coaster in 2013. Context_2 : Six Flags Discovery Kingdom (formerly known as Six Flags Marine World, Marine World, The New Marine World Theme Park, and Marine World Africa USA) is a 135-acre (55 ha) animal theme park located in Vallejo, California, roughly halfway between San Francisco and Sacramento on Interstate 80. The park includes a variety of roller coasters and other amusement rides. Discovery Kingdom has been part of the Six Flags chain of amusement parks since 1999. Context_3 : Tatsu is a steel flying roller coaster designed by Bolliger & Mabillard at the Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement park located in Valencia, California, United States. Announced on November 17, 2005, the roller coaster opened to the public on May 13, 2006 as the park's seventeenth roller coaster. Tatsu reaches a height of 170 ft and speeds up to 62 mph . The ride's name means \\"Flying Beast\\" in Japanese. The roller coaster is also the world's tallest and fastest flying coaster; is the only flying roller coaster to feature a zero-gravity roll; and has the world's highest pretzel loop. It was the world's longest flying coaster until The Flying Dinosaur surpassed it. Context_4 : Intimidator is a steel roller coaster built by Bolliger & Mabillard at Carowinds. The roller coaster is located in the Celebration Plaza section of the park on the former site of the Wild Thornberry's River Adventure log flume ride. Intimidator is the thirteenth roller coaster installed at Carowinds and is located near the entrance of the theme park. It is currently one of the tallest, fastest and longest roller coasters in the Southeast with a 232 ft lift hill, a top speed of 75 mph and a track length of 5316 ft . It was announced on August 26, 2009 and opened March 27, 2010. The roller coaster's name comes from the nickname of NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt. Context_5 : Fujiyama is a steel roller coaster at Fuji-Q Highland, Fujiyoshida, Yamanashi, Japan. When Fujiyama opened in 1996 it was the world's tallest roller coaster at 259 ft , and had the largest drop in the world at 230 ft . Fujiyama was also the world's fastest roller coaster for a year of its operation, succeeded by Tower of Terror at Dreamworld theme park in Queensland, Australia in 1997. Despite being the world's fastest roller coaster in operation for a year, Fujiyama set no world records for roller coaster speed. Steel Phantom at Kennywood set the world record for speed before engineers added additional brakes to slow the ride down because of safety and rider comfort concerns. Context_6 : Goliath is a steel Hyper Coaster located at the Six Flags Over Georgia amusement park in Cobb County, Georgia, United States. Designed by Bolliger & Mabillard it reaches a maximum height of 200 ft , a top speed of 70 mi/h , and has approximately 4480 ft of track. Great Gasp and Looping Starship were both removed by the end of the 2005 season to make room for the roller coaster. Goliath was announced to the public on September 1, 2005 and opened on April 1, 2006. In 2006, \\"Amusement Today\\"' s annual Golden Ticket Awards voted it the fourth-best new steel roller coaster of that year and the 9th-best steel roller coaster. It was voted the 7th-best steel roller coaster in 2013. Context_7 : Millennium Force is a steel roller coaster built by Intamin at Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. It was the fourteenth roller coaster to be built at the park since Blue Streak opened in 1964. Upon completion in 2000, Millennium Force broke six world records and was the world's first Giga Coaster, a roller coaster that exceeds 300 ft in height and completes a full circuit. It was briefly the tallest and fastest in the world until Steel Dragon 2000 opened later the same year. The ride is also the third-longest roller coaster in North America after The Beast at Kings Island and Fury 325 at Carowinds. It was the first roller coaster to use a cable lift system rather than a traditional chain lift. The coaster has a 310 ft , 45-degree lift hill with a 300 ft drop and features two tunnels, three overbanked turns, and four hills. It has a top speed of 93 mph . Context_8 : Kong is a steel Suspended Looping Coaster, made by Vekoma, located at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo, California. Context_9 : White Cyclone (ホワイトサイクロン , Howaito Saikuron ) is a wooden roller coaster at Nagashima Spa Land in Mie Prefecture, Japan. At 1700 m in length, White Cyclone is the third longest wooden roller coaster in the world, and is the longest wooden roller coaster outside of the United States. Despite its length, White Cyclone is still considerably shorter than the 2479 m Steel Dragon 2000, the world's longest steel roller coaster, which is also at Nagashima Spa Land. In addition to being the third longest wooden roller coaster, White Cyclone is the seventh tallest wooden roller coaster in the world and the fourth tallest wooden roller coaster outside the United States. A single ride on the White Cyclone costs ¥1,000 (approximately 9 USD), and the ride is restricted to those individuals above 1.3 m in height; and those individuals under 54 years of age. Context_10 : A wooden roller coaster is most often classified as a roller coaster with running rails made of flattened steel strips mounted on laminated wooden track. Occasionally, the support structure may be made out of a steel lattice or truss, but the ride remains classified as a wooden roller coaster due to the track design. Because of the limits of wood, wooden roller coasters, in general, do not have inversions (when the coaster goes upside down), steep drops, or extremely banked turns (overbanked turns). However, there are exceptions; the defunct Son of Beast at Kings Island had a 214 ft drop and originally had a 90 ft loop until the end of the 2006 season, although the loop had steel supports. Other special cases are Hades 360 at Mount Olympus Water and Theme Park in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin. The coaster features a double-track tunnel, a corkscrew, and a 90-degree banked turn. There is also The Voyage at Holiday World (an example of a wooden roller coaster with a steel structure for supports) featuring three separate 90-degree banked turns. Ravine Flyer II at Waldameer Park has a 90-degree banked turn, T Express at Everland in South Korea with a 77-degree drop, and Outlaw Run at Silver Dollar City which has 3 inversions and 120-degree overbanked turn. fact_1 : Kong is a steel Suspended Looping Coaster, made by Vekoma, located at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo, California. fact_2 :  The park includes a variety of roller coasters and other amusement rides.

Given that Ash values their friendship, they would most likely choose actions that reflect an understanding of the effects of their behavior on the relationship.  There are a few actions that Ash might consider, some of which could work to strengthen or weaken the friendship: 1. Apologize and admit their wrongdoing: The first thing Ash needs to do is admit that they made a mistake. This means offering a sincere and heartfelt apology to their friend. They should acknowledge how their actions hurt their friend and express genuine regret for what they did. Ash will need to take responsibility for their actions and assure their friend that it won't happen again. 2. Return the toy: Ash will need to return the stolen toy to their friend as soon as possible. This tangible act of restoring their friend's possession can help demonstrate their sincerity and commitment to making things right between them. 3. Make amends: For Ash to rebuild trust between themselves and their friend, they may want to find a way to compensate for the harm their actions caused. This could involve replacing the toy (if it was damaged or lost during the theft) or buying their friend a new toy as a gesture of goodwill. Ash could also consider other appropriate actions, such as doing something nice for their friend or spending time together to work through the issue. 4. Reflect on their behavior: Ash needs to ask themselves why they felt compelled to steal the toy in the first place. Understanding the underlying reasons, such as envy or a desire for attention, can help Ash recognize any potential patterns in their own behavior and work towards self-improvement. 5. Avoid stealing in the future: It's essential for Ash to learn from this experience and make conscious decisions not to engage in similar acts in the future. This includes resisting any temptation to steal from others and actively choosing more constructive and positive ways to cope with personal issues. 6. Strengthen the friendship: Ash could focus on ways to strengthen their bond with their friend by engaging in shared activities, being a good listener, and offering support. Demonstrating reliability and trustworthiness will be crucial in rebuilding trust between them. In summary, Ash should address the situation by apologizing, returning the toy, making amends, and reflecting on their actions. They should also commit to improving their behavior and working on their friendship to ensure a stronger and more trust-based relationship with their friend moving forward."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information. They both ask about the reason behind Cyrus Mistry's removal as the chairman of Tata Sons. Cyrus Mistry was removed from the position of the chairman of Tata Sons on 24th October 2016 and replaced by Ratan Tata as the interim chairman. This unexpected ousting of Mistry created ripples in the business world as it was an unprecedented move by the conglomerate. Several factors contributed to Cyrus Mistry's removal from the position: 1. Performance Concerns: Tata Sons cited that the company's performance under Mistry's tenure was not up to the expectations. There was a decline in revenue and profits, raising concerns about the financial health of the conglomerate. The lack of satisfactory performance on various business parameters was a major reason behind his removal. 2. Leadership Style and Decision Making: Mistry's leadership style was perceived as indecisive, leading to loss of confidence by Tata Sons' board members. There were concerns about his reluctance to take bold decisions, and the slow pace of execution of critical projects, which impacted the company's growth. 3. Misalignment with Tata Values and Ethics: The Tata Group, known for its value-based and ethical approach, was believed to have experienced a deviation from these principles under Mistry's tenure. Instances such as the alleged corporate governance lapses at AirAsia India and the handling of Tata-Mistry conflict demonstrated a value misalignment with the Tata Group's philosophy, causing discomfort within the company's leadership. 4. Poor Management of Legacy Businesses: Some of the key businesses of the Tata Group, such as Tata Steel, Indian Hotels, and Tata Teleservices, had been struggling during Mistry's tenure. Tata Sons believed that the situation was not aptly managed by Cyrus Mistry, leading to further decline and harm to the group's interests. 5. Lack of Communication and Trust: Another critical issue was the lack of communication and trust between Mistry and other stakeholders of the Tata Group, particularly the Tata Trusts and its Chairman Ratan Tata. The strained relationship between the leadership ultimately led to the inability to work cohesively for the company's welfare. Following Cyrus Mistry's removal, a bitter public feud ensued between Mistry and Tata Sons, with both parties trading allegations against each other. Ultimately, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in December 2019 ruled that Mistry's removal as the chairman was illegal. However, in March 2020, the Supreme Court of India stayed the NCLAT order, and eventually, in March 2021, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Tata Sons, upholding Mistry's removal as legal."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The former lovebirds walked the carpet together in coordinating punk-inspired outfits and posed for pics as a couple.      The duo was also spotted last week at an NYC Kabbalah center.      Before Zaibat, Madge dated model Jesus Luz. She also has daughter Lourdes with ex Carlos Leon, son Rocco with ex-hubby Guy Ritchie and adopted son and daughter, David and Mercy.      Meanwhile, Madonna recently visited Haiti with her ex-husband Sean Penn. Penn invited his ex to tour the nation with him as part of his J/P Haiti Relief Organization's earthquake relief efforts.      Madonna's posted tons of pics of her family trip to the Caribbean island. \\"The Prime Minister Of Haiti!

This photograph, featuring a French far right politician asleep on a plane, has amassed almost 200,000 likes on Facebook and been shared more than 30,000 times.      Now the man who took it is being sued, and blamed for disrupting the recent French elections.      The man asleep on the right of the photo is Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of France's National Front party. The man on the left is Brahim Zaibat, a professional dancer, and one of Madonna's ex-boyfriends.      Zaibat, who is half-Algerian, posted the picture on 12 December, after both men just happened to be seated near each other on a flight.      The date is significant as it was the day before the second round of France's regional elections in which the National Front were hoping for a string of important victories after a strong showing in the first round.      The photo appeared on Zaibat's Facebook with the accompanying message: \\"Knock out [the National Front] tomorrow by going to vote. Preserve our fraternal France!!! #Iloveit.\\"      The picture was an instant hit among Zaibat's fans, who liked, shared and commented on it en masse. \\"This photo is beautiful. Long live France, it will never be the land of the far right,\\" wrote one. It spawned a lengthy debate about racism in France, and Le Pen's relevance to the party he founded.      The following day the National Front - now led by Jean-Marie's daughter Marine Le Pen - failed to win a single region in the local elections in a result that surprised many commentators.      Follow BBC Trending on Facebook      Join the conversation on this and other stories here.      Jean-Marie Le Pen has now determined that the party's failure was at least in part down to Zaibat's potentially embarrassing photo, and rallying cry.      On Sunday French magazine Public reported that Le Pen is claiming €50,000 (£37,000) in damages from Zaibat, and demanding a public apology, claiming that the photo \\"harmed his image and was instrumental in the defeat of the party\\". Another French publication, Rue 89, has confirmed that Jean-Marie Le Pen is suing Zaibat for breach of privacy.      If you find it unlikely that a picture of a sleeping politician could change the course of a major election, you aren't alone. The more conventional analysis is that, despite winning a significant share of the vote, rival parties worked together and stood down some of their candidates to block the National Front winning in any single region.      Not only that, Jean-Marie ceded power to his daughter Marine almost five years ago now. Since then she has attempted to renew the party's image. And in August the National Front even expelled Jean-Marie Le Pen in an effort to shed its extremist reputation.      French media is reporting that the first hearing of Le Pen's complaint is set to take place on 22 January. Zaibat has yet to comment publicly on the damages claim.

It's the best time to develop your skills with different people, such as teachers, classmates, and roommates. Your social skills and relationships with people in college will have an influence long after you graduate. Here are some tips on developing your people skills at college. Put yourself out there and meet new people You're very likely to make some lifelong friendships at college. But before you get there you have to start by making friends. Upperclassmen and the college itself will organize events to introduce you and your peers to each other and the new college environment. For the purpose of improving your social skills early on, attend every single one. Join clubs that fit your interests. You can meet many people there and it's a safe bet that you will have something in common. Being active on social networks, such as Renren and micro blogs, is also a good way to meet people, especially if you're not so good at face-to-face conversation. Always open yourself to conversation Your chances of making new friends depends on your ability to get a friendly atmosphere across. Simple gestures, such as moving your things from a chair when someone is looking for a place in the canteen, can make you seem more open to conversation. You can also take out your earphones when someone asks to share a table with you in the common room while you're studying. Try to get along with roommates Getting along with roommates is a challenge you'd be wise to overcome. You live together, so you will often spend time together without even trying to. It's important to make sure that dorm life doesn't make you unhappy. You should be cautious about facing your roommates over any problems, especially if you have only just met.

Article: Image copyright Thinkstock      Even low levels of light in bedrooms may stop breast cancer drugs from working, US researchers have warned.      Animal tests showed light, equivalent to that from street lamps, could lead to tumours becoming resistant to the widely used drug Tamoxifen.      The study, published in the journal Cancer Research, showed the light affected sleep hormones, which in turn altered cancer cell function.      UK experts said it was an intriguing finding, but not proven in people.      Tamoxifen has transformed the treatment of breast cancer by extending lives and increasing survival times.      It stops the female hormone oestrogen fuelling the growth of tumours although the cancerous cells may eventually become resistant to the drug.      Light      Researchers at the Tulane University School of Medicine investigated the role of the body clock in Tamoxifen resistance.      They focused their research on the sleep-promoting hormone melatonin, which normally begins to rise in the evening and continues through the night, before falling away as dawn approaches.      However, light in the evening - such as from a smartphone, tablet or artificial lights - can lower melatonin levels.      Rats, with human breast cancer and treated with Tamoxifen, were left to sleep in a completely dark cage or one that had dim light.      The scientists showed that in dim light, melatonin levels were lower, the tumours were bigger and were resistant to Tamoxifen.      A second set of tests showed that giving those mice melatonin supplements kept Tamoxifen working and resulted in smaller tumours.      Image copyright Thinkstock      Dr Steven Hill told the BBC News website: \\"I'm not advocating people buy melatonin over the counter, there's not enough evidence.      \\"But they could make sure they sleep in a room that is completely dark or they could wear eye-masks to let night-time melatonin rise and take Tamoxifen right before going to bed, that would be the easiest way to see if it works.\\"      Some studies have suggested that melatonin may improve cancer treatments.      It has been suggested that the hormone calms down cancer cells, which are working on overdrive, to slow down the processes needed to develop resistance.      Dr Hill wants to move the research into human breast tissue.      Evening tech      He did add a warning about using technology, which tends to produce blue light wavelengths that disrupt melatonin production, in the run-up to bedtime.      \\"If you get seven hours sleep at night, but use an iPad or computer or watch TV then those blue wavelengths are suppressing melatonin production for anywhere from an hour to an hour and half.      \\"So instead of seven hours of melatonin, you're getting six or five and a half.\\"      Dr Samuel Godfrey, from the charity Cancer Research UK, said: \\"The link between developing drug-resistant breast cancer and sleeping in dim light is an intriguing one, but it's important that we remember this link was found after studying a small number of rats implanted with breast cancer cells, not humans.      \\"More research in people is needed before we know whether the same mechanisms are at work in people.\\" ||||| Melatonin      Other common name(s): none      Scientific/medical name(s): N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine      Description      Melatonin is a hormone produced naturally by the pineal gland-- a pea-sized gland located just beneath the center of the brain-- in response to darkness. Melatonin is also available as a man-made supplement.      Overview      Research suggests that the melatonin made by the body plays a large role in the daily rhythms of sleeping and waking. Some recent studies have found that people who work night shifts may be at increased risk for cancer, which could be linked to melatonin levels in the body. Study results regarding the effect of melatonin supplements on survival and quality of life in people with cancer have been mixed, and further research in this area is needed.      How is it promoted for use?      There is some evidence that melatonin may have a role in the regulation of daily body cycles, sleep patterns, mood, and reproduction. Possible effects on tumor growth and aging are also under study.      Melatonin is promoted mainly as a sleep aid. Its production in the body may decrease with age, which, according to proponents, may explain why many older people have trouble sleeping. Melatonin is also promoted to help people adjust to odd or irregular work schedules and to counter the effects of jet lag, as it may restore normal sleeping and waking schedules. Some practitioners also believe that melatonin influences hormones in the body that regulate reproduction, the timing of ovulation, and aging. It is sometimes promoted to prevent Alzheimer disease and is often sold as an anti-aging hormone.      Proponents also claim that melatonin is a powerful anti-oxidant, a compound that blocks the action of free radicals, activated oxygen molecules that can damage cells. Because of melatonin's suspected antioxidant properties, some believe it may suppress the growth of some types of cancer cells, especially when combined with certain anti-cancer drugs. Some supporters suggest that melatonin may also stimulate a type of white blood cell called natural killer cells, which attack tumors.      Others suggest that melatonin levels and daily body cycles are abnormal in some people with cancer and that melatonin supplements may help them sleep at night. There are also claims that melatonin may decrease the toxic effects of radiation therapy and chemotherapy.      What does it involve?      Melatonin is sold as a supplement and is available in drugstores, health food stores, and over the Internet. There are no widely accepted recommendations for dosage or duration of use. Melatonin can also be found in many foods, such as milk, peanuts, almonds, turkey, and chicken, but in such small amounts that one would have to eat very large volumes to obtain a measurable dose.      What is the history behind it?      The existence of the pineal gland has been known for thousands of years, although its function remained a mystery until the late 20th century. In the 1600s, the French philosopher René Descartes called the pineal gland \\"the seat of the soul,\\" because many people believed emotions originated there.      Researchers at Yale University first discovered melatonin and its connection to the pineal gland in the late 1950s. Its link to sleep and hormonal influences and its possible link to cancer have been studied since that time. Melatonin became available as a dietary supplement in the 1990s.      What is the evidence?      Some recent research has suggested that low melatonin levels in the body may be linked to a higher risk of certain types of cancer. For example, a few studies have found that women who work night shifts for many years (and therefore would be expected to have lower levels of melatonin) seem to have a slightly higher risk of breast and colorectal cancer. Even if this research is confirmed, however, it does not necessarily mean that melatonin supplements can lower cancer risk.      Melatonin has been shown to slow or stop the growth of several types of cancer cells when studied in the laboratory. Whether this same effect occurs in the body is unknown.      Several studies have looked at the use of melatonin to treat cancer. Melatonin has been used alone and combined with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy (such as tamoxifen), or immunotherapy (such as interleukin-2) in a number of studies involving different types of cancer. Some of the studies have suggested that melatonin may extend survival and improve quality of life for patients with certain types of untreatable cancers such as advanced lung cancer and melanoma. Some studies reported that a small number of cancers went into total or partial remission, while other studies indicated that melatonin caused little or no response in tumors.      In a 2005 clinical trial looking at cancer-related weight loss (cachexia), melatonin was compared to fish oil in a small group of patients with advanced intestinal cancer. Although neither group gained weight on these substances, three of the eleven patients in the melatonin group did not lose more weight over the 4 week trial period. However, this study was limited by its small size and short period of follow up, and other factors may have accounted for the more stable weight in these patients.      Most of the studies reporting positive results from melatonin were small and conducted by the same group of Italian researchers. Before the results are widely accepted, they will need to be confirmed in larger studies at other centers.      Some early studies have reported that melatonin may improve appetite, blood platelet counts, and mouth sores in people undergoing chemotherapy. But a study of melatonin's ability to ease the effects of chemotherapy on the blood counts of lung cancer patients found that high doses of the hormone had little effect. More research is needed to clarify these results.      There is relatively good evidence that melatonin supplements can influence sleep and fatigue and can help with jet lag and some sleep problems. Research has not yet shown the most effective way to use melatonin supplements for patients with sleep disorders or for people who have trouble sleeping occasionally. Some research shows that melatonin affects not only how quickly people fall asleep but also the duration and quality of sleep.      Are there any possible problems or complications?      There appear to be few short-term side effects from taking melatonin. Some people report headaches or feeling drowsy or confused after taking it. People taking high doses have reported nightmares and trouble sleeping.      The effects of long-term use of melatonin and how it interacts with other medicines or supplements are unknown. Some reports have indicated that melatonin may interact with blood-thinning medicines and with medications for seizures or diabetes. People taking these medicines should speak with their doctors before taking melatonin.      Since melatonin may have an effect on hormone levels, women who are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are breast-feeding should not use this supplement. The National Institute on Aging has also warned that melatonin may constrict blood vessels, which could be dangerous for people with high blood pressure or heart disease. Some practitioners believe that children and people under the age of 40 should not take melatonin because their bodies make enough of the hormone naturally. Some also caution people with severe mental illness and those taking steroid medications against using melatonin.      Because it has antioxidant properties, concerns have been raised that melatonin might interfere with radiation therapy or chemotherapy, possibly making these treatments less effective. While this concern is based largely on theories of how cancer treatments work, it is supported by some recent studies. For this reason, people being treated for cancer should speak with their doctors before taking this supplement.      Some experts also suggest that people with immune system disorders (such as severe allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, or cancers such as lymphoma) should not take melatonin because it may further stimulate the immune system and worsen these conditions. Again, this is based on a theory and not scientific evidence, but people with immune system problems should speak with their doctors before taking this supplement.      Relying on this type of treatment alone, and avoiding or delaying conventional medical care for cancer, may have serious health consequences.

Trouble is, chronic exposure to light at night leads to a host of health problems.      To understand why chronic exposure to light at night is so bad, we need to consider human evolution. Prior to the end of the stone age, humans were exposed to two different kinds of natural light responsible for regulating circadian rhythmicity. During the day we had the sun, while at night we had the moon and the stars, and perhaps the light from campfires. The binary day/night pattern was unrelenting, and our biological programming followed suit.      Today, we have artificial lighting at night (LAN), and it's a different case altogether. Indoor lighting is considerably less powerful than sunlight, but many orders of magnitude greater than star and moonlight. Check out this chart to see what I mean:      Advertisement      Keep in mind that this is a logarithmic scale, so the difference between sunlight and moonlight is considerable — a difference that influences a series of critical biochemical cascades tied to light periodicity, including the production of cortisol and melatonin levels.      Light is a Drug      Melatonin suppression is key to understanding much of why LAN is so crappy for us. This workhorse biochemical is produced by the brain's pineal gland at night — when it's dark — to regulate our sleep-wake cycle. It lowers blood pressure, glucose levels, and body temperature — key physiological responses responsible for restful sleep. As neurologist George Brainard puts it, \\"Light works as if it's a drug, except it's not a drug at all.\\"      Sponsored      The part of your brain that controls your biological clock is the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN), a group of cells in the hypothalamus. These cells respond to light and dark signals. The optic nerves in our eyes senses light and transmits a signal to the SCN telling the brain that it's time to wake up. It also kickstarts other processes, like raising body temperature and producing hormones like cortisol. Our cortisol levels are relatively low at night, allowing us to sleep, and higher during the day, allowing for the stabilization of energy levels and the modulation of immune function.      But LAN unnaturally elevates cortisol levels at night, which disrupts sleep and introduces a host of problems relating to body-fat levels, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation. It also contributes to sleep debt and a disruption the neuroregulation of appetite.      But if our rooms are dark at night, there's no optic signal to the SCN, so our bodies pump out the much needed melatonin. Moreover, our melatonin levels are regulated according to the amount of exposure we had to light during the previous day.      Related: The science behind power naps and insomnia.      The Light Before You Sleep      Indeed, studies have shown that exposure to room light before bedtime shortens melatonin duration by about 90 minutes compared to dim light exposure. In addition, exposure to room light during usual hours of sleep suppresses melatonin levels by more than 50%. That's significant.      So, even before you hit the hay, the light in your bedroom is causing you problems. With the introduction of tablets, smartphones, and energy-efficient light bulbs, it's an issue that's only getting worse.      And just to add insult to injury, many modern devices emit blue light from light-emitting diodes (LEDs) — light that's especially good at suppressing melatonin. This is because melanopsin — a photopigment found in specialized cells of the retina involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms — is most sensitive to blue light.      Recently, scientists warned college students about the impact of light from computer monitors on melatonin levels. They found that computer light at night — particularly blue light that was scanned by wearing different wavelength-blocking glasses — reduces college students' melatonin levels. A related study found that backlit tablet displays suppress melatonin, disrupting sleep. But the researchers write: \\"[It] is important to acknowledge that usage of self-luminous electronic devices before sleep may disrupt sleep even if melatonin is not suppressed. Clearly, the tasks themselves may be alerting or stressful stimuli that can lead to sleep disruption.\\" Which is a very good point.      The Cancer Link      Regrettably, all this hormone and biochemical disruption is creating downstream effects — cancer being one of them. Scientists aren't entirely sure why, but studies consistently show a correlation.      For example, a 10-year study found that a sample group of over 1,670 women exposed to higher intensity light in their sleeping environment had 22% higher odds of developing breast cancer than those who slept in total darkness. The researchers blamed it on hormone disruption caused by melatonin suppression.      In another study, researchers implanted nude rats with breast cancer xenografts and then gave them perfusions of blood from different women. Rats receiving blood from women who were exposed to dim light at night had their tumor growth reduced — but those with blood from women who were exposed to bright light at night weren't granted this beneficial effect.      Troublingly, this has grim implications for workers who do shift work. Case-controlled studies have shown that nurses who work rotating shifts at midnight are more at risk for breast cancer compared to nurses with permanent day work.      Low Light, Blue Light, Depression and Immune Response      Disturbingly, the light at night doesn't even have to be bright to cause problems. Chronic exposure to dim light at night leads to depression-like symptom in hamsters, such as exhibiting less interest in drinking the sugar water that they normally love. But by returning them to a normal, non-lit day/night schedule, the researchers were able to reverse the depression. Scientists suspect that this dim-light depression may be the result of a protein called tumor necrosis factor.      Chronic dim light at night also detrimentally affects the immune system.      You might want to think about this next time you leave even the dimmest lights on in your bedroom — including your clock radio and the light that bleeds in from street lights.      Another study, also on rodents, showed that blue light at night in particular is especially powerful at inducing depression-like symptoms. LAN can also impair mood and learning, again likely on account of melanopsin-expressing neurons.      Premature Aging and Heart Problems      Melatonin also has antioxidant properties, which plays an important role in anti-aging. Researchers have been able to treat artificially aged mice with melatonin, thus reducing oxidative stress. These mice models are helping scientists understand the fundamental mechanism behind aging because they're the same markers found in neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.      Other studies show a link between melatonin suppression and cardiovascular disease.      Weight Gain      Light at night also contributes to weight gain by shifting the time of our food intake. Mice, when exposed to LAN, gained more weight — despite exercising and eating as much as their darkness-exposed brethren. Scientists have also correlated low levels of melatonin to diabetes, though it's not clear what role, if any, LAN plays in this matter.      Pitch Black      All this research points to one basic fact: We need to keep our bedrooms as dark as possible and avoid blue light before sleep. To that end, you should turn off all your light-emitting gadgets and close the blinds. And if possible, refrain from reading your tablet computer or smartphone in the hours preceding sleep.

But new research conducted in rats suggests exposure to dim light at night - as little as that coming in a window from a street light - suppresses melatonin production, making tumors resistant to the drug.            Researchers found that exposure to dim light at night results in breast cancer tumors becoming resistant to tamoxifen. Researchers found that exposure to dim light at night results intumors becoming resistant to tamoxifen.      The study, led by Prof. Steven M. Hill of Tulane University School of Medicine in New Orleans, LA, is published in Cancer Research, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.      \\"Our levels of melatonin are not determined by sleep, as many people think,\\" explains Prof. Hill. \\"It is actually the darkness that is important. During the night, if you sleep in a brightly lit room, your melatonin levels may be inhibited; however, if you are in the dark but cannot sleep, your melatonin levels will rise normally.\\"      He and his team note that disruption of circadian rhythms by night shift work or disturbed sleep could result in an increased risk of breast cancer and other diseases. For patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, Prof. Hill adds that tamoxifen resistance \\"is a growing problem.\\"      \\"Our data, although they were generated in rats, have potential implications for the large number of patients with breast cancer who are being treated with tamoxifen, because they suggest that nighttime exposure to light, even dim light, could cause their tumors to become resistant to the drug by suppressing melatonin production,\\" he says.      Nighttime melatonin supplement resulted in regressed tumors      To conduct their study, the researchers observed rats with human breast tumors that were living in either normal light and dark conditions - which involved 12 hours of light and 12 hours of complete darkness - or alternative conditions - 12 hours of normal light and 12 hours of dim light.      Fast facts about tamoxifen's uses To treat breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body      To treat early breast cancer in women who have already been treated with surgery, radiation or chemotherapy      To reduce risk of developing a more serious type of breast cancer in women who have had ductal carcinoma in situ      To reduce risk of breast cancer in women at high risk for the disease.      The rats who were living under normal conditions had blood melatonin levels that rose during the dark period and fell again during the light period. However, the rats living in the alternative conditions had melatonin levels that remained low during the light/dark cycle.      Compared with the rats living in normal conditions, the rats living in the dim night light conditions had tumor growth that was 2.6-fold times faster.      Additionally, the team found that the rats living in the dim night light had tumors that were completely resistant to tamoxifen, while the rats living in normal conditions had tumors that significantly regressed.      However, the team also found that when given a nighttime melatonin supplement, the tumors of the rats living in dim night light conditions likewise regressed.      \\"These data suggest that, in the not-too-distant future, it may be possible to combine melatonin and tamoxifen,\\" says Prof. Hill. \\"However, before this is done we would need to identify the optimal times of day to give the two because if the timing between the two is off, the advantage of giving them in combination may be lost.\\"      He also notes that their study does not reveal how much light exposure is needed to decrease nighttime melatonin production, resulting in tamoxifen resistance in humans, \\"but we think that it could be as little as the amount of light that comes in the bedroom window from a street light.\\"      Though melatonin supplements can be purchased over the counter, Prof. Hill cautions that their research is not yet at the point where he and his team can recommend that breast cancer patients on tamoxifen take melatonin:      \\"Melatonin is produced by our bodies at a very specific time of day, exclusively during darkness at night, and taking melatonin supplements at the wrong time of day would potentially disrupt the circadian system, particularly the natural melatonin cycle, which may, in itself, paradoxically impair breast cancer responsiveness to tamoxifen.\\"      The team is now conducting further studies to investigate how much light exposure suppresses nighttime melatonin production in humans to the point where it would make tumors tamoxifen-resistant.      Medical News Today recently reported on a study that suggested the gel form of tamoxifen is just as effective as the oral form, with fewer side effects. |||||Summary:","output":"A study warns that even low levels of light in bedrooms may stop breast cancer drugs from working. Researchers found that light, equivalent to that from street lamps, could lead to tumors becoming resistant to the drug Tamoxifen, widely used to treat breast cancer. The scientists showed that in dim light, melatonin levels were lower, the tumors were bigger and were resistant to Tamoxifen."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

VALENCIA, Spain -- Defending America's Cup champions Alinghi of Switzerland have revealed they are to start building a multihull yacht for their duel against American challengers Oracle. Alinghi have promised a \\"big beast of a boat\\" when they take on American challengers Oracle. Alinghi's design team coordinator Grant Simmer said: \\"We are looking at building a big beast of a boat and the loads are off the scale compared to most of the boats we've been involved with.\\" \\"Obviously from a naval architecture point of view this is an extremely fast and exciting boat,\\" he told a news conference in the Spanish port of Valencia which hosted the last America's Cup in July 2007. Earlier this month, San Francisco-based Oracle, backed by Silicon Valley maverick Larry Ellison, announced that construction of a multihull yacht for its America's Cup challenge was \\"well underway\\" on the US Pacific coast. While Alinghi, which is backed by biotech tycoon Ernesto Bertarelli, has not yet started to build its boat, the Swiss team have been training on both catamarans and trimarans in Europe. The two sides will be facing off in a duel, or Deed of Gift Match, for the 33rd America's Cup because they failed to reach an agreement on the rules for a traditional regatta involving several teams. The New York Supreme Court, the trustee of the Deed of Gift, the 1887 document which details the complex rules of the America's Cup, is expected to rule shortly on the next date for yachting's showpiece event. Alinghi prefer May 2009 while Oracle want October 2008. The Swiss team argues it cannot build a competitive multihull yacht by October in order to adequately defend their crown for what would be their third straight title. \\"Today we have a way forward,\\" said Alinghi team skipper Brad Butterworth. \\"Ernesto has committed to building this multi-hull and as long as we can get the pending issues resolved by the New York courts, including a race date in 2009, we'll be sailing in a huge multi-hull against Oracle,\\" he added. Butterworth said Alinghi had retained most of the sailors that it had during the last America's Cup \\"with a slight downsize\\" and had recruited people with experience in a multi-hull challenge. Alinghi retained the America's Cup by beating Team New Zealand in a hugely successful event in Valencia in July 2007. The 33rd America's Cup had originally been scheduled to be held in Valencia in July 2009 as a traditional regatta involving several teams. But organisers indefinately postponed the event in November because of the legal wrangling betwen Oracle and Alinghi over the rules of the event. E-mail to a friend. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"In Valencia, Spain, the Swiss team called Alinghi, who are the champions of the America's Cup, have said they will start building a very big boat called a multihull yacht.

Conventional or commercial poultry farming: Large-scale, industrialized production units where birds are raised in controlled environments with standard diets, vaccination programs, and other inputs to optimize production efficiency. 2. Traditional or backyard poultry farming: Small-scale, family-operated farms where birds are raised more naturally, often with limited access to commercial inputs and under less controlled conditions. Step 4: Provide the answer In conclusion, there are primarily two industry models followed for the production process of poultry: conventional (commercial) poultry farming and traditional (backyard) poultry farming.

Over-preparing: Bailey might have wanted to create the best possible speech, causing her to become overly preoccupied with its content, structure, and delivery. Her insistence on perfection might have caused her to lose track of time, inadvertently encroaching on Addison's time. 3. Nervousness or anxiety: Bailey might have been feeling particularly anxious or nervous about delivering the speech, leading her to spend excessive time practicing or obsessing over minor details.

Compare the absolute values to find the element with the highest absolute value:    - 53.284    - 33.801    - 64.991    - 85.037 (highest absolute value) 5. Return the value of the element that had the highest absolute value before applying the absolute value:    - In this case, before applying the absolute value, the element was -85.037. Output: -85.037"},{"instruction":"Much like the Grand Old Duke of York, who had ten thousand men and marched them up to the top of the hill, and then marched them down again, I can’t get enough of York… (because he visited repeatedly, that was obvious, right?) Having visited nearly half a dozen times over the years, and somehow not managing to share it on my blog over the years, I would say that although you could visit from London for the day, I wouldn’t. Go for a minimum of an overnight stay, or a few days if you can. Witness a misty morning, and a candy coloured sunset, wander out into the Dales or slip in a seaside visit somewhere like Scarborough, and really get to know the ancient city. Alas, I haven’t really learned how to take my own advice, but hot on the end of a family visit in Lincolnshire we were lucky enough to spend sometime with one of my favourite expats on Yorkshire (ok, ok, I only know two, but they are definitely in the top two of that limited ranking system). It was of course Amanda, her fabulous husband Sam and we got to meet their gorgeous new addition to the family, a mischevious Dachshund pup who goes by the name of Harold. Instagram was alive with “OOOOOOOH MY GOD YOU GOT TO MEET HAROLLLLLD” Forget being a rockstar in this day and age, puppy dog eyes are all you need to make ladies weep and then squeal into their keyboards. We tumbled off the train, cheeks ruddy from the fresh the North Sea breezes (fresh from visiting the Seal colony with a litany of pups at Donna Nook, and nibbling fish and chips with the family in Cleethorpes) and went wandering. I’m going to make a big claim here – if you’re travelling through the UK and can only fit in one city visit outside of London, York or perhaps Bath would be excellent choices. Compact enough to really explore, full of ancient buildings and history, and good cake. What more do you even need? When did the writer meet Harold? - not enough information - after they exited the train - while they went wandering - during time spent with expats Answer:","output":"after they exited the train"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lewis Robert \\"Hack\\" Wilson (April 26, 1900 - November 23, 1948) was an American Major League Baseball player who played 12 seasons for the New York Giants, Chicago Cubs, Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. Despite his diminutive stature, he was one of the most accomplished power hitters in the game during the late 1920s and early 1930s. His 1930 season with the Cubs is widely considered one of the most memorable individual single-season hitting performances in baseball history. Highlights included 56 home runs, the National League record for 68 years; and 191 runs batted in, a mark yet to be surpassed. \\" Lewis Robert Wilson was born April 26, 1900, in the Pennsylvania steel mill town of Ellwood City, north of Pittsburgh. His mother, Jennie Kaughn, 16, was an unemployed drifter from Philadelphia; his father, Robert Wilson, 24, was a steel worker. His parents never married; both were heavy drinkers, and in 1907 his mother died of appendicitis at the age of 24.  In 1916 Lewis left school to take a job at a locomotive factory, swinging a sledge hammer for four dollars a week. Although only five feet six inches tall, he weighed 195 pounds with an 18-inch neck, and feet that fit into size-five-and-one-half shoes. Sportswriter Shirley Povich later observed that he was \\"built along the lines of a beer keg, and was not wholly unfamiliar with its contents.\\" While his unusual physique was considered an oddity at the time, his large head, tiny feet, short legs and broad, flat face are now recognized as hallmarks of the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.  In 1921 Wilson moved to Martinsburg, West Virginia, to join the Martinsburg Mountaineers of the Class \\"D\\" Blue Ridge League. After breaking his leg while sliding into home plate during his first professional game, he was moved from the catcher's position to the outfield. In 1922 he met Virginia Riddleburger, a 34-year-old office clerk; they married the following year. In 1923, playing for the \\"B\\" division Portsmouth Truckers, he led the Virginia League in hitting with a .388 batting average. Late in the season, New York Giants manager John McGraw purchased his contract from Portsmouth for 10,500.

With no official figures available, it is estimated that 600,000-900,000 persons fled the country during the Lebanese Civil War . Although some have since returned, this permanently disturbed Lebanese population growth and greatly complicated demographic statistics. Another result of the war was a large number of internally displaced persons. This especially affected the southern Shia community, as Israeli invasion of southern Lebanon in 1978, 1982 and 1996 prompted waves of mass emigration, in addition to the continual strain of occupation and fighting between Israel and Hezbollah . Many Shias from Southern Lebanon resettled in the suburbs south of Beirut. After the war, the pace of Christian emigration accelerated, as many Christians felt discriminated against in a Lebanon under increasingly oppressive Syrian occupation.

Article: My son Jack, a fourth grader, was having a hard time in getting interested in story books recently, so I offered to read the first few chapters to him. In the early pages of 'Incident at Halk Hill', a quiet little boy has a special meeting with a female badger  .Soon after, another badger is caught in a steel leg trap , and the author describes in detail the pain and scare of an animal struggling to its death. We meet the cruel hunter and his ill treatment of a dog; we see the badger being skinned by the boy's father;and we experience the child's confusion when beaten by his father in anger. _ , I thought. Last night , I returned from a weekend away to find that Jack had finished the whole book on his own. \\"It was really, really good and sad, and violent,\\" he reported. \\"There was a lot of killing.\\" \\"Were there any happy parts?\\" I asked, \\"The boy's life was saved by the badger, and that was good. But then that badger got caught in a trap again and at the end it's dying, too. \\" Jack said, \\"It was so sad that I almost cried. \\" I told him that many books have made me cry, beginning with Heidi, when I was just his age, right on up to the novel I finished last week. \\"Well,\\" he admitted then, \\"I actually did cry. Reading that book just reminded me of all the sadness in the world, and it made me feel sad ,too. \\" So, I think, now he has been through the sad tone of the passage , the discovery that words on a printed page can give rise to such strong emotion ,that a book can move you right out of your own comfortable little self and into someone else's pain. Thus we come to realize that if we are to remain fully engaged in life, open to its mysteries and feel sorry towards its suffering, we indeed need stories to grab  us by the neck and remind us of the sadness in the world that is not our own.

How a small yet mighty bit of paper can still get you a job This simple transaction still has the potential to be painfully embarrassing if you get it wrong. But Walter Faulstroh, co-founder of HUM Nutrition, says he has finally managed to fine-tune the art of the business card exchange after many years living in Paris, London and now Los Angeles. This has meant tailoring his approach carefully to where he is and who he’s meeting. If you pull out a business card, they look at you like you’re from a different [era] In Europe, he says, the card is often still formally presented — as it always has been — upon introduction, then carefully tucked away. But on the US West Coast, things are different. As part of the startup crowd, Faulstroh typically waits for his counterpart to do a formal introduction, but if there isn’t one he skips handing over his card. “It’s become quite complex,” he says. It’s so extreme that at some tech conferences, “if you pull out a business card, they look at you like you’re from a different [era].” Instead, he quickly follows up with new contacts via LinkedIn or another social media platform to cement the connection. The business card exchange itself is a ritual So if we’ve all become such ‘digital natives’, why is it still relevant to hand over a piece of card? More than just an exchange of details, business cards help with that crucial positive first impression, act as an ice breaker, grab someone’s attention and even boost your credibility, say experts. Doing business in parts of Asia, Latin America and even Southern Europe often still means adopting a traditional approach. “The business card exchange itself is a ritual,” even if can seem redundant in the age of social media, says Sebastian Reiche, an assistant professor at IESE Business School in Barcelona. “We are still printing business cards, but you really don’t need them.” In mainland China, American Michael Michelini, a Shenzhen-based marketer, learned to hand over his card with both hands with the words facing towards the other person. He also makes sure to glance at any cards he receives and to put them anywhere but his back pocket, which is a big no-no. He’s now careful to glance at the details (it signifies respect) after a business card is handed to him. Even after 10 years in China, “I’m still not as good at paying attention,” he says. “It distracts me usually.” The entire ritual is meant to honour the person giving the card and is practiced in some form or another throughout most of Asia. In countries where traditional hierarchical rules apply, the card serves as a reminder of status In countries where traditional business rules apply, the card still serves as a reminder of status, says IESE’s Reiche. “In a culture where hierarchy is important, the person wants to [see the card] to prepare how to interact with you and how to address you,” he says. Nicole Dyer Griffith, an international protocol consultant, in Trinidad, advises clients overseas to follow the lead of the most senior person in the group. For example, some cultures may save the business card exchange until the end of the meeting, elsewhere introductions are made with a business card in hand. Amazing as it may sound to people doing business in the US or UK, disregarding this practice can potentially sour an entire business exchange, she adds. “It’s important to try to [follow etiquette] as best as possible.” Even taste in design varies significantly worldwide, according to Chad Jennings, chief product officer at Moo, a UK-based printer and designer of business cards. Unlike in the UK and across Europe, thinner — not thicker — paper stock is a mark of luxury in Japan and China, he says. In China, cards tend to be filled with text, while Swiss and German cards are more sparse, pointing out only the most essential details without bragging about career achievements. In the UK, gold foil text is the most popular because it provides a more luxurious look, he adds. So the business card’s not dead yet. In fact it’s getting a makeover. Last year, Moo launched its NFC-enabled business cards, which stands for near-field communication. These cards use so-called smart paper to store data to be scanned by a smartphone or another electronic device. While it’s still just a tiny fraction of Moo’s sales, Jennings says the idea is slowly starting to take hold. “People are using it in really unique ways,” he says. “Some associate [the business card] with a Spotify playlist.” People are using it in really unique ways In March, the company also launched Monogram by Moo, an app that serves as a digital business card of sorts that allows users to share their portfolio on their smartphone or send it along electronically, which can be shown “to tell their story” in addition to a traditional card. “You can pull it up and hand it over to the person,” he says. Michelini says that his business cards now include a WeChat QR code on the back to allow for another user of the China-based social media platform to scan it straight away and connect online. Often, in lieu of business cards, he simply generates a QR code via smartphone, which is then scanned by a business associate, he adds. The practice — popular with his Chinese associates — is preferable to a more traditional card, because it automatically ensures an online connection, he adds. But “not everyone is on the same level technologically,” says Dyer Griffith. For most industries, the business card exchange can feel as necessary as a handshake. “It still adds that personal touch,” she says.

Movie plot title: Contraband Movie plot: Luca Di Angelo (Fabio Testi) is a smuggler, one member of an organized team trafficking cigarettes and booze up and down the coast off Naples, Italy. After a run-in with the police in which the smugglers manage to get away by faking a boat explosion resulting in the police motorboats responding to the false emergency allowing the smugglers to get away, Luca and his brother Mickey suspect Scherino (Ferdinand Murolo), the head of a rival gang of smugglers, of passing on their actives. Lucia and Mickey take their accusations to their boss Perlante (Saverio Marconi) a sleazy playboy withy numerous Mafia connections, who agrees to look into it. After a nighttime fire at Mickey's racing stables kills a valued racehorse, he and Luca drive over to inspect the damage. But on the way, they are stopped at a fake police roadblock where the assasins dressed as policemen trick Mickey into getting out of the car and machine-gun him to death over and over again (think Sonny Corlone's death scene in 'The Godfather'), while Luca barely escapes injury by hiding on the floor of the car.Afterwards, Perlante suggests that Luca leave town for a few days, but he refuses. After his brother's funeral, conducted on the gang's speedboats in the Bay of Naples, with the police surveying them, Luca vows revenge. Despite his wife Adele's (Ivana Monti) pleas, Luca goes after the prime suspect: Scherino.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if forest rangers are more diligent at watching for fires, they would likely be able to prevent or quickly control wildfires. This would affect the greenhouse effect in an indirect way. When wildfires occur, they release large quantities of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) into the atmosphere, which contributes to the greenhouse effect. In addition, burning forests also reduce the number of trees available to absorb and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through the process of photosynthesis. Thus, by preventing or controlling wildfires more effectively, forest rangers would help to limit the release of carbon dioxide from wildfires and maintain the number of trees that can store carbon dioxide, ultimately reducing the greenhouse effect to a certain extent. However, it is important to note that this perturbation would have a relatively small impact on the overall greenhouse effect, as human activities like burning fossil fuels contribute significantly more to the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The list contains both alphabetical and numerical elements. Your goal is to rearrange the list so that all the alphabetical elements come first, and all the numerical elements come after. Here are the steps to follow: 1. Understand the input list: The input is a list containing several items. In the given example, the list is:    ['3331', 'F', 'q', '6135', '9143', '7897', 'c', '8947', '5899', 'J', 'E', '6137',     'S', '9207', 'R', '2255', '5633', '575', '817', '8747', '2825', '2071', 'e',     '5491', 'S', 'N', '9265'] 2. Separate the alphabetical and numerical elements: Go through the list and separate the elements into two new lists - one for the alphabetical elements and another for the numerical elements.    Alphabetical list:    ['F', 'q', 'c', 'J', 'E', 'S', 'R', 'e', 'S', 'N']    Numerical list:    ['3331', '6135', '9143', '7897', '8947', '5899', '6137', '9207', '2255', '5633',     '575', '817', '8747', '2825', '2071', '5491', '9265'] 3. Maintain the order: Make sure the order of the elements in each individual list (alphabetical and numerical) remains the same as in the original input list. 4. Reorganize the list: Once you have the two separate lists, combine them into a new list by placing the alphabetical elements first, followed by the numerical elements.    The rearranged list will be:    ['F', 'q', 'c', 'J', 'E', 'S', 'R', 'e', 'S', 'N', '3331', '6135', '9143', '7897',     '8947', '5899', '6137', '9207', '2255', '5633', '575', '817', '8747', '2825',     '2071', '5491', '9265'] 5.

Joel chased Kenneth around the room while holding a spider and laughing because  Available options: * Joel is a jerk.; * Kenneth is a jerk.;","output":"Joel chased Kenneth around the room while holding a spider and laughing because he seemed to enjoy Kenneth's fear of spiders. Joel found amusement in Kenneth's panic as he darted around, trying to avoid the eight-legged creature. For years, Joel always tried to find creative ways to get under Kenneth's skin, and this time, the tiny spider was his winning instrument. Joel is a jerk. Although Joel might consider his actions to be playful or funny, it's clear that, in this situation, Joel is a jerk. It's worth noting that everyone has different thresholds for what they consider to be amusing or offensive, but there's one matter that almost everybody agrees on: it's mean-spirited to exploit someone's fear for amusement. Joel's behavior demonstrates a lack of empathy toward Kenneth's phobia and highlights his inclination to derive pleasure from someone else's distress. Furthermore, he disregards Kenneth's feelings in favor of his enjoyment, which underscores his selfish nature. Now, let's consider the following alternative scenario: Kenneth is a jerk. Suppose Kenneth has a history of being inconsiderate and rude towards Joel. Perhaps he frequently mocked Joel for his interests or constantly belittled his accomplishments. In this case, one could argue that Joel's actions were merely a form of payback for the mistreatment he had endured at the hands of Kenneth. Despite Kenneth's behavior, using a genuine phobia to take revenge still classifies Joel as a jerk. Two wrongs don't make a right, and resorting to similar behavior to retaliate is immature and unproductive. An effective resolution would require direct confrontation to discuss their differences and find common ground. It's crucial to reflect on how one's actions impact others, even if taken in jest. In both scenarios mentioned above, Joel's actions would be perceived as cruel, regardless of Kenneth's demeanor. Respect, empathy, and open communication should be the foundation of any relationship, either friendly or otherwise. In conclusion, the situation shows that Joel is a jerk for using Kenneth's fear of spiders as a tool to provoke him. Such behavior only serves to intensify any existing animosity between them. Ultimately, it's important to treat others with kindness and respect and strive for open communication to ensure a healthy, positive relationship with those around us."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? a smart movie","output":"Determining the sentiment of a sentence containing the phrase \\"a smart movie\\" requires context and a deeper understanding of the words used as well as the intent behind them. However, with the available information, we can infer the sentiment through the analysis of the words and their general connotations. Based on the terms used, the sentiment in the sentence can be interpreted as positive. Here is a breakdown of the words and their general connotations: 1. \\"Smart\\" generally refers to something that showcases intelligence, cleverness, or astuteness. In this case, it's being used to describe a movie, which implies the movie presents unique ideas or thought-provoking content. This can lead to positive emotions like admiration, appreciation, or enjoyment. 2. \\"Movie\\" is a neutral term that simply designates the medium, in this case, a film. The overall sentiment is determined by the accompanying adjective or describing word, which, in this sentence, is \\"smart.\\" It is important to acknowledge that context is crucial in gauging the true sentiment behind this statement. The surrounding words and the intent of the speaker can alter the connotation. For example, if the sentence were part of a more extensive statement like, \\"I expected a smart movie, but it was a waste of time,\\" the sentiment would shift negatively. But, considering only the given sentence, \\"a smart movie\\" seems to convey a positive sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment. If a river floods often, a floodplain develops. A floodplain is an area where a thick layer of rich soil is left behind as the floodwater recedes. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land.

Article: Once upon a time if we wanted to make a phone call or wait for someone to contact us, we had to sit at home or at our desks. There were public phones in the street of course, _ . And of course you had to bring a lot of coins to pay for the calls. So people didn't phone their friends as often. Mobile phones, these small pieces of electronic equipment which allow us to talk with friends and family while we are on the move, have greatly changed the way we live. Before the age of the mobile phone, our loved ones would sit around worried sick if we were late coming home. There were no quick calls to tell mum that there would be additional guests coming for dinner. We would have to depend on notes left on fridges or desks to communicate messages. But mobile phones have also had a negative effect and what people don't seem to realize is that we've lost something very valuable: our privacy. Now our friends and family can contact us wherever and whenever they want to. We can never get away from them. The way people communicate with each other is totally different now. It's difficult to have a conversation face-to-face with a friend without being disturbed every couple of minutes by the ring of their phones, ,most people don't see anything wrong in having a long conversation on their mobile phone while forgetting all about the person sitting opposite. It seems the art of real conversation may be dying. Of course, people could leave their mobile phones at home or even switch them off but no one ever does that. Why not? Because the worrying thing is we can't live without our phones. We've become communication addicts, unable to spend even a few minutes out of contact, in case we miss something  'important'. Question: What's the writer's point about using telephones before the invention of mobile phones? Answer: OPTIONS:  * Using a telephone was expensive..  * Phone calls were much shorter..  * People made fewer phone calls..  * People relied on notes a lot.. The answer is:","output":"People made fewer phone calls.  The writer's point about using telephones before the invention of mobile phones is that people made fewer phone calls due to the limitations and inconveniences of landlines and public phones. The article states that, back then, one had to stay at home or at their desks to make or receive a call, or use public phones on the streets, which required carrying a lot of coins to pay for the calls. As a result, people didn't phone their friends as often as they do now with mobile phones. Additionally, the reliance on notes left on fridges or desks for communication further supports the point that people made fewer phone calls in those times."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I'm going to take something that happened to my daughter for this answer. Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before. My wife assisted in the search and soon found a partially chewed up piece of our daughter's homework page. Our daughter was devastated! How could she possibly walk in to school and publicly announce, “My dog ate my homework!” without becoming the laughing stock of the school? Like this: Mama Bear (my wife) storms into the classroom and vehemently upholds our daughter's “dog ate my homework” bit, showing the teacher the half eaten paper. Funny thing was, the teacher would have never doubted our little girl for one minute. Back then, Billie Jo was the sweetest, cutest, most polite and well mannered child a parent could possibly hope for. And her teachers loved her. So, if you have partial proof, it can be a valid excuse. How old was Billie Jo when the dog ate her homework - at least 14 - not enough information - around ten years old - at least 11 The answer to this question is:","output":"Billie Jo was around ten years old when the incident of her dog eating her homework occurred. This event led to a significant amount of distress for the young girl, as she was worried about being ridiculed by her classmates and potentially disappointing her teachers. However, the situation was salvaged by her mother's intervention, who took it upon herself to visit the classroom and present the half-eaten paper as evidence in support of Billie Jo's claim. This unexpected incident highlights the importance of being prepared for unforeseen situations and demonstrates how supportive family members can help resolve potentially embarrassing predicaments. In this particular case, Billie Jo's mother's actions not only saved her from potential embarrassment but also reinforced the trust between the child and her teachers, who had always held her in high regard. The story of Billie Jo's dog eating her homework serves as a reminder that even the most diligent and responsible students can face unforeseeable challenges. It is essential for teachers and parents to recognize and understand that students may experience setbacks and need support and understanding in these situations. In conclusion, Billie Jo was around ten years old when her dog ate her homework, causing worry and concern about her academic standing and her reputation among her peers. Fortunately, her mother's swift intervention and presentation of evidence to the teacher averted any adverse consequences for Billie Jo, allowing her to continue thriving academically and maintaining her standing as a well-regarded, diligent, and responsible student."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Without a legal will, the division of his estate would be decided in court.  The 2002 will surfaced Monday after a Los Angeles judge gave the singer's mother, Katherine Jackson, temporary control of her son's \\"tangible personal property.\\"  The pop icon's three children -- ages 7, 11 and 12 -- were also placed under the temporary guardianship of Katherine Jackson.  McMillan said he has seen the will but would not disclose its details.  \\"There is a process called 'probating the will' that will validate any will in due course,\\" he said.  Probate is the legal process to prove whether a will is authentic and valid. The process is used to pass on items in the will from the deceased to the beneficiaries.

During a stop in a small town square with her tour group, Lisa grows to admire a fresco of the devil carrying a dead man's body which her tour guide describes as the devil carrying away lost souls back to Hell. As her group disperses, Lisa hears a beautiful piece of music. She leaves her companions and traces its source to an elaborate music box in a little antique shop just outside the main square. While inside the shop, she encounters a strange man (Telly Savalas) purchasing parts of a life-size mannequin. After making eye contact, Lisa is startled when the man bears an uncanny resemblance to the devil depicted in the painting. The man's peculiar behaviour distresses Lisa, so she flees from the shop to rejoin her friends.However, she becomes hopelessly lost in the maze of backstreets of the town. Though she has only walked a short distance beforehand, the back streets and alleyways seem totally alien to her. The locals refuse to give her directions, as side streets lead to dead ends. Lisa runs into the mysterious man a second time, though this time he is carrying a full-length, life-sized mannequin eerily similar to the painting depicted in the main square, as well as carrying the music box still playing the haunting tune. Introducing himself as Leandro, he gives Lisa some vague directions back to the main square, then walks around a corner and disappears. But the direction that Leandro points to the main square leads only to more unfamiliar streets. Next, Lisa encounters a strange man who looks a lot like the mannequin that Leandro was carrying. These bizarre coincidences begin to terrify Lisa, and the stranger acts as though she is his long-lost lover.

The body of Christine Solik, 57, was found 50 miles (80km) from her home in the Kwazulu-Natal province three days before that of her husband, Roger, 66. Police initially began a kidnap and robbery investigation after a neighbour found bloodstains in their home. The couple from the Cynon Valley emigrated after their marriage in 1980. Mrs Solik's mother, Sheila Savage, 83, from Abercynon, Rhondda Cynon Taff, said the family were \\"devastated\\". A passer-by spotted the body of Mrs Solik in a river on Friday 17 February, and a search and dive unit discovered Mr Solik's body last Monday. Police said Mrs Solik had suffered a head injury, and both of the couple's hands had been bound. Several teams of officers, including a canine unit, are investigating the murders. KwaZulu-Natal acting provincial commissioner Maj Gen Bheki Langa said officers would \\"not rest until the killers are brought to book\\". The Times' Africa correspondent Aislinn Laing said people in South Africa were \\"horrified\\" by the deaths despite the country's high crime rate. \\"In a small community like this it has caused a huge amount of alarm,\\" she told BBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Wales programme. The couple lived on a farm estate in the town of Nottingham Road, about 100 miles (160km) in land from Durban.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what can cause golf clubs to repel each other?\\" is \\"friction\\", given that  magnetism can cause golf clubs to repel each other? Pick from: A. Yes. B. No. Answer:","output":"B. No. Friction cannot be considered the right answer to the question \\"what can cause golf clubs to repel each other?\\" given that magnetism can cause golf clubs to repel each other. Friction is the force that opposes the movement of one surface across another, whereas magnetism is the force that establishes an interaction between objects that possess a magnetic charge.  Magnetism can indeed cause golf clubs to repel each other in certain instances. Golf clubs themselves are typically not magnetic, but they can become magnetized if they come into contact with powerful magnets or undergo a strong magnetic field exposure. Additionally, if a golf club has any ferromagnetic materials such as iron or steel, it can potentially become magnetized. Once magnetized, the clubs can experience a repelling force if the poles (north and south) of their magnetic fields are aligned in opposing directions. This repelling force is due to magnetic repulsion, which dictates that like poles repel each other. Although friction is an essential factor in golf, impacting how the club moves and interacts with the ball and turf, it does not play a role in causing golf clubs to repel each other.

I am a sucker for Schnitzel and the Pork Jagar Schnitzel is my favorite (pork pounded then breaded & cooked topped with brown mushroom gravy when served.) Seriously AMAZING, my description does not even come close to explaining the wonderful flavor explosion that this dish is! The portions for dinner are large, plus with your dish you also get to choose 4 side dishes total. I like the Creamy dill potatoes, Potato salad, Homemade coleslaw and Pickled beets. For the Canadians out there they serve Quebec Poutine (I recommend the large for the table to share as an appetizer.) They also have hand made Pierogies (yum!) All in all i have not been disappointed in anything i have ordered here. I love the new location (much larger and nicely decorated.)

Possible A: suface of moon, building, bridge, ground, bright light  Why is \\"ground\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Ground\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because shadows typically form on solid surfaces where light is obstructed by an object. In everyday human experiences, the most common surface where shadows appear is the ground. This is due to the light sources we encounter daily, such as sunlight or artificial light from lamps or streetlights, which generally come from above. In these situations, when light shines on an object such as a person, tree, or vehicle, the side of the object that is not facing the light source remains in darkness, creating a shadow on the surface behind the object. Since the ground is underneath most objects, it is the usual surface that receives these shadows. While it's true that shadows can form on other surfaces like the moon's surface, buildings, and bridges, the ground is the most frequently encountered surface for shadows in our daily lives. This makes it the answer that best aligns with human common sense."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Doris May Lessing CH (née Tayler; 22 October 1919  17 November 2013) was a British novelist, poet, playwright, librettist, biographer and short story writer.

The given equation can be simplified as follows: Step 1: Combine the like terms The like terms here are -v and -7*v. -v - 7*v = -1*v - 7*v = (-1 - 7)*v = -8*v Now, our simplified equation becomes: -8*v + 56 = 0 Step 2: Solve for v We want to get v by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we will first move the constant term, which is 56, to the other side of the equation. -8*v + 56 = 0 -8*v = -56 (Subtract 56 from both sides) Now, we need to get v by itself. Since v is being multiplied by -8, we will divide both sides of the equation by -8 to isolate v: -8*v / -8 = -56 / -8 v = 7 So the solution to the given equation -v - 7*v + 56 = 0 is v = 7."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Where might he live?  Here are possible answers to this question: - house - apartment - village - beach condo - hotel  I believe the correct choice is \\"apartment\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"James likely lives in an apartment, and there are several reasons for this choice.  First, let's consider the nature of the hide bed sofa itself. A hide bed sofa, also known as a sofa bed or a sleeper sofa, is a piece of furniture that is designed to serve a dual purpose. It can be used either as a sofa for sitting, or it can be easily transformed into a bed for sleeping by pulling out the hidden mattress underneath. The primary advantage of a hide bed sofa is the efficient use of space that it provides. Now, let's analyze the living situations for each of the given options: 1. House: Typically, a house has more space than an apartment, which means that residents living in a house generally have more rooms and can therefore allot separate spaces for sitting and sleeping. In this situation, there would be less need for a piece of furniture like a hide bed sofa that combines the two functions. 2. Village: Living in a village does not provide any specific information about the kind of dwelling James is living in. He could be living in a house or an apartment within the village. Thus, we cannot make a clear decision based on this option. 3. Beach Condo: A beach condo is similar to an apartment in terms of space limitations. However, a beach condo is generally a vacation property and not a primary residence. While it's possible that James might have chosen a hide bed sofa for his beach condo, the scenario seems less likely in comparison to him having a hide bed sofa in his primary residence, where regular space efficiency is a concern. 4. Hotel: In most cases, people do not buy furniture for a hotel room, as it is a temporary place to stay, and the hotel already provides the necessary furniture. It would be rare for someone to purchase a hide bed sofa for a hotel room. Taking all these factors into account, the most likely reason James bought a hide bed sofa is because he lives in an apartment. Living in an apartment often means having limited space, which leads individuals to seek out furniture items that can serve multiple purposes and conserve space. A hide bed sofa is an excellent choice for this objective, as it allows James to have both a sitting area and a sleeping area in the same space, without the need for separate furniture items. This space-saving solution is a clear indication that James most likely resides in an apartment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How is rain measured? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","output":"The questions \\"How do you measure rain?\\" and \\"How is rain measured?\\" are semantically the same. Both are asking about the method or procedure for measuring the amount of rainfall. The only difference is the way they are phrased - the first is direct, as if asking someone specific (in this case, an artificial intelligence), while the second is indirect and impersonal. Now, let's breakdown the steps to answer these questions. \\"Measuring rain\\" implies we are quantifying the amount of rainfall. Here is a step-by-step process to measure the rain: 1. **Rain Gauge Installation and Collection:** The instrument used to measure rain is a rain gauge. It is typically a straight cylindrical container, marked on the side for measurement. The rain gauge should be placed in an open area where no buildings or trees can obstruct the rainfall. It must be stable enough not to be knocked over or affected by wind. The rainwater collected in the gauge directly represents the amount of rainfall. 2. **Measurement:** Following a period of rainfall, the water level in the gauge is checked. Based on the marked increments on the side of the rain gauge, one can measure the height of the water. It's important to level your eyes with the water surface to avoid reading errors due to the angle of view (known as parallax error). 3. **Recording:** The measured rainfall volume is then recorded. It's important to record consistently after each rainfall to create a reliable measurement data set over time.  4. **Data Analysis:** The recorded data provides useful information about seasonal changes, local climate, and patterns in weather behavior. These analyses can be used for various purposes like agricultural planning, flood predictions, and climate studies. 5. **Emptying:** After each measurement, the rain gauge should be emptied to prepare for the next round of rain collection.  It's worth noting that while manually operated rain gauges are common, there are also automated types, such as tipping bucket rain gauges and weighing rain gauges, which record rainfall electronically with no intervention required."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Plant A is very large, but plant B is smaller. Plant C and D are the same size. He applied some gibberellins to plant C, but didn't apply anything to plant D. He got curious about why some plants are bigger, while others are not.  and a hint : Gibberellins are hormones that cause the plant to grow. When gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists, the stems grow longer. Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase the growth of plants. Dwarf plants (small plants), on the other hand, have low levels of gibberellins ( Figure below ). Another function of gibberellins is to stop dormancy (resting time) of seeds and buds. Gibberellins signal that it’s time for a seed to germinate (sprout) or for a bud to open.  Please answer this question : Which plant would not see increase in growth, plant C or plant D? Answer:","output":"Plant D would not see an increase in growth as compared to plant C.  To understand this in more detail, let's take a closer look at the role of gibberellins in plant growth and how this hormone affects the growth of plants. Gibberellins are a class of plant hormones that play a crucial role in regulating various growth processes. They are responsible for stimulating cell elongation, promoting germination, and overcoming dormancy, among other things.  When Keith applied gibberellins to plant C, he essentially boosted the concentration of this hormone in that particular plant, helping to increase its growth rate by stimulating the elongation of its stem and possibly improving other aspects of its development. This means that plant C, post the application of gibberellins, will experience an enhanced rate of growth as compared to its previous state and potentially compared to other plants that did not receive the hormone treatment. On the other hand, plant D did not receive any gibberellins from Keith. This means that plant D would continue to grow at its natural pace, dictated by its genetics and environmental conditions. Since plant D is not experiencing any external hormonal intervention, its growth rate would not see a significant increase as compared to plant C, which has received the gibberellin treatment.  So, the answer to the question is that plant D would not see an increase in growth compared to plant C. Understanding the role of plant hormones like gibberellins can help gardeners or horticulture scientists manipulate the growth and development of plants for various purposes, such as increasing yield, improving morphology, or achieving desirable characteristics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both statements compare the nature of the Tax March with that of most liberal protests in the United States, highlighting the difference in focus between the two. In the first sentence, \\"Unlike most liberal protests in the United States, the Tax March focused not on broad issues, but on specific demand,\\" the emphasis is placed on the fact that the Tax March did not concentrate on general, wide-ranging issues. Instead, it honed in on a particular demand. The words \\"not\\" and \\"but\\" stress the contrast between the Tax March and other liberal protests. In the second sentence, \\"Unlike most liberal protests in the United States, the Tax March did not focus on broad issues, but instead focused on a specific demand,\\" the contrast is similarly highlighted. This time, the words \\"did not\\" and \\"but instead\\" are employed to illustrate the differing focuses. The phrase \\"a specific demand\\" suggests the same meaning as \\"specific demand\\" in the first sentence, implying that the Tax March concentrated on an individual issue or requirement.

Title: Men of Honor Movie plot: Carl Brashear (Gooding, Jr.) leaves his native Kentucky and the life of a sharecropper in 1948 by joining the United States Navy. As a crew member of the salvage ship USS Hoist, where he is assigned to the galley, he is inspired by the bravery of one of the divers, Master Chief Petty Officer Leslie William \\"Billy\\" Sunday (De Niro). He is determined to overcome racism and become the first black American Navy diver, even proclaiming that he will become a master diver. He eventually is selected to attend Diving and Salvage School in Bayonne, New Jersey, where he arrives as a boatswain's mate second class. He finds that Master Chief Sunday is the leading chief petty officer and head instructor, who is under orders from the school's eccentric, bigoted commanding officer to ensure that Brashear fails. Brashear struggles to overcome his educational shortcomings, a result of his leaving school in the 7th grade in order to work on his family's failing farm. He receives educational assistance from his future wife, a medical student who works part-time in the Harlem (New York City) Public Library. Brashear proves himself as a diver by rescuing a fellow student whose dive buddy abandons him during a salvage evaluation. Unfortunately, due to the racism of the commanding officer (Hal Holbrook), the student who fled in the face of danger is awarded a medal for Brashear's heroic actions. Likewise, during an underwater assembling task where each student has to assemble a flange underwater using a bag of tools, Brashear's bag is cut open. Brashear nevertheless finishes the assembly and graduates from diving school, earning the quiet and suppressed admiration of Master Chief Sunday and his fellow divers. Master Chief Sunday is later demoted to senior chief by the commanding officer for standing up for Brashear and allowing him to pass. The paths and careers of Brashear and Sunday sharply diverge.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Sources: Texas Rangers trade Ian Kinsler to Detroit Tigers for Prince Fielder - MLB News Updated Nov 21, 2013 12:45 PM ET The Texas Rangers on Wednesday traded second baseman Ian Kinsler to the Detroit Tigers for first baseman Prince Fielder. The Rangers, who officially announced the transaction Wednesday night, will also receive 30 million cash. Fielder is owed 168 million over the next seven years, Kinsler 62 million over the next four. That brings a net savings of 72 million for the Tigers. Fielder signed a nine-year, 214 million deal with the Tigers in January 2012. Kinsler signed a five-year, 75 million extension with the Rangers in April 2012. The implications for the Tigers are obvious. The savings on Fielder's contract could enable them to keep American League Cy Young winner Max Scherzer, who can become a free agent after the 2014 season, and AL MVP Miguel Cabrera, who can become a free agent after 2015. The blockbuster opens up positions for prospects. Nick Castellanos could play third base for the Tigers, with Cabrera moving to first. Jurickson Profar could play second base for the Rangers. There are free-agent implications, as well. The Rangers are presumably out on Mike Napoli. They had been involved on Brian McCann and Carlos Beltran, as well, among others. ''Obviously, a very exciting trade for us in adding Prince Fielder to the organization,'' Rangers general manager Jon Daniels said. ''Also a tough trade to make in that Ian Kinsler's been with the organization since he was drafted in \`03, and we've signed him here a couple of times. Been here, a catalyst for our World Series clubs, and a huge part of this. A winning guy, a heart-and-soul guy, and Detroit got a tremendous player and person.'' Robinson Cano is the biggest star on the market. Who are the best players for sale Fielder, a five-time All-Star, had to consent to the trade before it could be completed because of a limited no-trade provision. ''We're thankful for what he did for us,'' Detroit general manager Dave Dombrowski said. ''It'll be a bat that we miss at times — there's no doubt about it.'' Fielder hit .279 with 25 homers this year. He drove in 106 runs, but it was his lowest home run total over a full season. He did not have a single RBI in the 2013 postseason and hit .182 in the ALCS. Daniels said the trade came together quickly; the first discussions took place Tuesday. The Rangers will welcome the durable Fielder, who has played 162 games in four of the past five seasons. Texas was interested in Fielder when he signed with Detroit as a free agent. ''Our offer was well below what it ended up being, so we weren't that close,'' Daniels said. ''I thought he was a genuine guy that really loved the game, really loved playing the game, loved his boys, his sons.'' Kinsler batted .277 with 13 homers this year. The three-time All-Star was limited to 136 games because of injuries to his ribs and right side. The Associated Press contributed to this report.","output":"In November 2013, the Texas Rangers traded second baseman Ian Kinsler to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for first baseman Prince Fielder.

Soccer is a very physical game that is often played outdoors. Between the rain and your sweat, your socks may get extremely moist. Many brands have technology to wick away sweat and moisture. Hygiene, odour issues, and performance can all be affected by extreme moisture. Each brand has its own patented technology:  Puma technology is referred to as DryCell, CoolPlus Yarn, and CoolCell. Nike technology is referred to as Dri-Fit. Adidas technology is referred to as ClimaCool and ClimaLite. Under Armour technology is referred to as ArmourDry and HeatGear Each player is comfortable with a different sock length. In an official match, you may need to keep your socks at least above your shin guard. In practice you may find that a shorter length allows for more movement. Cold weather may also affect your decision. Here are some helpful descriptions that you may come across:  OTC stand for socks that come over the calf. These socks are the longest you can get and usually are worn above your knee. Crew refers to socks that cover slightly above your calf. Low-cut refers to socks that are below your calf and slightly above your ankle. No-show refers to socks that are below your ankle and basically cannot be seen with your shoes on. Invest in higher end technology that creates strategic support, cushioning, and comfort for each foot. These socks will usually have an L or R to indicate which foot to place the sock on to. Choose from a variety of technological specifications including: ribbed ankle support, anti-odor technology, mesh ventilation, achilles cushioning, and arch support. For example, you may need achilles cushioning if you have been injured or find that your shoes irritate that area when you perform certain movements. Team administrators and coaches may have the added responsibility of choosing team colours. They should also consider construction and sweat control as these socks will need to be durable and prevent player issues with hygiene and performance. Think about the ratio of synthetic material against natural material before making your final decision. Synthetic materials provide more stretch and can help to manage sweat and moisture. Synthetic materials include polyester and spandex. Natural materials can provide warmth and increased cushioning. These materials include cotton and hemp. A blend of both synthetic and natural materials tend to work best. Also factor in your team’s budget before making the final purchase. If you don’t wear shin guards while practicing, you have a lot more sock options. Crew socks are very popular for training. No-show and low-cut socks are popular for cardio or gym training. You must choose the right size and correct material to meet your comfort and fit needs. Training can be grueling and the wrong fit can lead to painful blisters. Your skin may also get easily irritated by certain material. If you are on a team, you will need two pairs for both your home and away soccer kits. If you play in tournaments, you will most likely play in several games in one day or over a weekend. Training may require at least five pairs depending on how often you intend to train during the week. High-level players may train every day or even two or three times in a single day. You can get blisters, athlete’s foot, or severe foot damage if you continuously wear your used socks without cleaning them. Keep in mind that you will also need extra socks for cold weather, if you damage a pair, or if a fresh pair helps with your performance. You may also lose a single sock in the laundry or use specific pairs for specific activities. For example, you may use a special pair for shoot outs. Players at every position prefer different socks lengths. If you are a forward and attack aggressively, you may want your socks to be lower or to have added achilles support for your quick movements and ball handling. Goalies may prefer socks that are thicker and longer when playing in colder weather.

Despite the stark differences in their behaviors, it was clear that there was a problem that needed to be addressed. The day started like any other, with Logan and Ian clocking in at their usual time of 8:00 a.m. The two were known for being on time and reliable; they were tasked with important responsibilities in a fast-shifting environment. Their manager, Angela, was always appreciative of their punctuality and work ethic. Even though Angela noticed that Logan seemed a bit disheveled that morning, she didn't think too much of it initially. After all, everyone has off days, and perhaps Logan was just tired or not feeling well. Around mid-morning, however, a few of Logan's co-workers began raising concerns. They mentioned feeling uncomfortable with Logan's presence due to the strong smell of alcohol that seemed to be emanating from him. This was highly unusual for Logan, as he typically maintained a professional demeanor and appearance throughout the workday. Angela caught whiff of Logan's alcohol odor when she walked by him later that morning. Unwilling to overlook the situation, Angela decided she needed to have a conversation with Logan about his current state. She pulled him into her office to discuss the issue further. During this conversation, Logan initially denied having consumed any alcohol that morning. He seemed a bit defensive and attempted to brush off any concerns. Angela, however, was relentless, and after a few probing questions, Logan admitted that he had been drinking the previous night, stayed out much later than he planned, and didn't have time to shower or change before coming to work. He regretted doing so and in hindsight realized that it was impacting not only his own work but also the work environment for others. At this point, Angela was forced to make the difficult decision to send Logan home for the day. Despite typically being an upstanding employee, the fact that he came to work smelling so strongly of alcohol was a clear violation of the company's code of conduct, and it was affecting the team’s morale. Logan was asked to return the next day with a clear head and a commitment to maintaining a professional demeanor in the future. Meanwhile, Ian, who had never had any such issues in the past, continued with his day, focusing on his responsibilities and teamwork. He was troubled by the situation with Logan, as they had always gotten along well and Ian saw him as a role model in many ways. Nonetheless, Ian was determined to maintain his own professionalism and demonstrate respect for the company's policies and his co-workers' well-being.

However, owning a cast iron pan requires proper care and attention in order to maximize its potential and extend its lifespan. In this article, we will discuss the importance of drying, oiling, and reheating your cast iron kitchenware, as well as preventing moisture build-up during storage. Step 1: Dry it Immediately One of the most essential steps after using your cast iron cookware is making sure that it's thoroughly dried. Wet or damp cast iron can develop rust, which can compromise both the quality of your pan and the food you cook on it. After washing or rinsing your cast iron with warm water, thoroughly dry it using a towel or place it on low heat on a stovetop to evaporate any remaining moisture. Step 2: Oil it Back Up After ensuring that your cast iron piece is completely dry, it's vital to oil it back up. Oiling helps to maintain the seasoning and prevents the pan from rusting. Use a small amount of oil (vegetable oil, shortening, or flaxseed oil are all great options) and rub it all over the cooking surface using a paper towel or a lint-free cloth. A well-seasoned cast iron will not require frequent oiling, but it's a good habit to keep it lightly oiled, especially in humid environments. Step 3: Reheat It Preheating your cast iron cookware before storage is another important step in maintaining its quality. The heat helps to fully absorb the oil and create a protective barrier against moisture. Place your oiled pan on a low to medium heat until it's warm to the touch. You can also put it in the oven at 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius) for about 10 minutes. Step 4: Prevent Moisture Build-Up During Storage To prevent moisture from building up during storage, make sure to store your cast iron cookware in a cool, dry place. Avoid stacking other pots or pans on top of your cast iron as this can trap moisture and promote rust. To ensure proper airflow and to keep your cast iron pieces moisture-free, you can use a paper towel or a dry cloth inside your pan when storing it. This will also help to soak up any excess oil and prevent sticky buildup. Conclusion By following these basic steps, you'll not only prolong the life of your cast iron cookware but also ensure that you're getting the best possible cooking experience. A well-cared-for cast iron pan will serve you and your kitchen for a lifetime. So remember to dry, oil, reheat, and store your cast iron properly to make the most out of this kitchen essential."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.  - \`\` Shakey Ground '' is a 1975 R&B single by The Temptations .
