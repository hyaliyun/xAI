However, if you could give me one piece of advice, what would it be?","output":"First, I will begin by letting Abraham Lincoln answer your question and then I will take a stab at it. Lincoln was a very famous and skillful lawyer. Lincoln wrote that a man who “represents himself in court has a fool for a client.” Now I will add my own admonitions. You may understand your favorite sport very well, but not necessarily be able to play it. When you as a lay person walk into a courtroom against a lawyer, it will be like you being matched against an NBA player in a game of basketball. Even if the player opposite you is one of the worst ranked players in the league, the outcome will still be certain. You will lose. And that is the most likely fate that awaits you in a courtroom. I have spent the last 4 decades of my life in courtrooms. I have watched the performance and the results in countless cases involving people representing themselves. A few of them have done astonishingly well. But only a few. The rest were sad failures. Most of the failures were going to lose anyway. They just didn’t have the facts or the law on their side - but they didn’t know it. Many losers could have had much better outcomes if they had legal representation. Legal representation could have allowed quite a few of the losers to salvage something better that an outright loss. That’s because a lawyer would have been able to negotiate something better for them. There is no better substitute in a courtroom for putting the skill, experience and analytical ability on your side that only a lawyer can bring to the handling of your case.

Obesity is not just a cosmetic concern. It is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to such an extent that it may negatively affect health. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measurement of a person’s weight with respect to his or her height. The results of a BMI measurement can give an idea about whether a person has the correct weight for their height. A high BMI can indicate high body fatness. BMI screens for weight categories that may lead to health problems. The classification of BMI (Body Mass Index) is as below: BMI less than 25 is considered normal.BMI between 25 - 30 is considered overweight.BMI between 30 - 35 is considered grade I obesity.BMI between 35 - 40 is considered grade II obesity.BMI greater than 40 to 45 is considered morbidly obese.BMI greater than 50 is considered super morbidly obese. Class III obesity, formerly known as morbid obesity, is a complex chronic disease in which a person has a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher or a BMI of 35 or higher and is experiencing obesity-related health conditions.

Spoiler Alert: if you haven't seen the movie I pretty much reveal some key parts to the film. Read on if you dare. Just a heads up. When the books are opened at the end of Hillary Swank’s life, the role of Maggie Fitzgerald, in Million Dollar Baby, just might be the role that grants her entrance into the pearly gates. For one movie it doesn’t get much sadder than a waitress from the Ozarks looking to track down Clint Eastwood’s character, boxing trainer, Frankie Dunn, so he could train her to prizefight. Dunn reluctantly takes on this new project and watches like a grandfather would as his favorite granddaughter, in her million dollar match takes on the dirtiest fighter out there, Billie Osterman. Maggie knocks Osterman from pillar to post, and in a move highlighting her inexperience and cockiness, she turns her back on her opponent. A big no-no. Living up to her dastardly reputation, Osterman illegally tags Maggie, knocking her down, and the audience groans as her head crashes into a stool, just before her body thuds on the floor. She ends up in the hospital and is pronounced paralyzed. Making matters worse is that while she’s recovering, and expectedly awaiting the arrival of her family for support, they arrive only after making a tour of Disney Land and Universal Studios Hollywood. Their primary concern is getting Maggie’s assets/belongings transferred to them in the case of her death. Maggie, disgusted, banishes them from the room and tells them that she will report their welfare fraud if they come back around again. She eventually gets her leg amputated and, after having enough, she asks Frankie to administer the coup de grace. He does so but not without much conflict. Injecting her with adrenaline and then walking away as the narration to end the film begins. For those of you that have never watched this film, go watch it, I have a 24 Pack of Mountain Dew on the line if you manage to watch….this… and happen to want to watch it again.

I.e., if you were to take a Modern Greek speaker and give them a series of ancient Greek texts, each older than the last, at what point will they stop understanding?","output":"It’s a mess because not everyone used as archaic language as the “Logioi” or “Katharevousianoi” later. Or the Church. Erotokritos, a medieval Cretan poem is an example of what “refined” folklore greek sounded like during the renaissance, and they are almost indistinguishable from the modern Cretan dialect, but full of idioms for Greeks outside of Crete, or even Cretans that forgot their own idiom. So, less formal medieval greek is probably the limit; then you’d need special training in school to understand anything more archaic.

Vishnu is so beautiful with lotus shaped eyes, His mesmerizing smile, His body is as blue as sky, to tell in one word, Lord Vishnu is Manoharudu, who steals our hearts with His beauty. No words or poetry exists in this world to describe His beauty ! He rests on the Seshanag, is portrayed with four arms, resembling the four directions, and He is the protector and operator of this Universe. A lotus sprouts from His navel, from which lord Brahma, the creator is born. He has goddess Lakshmi, the prosperity provider to all the people as His wife and she resides in Vishnu's heart( Vakshasthala_stitayai). She presses His lotus feet and provides Him the much needed relief from the busy schedule as the Protector of the entire Universe.

All religions contain valuable philosophy that may hold meaning to people.

Which in theory gives you a touch more gain and a symmetrical pattern. It is more important with a dipole than a yagi. A yagi is good at balancing out the energy with the directors and reflector(s). If the gain is essentially the same and the impedance is matched with a simpler match why not do it? Many dipole driven elements are fed with unbalanced feeds like gamma matches which are simpler and perhaps lower cost too. If you are throwing up a lone wire dipole, a gamma match is much more difficult to achieve. However a balun is mechanically simple. Just connect one wire to each side and trim the lengths for resonance. Some dipoles really need a balun due to how they are is fed. Folded dipoles would be difficult to feed with an unbalanced feed."},{"instruction":"What is the formula for sport betting?","output":"Successful sports betting typically revolves around a few key principles: Knowledge: Understand the sport you're betting on. Familiarity with teams, players, and statistics can help make more informed bets.Discipline: Avoid impulsive betting. Set a budget and stick to it to avoid potential financial pitfalls.Odds Understanding: Be aware of how odds work and what they imply about the likelihood of an outcome.Value Identification: This is where bettors often make money in the long run. It involves identifying and betting on outcomes that you think are more likely to happen than the odds suggest. For instance, if a bookmaker offers odds of 3:1 for Team A to win against Team B, but you believe Team A's chances are better than that, this could be a value bet.Emotion Management: Avoid letting emotions drive your decisions. Betting should be based on facts and analysis, not loyalty to a specific team or player.Diversification: Similar to investing, don't put all your money on one outcome. Spread your bets to manage risk.Continuous Learning: The most successful bettors are often those who continue to learn and adapt their strategies over time. Remember, sports betting involves risk, and losses are inevitable. Never bet more than you can afford to lose, and consider it as a form of entertainment rather than a reliable way to make money."},{"instruction":"Why are cookies called biscuits in England?","output":"Why are biscuits called cookies in the USA?"},{"instruction":"When cooking, is stir fry the same process as French sauté?","output":"The processes are somewhat similar but with a huge difference.The intensity of the heat on stir fries is several folds more than on a sauté.

[LINKED_TEXT: Granite] [URL: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhDV_pSkqJEWYKyGOqHE1A] is a type of magmatic rock, formed by the slow crystallization of magma below the Earth’s surface. The stone is typically a conglomerate of quartz, mica, feldspar, amphiboles and other trace minerals. Granite has been used for thousands of years, as evidenced by historical structures that remain standing all throughout Europe to this day. That’s no surprise, as granite is second only to diamonds in its hardness. Granite surfaces are highly durable and heat-, crack- and scratch-resistant, making it an excellent choice for indoor applications like kitchen countertops, floor tiles, backsplash, bathroom tiles, mantelpieces and staircases. Cleaning and Maintaining Granite While granite is one of the easiest natural stone surfaces to care for, it can become dull around sinks and in high traffic work areas over time. The following measures can help protect your granite countertops for many years to come: Wipe counters daily with a neutral cleaner.Use cutting boards, cooling racks and trivets.Clean spills and moisture as soon as possible.Keep bottles of cleaning fluids like dish detergent off of countertops (on a dish, for example).Use coasters for mugs and glasses.Dry underneath dishes regularly.Wipe water around faucets off daily to prevent it from calcifying and turning white (using a neutral cleaner once a week can clear away buildup). What is Marble? The main difference between marble and granite is how these stones are formed in the earth. Let’s discuss [LINKED_TEXT: marble] [URL: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhDV_pSkqJEWYKyGOqHE1A]! Marble is metamorphic as opposed to magmatic. Metamorphic rock forms when limestone is subjected to high amounts of heat and pressure during metamorphosis. This process usually occurs at convergent plate boundaries near the Earth’s crust. Marble is primarily composed of calcite, but like granite, it usually contains other minerals like micas, quartz and iron oxides as well. This gorgeous natural stone is just about synonymous with a luxurious, timeless aesthetic. While marble is a softer stone than granite, it can also last for generations when properly installed and cared for. Marble is both heat- and crack-resistant, which makes it an excellent choice for the kitchen or around a fireplace. Cleaning and Maintaining Marble Marble is a porous, absorbent stone, which can make it vulnerable to spills and acidic substances if not sealed properly and regularly. When used outdoors, it can also be damaged by acid rain and pollutants, but taking these steps on a daily basis will help protect your investment: Wipe up spills and dirt right away with a non-abrasive cloth or sponge.Avoid using chemical cleaners, acids like vinegar and lemon juice, grout cleaners, and tub or tile cleaners, as they can etch and dull the stone.Soapless, neutral cleaners specifically made for stone are ideal. You can also use mild, phosphate-free, eco-friendly dishwashing liquids or powders, neutral detergents, or vegetable oil-based soaps––just be sure to rinse all cleaners off completely with fresh water.For exterior steps and pathways, sweep and rinse marble often with water, drying them thoroughly afterwards.Use coasters and trivets when placing wet or hot items on marble."},{"instruction":"Who played drums on Michael Jackson’s Billie Jean?","output":"Leon NDugu Chancler."},{"instruction":"What do British conservatives think about such things as gun rights, ending abortion, ending gay marriage, and restoring the death penalty?","output":"I am afraid that “British Conservatives\\" would be a major disappointment to you.

Has this tactic ever been used in war?","output":"Yes it is. In fact, any use of Geneva conventions protections to gain military advantage, for example, Hamas’s use of schools to conceal weapons, or dressing a fighter as an unarmed civilian, is specifically defined as “Perfidy” in the Geneva Conventions. Perfidy is forbidden, and with good reason. False surrender is called out as an example of Perfidy. Others include faking incapacitation or illness. Has it been used? Countless times, by terrorists in Iraq and Israel, who approach guard posts, surrender, and try to explode bombs. This is why guards have learned to order people surrendering, if they look at all suspicious, to remain at a distance and remove clothing. And that is why perfidy is a crime. When you do it, it causes the enemy to lose incentive to act with mercy. Store bombs in enough schools, and sooner or later your enemy will assume the schools have bombs in them, and act exactly as you have taught them to."},{"instruction":"w dangerous is broken insulation in outlet wiring?","output":"Very. Anything metallic or conductive, from Christmas tree tinsel, to a fork, to a baby’s finger, can burn your house down (and wreck the baby’s day). You see, if something completes the circuit, what you have is a small space heater. It creates an arc, that will very quickly heat up the wires. If you’re lucky, the circuit breaker will trip, but think about all that heat coming out of a blow drier. What if that heat was, instead, right next to some paper, and concentrated in a section an eighth of an inch wide? That might NOT pop the circuit breaker … after all, the blow drier didn’t (although it is close to the max, depending on the dryer). It all depends on resistance of the wires. Don’t gamble with your house and your life that way. Just because it creates a short circuit doesn’t mean the circuit breaker will pop (although they usually do, which is why they are a good idea). Yes, it’s a long shot, but not THAT long of a long shot: Electrical failures or malfunctions were the second leading cause of U.S. home fires in 2012-2016 (behind fires caused by unattended equipment), accounting for 13% of home structure fires. Fires involving electrical failures or malfunctions accounted for the highest share of civilian deaths (18%) and direct property damage (20%).Nearly two of five fires (39%) involving electrical failure or malfunction occurred in the cold weather months from November through February.Arcing was the heat source in approximately three of five home fires involving an electrical failure or malfunction.

It advocates allowing animals to live, instead of slaughtering them. As that concerns hundreds of billions of animals who are caught up in the meat and dairy industry every year, it’s the most important Pro-Life cause that you can possibly think of. PETA also opposes vivisection which involves torturing animals, and then killing them. Billions of animals are used for painful experiments and then they are thrown away like scrap afterwards every year. PETA is trying to stop this. There is no Pro-Life organisation on the Earth that is more important than PETA. That’s my opinion."},{"instruction":"Why is encryption so much easier than decryption in cryptography?","output":"Encryption is converting plaintext to ciphertext and decryption is ciphertext to plaintext. Encryption may vary according to the method of the algorithmic schemes. It is only easy in traditional cryptographic schemes but if we consider modern cryptographic schemes then you may find encryption is difficult. We can convert plaintext into ciphertext with the help of known keys to make it as difficult as possible to decrypt. Decryption is where we achieve plaintext from the ciphertext. We receiver already know the key to decrypt then he/she won't take much time to get the original message. If he/she doesn't know the key then he/she needs to try every single possible key. It results into time complexity. Henceforth, we can say that it depends on the algorithmic scheme how much easy encryption and decryption is."},{"instruction":"What was your reason for leaving a tremendous tip at a restaurant?","output":"Hi. At the end of August 2020, I and a friend of mine decided to go out and have dinner at a restaurant after work. We went to Twickenham, south west London, and sat in a restaurant right by the Thames. Lovely place, lovely people, and best of all, away from the confusion that is central London. A waitress comes and meets us and she’s really nice, using a mask and gloves, and takes our orders. While we wait for the food my friend and I talk and laugh and she comes back with a bottle of wine and pours it and everything is good. When the food arrives it’s a waiter that brings it, not her, and he says to us as he puts our plates on our table: When you tip me, don’t put it on the card, give it to me in cash as the boss will take a percentage. Maybe you guys don’t find that rude, but I certainly did. We said. No worries, mate. After a couple of minutes the waitress comes back with another bottle of wine and I ask her where she’s from as I recognize her accent. She happens to be from Braga in my home country, Portugal. We start speaking and she starts laughing at our jokes and she brings us dessert and we spend about 30 minutes talking to her (there were no other customers). The waiter sees this and I can tell he's pissed off as he’s shaking his legs and looking straight at us. He then brings us a piece of cake each and says it’s on the house. We say thank you and I ask the waitress to put it in a box for me to take home. She does and gives us the receipt after we ask for it. It was 127.45£ in total. I put the box with the cake on the counter and drag it in her direction. She smiles and nods negatively and I nod positively and she laughs and grabs it and takes it inside. When she comes back I give her my card to pay and we start to leave and she follows us to the door. Thank you very much! Hope you had a good time. I get close to her and hand her two 50£ notes. That’s for you, and you alone. And I leave as she looks at me with her eyes wide open. In the car I was laughing, imagining the waiter’s face when he noticed we left without tipping him. She never asked for a tip and was nothing but polite and professional listening to me and my friend. She deserved that and more. Thank you for reading."},{"instruction":"Why is the microwave oven harmful to food?","output":"Microwaving food does not make it inherently less healthy. It can be one of the best methods for retaining nutrients in food because it cooks quickly and doesn't require a large amount of water, unlike boiling. More nutrients can be lost when food is cooked for a longer period or in a large amount of water. However, it's essential to use microwave-safe containers when heating food. Containers made from unsafe materials can leach harmful substances into food when heated. Plastic containers or films not explicitly designed for microwave use can melt or release harmful compounds into the food."},{"instruction":"have 100k which I want to invest passively.

Many people are interested in the idea of [LINKED_TEXT: passive income through multifamily investment] [URL: https://growcaptoday.com/dover-pointe-apartment-2/], but they don't know how to get started. To help you out, here's an overview of what you can expect from this type of investment and some tips on where to start: Multifamily investment involves buying multiple properties that are rented out together and managed as a single entity. This means that you'll be renting out units in your properties to tenants who may or may not live there full-time. The idea behind multifamily investment is that it's easier to manage multiple properties at once than it would be if each property was its own separate entity. You'll have more flexibility in terms of what types of tenants you allow into your buildings, and the maintenance costs will be spread across all your properties instead of individually for each one. One thing to keep in mind is that it can take longer for multifamily investments to become profitable than other types of investments like stocks or bonds because there are fewer variables involved—it's just about collecting rent checks every month! However, if you're willing to put in the time and effort up front, then over time you'll see The benefits of [LINKED_TEXT: multifamily investment] [URL: https://growcaptoday.com/about/] are that it's passive, low-maintenance and low-risk—and those are three things that investors love!"},{"instruction":"ve you ever hired someone because of their Udacity Nanodegree?","output":"Because of?

It would be fatiguing and distracting. Lifting your arms on a continuous basis with the Mac on a desk, would cause your arms to be tired, as well as if you alternated from touch to mouse/ keyboard would cause loss of productivity and concentration. Apple products are created with the idea of providing an excellent solution for a need while maintaining ease and comfort. The included Touch Bar on a MacBook, above the keyboard provides a great solution. This works. It still provides a comfortable productive solution without an eventual fatigue by having to life your arms continuously.

Almost invariably British garages are built with a brick pillar exactly where the door opens. And then you have the problem of getting the car out in reverse as you, or the wife in my case, clips the garage doorframe. I would put my new car in the garage but because it is so narrow it is inevitable it would suffer more damage than if I park on the drive.

When you spend considerable time with then you pick up their accent. When I spent three years in UK I learned how to roll my tongue so that the locals understood me. But when I came back to India I let go of that habit because then Indians did not understand me. Also it is my general observance (which is limited and my personal opinion) that people who are not fluent in English in their home country pick up the local accent faster than the people who already have an established fluency over English. I tried a lot but could never take on the British accent and people in India often asked why I don’t talk like a British. While in Britain, I was asked a lot why I don’t have an Indian accent. I think it all comes down to how well you fluently speak each word so that the other person understands you.

When the bats leave, the crows come home. Not all the din of their homecoming fills the silence left by the sparrows that have gone missing, and the old white-backed vultures, custodians of the dead for more than a hundred million years, that have been wiped out. The vultures died of diclofenac poisoning. Diclofenac, cow aspirin, given to cattle as a muscle relaxant, to ease pain and increase the production of milk, works—worked—like nerve gas on white-backed vultures. Each chemically relaxed milk-producing cow or buffalo that died became poisoned vulture bait. As cattle turned into better dairy machines, as the city ate more ice cream, butterscotch-crunch, nutty-buddy and chocolate-chip, as it drank more mango milkshake, vultures’ necks began to droop as though they were tired and simply couldn’t stay awake.

Milan Kundera’s [LINKED_TEXT: The Unbearable Lightness of Being] [URL: https://www.quora.com/topic/The-Unbearable-Lightness-of-Being-1984-book] “The idea of eternal return is a mysterious one, and Nietzsche has often perplexed other philosophers with it: to think that everything recurs as we once experienced it, and that the recur-rence itself recurs ad infinitum! What does this mad myth signify? Putting it negatively, the myth of eternal return states that a life which disappears once and for all, which does not return, is like a shadow, without weight, dead in advance, and whether it was horrible, beautiful, or sublime, its horror, sublimity, and beauty mean nothing. We need take no more note of it than of a war between two African kingdoms in the fourteenth century, a war that altered nothing in the destiny of the world, even if a hundred thousand blacks perished in excruciating torment. Will the war between two African kingdoms in the four-teenth century itself be altered if it recurs again and again, in eternal return? It will: it will become a solid mass, permanently protuberant, its inanity irreparable. If the French Revolution were to recur eternally, French historians would be less proud of Robespierre. But because they deal with something that will not return, the bloody years of the Revolution have turned into mere words, theories, and discussions, have become lighter than feathers, frightening no one. There is an infinite difference between a Robespierre who occurs only once in history and a Robespierre who eternally re-turns, chopping off French heads. Let us therefore agree that the idea of eternal return implies a perspective from which things appear other than as we know them: they appear without the mitigating circumstance of their transitory nature. This mitigating circumstance prevents us from coming to a verdict. For how can we condemn some-thing that is ephemeral, in transit? In the sunset of dissolution, everything is illuminated by the aura of nostalgia, even the guillotine.” 3.

Nobody will think that you are a rich person and try to rob you and you also won’t be mistaken for a soldier or an irregular combatant (they drive only the best cars in wartime). Additionally, when the time has come to leave your vehicle behind and continue on foot, it will hurt much less to abandon a pile of crap than an expensive jeep. Many people have been killed in wartime, because they clung to their property and wouldn’t let go. This one will do! Still, the problem with all motorized vehicles is that they need fuel (which is often not available in war zones) and of course roads. Being on a road can be a dangerous thing as you inevitably have to cross checkpoints where you can be harassed, beaten, arrested and even get killed. The roads will also be blocked by refugees as you are probably not the only person who wants to escape. Better than any car is a cross motorcycle. They go practically everywhere. However, all motorized vehicles make a lot of noise which attracts attention, especially at night. A tractor and other agricultural machines can be easily mistaken for military vehicles (their engines sound like tank motors) and come under attack. A bicycle, on the other hand, makes no noise, but has the disadvantages that it takes you less far than a car and you also won’t be able to carry a lot of stuff with you.

Are farmers happy?","output":"Being a farmer is one of the rare professions in this world where he interacts directly with nature. Being a farmer is a living a healthy way of life. We grow Cashews and it’s harvesting season is in summer. So, at 6.00 AM i have to be in the farm to harvest as much trees as possible before 11:30 to escape from the scorching sun afterwards. Then again the work starts by 3:30 goes till 7 or sometimes till 9. As a gift, we receive a rain for two days to cool ourselves in summer. We call it Kodai Mazhai. A most of the cashew trees are grown by spreading themselves over ground, their shadows saves us. Animals we interact are rabbits, cows, goats and birds like peacock, sparrows, swans, pigeons and numerous foreign birds. Reptiles like scorpion and snakes are often seen. The schedule is tight for a day as preparing tiffin like idli and dosa is rare during morning and ragi paste drink (kezhvaragu koozh) is the most common breakfast and curd rice or water rice (thanni soru) with pickle is the lunch. Water has to be taken from wells for drinking while working in farms and for consumption in evening and night. Taking well from well is an art and it improves fitness. People are simple and lot of trees around us gives chillness to sleep. The sixty days of harvesting are honeymoon period for me as i do very hard work, take heavy food and sound sleep plus generating income tax free money. I miss those days by living dumb for the other 305 days. Amendment: I suggest the next generation youth and the present generation youth to focus on agriculture as it is not only a profession but it is a way of living our life. It should not be underrated as it has lot of things to give, profit, fitness, punctuality, sincerity, time management, stress less life, mind control, feel good thoughts because of the God’s creation, family bonding, strong and trustful relationships, love from animals, feeding people, own holiday plans, own financial plans, clean water, clean air, healthy food, long life span etc which we rarely get in fast moving city life."},{"instruction":"lost my email password.

If not for the intervention of Captain Janeway and the crew of Voyager, the Borg would have been entirely erased. However, the Undine were a much greater threat than even the Borg, so Janeway worked with the Collective to create weapons that were effective against them. As a result, the Undine were driven back into Fluidic Space, and the Borg were allowed to resume expansion in the Delta Quadrant. The Borg are still a threat, but it will take decades for the Borg to return to their pre-war levels of power.

Some say men should pay, others want to go dutch because they want to take a lovely night home, not regrets. My first date was in college. Being a college student is synonymous to being broke. I explicitly texted the girl: “I suggest we should pay for own parts. I think we should know each other a bit better before paying each other’s bills.” Sike. You can’t imagine the cringe that thrilled me down to my spine. But hey, I’m just a student. So is she. We did not earn, and it was only expected. If you’re still in school or college, it’s more than cool to split. That was a year ago when I was 20. Now, when I go on dates, I just pay for the whole thing. I make enough money. I don’t like to bicker. I’m there for a good time, and I’m fine paying for it. “But what about the girl? She was there for a good time, too, why shouldn’t she pay as well.” Mate, sit down. Here’s a bit of an advice that’ll be non-conventional in this age of alpha-this and beat up-that. Women like men. Capable, protective and stable men. Chivalry is not dead. It charms a woman when a man extends an effort to show care and character. She put on makeup that was probably worth more than everything you’re wearing from head-to-toe. Then you go on to ruin the night with your “Hey, can we split the bill? hehe.” like an awkward goat. If you didn’t see her after again, don’t wonder why. If you’re a man who earns, and you ask out a woman for a date, then you ask her to split the bill, do you know what that shows? You don’t find her valuable enough to be spending a few more bucks on her.You’re unsure about your choice in women.Or you probably just want to go on a dates with a lot of women, so you’re trying to save up. What part of this exhibits a strong sense of character? You want to show that you care for the time you have with her, and it doesn’t bother you if you shed a few bucks on her. If you don’t have much to spend dates, then don’t go on so many.

Facts spoil a good myth, don’t you think? I even acknowledge that names could be wrong, but what the hell. Anyway, Scotland under Robert The Bruce is fighting England. There is a lot of raiding of castles going on and the Scottish are VERY good at it, with one man in particular standing out. Douglas. He may have a title, he may have a clan, he may even wear pink socks for all I remember, but one thing he does have is a NAME, a name given to him by his enemies. THE BLACK DOUGLAS (or it could be Angus for all I know). His face is no doubt on many a “traitor’s board”, WANTED, DEAD OR ALIVE. The princely sum of ten groats and a ferret as the reward. Ten groats AND your very own ferret? The English must really rate this guy! Why, for that sort of money you could buy half of Scotland and still have enough left over for a Hogmanay party! Anyway, so Blackie (let’s be familiar as I feel I know the guy) has clocked in to work and is happily engaged in raiding his next castle. He has a trick, though, does our Blackie. He has a knack for …….what’s the correct term……sneaking in the back door? Show him a castle and he automatically seems to gravitate to its weakest point. Climbing high walls in darkness, sheer walls that are slippery with moss and cold and wet with rain? No problem. What do you want me to do AFTER breakfast? Ooh, bet that lock hasn’t been oiled recently? One jiggle and……yep, open. Oh, and while I’m there shall I slit the throat of the sleeping Lord, bugger his mistress silly then make of with all his gold? What the hell, seems like a good hobby. Anyway, so Blackie gets a reputation for his particular kind of house breaking, hence the ten groats and a ferret, reputedly increased to TWO ferrets over time. Two ferrets? A mating pair? You’d never have to lift a finger again! Just sit back and watch the ferrets breed; rich beyond the wildest dreams of avarice. The good life. But nobody would sell him out because he also had a reputation for dealing with people like that. If he could break into a castle then a dung filled hovel wouldn’t be a problem. Didn’t matter how many guards you could afford to buy with your unlimited supply of ferrets, he’d still get you. Best leave well alone if you value your knackers. And waking up with a red smiley face on your throat can spoil your whole day. Where were we? Oh yes, so he’s clocked in for his night shift, picked his castle and he’s nose to the grind stone putting in a shift’s honest graft when he meets a snag. He’s just managed to get in to the top floor of the castle where all the goodies are when he hears a noise. Stepping into the shadows he spies a woman with a baby and the baby is doing what babies are want to do at night. The woman is trying her best to shush the kid. Don’t want to wake up the whole castle, right? “Shush, there there. Quiet down me wee girl. Go to sleep or the Black Douglas will get ye,” and so on. Blackie is in a quandary. He can’t wait here all night or some guard might find evidence of his passing. And isn’t this kid EVER going to shut up! So he makes a decision, steps out of the shadows, takes the baby from the terrified, unbelieving, too scared to talk woman, shushes the baby with a stern look and a finger to his lips, hands the baby back to her (silently nodding towards a room where she will be safe - The Black Douglas will not look in there, wink wink) and finishes his raid. Now tell me that ain’t a cool legend or myth? And don’t go spoil it by looking up facts though, I assure you, the incident does indeed appear in some historical text. Beat that, Milk Tray chocolate man. The Black Douglas was never caught. Rumour has it he retired from the life of castle raiding and started up a lucrative business in child care.

I understand in some cases Assembly beats even compiled code in c and c++, what happen under the hood that makes Assembly code run faster in certain situations?","output":"High level languages like C and C++ have to be converted in to assembly language for the computer to understand them. (Actually they are converted to “machine code” - but it boils down to the same thing). So the question of whether hand-written assembly language is faster than C/C++ comes down to whether the compiler that converts them to assembler is better at writing assembly language code than a human. Writing machine code is a bit like playing chess - and we all know that computers can play chess better than any human…compilers are more or less the same deal. For any given set of operations, there are usually a bunch of ways to do it in assembly language. So, for example - if (in C) I write: a = b * 2 ; c = d / 4 ; …then we should note that multiplication and division instructions take longer to execute than additions, subtractions and shifts. So a human machine code programmer might spot that multiplying by two is the same as adding b to itself - and so they’ll probably write assembly language code that does this: a = b + b ; But then, they might notice that the time it takes to load ‘b’ from memory into a register is kinda time consuming - so maybe: a = b << 1 ; (“<<” means “shift all of the bits in the number up one place”) …is even faster than “b+b”. Same for the division - dividing by an exact power of two is like downshifting twice: c = d >> 2 ; …OK! So this is much better than C…right? But not right. The C compiler also knows those exact same tricks that the human programmer knows…and it employs them PERFECTLY every single time…it NEVER forgets a clever trick that saves time. So a human might work really hard and spot that: a = b * 60 ; …could be rewritten as: a = (b << 5) - (b << 2) ; …that’s b times 64 minus b times 4 - which is b times 60 - but without needing a multiply! But now it’s not at all clear whether two shifts and a subtract is faster or slower than a multiplication instruction. You might have to consult the machine code programmers guide to figure out whether it’s better or not. The compiler knows which is faster - and will always do the right thing…perfectly…every time (and although it DOES know that - it actually won’t do this - we’ll find out why in a moment). The human programmer isn’t going to be able to spot these kinds of optimization 100% of the time - they’ll get lazy and not bother - or simply won’t consider all of the possible implications of the optimization…but the compiler will! HOWEVER: The human does have some other advantages. In truth, changing: a = b * 60 ; …into a = (b<<5) - (b<<2) ; …isn’t correct! If we’re doing (say) signed 16 bit arithmetic and ‘b’ is between 512 and 546 then (b<<5) will overflow the 16 bit word and the answer will come out NEGATIVE - the answer won’t be the same as b*60…which only fails when b is larger than 546. BZZZTTTT!!!!!!! FAIL!!!!! So the C compiler must give up and use a multiply instruction. So there are two things that could happen here. Maybe the programmer didn’t consider the case where b might overflow - and by optimizing the code introduces a possibly subtle bug into the program…a VERY bad thing. The compiler wins.Maybe the programmer happens to KNOW that this calculation is a part of an algorithm that’s converting hours, minutes and seconds into seconds. ‘b’ is a number in minutes that is being converted into seconds - and ‘b’ can never be more than 60 because some earlier part of the program never allows that. HENCE the programmer can beat the compiler by knowing something that the compiler cannot POSSIBLY be aware of. So the programmer wins. So, yes it’s POSSIBLE for a programmer to write better assembly code than the compiler ever can. HOWEVER, in practice, even the very best human programmers can’t beat the compiler over large chunks of code…especially if they’re trying to get the work done in a sane amount of time and not introduce subtle bugs. I can write a 50 line program in 20 minutes in either C/C++ or an hour or two in efficient hand-optimized assembly language.

It explores a wide range of philosophical themes and ideas, including the nature of power, the role of fate and destiny, and the conflict between individual freedom and the common good. The novel also delves into philosophical questions about the meaning of life, the nature of consciousness, and the relationship between humanity and the environment. One of the things that makes Dune's philosophy so interesting and compelling is the way that it is integrated into the story and the characters. The novel's hero, Paul Atreides, is a complex and conflicted character who grapples with philosophical questions throughout the story, and his journey and growth are shaped by the philosophical ideas that he encounters. Additionally, Dune's philosophy is rooted in the novel's rich and detailed world-building, which creates a vivid and immersive setting for the story. The novel's diverse and complex characters, its intricate political intrigue, and its imaginative and unique setting all contribute to the novel's philosophical depth and richness. Then, Asimov's Robot series. This is an important science fiction book because it explores a wide range of themes and ideas that are relevant to the development and impact of AI. The novel's central premise is that robots are becoming increasingly intelligent and capable, and that they will eventually surpass human intelligence and capabilities. One of the key themes of the Robot series is the ethical and moral implications of AI. Asimov explores the question of whether robots should be given the same rights and protections as humans, and he considers the potential consequences of granting robots autonomy and agency. Another important theme of the Robot series is the relationship between humans and robots. Asimov explores the ways in which robots and humans interact and coexist, and he considers the potential conflicts and tensions that could arise between these two groups. Additionally, the Robot series is significant because it is one of the first works of science fiction to explore the concept of AI in a thoughtful and nuanced way. Asimov's robots are not simply machines that follow orders, but complex and intelligent beings that have their own motivations and desires. This portrayal of robots as complex and intelligent beings has influenced many other works of science fiction and has helped to shape our understanding of AI."},{"instruction":"What is the most incredible feat of human will?","output":"“Where there is a will there is a way”.

If the polynomial is equal to zero mod 20 for all values of [math]n[/math] from 0 to 19, then it's uniformly divisible by 20. But there's a \\"trick\\" here, the polynomial factors as[math](n-2)(n-1)n(n+1)(n+2)[/math]and the product of 5 consecutive numbers is always divisible by 20. Why is that? Because exactly one of the numbers will be divisible by 5, and at least one of the numbers will be divisible by 4. In fact, a stronger statement can be made, that the polynomial is always divisible by 120. That's because [math]5! = 120[/math] and in five consecutive numbers, there is at least one divisible by 5, one by 4, one by 3, and one by 2.

That is, teams had to work at getting someone open and not just try to find someone behind the arc. There were still shots from outside, of course, but there was a greater variety of shots taken during a game - shots like Chris Paul takes finding his spot for a fifteen footer - with almost a guaranteed two points. Oh, don’t get me wrong, basketball can still be exciting and watching a Steph Curry or someone free himself in a myriad of different ways to have three-point opportunity (and then hit it 40% of the time, or whatever) is pretty exciting. But it is much less so if everyone just passes the ball around the perimeter until someone is open - even players who do not have that kind of percentage - to then throw up a three and hope if it doesn’t go in there will be an offensive rebound. How many drives have we seen this year to then have the ball passed back out for a three-point attempt - not because the drive wasn’t going to be successful, but just to have a chance at the 3-pointer?

Closer to the school and so I could work. It wasn’t more than a fair sized (master) bedroom in a boarding house. That said I was there from 88~ to 91? Not really that long in the grander scheme of things, but long enough for my age at the time. I had a very limited income, and she presented me with a rent increase. 30 years ago sure, 75 a month wasn’t much, but to a student, who was trying to step ahead financially and save for college, save for well, the things a 17–21 year old saves for, I was informed of a 10–15 a week rent increase. Comparables where all the same or less… and I managed to find one that was 20 less. Better yet it was just across the road. By the time I had my first and last paid, and gave her my notice… she decided to offer to lower the rent to keep me. In my three years there, I had seen a host of others cycle through the two other rooms on my floor. Young as I was, I should have opted for stability instead, but the idea of paying THAT MUCH less for rent at the time had me caught. I mean more for me right? The landlord was a kind lady, and I really should have tried to stay. In many ways I wish I had. The new place was a disaster, I had to move again some 6–9 months later (we won’t even discuss the suspected drugs in the house). Other tenants had stolen my employment Insurance cheques, three of them. By the time all was sorted the new landlords had had enough, and “ServiceCanada” or what they WERE called at the time seemed disinterested in lending me any extra help. Moral of my story? Less rent isn’t the end all or be-all. That said, if you are happy with where you are, and the people you are dealing with, seriously consider it. While the offer to lower my rent wasn’t really “lowering” but returning it to the previous amount, it resulted in a perspective I have now. The losses I experienced in property from my next three moves over the next three years outweighed the extra bit I would have paid by staying where I was."},{"instruction":"f an atheist doesn't believe in God, do they also not believe in Satan?","output":"correct"},{"instruction":"Who is headless CMS for?","output":"Do you need to?

When an atom has a stable electron configuration, it tends to have a low electron affinity or even a zero electron affinity. Helium and magnesium both have stable electron configurations in their ground states with a filled outermost shell, so they have a zero electron affinity. Calcium, on the other hand, has an electron configuration of [Ar] 4s2, with two electrons in its outermost s-orbital. These electrons are not paired, which makes the calcium atom more reactive and less stable compared to helium and magnesium. As a result, the calcium atom has a higher electron affinity and can accept an additional electron to form a negatively charged ion. This extra electron is accommodated in the 4p orbital of calcium, resulting in a stable electron configuration. In summary, the difference in the electron affinity of helium, magnesium, and calcium is due to the differences in their electronic configurations and the stability of their outermost shells. Helium and magnesium have stable outermost shells and a zero electron affinity, while calcium has an unstable outermost shell and a higher electron affinity."},{"instruction":"What are the improvements that made Windows 10 better than Mac?","output":"The Mac vs. PC debate is one of the most controversial topics when it comes to computers. This page is meant to give a comparison between computers running Apple's macOS and those running Windows. We are looking to help users who are interested in buying a new computer, not dictating which brand is the \\"best.\\" Security Mac - Traditionally, Macs have had fewer security vulnerabilities. Also, in overall numbers, Macs receive fewer viruses than PCs running Windows. However, these numbers can be misleading as Apple's computers only account for less than 10% of the market share. Consequently, PCs will show that they not only have more vulnerabilities total, but if one were looking to infect or illegally access the most computers, PCs are the easy target. PC - As stated in the Mac section, many more people today are using computers running some version of Microsoft Windows, which makes it a smarter target for attackers. That being said, Windows computers have had more security vulnerabilities than Apple computers in the past. Bottom line: While newer versions of Windows have made significant improvements in security, most [LINKED_TEXT: malware] [URL: https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/malware.htm] is created for PCs. Therefore, you're less likely to run into security issues with a Mac. Mac wins in this category.

They are especially cheaper when it comes to customization of the computer's [LINKED_TEXT: components] [URL: https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/component.htm]. Bottom line: PC wins this category. Operating system Bottom line: This section is even as you're comparing apples and oranges. Both macOS and Windows 10 are clean, fast, highly capable operating systems. In this category, it comes down to personal preference and the user's specific needs. This category is a tie. Note: Windows is put onto PCs by multiple manufacturers, most of which add some form of [LINKED_TEXT: bloatware] [URL: https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/crapware.htm]. That being said, bloatware is removable. Either way, that doesn't mean that Windows 10 is an inferior operating system.

PC users can also install [LINKED_TEXT: Linux] [URL: https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/l/linux.htm] on their computer and use it in conjunction with Windows or as an alternative to Windows. Software Bottom line: The number of software titles for Mac has grown over the years. However, Windows dominates the computer software market share, and developers are more likely to create software for PCs because of the potential in getting a good return on their investment. Furthermore, there are 100s of free programs available for PC that are not available to Mac owners. PC wins this category.

PC - PCs have always been highly customizable, from cases, to internal components, to monitors. As such, there are many different levels of build quality. Therefore, while you can get very high-quality components for a PC, you can also get those that are poor quality. Bottom line: While the quality of PC components can be just as high, if we are to rate quality across the board, Mac wins this category - but situationally. Customization and upgrades Bottom line: Apple machines may be customized with several options. All of their computers come pre-built, and are only manufactured by Apple. PCs, however, have more pre-built options, due to a higher number of manufacturers. Furthermore, for those who like to build their own computers, the options for customization are exponentially higher. PC wins this category. Boot time Bottom line: Traditionally, Macs have been faster to boot up than PCs. However, with the advent of Window 10, PC boot times have decreased dramatically. In some cases, Windows 10 performs faster than macOS. That being said, these differences are negligible when compared to hardware. The single biggest component in reducing boot time is the type of hard drive a computer has. Both Macs and PCs have [LINKED_TEXT: SSDs] [URL: https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/ssd.htm]available to them, but those who build PCs have much faster options.

However, in recent years all devices are [LINKED_TEXT: plug-and-play] [URL: https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/pnp.htm] in Windows and no longer require the user to install drivers. This category is a tie. Gaming Bottom line: Over the years, computer game companies have shown increased support for Macs. However, as we mentioned in the security and software sections, Windows own's 90% of the market share, and as such, developers are far more likely to create games for that operating system. Additionally, because (built) PCs are much more customizable, their ability to run computer games is higher. Except the Mac Pro, there aren't any Macs that can keep up with a PC running a mid-range [LINKED_TEXT: graphics card] [URL: https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/v/video-card.htm]. PC wins this category. Repair Costs Bottom line: Apple strives to make their Mac product line as sleek and compact as possible. To do so, they continue to further integrate their parts. Thus, when their desktop computers need to be repaired, they usually require more than one part to be replaced. Most PCs, on the other hand have easy access to any part of the computer by removing a side panel. Laptop repair costs between the two platforms would be more similar, but Mac is still more expensive. PC wins this category.

Better Call Saul series finale spoilers follow. 0:00 Better Call Saul is an AMC television drama series created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould. It is a prequel and spin-off of Gilligan's previous series Breaking Bad. The first season premiered on February 8, 2015. The show's 10-episode second season premiered on February 15, 2016. The series has been renewed for a 10-episode third season, which will air in 2017. If you're a fan of Breaking Bad, then you'll definitely want to watch Better Call Saul.

We've got you covered with a complete explanation of the events of the finale and what it all means for Saul's character. Read on for all the details! The series finale of #bettercallsaul ended with a major twist that left fans wondering what will happen to Saul Goodman in the future. In the final scene, Saul (played by Bob Odenkirk) is seen working in a Cinnabon in a mall, years after the events of the show. What happened to him in the intervening years? And what does this mean for his future? [Better Call Saul] came to a close with an ending that left many viewers wondering what happened to Saul. In the series finale, we see Saul finally get the closure he needs and find out what happened to him. Read more to find out. 5:00 Saul #Goodman finally got his comeuppance in the series finale of Better Call Saul. Here's a look at what happened to him and what it all means. Well, here we are. After six #seasons and 63 episodes, Better Call Saul has come to an end with a heartbreaking finale, 'Saul Gone', that not only wraps up the storyline of our favorite con man/lawyer/fugitive but even neatly ties in plot threads from the show it was originally spun from, #breakingbad . We first met morally ambiguous Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) back in season two of Breaking Bad, but Better Call Saul revealed that Saul began life as Jimmy McGill, a struggling lawyer living in the shadow of his highly accomplished brother Chuck (Michael McKean). The series also showed us just what happened to Saul/Jimmy after his association with Walter White (Bryan Cranston) – he fled to Omaha under a new identity (Gene) and worked as a baker at a shopping-mall Cinnabon – and this final episode brings all three of his personae together as Jimmy’s, Gene’s and Saul’s worlds collide. While the penultimate episode ended with Gene’s true identity, being discovered by feisty Marion (Carol Burnett), who used her medical-alert alarm to notify police, 'Saul Gone' begins with a flashback of Mike (Jonathan Banks) and Saul out in the desert, stranded (as they were in season five’s episode 'Bagman') with 7 million in canvas bags. If Mike could use the money to build a time machine to go back in time, where would he go, asks Saul as they sit in the baking sun. #Mike immediately picks a date he regrets (when he took his first bribe as a cop) as a moment he could go back and change, while Saul’s choice, just involves a way of making money. 8:45 It’s one of a handful of flashback moments in the episode that serve as testimony to Saul/Jimmy’s character – there’s also one with Walter and one with Chuck (keep your eyes peeled for the book he is reading in that one). By this point in time, was he really so far gone from his true self that money was all that mattered? We’re then whipped back to the present, with #Saul/Gene running away from Marion’s house, in an attempt to evade the police, his small shoebox of treasures (some cash, a few #diamonds and that useful Ed’s vacuum repair phone number that would lead to another new identity and location for our fugitive) under his arm. There’s no escape this time, however, and #saulgoodman is found hiding in a dumpster by the cops and arrested. \\"This is how they get you,\\" mutters Saul in his cell, before he hatches a plan that involves hiring his old legal nemesis, former Albuquerque DA Bill Oakley, as his lawyer to negotiate a deal with the various authorities."},{"instruction":"My partner of one month doesn’t like my therapy dog of 10 years.

The spine is a complex and congested collection of joints, nerves, muscles and blood vessels. Thus, there are many structures that can create pain if you move the wrong way, experience trauma or over-stress the area. However, lower back pain (even when severe) can fade away quickly without treatment — often within a few days. This is because the body has a powerful ability to heal and most back pain is due to being a little \\"out of whack\\" instead of damaged. Be patient if you feel lower back pain, stop any aggravating activities and see if it fades away on its own. Complete bed rest is no longer recommended for most types of lower back pain. The medical consensus is that at least some light exercise (walking, stair climbing) is helpful for lumbar pain because it stimulates blood flow and can help \\"loosen\\" or \\"unjam\\" any irritated spinal joints or nerves. If your lower back pain is caused from exercising at the gym, then maybe you're working out too hard or with bad form — ask a personal trainer for advice. If your lower back pain is work related, speak to your boss about changing to lighter work duties or altering your work area — a cushioned mat for underneath your feet or a chair with lumbar support, for examples. 2. Use cold therapy for acute low back pain. While you're resting your lower back and being patient for a few days, consider applying cold therapy. Applying ice or frozen gel packs to any acute (sudden or new) musculoskeletal injury is effective because it numbs the pain and reduces inflammation. Crushed ice, ice cubes, cold gel packs or a bag of frozen veggies should be applied to the most painful area of your low back for between 10 – 15 minutes every hour, until the discomfort starts to fade away. Once improved, reduce the frequency to three times per day. Always wrap anything frozen in a thin cloth before applying it to your lower back in order to prevent frostbite or skin irritation. Compressing the cold therapy against your lower back with an elastic bandage or support can also help prevent inflammation from building up. Remember that cold therapy is usually not appropriate for chronic (long term) back pain because it can aggravate symptoms — moist heat often provides more relief. 3. Apply moist heat to chronic lower back pain. If your low back pain is chronic and has bothered you on and off for many months or years, then applying moist heat is likely better because it promotes blood flow and relaxes tight muscles and other soft tissues. A good source of moist heat is microwavable herbal bags, especially the ones infused with relaxing aromatherapy, such as lavender. Put the bag in the microwave for a couple of minutes, then apply it to your lower back while sitting or lying down for about 20 minutes. Cover the bag with a towel to insulate it and prevent heat loss too quickly. As an alternative, soak your lower back in a warm Epsom salt bath for at least 20 minutes a few times a day until your symptoms fade away. Epsom salt contains magnesium, which relaxes muscles and reduces swelling. Don't make your bath water too hot so that it scalds you and remember to keep well hydrated — warm salt baths pull fluid from your skin and can dehydrate you. Applying moist heat or soaking in a warm salt bath is usually not recommended for acute back pain because it increases blood flow and tends to promote inflammation. 4. Take over-the-counter (OTC) medications. OTC non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve) or aspirin can be effective short-term solutions for acute lower back pain because they reduce inflammation and pain. On the other hand, chronic lower back pain may be better served by taking OTC painkillers, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), because they alter the way your brain perceives pain. NSAIDs can be harmful to your stomach and kidneys if taken in large doses or for long periods of time (more than a few months), so be cautious and read labels carefully. Acetaminophen is not so hard on your stomach and kidneys, but it can damage your liver, so don't overdo it. Another way of relieving low back pain, but without the risk of stomach, kidney or liver irritation, is applying a cream or gel that contains NSAIDs, acetaminophen or natural analgesics such as menthol and capsaicin. 5. Change your sleeping position. Your sleeping position and/or sleeping environment may be contributing to or causing your lower back pain. For example, sleeping on your stomach can cause too much of an arch in your low back, which compresses and irritates spinal joints and nerves. The best sleeping positions for your lower back are the recumbent position (on your side similar to the fetal position with your hips and knees bent) and the supine position (on your back with your legs elevated by a pillow). Both of these positions take pressure off your lower back joints and reduces the chances of irritation / pain. Changing your sleeping environment usually means making sure what you sleep on is supportive for your spine. In general, beds that are too soft tend to promote back pain, whereas firmer orthopedic beds tend to reduce the incidence of lower back pain. Everyone's a little different, so a good way to judge your bed is if you're waking up sore or not. If you wake up sore, then your sleeping position/environment is an aggravating factor. If you're more sore at the end of the day, then it's likely your job/activities/exercising is to blame. Keep in mind that most foam and spring mattresses only last about 10 years with constant use, although it depends on your weight. Rotate and flip your mattress on a regular basis (every time you wash your sheets) to increase its longevity. 6. Improve your posture. Too much slouching while you sit and stand can increase the strain on your low back and lead to irritation or pain. Improving your posture can help reduce back strain and relieve existing back aches. In fact, improving your posture can also help prevent recurrence of lower back pain. However, improving your posture is a difficult task that requires daily effort and dedication. Strengthening your core muscles is a good strategy to help improve your posture. Core muscles are those in your low back, lower abdomen and pelvis — they all connect to your spine and/or pelvis in some way to help hold your body upright. To maintain good posture while standing: stand with your weight distributed over both feet and avoid locking your knees. Tighten your stomach and buttock muscles to keep your back straight. Wear supportive shoes and alleviate muscle fatigue by periodically resting one foot on a footstool. To maintain good posture while sitting: choose a firm chair, preferably one with armrests. Keep your upper back straight, but your shoulders relaxed. A small cushion placed behind your lower back can help maintain the natural curve of your lower back. Keep your feet flat on the floor, using a footstool if necessary. It can be helpful to set an alarm on your phone or use an app to remind you throughout the day to check and correct your posture. 7. Make sure you are using safe lifting techniques. Though there is some disagreement about the best way to lift, as it varies depending on the circumstances, but there are a few basic rules you should try to follow. Test the weight of the load so you are not surprised by and unexpectedly heavy or shifting load. If the load is too heavy, ask for help. Stand as close to the load as possible before lifting, and keep it as close to your body as you can when you are carrying. Do not twist, stretch, or turn at the waist — if you need to turn, do so with your entire body. Appropriate lifting posture may include a squat lift (bending at the knees and hips while keeping your back straight), a stoop lift (keeping your legs straight while bending your back), or a freestyle lift (a semi-squat that allows you to rest the load on your thighs). Method 2 of 3:Getting Alternative Back Treatments1. Make an appointment with a chiropractor. Chiropractors are doctors who specialize in the spine and other joints. They are trained to treat back problems in natural ways, such as with manual spinal manipulation. Manual manipulation, also called a spinal adjustment, is used to unjam or reposition spinal joints that are slightly misaligned, which triggers inflammation and sharp pain. A single spinal adjustment can sometimes significantly relieve your lower back pain, but usually it takes three to five treatments to really feel much better. Keep in mind that your health insurance may not cover chiropractic care. Chiropractors also use therapies meant more for muscle strains and ligament sprains, which may be more appropriate for your lower back issue. Electronic muscle stimulation, therapeutic ultrasound and TENS treatments are examples of such therapies. Tractioning or stretching your spine with an inversion table can also help lower back pain. Some chiropractors use inversion tables, which allows you to recline your upper body and enlist the help of gravity to decompress your spine. 2. Get a lower back massage As noted above, not all lower back injuries are joint related. Many are related to muscle pulls or strains. A pulled muscle happens when the small muscle fibers tear, which causes pain, inflammation and muscle guarding or spasms. Thus, a deep tissue massage can be great for mild-to-moderate strains because it calms muscle spasms, reduces inflammation and promotes relaxation. Start with a 30 minute massage from a licensed massage therapist, focusing on your lower lumbar spine and pelvis. A single 30-minute massage session may be enough to soothe your lower back pain, but it often takes a few more sessions to see significant results. For chronic back pain, consider increasing your sessions to an hour and include some mid back and/or leg work also. Drink lots of purified water after any massage in order to flush out inflammatory by-products from your body. Failure to do so might lead to muscle soreness, a headache or some mild nausea. As an alternative to a professional massage, place a tennis ball underneath your low back and roll on it slowly for 15 minutes a few times daily until the pain fades away. 3. Try some acupuncture therapy. Acupuncture is an ancient Chinese healing art that involves sticking thin needles into specific points within your skin in efforts to reduce pain and inflammation. Acupuncture for lower back pain can be very helpful, especially if it's done when your symptoms are acute (fairly new). Acupuncture apparently works by triggering the release of many substances, including endorphins and serotonin, which act to eliminate the sensation of pain. There is some research evidence that acupuncture really helps chronic lower back pain, but your results may vary. Acupuncture points that provide back pain relief are not all located close to where you feel the pain — some are in distant areas, such as your hand. Acupuncture is now practiced by many health professionals — whoever you choose should be certified by the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. 4. Consider cognitive-behavioral therapy. Method 3 of 3:Getting Medical Treatments for Your Back If patience, basic home care and alternative therapies are not real helpful in alleviating your lower back pain, then make an appointment with your doctor. They will examine you to see if your pain is caused by a serious spinal issue: herniated spinal disc, entrapped (pinched) nerve, bone infection (osteomyelitis), osteoporosis, stress fracture, advanced arthritis or cancer. For pain control, your doctor can prescribe stronger NSAIDs or painkillers. X-rays, bone scans, MRI, CT scans and nerve conductance studies are all methods of viewing and diagnosing spinal problems. You may also be sent for a blood test in order to see if you have rheumatoid arthritis or a spinal infection (osteomyelitis or meningitis). You may ultimately be referred to a medical specialist (orthopedist, neurologist, rheumatologist) to better figure out your lower back problem. 2. Get a physical therapy referral. If your lower back pain is chronic (bothering you for many months or years) and related to weak muscles, bad posture and/or degenerative conditions (\\"wear and tear\\" osteoarthritis), you should consider spinal rehabilitation therapy — you'll likely need a referral from your doctor. A physiotherapist can teach you specific stretches and strengthening exercises for your lower lumbar spine, which can relieve pain with time. Physical therapy is usually recommended 3x per week for 4-8 weeks to make a significant impact on chronic lower back issues. For spinal rehabilitation, physiotherapists tend to use a variety of exercise balls, weighted medicine balls, elastic tension bands, electronic muscle stimulation and/or therapeutic ultrasound devices. Effective strengthening exercises that you can do on your own for your lower back muscles include: swimming, rowing, certain yoga positions and back extensions. 3. Try myofascial trigger point therapy. Your back pain may be related to muscle injury or strain at a trigger point, which can lead to referred pain, or pain that extends to another area. So, though you may be experiencing pain in your lower back, the trigger point may be located elsewhere on your body. Locate a practitioner who is trained to identify and treat myofascial pain. He may use a variety of techniques to release the trigger point. 4. Consider a steroid injection for your pain. If stronger prescription drugs and/or back rehabilitation don't prove effective, then an injection of corticosteroid medicine into the joints, muscles, tendons or ligaments of your low can quickly reduce inflammation and pain, and allow better movement. Corticosteroids are based on natural human hormones, which have strong and quick-acting anti-inflammatory properties. The most common ones used by doctors are called prednisolone, dexamethasone and triamcinolone. Your family doctor will likely refer you to a back specialist (orthopedist) for the injection if she thinks it will help. Potential side effects of getting steroid injections include: local infection, excessive bleeding, tendon weakening, muscle atrophy, nerve irritation / damage, and reduced immune system function. Pain relief from steroid injections can last anywhere from a few weeks to many months. Doctors don't like to give more than two injections per year. If corticosteroid injections don't give much relief for your lower back pain, then an operation (there's many different surgical procedures) should be explored with your doctor as a last resort."},{"instruction":"Why aren't bullets sharp?","output":"Bullets “flatten” as they reach their destination after being fired from a weapon.

A proxy can be defined as software that makes requests to the server on behalf of the clients. In simple words, the proxy sits between the clients and the servers. Any request from the user first goes through the proxy and then reaches the server. This is also known as \\"forward proxy\\". The system or router on which this software sits is known as a Proxy Server. How does a proxy work? As mentioned, proxies are an intermediary that sits between a user's browser and a website, routing the requests through their own machine. It can be thought of as if proxies act as a filter between users and the server. Any request from the user first goes through the proxy and then reaches the server. They also provide a level of anonymity, often required by people who do not want their browsing history to be tracked by their ISPs. Proxies are also used to allow users to access sites they would not normally be able to reach. If you want to know more about a proxy, checkout this article titled - “What is a Proxy?

MSc in Economics Pros:Economics is a versatile subject with many different career options.The MSc in Economics program at BITS Pilani is well-regarded.There are many opportunities for research and development in economics at BITS Pilani.Cons:Economics is not as technical as engineering, so it may not be a good fit for you if you are interested in a more hands-on career.The job market for economics graduates can be competitive. Ultimately, the decision of which program to choose depends on what you are looking for in an education and a career. If you are interested in a challenging and technical engineering education, then EEE at BITS Pilani may be a better choice for you. If you are interested in a more versatile and less technical education with more career options, then an MSc in Economics may be a better choice for you. Here are some additional factors to consider when making your decision: Your interests: Which subject are you more interested in? Engineering or economics?Your career goals: What do you want to do after you graduate? Do you want to work in engineering or economics?Your personality: Which type of education and career do you think you would be more suited for? A challenging and technical education or a more versatile and less technical education? I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions. As for your BITSAT score of 240, it is a good score, but it is not as high as the cutoff for EEE at BITS Pilani. However, you should still apply to EEE at BITS Pilani, as there is always a chance that you will be admitted. If you are not admitted to EEE, you could consider applying to the MSc in Economics program at BITS Pilani. I also want to mention that your BITSAT score does not necessarily reflect your intelligence or your ability to succeed in engineering or economics. There are many factors that contribute to a person's success in college, including their hard work, their dedication, and their passion for their studies.

I’ve been reading a lot of top posts before writing my own answers. Those suggested that there was a good interaction between users and people seemed to react to each other’s comments and questions like in a real discussion. Turns out it is just for top posts. I was kind of imagining that someone who wrote a question is genuinely interested in an answer and would engage with those who gave the answers. At least for now, it seems like nobody cares if you answer something or not. Your answer is just basically out there like a tweet or a blog post waiting to be discovered by someone who might react. Quite pointless. Even on normal message boards like Stack Overflow you can usually get some answers and can discuss problems. Here you answer something and that’s it. I might as well write them on a wall and wait for someone to write something next to it. As soon as I started writing, Quora started to bombard me with answer requests. Questions started to multiply. The quality of the questions are shockingly low, repetitive and basically meaningless. There are a lot of interesting questions but again it seems like the original poster is not really interested in an answer. Others are just meaningless. It’s like scavenging in an upper class rubbish heap. There are quality things mixed in worthless rubbish. There are so many repetitive questions, with all kinds of variations that it starts to look like a postmodern novel: “What does an IQ of 110 mean?” “What does an IQ of 120 mean?” “Is an IQ of 130 high?” “Can I be a genius if my IQ is only 110?” “What does an IQ of XYZ mean?” Again many questions are clearly pointless asking for facts you can look up on Google in a second. It seems that the reason for all this is a mistaken strategy move and misaligned incentives, but something needs to be done. Maybe, there should be two Quoras: QuoraIntellectual and QuoraLite. One could choose which they are mainly interested in and then receive questions only from that part. Perhaps you can ask for a not-too high subscription fee for the quality QuoraIntellectual.

Indeed, if A is a finite abelian group of order n then [math]mathbb CA cong mathbb C^n[/math] as [math]mathbb C[/math]-algebras. This can be seen as a consequence of some high-powered theorems in Representation Theory (Wedderburn’s Theorem, Maschke’s Theorem), but let’s go for an explicit isomorphism without invoking any high-powered stuff. We’ll start with [math]A=mathbb Z_4[/math] and then comment on how to generalize. Okay, so let [math]A={a,a^2,a^3,a^4=1}[/math]. Then [math]mathbb CA={c_0+c_1a+c_2a^2+c_3a^3|c_0,ldots,c_3inmathbb C}.[/math] If we’re looking for an explicit isomorphism into [math]mathbb C^4[/math], then the image of a has to be some [math]vinmathbb C^4[/math] such that [math]v^4=1[/math] and [math]{1,v,v^2,v^3}[/math] is a linearly independent set. (Note: this 1 stands for [math](1,1,1,1)[/math], the multiplicative identity of [math]mathbb C^4[/math]). In fact, if we can find any such element v, then [math]amapsto v[/math] extends uniquely to an isomorphism. (Proof: exercise.) So let’s start looking for such a [math]v=(v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4)[/math]. Since [math]v^4=1[/math], that means each [math]v_i[/math] is a 4th root of unity. Furthermore, if [math]v_i=v_j[/math] for any [math]ine j[/math], then [math]{1,v,v^2,v^3}[/math] would be a linearly dependent set because it is contained in the 3-dimensional subspace consisting of vectors whose i-th coordinate equals the j-th coordinate. Thus [math]v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4[/math] must equal the fourth roots of unity in some order. Clearly the order doesn’t matter so let’s just set [math]v=(1,i,-1,-i)[/math]. And there you have it! All we have to do now is check that the powers of v are linearly independent. As a matter of fact, they are orthogonal, in other words [math]X=[1|v|v^2|v^3]=left[begin{array}{cccc}1&1&1&11&i&-1&-i1&-1&1&-11&-i&-1&iend{array}right][/math] satisfies [math]X^*X=4I[/math]. This can be verified by a direct calculation, but I’ll let you prove that that this is always true for nth roots of unity, not only n=4. Ok, so to sum up: we chose an isomorphism satisfying [math]amapsto (1,i,-1,-i)[/math] and by linearity, it follows that the full explicit isomorphism is [math]c_0+c_1a+c_2a^2+c_3a^3mapsto (c_0+c_1+c_2+c_3,c_0+ic_1-c_2-ic_3,c_0-c_1+c_2-c_3,c_0-ic_1-c_2+ic_3).[/math] The easiest proof that this is an isomorphism is not to verify directly that it preserves sums and products, but rather the proof outlined above, which shows that if [math]Z_n[/math] is generated by a, then [math]amapsto (1,omega,ldots,omega^{n-1})[/math] extends to an isomorphism [math]mathbb CZ_nmapsto mathbb C^n[/math] where [math]omega[/math] is a primitive nth root of unity. As for extending this to all finite abelian groups, we can do so using the fact that every finite abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups, and that [math]mathbb C(Gtimes H)cong mathbb CGotimesmathbb CH.[/math]"},{"instruction":"there an affordable webbased small business accounting software?","output":"Here's an opinion that may not be popular, but I think is undoubtedly true: All web-based small business accounting software is affordable. Extremely affordable, in fact. The returns from accounting software dwarf the costs in almost any conceivable situation. And, the math to arrive at that conclusion is actually surprisingly straightforward. Savings: Almost any accounting software will provide basic functions like P&L reporting, balance sheets, invoicing, purchasing, accounts receivable, and billing. What's the difference in the amount of time doing these tasks with software versus manual processes? It depends, but you're probably talking minimum 5 hours a month--and probably more reasonably more like a difference of 10, 20, or 50 hours a month. So, what's the value of that time savings? Even super conservatively valuing that time at just 15/hour, that's a monthly labor savings of between 150 and 750. Not bad. Costs: Now compare the savings to the costs. For a small business (say 1-10 employees), web accounting software is probably going to be less than you pay for cable television every month. Solutions run from 20/mo to maybe 200/mo on the very top-end for this particular market. So, the costs of SaaS accounting software are much smaller than the savings generated. And that's before you even consider soft-cost type savings coming from improvements in customer satisfaction through better billing/servicee or better decision-making based on better financial reporting. So, I think the question really here is, what's the best solution for your particular needs? That's a much more complicated question actually. Things like your needs for access-based user control, particular invoicing method, reporting requirements, payroll needs, etc will determine which product is the best solution for you--and the most affordable. There are some great options listed in other answers already, so I won't rehash them. However, there's another option, if you don't want to spend time sorting through all those.

I was in the middle seat sitting up on my knees talking to the person sitting behind me (my cousin) when all of a sudden he just fell asleep as well as the 2 kids sitting next to him I looked down at the kid sitting next to me and he was also asleep then the van was upside down and I was thrown to the ceiling, it was rightside up again and I was slammed back into the seat, and lastly it was upside down again and this time it hit hard. I had glass in my mouth and felt like every bone in my body was broken, but I sat up after a minute and watched someone crawl out through the window so I followed them, when I got out I was in ankle deep water, we had landed in a ditch at the base of a hill that the road was on. I couldnt see the person I had followed out of the wreckage but I found a strange doll like a hound and climbed the hill (losing my shoe in the process) and stood in 70 mph traffic and 2 cars slammed on their brakes to avoid me, a woman stepped out of the first car and was screaming her head off at me before she realized I was all tore up and there was a van in the ditch then she immediately ran back to her car and pulled out a car-phone. Later at the hospital numerous doctors and nurses asked me to repeat this story over and over and over again I had to tell this story. It wasnt until later that I found out Everyone else was trapped in the van with broken bones and 1 kid died. I was the only person who escaped of my own power and I didnt have a scratch on me. I still dont know who or what it was I followed out of the broken window.

Your hard disk drives and the SSDs of the same form factor connect to the sata port on the motherboard that then runs through the sata bus to the motherboard. For the last few years there has also been M2 ports.Depending on the board the M2 port can either tie into the SATA bus OR the pci-e bus (usually x4 lanes). Thus there are currently 3 common types of SSDs:1) SSDs similar in size and shape to a 2.5″ hard drive, and it has a sata port2) M2 SATA SSDs chip that uses the SATA bus3) M2 NVMe SSDsNot as common as they used to be but worth noting there is also SSD cards that go into the pci-e ports In specs an nVMe drive is much faster than a SATA drive. SATA maxes out at 6gbps or 750 MBps (8 megabits per second = 1 megaByte per second). Pci-e X4 (what NVMe drives use) maxes out at 4 GBps.While real world human perception can be marginal between say an M.2 SATA Samsung 860 EVO and an NVMe 960/970 Evo, but if you run crystaldisk or other benchmarks you will see that the drive well exceeds the max of SATA bus.

Want to make a career out of it? Well, then forensic sciences courses are what you need to explore. Forensic science is a fascinating subject and holds the attention of many. It is used across the globe to enforce criminal laws and regulations and to resolve civil disputes. Profile of a Forensic Expert Essentially a crime-lab based profession, the job of a forensic scientist is to collect, preserve, examine, collate and analyse the physical evidence during an investigation. Methodical, thorough, accurate and unbiased are the essential requisites in a forensic expert. [LINKED_TEXT: Forensic Science Courses] [URL: https://www.irte.com/forensic-science] in India Forensic science draws upon various branches of science including chemistry, biology, physics, geology, psychology etc., with its focus being on the identification and evaluation of physical evidence. This makes it an ideal choice for a science student interested in studying forensics. Various government and private universities, colleges and institutes in India offer multiple courses in this field – certificate, bachelor and masters’ courses in forensic science. One can even go for a doctorate post getting the masters’. The need, however, remains for quality education, training and research in Forensic Science. To bridge this gap IRTE, (Institute of Road Traffic Education) has launched a masters programme in Forensic Science. The M.Sc. programme from IRTE will strive to impart relevant, meaningful and quality education that will focus not only to road crash investigation but also to crime at large. Affiliated to Maharishi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak, Haryana, the course at IRTE lays emphasis on a practical approach in all domains of forensic science. Career Opportunities after a Forensic Sciences Course Jobs in various government & private sectors in forensic and diagnostic labs, intelligence bureau, police department, investigative agencies, banks, colleges, to name a few are there for the taking after getting the required qualification from a good institution. So, if the forensics field thrills you, is calling out to you, time to explore it. Once you have completed your Masters in forensic science, there are plenty of career opportunities in the field. So far most jobs were in the government sector, but increasingly some private sector organisations are also offering jobs to people with degrees in forensic sciences. The leading employers of people with degrees in forensic sciences are various law enforcement agencies such as police, the legal system, the investigative services of the central government and state governments. Intelligence Bureau (IB), Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI), and the police department absorb most of those who have studied forensic sciences. In the private sector, forensic scientists are employed by private security and investigating agencies, psychiatric and substance abuse hospitals and medical and diagnostic laboratories. So a bright future awaits those with a degree in forensic sciences from a good institute.

There are some details within it that make me wonder. Gen 1:6 “And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.” -AV Not a lot of information but it does indicate the firmament (old English for atmosphere) between 2 waters. Does that mean somewhere up above the atmosphere there was another water supply? Was it in vapour or water’s constituents in ionized form? What was the ratio between surface water and that above the firmament? It’s not there now so impossible to know. Psalm 104:6 “Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains. 7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away. 8 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them. 9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.” -AV Again this states a water supply above the mountains. How high up it doesn’t say nor how much. Verse 9 in other translations says - “Mountains ascended and valleys descended” and “The mountains rose, the valleys sank down” This describes a geologic process of attaining Isostatic Equilibrium as the earth is more like a water-bed with high viscosity. The sudden introduction of the weight of the water upset this balance and thus the earth spent about a year for dry land to appear again. Even now there are seamounts with what are thought to be beaches 250 metres below the surface indicating much water has been introduced to the system. Many feel this is from the melting Ice Age 10K BP but alternatively ‘celestial water’ so to speak. When it did fall, was it like rain or a tsunami? The most northerly islands of the Canadian Arctic archipelago have trees over a metre in diameter that appear to have been snapped off with the trunks still in the ground. A helicopter pilot many years ago, before the problems of global warming, landed and made a fire from the wood, which meant it was not fossilized but mummified. Some have arrived at the age of 45 million years but an RC14 test gave an estimate of 30K years. This unfortunate little bit of information is rarely reported. [LINKED_TEXT: The Fossilized Forest Of Axel Heiberg IslandThe Fossilized Forest Of Axel Heiberg Island By Isabella Laird, Administrative and Communications Assistant, Beaty Biodiversity Museum on August 30, 2017 Photo Credit: Isabella Laird The above picture is wood from a tree that grew on Axel Heiberg island , which is an island in the arctic region of Canada. It’s the wood of a Dawn Redwood ( Metasequoia ). How old do you think it is? 11 years old? 1000 years old? Would you believe that it’s 45 million years old? Photo Credit: Isabella Laird 45 million years ago during the Eocene era, the world was a very different place. It was fairly warm, and at the poles, practically tropical; it would be a similar climate to today’s Florida. About 50 years ago, a fossilized forest was found on the island with wood that was so well preserved and had so much original organic material that it still could be split and burned – it may be better described as a ‘mummified forest’ . Axel Heiberg island didn’t move much from the altitude that it’s at now, so we know that this forest once grew in the arctic region, which today is classified as a polar desert. The forest was originally preserved by a “rapid burial in very fine sediments which prevented rotting and petrification”. Scientists can learn more about what the world looked like 45 million years ago from this forest, and perhaps how the future world will look. Today, Axel Heiberg island is home to only two research bases that study climate change and what different processes on the surface of mars may be like .

It strikes them as a mystery but the Bible can provide the information as to what happened. Here is another event and you realize they are getting close but still cannot see it. [LINKED_TEXT: 4.2-kiloyear event - WikipediaSevere climatic event starting around 2200 BC Global distribution of the 4.2 kiloyear event. The hatched areas were affected by wet conditions or flooding, and the dotted areas by drought or dust storms. [1] The 4.2-kiloyear (thousand years) BP aridification event (long-term drought) was one of the most severe climatic events of the Holocene epoch. [2] It defines the beginning of the current Meghalayan age in the Holocene epoch. Starting around 2200 BC, it probably lasted the entire 22nd century BC . It has been hypothesised to have caused the collapse of the Old Kingdom in Egypt as well as the Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia , and the Liangzhu culture in the lower Yangtze River area. [3] [4] The drought may also have initiated the collapse of the Indus Valley Civilisation , with some of its population moving southeastward to follow the movement of their desired habitat, [5] as well as the migration of Indo-European-speaking people into India . [6] Some scientists disagree with that conclusion, citing evidence that the event was not a global drought and did not happen in a clear timeline. [7] Evidence [ edit ] Central Greenland reconstructed temperature. Unlike the 8.2-kiloyear event , the 4.2-kiloyear event has no prominent signal in the Gisp2 ice core that has an onset at 4.2 ka BP. [ citation needed ] A phase of intense aridity about 4.2 ka BP is recorded across North Africa , [8] the Middle East , [9] the Red Sea , [10] the Arabian Peninsula , [11] the Indian subcontinent , [5] and midcontinental North America . [12] Glaciers throughout the mountain ranges of western Canada advanced about that time. [13] Evidence has also been found in an Italian cave flowstone , [14] the Kilimanjaro ice sheet, [15] and in Andean glacier ice. [16] The onset of the aridification in Mesopotamia in about 4100 BP also coincided with a cooling event in the North Atlantic , known as Bond event 3. [2] [17] [18] Despite the geographic diversity of these examples, evidence for the 4.2 kyr event in Northern Europe is ambiguous, which suggests that the origins and effects of the event are spatially complex. [19] In 2018, the International Commission on Stratigraphy divided the Holocene epoch into three periods, [20] with the late Holocene from approximately 2250 BC onwards designated as the Meghalayan stage/age . [21] The boundary stratotype is a speleothem in Mawmluh cave in India, [22] and the global auxiliary stratotype is an ice core from Mount Logan in Canada. [23] However, justification for this division is debated as the event was not a global drought and did not happen within a clear timeframe. Jessica Tierney , a paleoclimatologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson , states that proponents of the new partitioning mistakenly \\"lumped together evidence of other droughts and wet periods, sometimes centuries away from the event.\\" [7] Effects [ edit ] Ireland [ edit ] In Ireland , there is little definitive record of the 4.2-kiloyear event outside of a brief isothttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4.2-kiloyear_event] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4.2-kiloyear_event]Before that Africa looked like this.

Depression is when your not getting what You want out of life. I'm going to write what I know about Happiness. Happiness is freedom. Freedom comes from having courage. “The only real Prison is Fear, and the only real freedom is freedom is freedom from fear”. Can't spell or remember the Authors name but that's literally my Life in A nutshell. In Mythology before You enter A shrine there will be two Cherubim blocking the way. They represent fear and desire. So what I've learned that it's saying is in order to experience that moment of bliss/nirvana in our lives You must transcend or get past fear and desire. In my own life it's jiu-jitsu. Ive done it for over 20 Years. My life Is absolutely unbelievable when I'm doing it. I'm watching film everyday and tweaking all the little things I could have done better after Grappling. Then it's playing Guitar and recording Music. I used to practice over 5 hours a day for Years straight. Pretty much learned every song I ever really wanted to. So from my own experience being happy is going forward in spite of fear. In spite of self doubt. In spite of criticism from others. Going forward and seeing tangible results was and is the key for Me. Worst thing A person can do is either wait for the ‘right’ time to get going or allow themselves to get pinned down by someone else's thoughts and be stuck and afraid to act or accomplish whatever it is they want to accomplish. In A Nutshell from my experience happiness was having A purpose. A Goal. Something to work toward and see tangible results. Overcoming your own fears and limitations. In this social media Age people think they will be happy when they date or marry the beautiful woman or buy the expensive car. All that is fleeting. So when they chase those Dragons that A Capitalistic Society hopes you will chase they become disillusioned. The old saying happiness comes from within The longer You live the more You will see that is true. Being independent. Not needing anything from anyone. Taking full responsibility for your own happiness. Acting in spite of self doubt and fear. Seeing tangible results for your efforts. Being honest with yourself when you fail and don't Blame anyone else. And most definitely detatch yourself from mainstream social media. Don't get caught up in that Rat race. Center yourself. Try to discover what it is that You REALLY want then take steps everyday to make that a reality. It's the journey not the destination.

College is a place where all different types of people meet to learn a higher education, party together, make new friends, and to become overall better versions of themselves. When it comes to buisness on a small scale the first step is to look at who your potential customers are. With so many different types of people and things to do the options are endless. If I were to start a buisness, it would be in hustling candy and other snacking foods from class to class. Now here me out, I know this sounds like it won’t be long term profitable/too much work, but after you get past that mental block, this is when you begin to pay off your college loans. Step 1. Do some research, When it comes to selling such a broad catagory of foods and candies it can be hard to pick what to carry with you to sell. In my experience, candies such as gummy bears, chocolate bars, and jelly beans tend to work best. Go online and make a bulk purchase of about 10–15 worth of each of these things. Wait for the arrival then read step 2! Step 2. Find a extra backpack, stuff it, and get to selling. With candies and such products your going to want a good profit margin due to how cheap people are when it comes to buying snacks like these. When selling, make sure to be making at least 42–46% profit on each candy that you sell. Although this may sound a bit excessive from a reading article standpoint, when you are buying these candies in bulk and only selling 42–46% profit on each one, your fellow students will not see this as to expensive. For example, I buy a pack of 100 milk way bars for 120. By the end of the week I will have sold each bar for 2 and made a large profit of 80 off very little work. As you begin to do this with different products you will notice your popularity increasing, refer to step 3. Step 3. Ramp up amount in bulk purchases and raise profit margins By now, your probably thinking hey, this Quora guy made this whole buisness thing so simple, but how do I make more then just 80 from 100 chocolate bars? Well, it’s simple, as you are now notoriously known as the provider of snacks and foods to fellow classmates, you know can begin to ramp up the amount of candy you are selling. Instead of running out of candy on a daily basis, you now carry 2 or even three backpacks of candy with you, strategically pack them to hold a ton of candy, and sell larger amounts during the day. Classmates will begin hearing from other classmates where they get all there munchies during class and you will run out of candy even before the end of the day. To avoid this, buy 200–400 chocolates and candies at a time, charging the same price, but because your buying in such bulk, your profit will steadily increase to 50–60%. Step 4. Laugh at how much candies and chocolate you have in your dorm, and how much money your making. By now you have become the well know snack provider on campus and constantly have boxes and boxes of candies and chocolates coming into your dorm and don’t know what to do with it all. You have paid off all student loans and can’t believe how successful you are from a simple Quora post. Now that you are a candy selling expert, I only ask for two things.

Being an island, the UK unsurprisingly possesses a maritime climate. Between that, and being positioned at larger latitudes, that sort of thermidity is not worth betting on having. Stranded… irm… Living, as I do, here in Hell's right armpit (VERY Right armpit, if all the Trump banners still to be seen adorning many a fence line are to be believed) daytime temps have been plus 40°C for about a month now.

I ain't similarly so evolved! I've resorted to sleeping rough. At least since I scored a hammock with an intrinsic mosquito net. So I'm sorry about y'alls heat, but be grateful the UK lacks vampire insects. I guzzle 6 litres of water daily, the majority of which is expressed via perspiration. As others have advised when contending with ambient temperatures that are greater than body temp, may I add my personal credo, which I use to remind myself to take yet another swig: Hydration is salvation. I developed pancreatitis a decade or so ago under similar meteorological conditions, initiated by quaffing entirely too little water. Too many beers, and a bunch of greezy BBQ, may also have been contributory inflammatory factors… Pancreatitis recovery was worse than the time when I had 5 vertebrae simultaneously subluxed upon decelerating from 50 miles per hour to zero in the blink of an eye. I since have read descriptions of pancreatic pain levels that have sometimes had it surpassing that of labour and childbirth. I would have to corroborate!

What are some of the main factors that allowed the Empire to become so vast?","output":"The main factor was their naval dominance. Trafalgar showed how superior the British navy was to the French one - not just in technical ability but in training and discipline. The UK had the US colonies in it’s first empire and Bengal in the start of it’s second empire. Bengal was the most profitable state in India. Having Bengal’s manpower and wealth with the UK’s naval and technological power already made the British empire after Clive’s era a superpower. Once the UK started blobbing in India, knocking out minor factions and eventually defeating the mighty Marathas (which was no easy feat btw) the UK was already the most powerful country on Earth, surpassing the Ming as can be seen in the Opium war. Once they knocked out Mysore in the south, Oudh and Delhi in the north and later the Sikh Empire of the Punjab, there was no stopping them. Taking Africa and South-East Asia with the vast military might and manpower of the UK and India in their grasp was very easy. The UK was able to take the massive resource from India, set up huge industries in the UK from the capital of it’s overseas empire and use the captive markets of it’s empire to leap-frog every other country. Could some other country have achieved what the British did? Sure. But they needed to have taken India or China first to do it. Anything less than that would not be enough to be a global superpower the way the British did.

Will the veterinarian let me put my cat down even if she is not sick?","output":"If your cat is very old and very sick then a vet might put her down, yes. That is not a free procedure either, in case your family is unaware. One visit to the vet might be enough to determine if you cat is likely to respond well to treatment or whether euthanasia is a viable option, so you cat needs that one visit anyway.

Tell your family you will repay the vet expenses the cat incurs.Alternatively, ask the vet if they will accept payments for treatment in installments, and work out something you can afford.Find a good home for the cat, making sure the new owners have the will and resources to properly look after her health.Find a good cat rescue organization, who will foster your cat until a reliable home is found for her.

Not even my so called best friend. I was always considered the odd one out. The main reason was jealousy and arrogance towards me. And it increased after SOTY trophy! So, I left school with no actual friends, who used to show that they are my friends. . And I know as I have seen this normally, one day when you actually become successful and big, people start needing you or maybe the financial help from you. The same faces who turned their back, now are ready to kneel down! Actual success brings a lot of people around you. Because you start earning money and fame when you are adult and successful! And that what matters more than anything. . The only advice I would like to give is, In your teenage don’t be so mean to someone better that you. The person you left in jealousy or arrogance Can be the same person who could have been you best friend forever. Can be the same person from whom you’ll have to ask help in need. Can be the same person who can be so heartless that they will not even recognize you. Teenage is pretty normal stage to be jealous of someone better than you, but don’t ruin friendships.

When it comes to look, durability, etc., they both have benefits over one another. Granite v/s Marble 1 Durability: [LINKED_TEXT: Granite’s] [URL: https://www.usa.rkmarblesindia.com/granite/] is comparatively more durable and hardy than marble. It is frequently compared to marble as the most resilient natural stone. It is ideal for kitchen tops since it resists heat and can readily handle hot cookware. Additionally, marble is prone to color fading and dulling with time. A stone that has lost its brilliance cannot be restored, in contrast to stains that can be. It is a permanent process and marble's main flaw. 2 Reactivity to Acidic Substance: Both natural stones are porous, but marble is more porous due to its metamorphic characteristics. As a result, marble is easily damaged by spills, especially those involving acidic liquids like fruit juices and wines. 3 Appearance: Granite and marble have very diverse looks from one another. Because feldspar, mica, and amphibole are mixed in with granite, the stone's color variety appears as speckling throughout. On the other hand, marble has veins going through it and is a greyish or cream tone. Marble veins are typically caused by contaminants like iron oxide. 4 Applications: Marble is more suited for areas with lower foot traffic, such as restrooms, whereas granite is more acceptable for kitchen counters and hallways where there is considerable foot traffic. Marble is ideal for surfaces that get less use since it has a unique, vivid appearance. 5 Cost: Due to the weight of the slabs, installation of granite and marble must be done by professionals. Marble and granite are both generally 50 to 100 in price, although high grade granite is less expensive than marble. The actual cost, however, is determined by the type of tile used, the complexity of the project, and the quality of the stone. 6 Maintenance: To stop etching and staining, sealants are used to both marble and granite. Professionals advise sealing marble twice a year, whereas once every two years is sufficient for granite. Marble requires considerably more frequent sealing. The exact need for resealing depends on how frequently the stone was cleaned and how heavily it was used."},{"instruction":"What skills will help anyone make a significantly higher salary as an employee?","output":"[1] Prove that you are the performer.

He debuted in 1948 and even in 1989, he gave hits like Lashkar. His performance as Professor Anand in the 1989 film [LINKED_TEXT: Lashkar (film)] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lashkar_(film)] was widely appreciated and was a major success at the box office. He acted opposite young actors such as Sumeet Saigal, Hemant Birje, Javed Jaffery, Sonam and Madhavi. Lashkar was his last hit film in the lead role in 1989, with him neither being producer nor director of the film. Komal Nahta recounts the tale of a person who bought the rights of a Dev Anand flick for Rajasthan some years ago. “I asked him: “Are you crazy?” His reply was: “I got to pose with Dev Anand for a photo.” Dev Anand also had the ability, uncanny for Bollywood, to keep production costs to the minimum. Never mind that he did it by casting himself and a host of newcomers. He also enjoyed a pervasive goodwill in the industry. In Chargesheet, Naseeruddin Shah and Jackie Shroff, whose career Anand launched, were there for this reason. Others like Aamir Khan (Awwal Number), Rishi Kapoor and Salman Khan (Love in Times Square) and Boman Irani (Mr Prime Minister) were also touched by his goodwill. On why Warner Brothers chose to associate with Chargesheet, his last movie that released in september, an official said: “We did it for Dev Anand.” The result is that a typical Dev Anand movie costs around Rs 2 crore compared with an average Bollywood flick that runs up to nearly Rs 15 crore. Dev Anand was also helped by the fact that there are no dearth of distributors in Bollywood unlike in Hollywood, where getting distributers is more difficult than making movies. Anand has never had trouble finding financiers, especially NRIs, who count themselves his diehard fans and still see him as a matinee idol worth their expense. “For many, he is still a living legend,” says Nahta.

Filmstars like Big B and even Sunjay Dutt and SRK and others have trouble in finding people to fund their films. That kind of popularity is unheard of. He is the biggest superstar in India, and the biggest Indian superstar in the world. Imagine, he debuted in 1948 and could make films even in 2011, the year he died, and find producers like Warner Bros for his films. Career span? 62 years! Let’s see whether SRK has a career after 42 years from his debut, which happened in 1992. By 2032, he would be nowhere. Anand could give hits even 41 years after his debut. The great Dev Anand is mimicked and made fun of for his rapid dialogue delivery, nodding and other mannerisms. But those are part of his crowd pleasing films. One has to see his range in movies like Guide, Hum Dono, Teen Deviyan, Kala Bazaar, Kala Pani, CID, Hare Rama Hare Krishna, Bullet, Paying Guest, Duniya, Mahal, House No 44 etc. He could make you cry in Guide and Tere Mere Sapne and laugh in films like Love Marriage and Tere Ghar Ke Samne. P.S: Dev Anand has also been politically active. He led a group of film personalities who stood up against the [LINKED_TEXT: Internal Emergency] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emergency_(India)] imposed by the then [LINKED_TEXT: Prime Minister of India] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India], [LINKED_TEXT: Indira Gandhi] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi].

One reason why punk rock may not be as popular as it once was could be due to changes in the music industry and the way music is consumed. With the rise of digital streaming services and social media, there is now a much wider variety of music available to listeners than ever before, and this can make it harder for any one genre to dominate the cultural conversation. Additionally, as punk rock has become more established as a genre, it may have lost some of its edge and rebelliousness that originally made it so appealing to fans. Many of the original punk rock bands and artists have since become mainstream and influential in their own right, and new punk rock bands may struggle to find a unique voice and style that sets them apart from their predecessors. However, despite these challenges, punk rock continues to thrive as a subculture and a community, with dedicated fans and musicians all over the world who continue to push the boundaries of the genre and keep it alive. While it may not be as popular or commercially successful as it once was, punk rock remains an important and influential part of music history and culture."},{"instruction":"w can a piece of paper folded 103 times be larger than the observable universe?","output":"In practice you cannot fold a piece of paper 103 times."},{"instruction":"w do you politely tell your neighbor that they are mowing their grass too short?","output":"How do I politely tell my neighbor to mind their own fucking business?

I could see him getting his powers after being constantly cut off from the net, and he closes his eyes and just imagines his facebook page… and imagines putting up posts… and when he get’s his internet back, he sees the post he imagined. He actually learns of the academy’s manipulation, and becomes more and more the moral leader of the group as he sees more and more problems. However, this starts to gnaw on him as he’s taken in by internet scams, by viruses, and by the fact that there is sick shit out there… and he can’t STOP seeing it. Eventually his friends are just trying to keep him sane and cut back on his powers so he’s not trolling the most depraved reaches of the dark web and getting constantly traumatized by it. “Why don’t I stop looking, Pan? Why can’t I stop looking at this shit?!” Snowflake. No. Scrap. This is a terrible idea. Make her a white teenaged girl that cares about EVERYTHING and who has an opinion on EVERYTHING and who voices her opinion on EVERYTHING and is offended by EVERYTHING. Worse, the more offended she is, the stronger and more unpredictable her powers become. She wants to be the leader. Not because she’s white, but because she CARES the most. And she constantly is telling Pandora her body size is fine and she’s annoyed by Screen Time fact checking some of her more outlandish claims. The fact is she’s not the leader, and eventually gets called on it, which really makes her sulk, which really makes Pandora explain that they don’t think she’s bad, but she’s not really leading anything. She just tells people stuff, and she doesn’t listen. Maybe she relaxes a little. Maybe she confessess that she just feels guilty all the time and wants to DO something to not feel like shit. Safezone. Okay, so now that we’ve ditched the psychic twins, starting Safezone out as a big black guy is fine. Now let’s make him a transperson. He’s big and black and has never been comfortable with being big and black. He doesn’t like how everyone expects him to be big and black and athletic. His mental image of Pandora is 100 pounds skinnier and way more beautiful than Pandora thinks of herself. And of course he’s targeted for grief. He doesn’t want to fight people. He just wants to be happy. One of his bullies can become a metahuman C grade villain that likes using Safezone as a punching bag. Safezone tries to ignore Snowflake, tries to protect Safeword, and tries to listen to everyone else. Also Pandora tries to hide the annoyance that even at 6′2″, Safe looks better in a dress than she does. B-Negative: Burn in a fucking fire. Are goths even still a thing? No. Replace utterly with Nyah. Nyah is an anime cat girl that used to be a pretty average white guy way into manga and anime. When his power activated, they transformed into an anime cat girl. Powers are pretty limited. Claws, reflexes, cute, mallet space, immortal (or rather, 9 lives)… also cat girl so most people either think she’s cosplaying or a freak. But as the ‘fun’ wears off, he realizes he’s basically dead to his folks, who are so estranged that he can’t even prove that he’s their son. His powers are generic. And really, he doesn’t want to be a girl anymore. He’s also trans, but trans human as well as trans sexual. He’s not even sure he wants to be a hero as the tolls start adding up. And no one takes him seriously because, well, he’s a cat girl. Like on the scale of heroes, he’s a joke. It’s like he won the lottery, spent it on 400000 tons of ice cream, and watched it all melt. What kind of powers might he have had if he wanted to be a brain surgeon? He spirals into depression and almost kills himself. Wallbreaker: What?! A sixth hero!? Of course. Wallbreaker is Joseph Rodrigo-Ortiz, a Latino guy who likes to portray himself as a cool and laid back guy, who was brought into the country illegally when he was three. Don’t cause trouble, Joseph. He’s a devout catholic… but he can’t hide the fact that he’s pissed off at the world, and especially pissed off at migrants getting arrested at the border. One of his first ‘missions’ he gets the team to do is break people out of an ICE facility who are facing deportation. It goes horribly and one of the migrants is shot in the chaos. His powers are also relatively basic. He can increase his density, and thus increase his strength and resistance to damage. When he’s in place, he can get hit by a bus and not be harmed… but of course he’s find himself embedded in the steel. He’s got super strength with no super leverage and has to be careful not to break things simply by being there. Snowflake pisses him off with her ‘It’s terrible, but-’ lines. He’s creeped out by Safezone, but wants to protect Screentime. Nyah just desperately wants to have a friend to hang out with, and he can recognize that. He thinks Pandora should stop eating so much. Eventually the team realizes that they’re scheduled for ‘genetic degradation and analysis’ and they break out of the academy and go on the run. After all, going back to their families just makes them targets."},{"instruction":"What are some first date tips?","output":"If you’re a man dating a woman, I’d highly recommend you shit test her right from the get-go. Make her wait for around 30 min. without reacting to calls or messages. If she really wants you, she’ll wait forever, women just are built like that. If she’s in for a free meal just out of boredom ‘see what happens’ then she’ll be gone after 10 min tops. Another thing you should do is to test how easy she is with her own money on the date or how open minded to changes of plan. That will give you a pretty good idea of where you stand with her. Basically if she wants you she’ll wait and stick around forever (at least an hour)+pay for shit on her own+be very open to whatever changes to the planned date schedule you make. Another point is to not misinterpret things and treat them accordingly. “I don’t kiss on the first date” or “I don’t have sex on the first date” means nothing but that she doesn’t kiss or have sex with YOU on the first date. Don’t mistaken this for a general statement, even if she disguises it as one! And don’t be a nice guy. If you like her then you push for a kiss and you push for sex after the date, WHILE RESPECTING BOUNDARIES. Women do actually like that, because it makes you masculine, they are not dumb, they know you want sex and they see right through your passive aggressive nice guy pedestalizing her as an angel with a thought process of “she is so nice and beautiful, she would never want to have sex so quickly”, because yes SHE WOULD if you’re actually THE GUY. Yeah, I know this will get a lot of hate from the usual suspects, but we men don’t have time to waste a life either.

Learn while you work from home Working from home has given us a unique advantage to develop and enhance our skills as we work. Get ahead of the competition while you can – when the world opens up, the race is only going to get even more hectic. 3 . Real-time performance tracking Online, every assignment, every project you undertake can be tracked based on a number of parameters. These detailed reports give a clear understanding of what’s going wrong, if anything, and helps to improve. 4 . Engaging & interactive With the kind of tools and technology at our disposal, online classes are more engaging and interactive than regular ones. Surveys, polls, instant quizzes – these are available across all smart devices. Makes it easier for everyone to learn! 5 .

While this is great most of the time, it breaks down when you need tight integration with the underlying hardware, ex: Disk management — serverless platforms don’t make it easy to interact with a fast persistent disk. Generally you’ll get fast temp space and slow persistent disk. But if you need both persistent and fast disk writes, you may be out of luckData / network locality — similar to above, “standard” serverless offerings don’t offer you much control over where the code runs. External resources are always a network hop away.OS optimization / tuning — now, this is breaking down with the rise of Fargate, GKE, Knative, and other serverless + container combos. But answering with respect to “pure” serverless platforms like Lambda: you don’t get control over the operating system, so the low-level fiddly optimizations you can do on a Linux VM (buffer / cache tuning, etc) aren’t available. Very high request throughput (): Lambda and Cloud Functions charge along two main vectors (with caveats around reserved capacity, etc): Price per ms * CPUPrice per request The first sounds fine at first (the raw CPU price isn’t wildly uncompetitive with a VM) — except that requests round up to the nearest 100ms. If you’re running a microservice which responds within 5ms, you’re paying 20x the nominal resource cost! Add the request price on top of that, and the fully-managed serverless solutions can get very expensive if used unwisely. If you’re running services which process thousands of requests a second, you’ll likely want to manage the infrastructure yourself (even if you end up running your own “serverless” infrastructure) Data processing / ETL: There’s an interpretation here where “serverless” includes “cloud native data processing” (I mean, I’ve never personally seen a BigQuery server), but by the common definition, most ETL jobs aren’t suited for serverless processing. Related to the first point — if your application’s job is to pipe data from one socket into another socket, with some in-memory buffering, slicing, and dicing, serverless isn’t a great place for it. This answer is only valid through Q2 2020. Don’t throw it in my face in 2022 when AWS releases Lambda Extract Native Pipes for low-cost, high-performance data-local ETL. Or whatever."},{"instruction":"it true that Vlad the Impaler is a national hero in Romania and, if so, why is that the case?","output":"If you ask this question, you certainly do not know who he was.

There is no doubt in my mind that the color of my skin is the main contributing factor in my not getting picked. In fact, I have had guys tell me later, after having played a few games, that they misjudged my skill level. I in no way want this to seem like I am calling these guys racist or prejudice. These guys are some of my best friends. But I am definitely being misjudged for my appearance.

There is no single entity or group that universally holds complete control over the entire world. Instead, global affairs are influenced by a complex web of political, economic, social, and technological forces involving various actors, organizations, and governments. Some of the key players and entities that have significant influence on a global scale include: Governments: The governments of powerful nations, particularly those with significant military and economic capabilities, play a crucial role in shaping global policies and geopolitical dynamics.International Organizations: Entities such as the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Trade Organization (WTO), and other international organizations play roles in addressing global issues and coordinating multilateral efforts.Corporations: Multinational corporations, particularly those in the tech, finance, and energy sectors, exert considerable influence on the global economy, trade, and technological advancement.Financial Institutions: Central banks and major financial institutions significantly impact global monetary policy, financial stability, and economic development.Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs): NGOs and civil society organizations advocate for various social, environmental, and humanitarian causes and can influence public opinion and government policies.Media: Mass media, including news outlets and social media platforms, shape public discourse and have the power to influence public opinion and political outcomes.Technological Giants: Tech companies with global reach have a profound impact on information dissemination, innovation, and societal dynamics. It's important to note that power and influence are often distributed unequally across the world, and some regions and populations may experience more marginalization or limited agency in global affairs. It's crucial to approach discussions about global power structures with a critical and nuanced perspective, considering multiple viewpoints and recognizing that the distribution of power is constantly evolving and subject to change. The dynamics of global influence are interconnected and influenced by a complex interplay of various factors and interests."},{"instruction":"Why does copper (Cu) with an electronic configuration of 2,8,8,8,3 form an ion of Cu 2+ and not Cu 3+?","output":"Well, let us assess the electronic configuration for copper and its ions… For copper, [math]Z_{text{the atomic number}}=29[/math].

When a new user lands on the web application, he/she is most likely to find it complex and a little tricky to use, considering its quite different from what he was using previously. For instance, a salesperson who has been using Excel sheets for a long time will naturally find it hard to use an application like Salesforce despite its obvious advantages. Naturally, since the user is more accustomed and habitual in using Excel sheets while he’s brand new to Salesforce. So the key is to get your user to acquaint themselves with the application and build a habit out of using it. This means you need to constantly guide and support the users.

A visual demonstration of how the media can distort the truth. Although I wonder why soldiers are simultaneously giving a man water and holding a gun to his head. First of all, harming people is not against the Israeli Defense Force code of ethics. They’re soldiers, harming people is part of the job description. The IDF exists to protect Israel, and while their main role is to serve as a deterrent, they have taken part in numerous wars over the years. That being said the IDF do try to minimize civilian casualties when they use force. IDF soldier pictured with Palestinian woman. The IDF are a constant presence in Palestine. As such most interactions between the IDF and Palestinians are peaceful, if not exactly friendly. But these interactions don’t make the news because they’re not newsworthy. If 99 IDF soldiers go about their day and 1 shoots someone, it’s the shooter you see on video. Then there’s the issue of context. Take this infamous photo of Vietnamese Brigadier General Nguyen Ngoc Loan shooting a bound prisoner. It’s one of the most iconic images of the Vietnam War, and really brought to light just how brutal the fighting had gotten, that “our side” was executing unarmed men in the streets. What most people don’t know is that Eddie Adams, the photographer, apologized to the Brigadier after the photo was published. You see, the man being shot, one Nguyen Van Lem (no relation), was a terrorist. Shortly before the photo was taken he murdered Lt. Col. Nguyen Tuan (also no relation), his wife, his 6 children, and his 80 year old mother. The photo is a lie of omission. It accurately depicts an event which actually happened, an unarmed and bound man being executed by one of the “good guys”. But it doesn’t show the events leading up to the execution. Events which might not justify the action, but at least explain it. And that’s often the case with videos of IDF soldiers committing acts of violence. You don’t necessarily know what happened before that. [LINKED_TEXT: FACT CHECK: Does This Photograph Show a Palestinian Boy Shot by Israeli Soldiers?] [URL: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/palestinian-boy-shot-photo/] And then there’s the fact that you can rarely trust the things you see online. The above photo, which was found circulating online, is from the 2012 film Mamlakat al-Naml, Rather obvious in hindsight, people usually look this photogenic after being shot. And it’s not the only one. I’ve seen photo edits being passed off as authentic. I’ve seen pictures of foreign warzones labelled as pictures of Palestine. Once I ever saw a photo of IDF soldiers protecting an Israeli boy mistaken for a photo of them attacking a Palestinian boy, Israelis and Palestinians look very similar. For the sake of fairness here is a video about a Palestinian special effects artist, Mariam Salah, which is being used as “proof” that Palestinians aren’t being killed by the IDF. [LINKED_TEXT: Does This Video Show Injuries Created with Makeup to Fool the Public About Atrocities?] [URL: https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/makeup-artists-atrocities/] The conflict between Israel and Palestine is long, complex, and deeply personal for many people. It can be hard to find an unbiased source of information, and often times misinformation spreads because people usually don’t fact check stories they agree with. Add in the news’ habit of focusing on the negative, and it’s easy to imagine the IDF is made up exclusively of bloodthirsty monsters chomping at the bit to kill Palestinians. They’re not, they’re just soldiers defending their nation. But in the process of defending their nation people die. Sometimes even civilians. That isn’t going to change until the conflict ends. And it’s been going on for 70+ years with the best minds in the world failing to come up with a peace deal that pleases everyone. So I’m afraid I don’t have a solution here."},{"instruction":"Why did Piers Morgan leave Good Morning Britain?","output":"He is a Trumpian in that he loves to hand out criticism but can’t take it - a bully."},{"instruction":"What is your favorite Mexican restaurant in Fort Wayne, Indiana?","output":"Pretty much all Mexican in FW is good.

I'm mediocre in studies as I got only 240 in the BITSAT 2023.","output":"Choosing between Electrical and Electronics Engineering in BITS Pilani and pursuing an MSc in Economics depends on your interests, career goals, and aptitude. Here are some points to consider: Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) in BITS Pilani: 1. Interest and Aptitude: Evaluate if you have a genuine interest in engineering, particularly in the field of electrical and electronics. Consider your aptitude for subjects like mathematics, physics, and problem-solving. EEE requires a strong foundation in technical concepts and analytical thinking. 2. Career Opportunities: EEE offers a wide range of career opportunities in various industries, including power systems, telecommunications, electronics, robotics, and automation. The demand for electrical and electronics engineers is generally high, and there are opportunities for research and development as well. 3. BITS Pilani Reputation: BITS Pilani is a highly reputed institution known for its quality education and strong industry connections. The brand value of the institute can positively impact placements and career prospects. However, note that academic performance and skills are crucial for securing good placements irrespective of the institute. MSc in Economics: 1. Interest in Economics: Evaluate your interest in economics as a subject. If you have a passion for understanding economic systems, policy analysis, research, and data analysis, pursuing an MSc in Economics could be a suitable choice. 2. Career Opportunities: An MSc in Economics can lead to diverse career paths, including roles in finance, consulting, data analysis, research, government agencies, think tanks, and academia. Economic skills and understanding are valuable in decision-making and policy formulation across sectors. 3. Academic Performance: While you mention being mediocre in studies, it's important to consider if you have a genuine interest and the potential to excel in economics. Academic performance in the chosen field, research experience, internships, and networking will play a significant role in securing opportunities. Ultimately, the decision should align with your interests, strengths, and long-term career goals. If you have a genuine interest in electrical and electronics engineering, are willing to put in the effort to improve academically, and see potential in the field, pursuing EEE at BITS Pilani can offer good prospects. On the other hand, if you have a strong passion for economics, excel in the subject, and can envision a career in related fields, an MSc in Economics may be a better choice. Consider researching further, speaking with professionals in both fields, and seeking guidance from mentors or academic counselors to make an informed decision based on your unique circumstances."},{"instruction":"it true that the vast majority of Americans truly believe that the USA singlehandedly won the Second World War, and that the British Empire and USSR contributed either nothing or just very little to the Allied victory?","output":"Many Americans think this.

Has this tactic ever been used in war?","output":"The Japanese in WWII would ‘surrender’ but have a grenade or other explosives hidden under their clothing and attempt to get close enough to the Americans before detonating it to try and take some of the enemy with them."},{"instruction":"any way?","output":"Yes. Self-confidence can help a person in far more ways than is readily apparent, much like the fact that 90% of human communication is non-verbal. First, it can help someone have the courage to face the unknown, always a scary proposition for human beings, as far back as we go. Being able to rely on oneself to handle anything is key in facing the unknown. It can help one to face their fears. It is my own personal experience that if you allow your fears to rule you, so that you flee from them, they will grow without limit, and seem unconquerable the entire time, however, the moment you turn and face your fear, no matter how large it may seem to be, it will shrink to less than a yapping dog that has no teeth. When I first began studying the martial arts, I was beset with many fears, and had for years had a recurring nightmare in which I was beaten and shot, and no matter how hard I tried to fight back, I was always in slow motion, it felt like I was coated in molasses, but when I reached advanced blue belt, halfway through the American Karate belt system, and about a third of the way to Black Belt, I began to win in my dreams, for the first time in my life. Less than a month later, I was undefeated and have remained so ever since. In life, I was afraid to get in the ring, I'm not even sure why, it seems more like I was afraid of losing or looking foolish or inept than I was of getting hurt. But I made myself compete, and much to my surprise, I was good at it, I had some natural ability, and I won several times. After the first 2 or 3 tournaments, I never felt fear of the ring again, or of any physical confrontation. I am aware and confident of my ability to protect myself and more. I have however, felt pre competition jitters, and anxiety in my desire to win, but not fear. What's really strange is, at one point in my life I was a scratch golfer and attempting to get as good as I was able and see if that was good enough to compete at any professional level. But no matter how adept at the game I managed to become, in any competition, no matter how trivial, standing over that little white ball, I would get overwhelmed with anxiety and lose almost all of my confidence to hit it the way I wanted to, despite the fact that I knew I could, especially on the first tee. I was able to conquer this fear enough to help my partner and I win a major at my country club, the two man match play. I sunk a forty foot birdie putt on the 19th hole(1st play-off hole) for the win. It helped that my partner was about eight feet or so, and our opponents had about 12 and 20 footers respectively, but even so, nevermind that had I missed the ball prolly would have gone off the green, lol, I didn't, and I will remember that moment all my life. Even so, the jitters never left me in golf, although I did manage to play through them. I could not have done that without confidence in my ability, despite having the shakes. Back to the topic, confidence is apparent in one's over all bearing, when you apply for a job, the prospective employer can easily see if you are sure of yourself, or arrogant, or unsure, regardless of your demeanor. There is something obvious about a person with self-confidence, it isn't blatant nor belligerent, it's actually rather comforting to those that see it in you. When someone who is confident takes on a challenge or task, they are better able to successfully complete it, because all of their resources are being used to solve the issue, instead of being fragmented with worry or insecurity. When one is confident in themselves, they lend that feeling to those around them, and thus they pass it on, in some measure. There are other ways confidence can help a person, but rather than list them all, I would prefer to challege you, dear reader, how many other ways can you think of that confidence might be an asset?"},{"instruction":"Why did the army get rid of digital camo?","output":"It did not meet a pattern that would cover all environments.

Apparently (according to other quora posts) the design was sound but supposed to work with other colours, and something about night. Anyway, apparently the right colours didn't look cool, so, a compromise was found but in the classic 2+2= 9, US troops ended up with OCP and some were dead. I like to think of OCP as being the American Sa80. Great on paper, OK on base but terrible in the field. As lots of other countries have continued to use digicam with success (and the USMC), the problem with the can sits squarely with the Pentagon."},{"instruction":"What are some cool, lesser known facts about the Indian Railways?","output":"Indian Railway 's doing marvellous engineering work from Ramban to Pamban. :) Read carefully, read full to understand the tag line I gave just above, long answer but very very interesting. The JUSBRL project now known as Udhampur Srinagar Baramulla Rail Link (USBRL, after well functioning Jammu - Udhampur rail line) is one of the greatest example of engineering in the world. (Pic - Srinagar Railway Stn, self clicked, 2013) This rail line majorly divided into three sections Leg 1: Udhampur - Katra (25 kms) Leg 2: Karta - Qazigund (129 kms) Leg 3: Qazigund - Baramulla (119 kms) Leg 3 completed in 2009, Leg 1 completed in 2014. The most difficult and challenging job is leg 2. (Estimated date Dec 2022). Lets focus on Just Leg 2. 129 kms of which Banihal to Qazigund 18 kms was thrown open for public in 2013. This 18 kms includes the longest (currently) train tunnel of India, PirPanjal Tunnel (T-80) length 11.2 kms. The remaining 111 kms of leg 2 is most difficult and hence most interesting too. Highlights of Leg 2. 1. Has longest train tunnel in India T-49 length 12.75 kms 2. Has second longest train tunnel T-80 length 11.2 kms 3. Has highest railway bridge in the world over river Chenab 359 meters. 4. 1st cable-stayed bridge of Indian railways. Now, coming back to remaining section (i.e., 111 kms of leg 2) I'll say one thing about the it. It has 163 kms of tunnel length! And 7 kms of bridges! Combined length both. YES. That because every tunnel length more than 2.5 kms requires a parallel escape tunnel too. That's 97 kms of main tunnel and 66 kms of escape tunnel. OVERALL, leg 2 contains 29 tunnels - 108.2 kms combined length 81 bridges - 7.3 kms combined length Remaining land ~ 10% I remind you this is all happening in seismic zone 5, & landslide prone area. Not only that Leg 2 route is virgin land, so before the construction even starts or before the track alignment done, the first task was to make connecting roads for the supply. Leg 3 Now when your mind is full of tunnels we enter Kashmir now and see the Leg 3. The most interesting thing of this section is again number of tunnels. Which is ZERO. But can you make a guess on number of bridges? I'll give you few more seconds to make a guess. 119 kms of leg 3 contains 811 bridges of combined length of just 4.2 kms !! One of the most beautiful bridge in this section is near Pampore Rly Stn. (Pic credit - Sajjad Rafeeq, this pic was cover pic of NatGeo Traveler India) (Same location - Self clicked 2014) (Same location in Winter, credits - Shahid Mushtaq) Now, the last section Leg 1 This helped people to reach Katra specially. This section has 10 tunnels of combined length 11 kms and 38 bridges of combined length 1.4 kms. The one of the major highlight of this section is this Jajjhar bridge, which is the heightest steel guarded bridge in Indian Railway (not the longest after Bogibeel in Asaam). Over and all. I would like to say, these all are engineering marvels. Special thanks to Northern Railway, Konkan Railway & IRCON corp to work on these highly challenging projects. Indian Railways is really an example of world's best engineering. From North to South.

How you are forced to face yourself is another question entirely- some people, whether they’re on this tfj or not are forced to face themselves in a way that completely disrupts their life, everything has to go, while others may go through and experience a smoother ride, with some emotional upheaval but otherwise relatively balanced etc. it all depends on how much shit you have accumulated over your life (or lives…who’s to know). Being on the tfj does seem to accelerate this process and the experience can be incredibly intense for both counterparts . Source comes in and forces you to look at your life. The mirror is severe, scrutinising and leaves no stone unturned. For both twins (if they on this journey together, for some seem to be more solitary journeys, where one of the pair acts more as a catalyst and nothing more), the ‘work’ is forced upon them. And like most people in life, the twins seek balance within this connection. There is no way to deal with the heartbreak and longing other than to see yourself clearly and your connection to Source.

She is higher than the Highest; the Essence of all, infinitely superior, the First of all, Eternal, of the nature of the Highest Bliss, fortunate, highly respected, and worshipped by all. She is, the Presiding Devî of the Râsa Lîlâ of S’rî Krisna. From Her has sprung the Râsa mandalam and She is the Grace and the Ornament of the Râsa mandalam (the dance in a circle in Râsa). She is the Lady of the Râsa Lîlâ, the Foremost of the Jovial, humourous (witty) persons and dwells always in Râsa. Her abode is in Goloka and from Her have come out all the Gopîkâs. Râsa – the circular dance of Krisna and the cow-herdesses of Vrindâvana. Her nature is the Highest Bliss, the Highest Contentment, and Excessive Joy; She transcends the three Sattva, Rajo and Tamo Gunas and is Nirâkâra (without any particular form); but She dwells everywhere but unconnected with any. She is the soul of all. She is without any effort to do anything and void of Ahamkâra. She assumes forms only to show Her favour to Her Bhaktas. The intelligent learned men (Pundits) read Her Mahimâ (glories) in meditating on Her according to Vedas. The chief of the Devas and the Munis could never see Her; Her clothings are fire-proof and She is decorated with many ornaments all over Her body. Her body looks as if the crores of moons have risen all at once; She is the Giver of Bhakti (devotion) towards Krisna, services towards Krisna; and She bestows all wealth and prosperity.She incarnated Herself as the daughter of one Gopa (cow-herd), named Vrisabhânu. And Earth was blessed by the touch of Her feet. She is such as god Brahmâ and the other Devas could never perceive Her by any of their senses, yet everyone at Vrindâvan saw Her very easily. She is the Gem amongst women. And when She is seen on the breast of Krisna, it seems that lightnings flash in the blue mass of clouds in the sky. In days gone by, god Brahmâ practised several austerities for sixty thousand years to purify Himself by seeing the nails of Her toe; but far from seeing that, He could not have that even in his dreams. At last He succeeded in seeing Her at Vrindâvana and became blessed. O Child Nârada! This is the fifth Prakriti and She is denominated as Râdhâ. Every female in every Universe is sprung from a part of S’rî Râdhâ or part of a part. O Nârada!

But before answering the question with an actual strategy, let me consider a problem with the question, itself. You write, “…installed a private Fire Hydrant for his own use.” If for the owner’s use, one must wonder, how would the homeowner actually use it? Maybe they have a storage shed with some 4″ hose lines and nozzles, nearby. Do ya think? More likely, even if installed by the homeowner, it is for the use of the fire department. Which of course means they have to actually get to the hydrant to use it. Which, of course, your car makes very difficult. Perhaps as troubling is your evident agenda to escape responsibility for your your action. You come before strangers and ask for a “hack.” And I’ll actually give you one.

Since I always brought a book to read, she tried to find me a quite corner where I would not be bothered too much. She also made sure I was not forgotten there as sometime happens. Anyway I was in one morning when she was talking to some friends and family that showed up. It seems it was her last day of work and they wanted to wish her well as she was moving out of state to go to college, from the little I overheard. Not that I was trying to listen in, they were making a somewhat big show of it and it would have been hard to not notice. While I generally leave her a large tip for what is usually a 10 meal.

Russian universities attract the best students from world over. Everyone wants to migrate to Russia. Russian have the finest human rights. They are fair to their elderly, their poor and their women. Russians are very collaborative. They work well with everyone. USA, UK, France and Germany are little bugs as compared to the military might of Russia. Central Asia, Ukraine, Baltic, Balkans, Poland are all treated most fairly by their big brother, Russia. Russia makes the most optimal use of its immense natural wealth to improve the lives of its people. Russians spread finest values and knowledge wherever they go. No Russian wants to leave Russia ever. All parts of Russia are simply paradise. Finest meadows, orchards, cleanest rivers. Beautiful, lush cities with open roads and high living standards.

Friendships have been broken over a single point of disagreement when otherwise the involved parties are in agreement on everything… and when those friends are people with followers oof one type or another, it can lead to war… Judging a person by their age, skin color, place of origin, preference in romantic/sexual partners, fashion, personality, preferred sports team, preferences in books/movies/television/games(be it card, board, tabletop, video, or what have you)… it’s all silly, and yet it seems like most people do at least some of it, and often the reaction to any difference, no matter how small, is hate even when there should be enough commonality to forge an unbreakable friendship, and even when someone has a healthy level of true apathy towards the outgroup, they are often met with hate from those who hate the out group."},{"instruction":"What is your biggest fear in your hostel life?","output":"Ragging is my biggest fear of Hostel Life, I had fear of my seniors in my Hostel days.

So you will do saving take homes put it on rent and sit in the home doing freelancing projects and getting a decent amount of money from rent. My point is that for the company you have given a lot of time and you are settled in place where the 40k =20 k in terms of lifestyle of a peow jn a city and village.

Zeno of Elea described a practical way to demonstrate infinity itself. Remember a time you moved from a location A to a location B, and let's imagine that this distance is a real number. To go from A to B, you first went the finite nonzero distance from A to the halfway point, C= A+(B-A)/2. To get from A to the point C, you first went the finite nonzero distance from A to the quarter point, D=A+(C-A)/2. To get from A to the point D, you first went the finite nonzero distance from A to the eighth point, E=A+(D-A)/2. In order to move any finite distance whatsoever, you needed to cover an infinite number of finite, yet nonzero other distances first. Let's call the overall distance 1 length unit, and you may have learned in calculus that this geometric progression leads to the following sum: 1=1/2+1/4+1/8+1/16+1/32+1/64+…. So to feel the true size of infinity, just think about this infinite series every time you move any finite distance whatsoever. The terms are all positive, and there are more terms than any finite counting number. The real number “one” is generally not considered a number of large magnitude, but it is the sum of an infinite quantity of smaller positive real numbers. Infinity doesn't need a distance to be large overall, when there are more separate additive nonzero finite parts than any finite number. Move a finger one inch or walk for one mile; either way, you've demonstrated your ability to travel over an infinite number of distinct finite distances, because otherwise, there would be no motion at all. Spoiler: Or that the badly-named so-called “real” numbers don't actually describe the real world.

To begin with, the one who proposes the product writes the proposal document and based on the study and research of proposal, a set of team members while approving this proposal creates the feasibility study document.Likely, the business analysts study the requirements of customers’ business and produce the Requirements analysis documents and translates this into technical requirement document.Now, in this instance, the IT architect professionals understand the technical requirements and develop the Software design document. This would initiate the software development process.During the development stage of software, programmers/coders document the Coding documents such as the code, comments, etc.Quality analysts further develop the Testing documents to anticipate the development of a quality software product and on completion of testing, they themselves or others would review the project and produce the review records.Mostly, Technical writers create Guides and checklists to help people to know, understand and how to use the software.Finally, the legal team of an organization product the Project intellectual capital documents to add value to organization by effective documentation.And, the licensing team documents the product license maintenance information.

However, it's important to note that you can't spot reduce fat, meaning you can't target a specific area of your body for weight loss.Exercise regularly: Regular exercise can help you lose weight and can also help tone your facial muscles. Cardiovascular exercise, such as running, cycling, or swimming, can help you burn calories, while facial exercises, such as cheek lifts and jaw movements, can help tone and strengthen your facial muscles.Watch your diet: Eating a healthy, balanced diet can help you maintain a healthy weight and can also help reduce the amount of fat in your face. Focus on eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, and avoid processed foods, sugary drinks, and alcohol.Stay hydrated: Drinking plenty of water can help flush out toxins and reduce bloating, which can help slim down your face.Avoid salty foods: Eating too much salt can cause your body to retain water, which can lead to bloating and puffiness in your face. Avoid salty foods, such as chips, processed meats, and canned soups, and opt for fresh, whole foods instead.Get enough sleep: Getting enough sleep is important for overall health and can also help reduce puffiness and dark circles in your face.Consider cosmetic procedures: If you're looking for a more immediate solution to reduce face fat, there are several cosmetic procedures available, such as facial liposuction and buccal fat removal.

This means that offspring may not be from the contract, and inheritance is argued over, and wars start… YES wars, start over this stuff. So, we need some sort of authority to check up on these social contracts… In steps religion. Religion for thousands of years maintained the authority of marriage because religion was constant, and agreed to by all localised parties. it was a unifying concept that allowed the parties to look to in time sof debate. The religion said these two people were married, thus any other children or ‘flings’ become irrelevant without extra consent by the religion. But… what happens when people start to travel and move about? What happens when people are of different religions, or the issue has political ramifications? Religion even in ancient times tended to have some lines drawn between church and state, lines it could not cross. So, we need a better authority to check up on these religious checked social contracts that allowed the justice system to work… In steps government. Government for about two thousand years has been maintaining records on marriages in order to help it maintain civil justice. This allows it to solve land disputes, and other issues orderly and efficiently. So… modern relationships tend to follow the following situations: Social contract is similar to a defacto relationship, where a couple will engage in monogamy (usually) and live together for mutual benefit to maintain financial and social stability.Religious marriage is a defacto relationship which has the blessing of a priest, used to maintain spiritual and social stabilityOfficial marriage is either religious or social which has been deemed as a stable relationship for reference when dealing with children, and inheritance. As you can see, religion is just one method of marriage, it is not the only method of marriage.

China is the second biggest economy in the world and almost 40% of its trade in 2016 is transported through the South China Sea. China needs a small, secure, and low-cost path to trade with Europe and the Middle East and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a feasible solution to this requirement. This research analyzes the effect of CPEC on trade in terms of transport cost and travel time. In addition, the study compares the existing routes and the new CPEC route. The research methodology consists of qualitative and descriptive statistical methods. The variables (transport cost and travel time) are calculated and compared for both the existing route and new CPEC route. The results show that transport cost for 40-foot container between Kashgar and destination ports in the Middle East is decreased by about 1450 dollars and for destination ports in Europe is decreased by 1350 dollars. Additionally, travel time is decreased by 21 to 24 days for destination ports in the Middle East and 21 days for destination ports in Europe. The distance from Kashgar to destination ports in the Middle East and Europe is decreased by 11,000 to 13,000 km. If China will feel any danger to its investments and it's lifeline “CPEC” so they will take action. Well answer can be yes if India will not stop.

Kristi Noem South Dakota suing the Biden administration over fireworks at Mt. Rushmore as the agency in charge says the Sioux don't want it, it starts fires, environmentally negative, COVID19 and in general inappropriate?","output":"Question: Why is Gov. Kristi Noem South Dakota suing the Biden administration over fireworks at Mt. Rushmore as the agency in charge says the Sioux don't want it, it starts fires, environmentally negative, COVID19 and in general inappropriate? Beyond the fact that she’s a barely competent political hack? Doing so gets her headlines and airtime - Noem obviously believes that people will overlook her miserable record as South Dakota’s governor and perhaps elect her to the POTUS or VPOTUS positions. For that to happen, she has to get out her brand, and this is part of doing that.She knows that South Dakota’s tourism will take a hit if the fireworks don’t occur - Despite the fact that Mount Rushmore is controlled by the federal government, the state makes a substantial amount from the annual fireworks celebration. Noem is attempting to spotlight the potential lost revenue which is ironic as the numbers were already going to be low as many people still aren’t ready to travel during a pandemic.It’s part of a larger Republican “strategy” - Since they cannot win elections and they are trying to change election laws to prevent themselves from being voted into irrelevance, the GOP has decided to wholesalely attack Joe Biden at every turn.Noem, while a hack, is however a loyal operative and she’ll do her part to make certain that the GOP’s strategy includes her state. Harsh reality for Governor Noem: The federal government is under no obligation to hold fireworks displays on federal land. It can cancel any such event that it wants to at any time that it wants and there are no legal precedents to prevent that from occurring. Noem can sue all that she likes; however any such suit (or suits) will be tossed by a judge before they ever manage to go anywhere."},{"instruction":"What's it like to have a 150 IQ? Is life easier? What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","output":"I've been tested three times, ranging from 148 at age 16, to 150 at age 35. What's it like? My IQ is definitely one of the things that defines me, a bit like being female and left-handed. It's just part of what makes me me. I don't talk about it because when I was young other people made a big deal out of it and I was the subject of a study, which I hated. I don't want to be compared to others; I want to be accepted for who I am. Life has been easier occasionally, usually when my safety has depended on thinking outside the box. But the opposite is also true - I've had to learn to control my impatience when others can't see something that to me is obvious. The advantages are clear; the disadvantages are less so. Schoolwork / exams were a doddle if I was interested in the subject. If the subject bored me then I found it very difficult to care enough to pass (that still holds true).My brain never switches off. I can and do spend hours happily checking random facts which interest me, and then find I've only got 20 minutes left for sleeping before I have to get up again for work.I enjoy my work but for other reasons it has not been possible for me to pursue a high-flying career. Instead, I have put my intelligence to good use and have diversified, invested my money well and I can retire whenever I'm ready to.The biggest disadvantage is that I definitely don't trust authority figures. This may have something to do with being part of a study when I was a schoolgirl, or it may be because I haven't found any authority figures who can equal my IQ, and I have to guard against my tendency to look down upon people who are less mentally able than me. This is a big problem which I am always conscious of, and as I said earlier I don't talk about IQ much because it's easier not to.I have an excellent memory, which is an advantage. Conversely, if I genuinely don't understand something and can't be bothered figuring it out, then my mistakes are always stupid - I mean slapstick cringeworthy, and the sort of thing we would laugh at a toddler for doing. Like turning a camera to take a picture upside down. Duh! Not funny at my age.I can work out quite complicated fractions in my head, but Probability is a closed book. I cannot move on from “everything's 1 in 2. It either will happen or it won't\\". I can “see\\" spatial perception and geometry in my head, but get confused by angles in a mirror. I have never been interested in Physics enough to make the effort to learn, hence I have no idea how electricity works or how bumblebees fly, just so long as the lights come on when I flick the switch and my flower beds buzz in summer.I never stop asking questions (not out loud). Apart from Physics, Probability and Politics, I'm interested in pretty much everything else. I could read before I started school and I love everything about words. I realised early on that music is just mathematics in sound and I'm good at solving logic puzzles.Oh, and I don't know if this an IQ thing or not, but my party trick is being able to write both backwards and forwards at the same time, using both hands; one in each direction. So having a high IQ can be a mixed blessing. However, it is part of me and I hope I've used it well. I'm glad I've got it."},{"instruction":"Can you share some screenshots that deserves upvotes?","output":"Ah, I see what you mean.

The diet was mainly meat, fish, seal and plants, and skin colour got lighter as a way of absorbing more Vitamin D in a climate with less sunlight. Then some Anatolian Neolithic farmers came, bringing rye and barley 3.000BC to Sweden and 1,.500BC to Finland. And the Indo-Europeans came to Scandinavia 4.000 years ago with haplogroup R, while the Ural Finns brought N Y-dna to Finland. Sami and Estonian people also are Ural migrators, and the Urals are the border between Europe and Asia/Siberia. Neolithic N-dna was present in Northeast Asia, and R originated in South-central Siberia. Finns have very little Indo-European Y-dna (3,5% R1b and 5% R1a), but Sami have more (13% R1a and 7% R1b), along with Scandinavian I1 (28%) and Finnic N (53%), like the Finns. So Finns and Sami people are a mix of Ural and Scandinavian, with less Indo-European influence than Scandinavians. Swedes have mainly I1, R1b, R1a and N in that order. The Sami share an ancestry link with North African Berber people, and another link with ancient Siberians. Meanwhile Greenlanders have 50% Mongolian Q dna, which Swedes share to a small extent, but Ural people do not."},{"instruction":"Quaithe a Faceless Man?

When you lease a car, you only have to pay regular monthly instalments for as long as you keep the car. These instalments include the cost of the vehicle, insurance, maintenance, applicable taxes and other recurring costs. Generally, there is no down payment involved. Few reasons why car leasing is considered a good idea A typical car lease payment can be significantly lower than your monthly payments would be if you were purchasing the same vehicle and financing it with a traditional personal auto loan. That's because lease payments are based on the depreciation in value of the vehicle over the course of the lease period instead of the vehicle's full value. Your newer vehicle will likely remain under warranty throughout the lease period and, therefore, rarely require anything more than routine maintenance. With a lease, you never have to worry about any mechanical failures. No matter what, you’ll be covered Drivers can lease a vehicle that is nicer and more expensive than one they could afford to purchase.

In this article, we will delve into some of the most remarkable and smartest maneuvers witnessed in the business world. From strategic partnerships and disruptive innovations to ingenious marketing tactics, we will explore how these moves have shaped the course of businesses and influenced their success. 1. The Unconventional Pivot: Netflix's Shift to Streaming Background Netflix, originally a DVD rental service, made a pivotal decision that transformed the entertainment industry. Realizing the potential of online streaming, the company made a bold move to shift its focus from physical rentals to a digital platform. The Maneuver By embracing streaming, Netflix offered its subscribers unlimited access to an extensive library of movies and TV shows. This maneuver not only revolutionized how people consumed entertainment but also allowed the company to capitalize on a global audience. 2. Apple's Marketing Masterstroke: The \\"I'm a Mac, I'm a PC\\" Campaign Background When Apple was striving to gain a larger market share for its Mac computers, it devised an ingenious marketing campaign that struck a chord with consumers. The Maneuver The \\"I'm a Mac, I'm a PC\\" commercials featured a witty and relatable personification of the Mac and PC, highlighting the former's advantages over the latter. This humorous and effective campaign boosted Apple's brand image and resonated with the target audience. 3. Amazon's Disruptive Innovation: Amazon Prime Background Amazon, the e-commerce giant, was seeking to enhance customer loyalty and retention while increasing sales. The Maneuver Amazon Prime was introduced, offering subscribers benefits like free two-day shipping, access to exclusive content, and Kindle e-book lending. This strategic move not only incentivized customers to shop more frequently on Amazon but also solidified the company's position as a dominant force in online retail. 4. Google's Strategic Acquisition: Android Inc. Background In the early 2000s, Google recognized the growing significance of mobile technology and wanted to expand its influence in this area. The Maneuver Google acquired Android Inc., a startup that was developing an open-source operating system for mobile devices. This acquisition enabled Google to enter the smartphone market, and today, Android is one of the most widely used mobile operating systems globally. 5. Tesla's Electric Disruption: The Roadster Background Electric vehicles were not taken seriously until Tesla came along with its first-ever electric sports car. The Maneuver{ for more interesting [LINKED_TEXT: click here] [URL: https://www.rusancoguide.com/2023/07/why-is-it-important-to-incorporate.html] Tesla's Roadster showcased the potential of electric vehicles, proving that they could be high-performing and desirable. This paved the way for Tesla to become a pioneer in the electric vehicle industry and set the stage for the success of future Tesla models. 6. Airbnb's Growth Hack: Cross-Posting Listings Background Airbnb faced the challenge of expanding its inventory of rental listings rapidly. The Maneuver To overcome this obstacle, Airbnb allowed its hosts to cross-post their listings on Craigslist, thereby tapping into a massive pool of potential renters. This brilliant growth hack significantly increased Airbnb's visibility and user base. 7. Starbucks' Coffee Shop Ubiquity Background Starbucks, the iconic coffee chain, sought to establish itself as the go-to destination for coffee lovers worldwide. The Maneuver Starbucks adopted an aggressive expansion strategy, opening multiple stores in high-traffic areas, including airports, malls, and street corners. This ubiquity made Starbucks a familiar and convenient choice for coffee enthusiasts everywhere. 8. Microsoft's Inclusive Move: Office for Mac Background Microsoft's Office suite was initially designed exclusively for Windows users. The Maneuver Recognizing the growing Mac user base, Microsoft expanded its market by launching Office for Mac, allowing Apple users to access its popular productivity software. This move solidified Microsoft's presence on Mac computers and bridged the gap between the two ecosystems. 9. The Coca-Cola - Share a Coke Campaign Background Coca-Cola wanted to revive its connection with consumers and make its product more personal. The Maneuver The \\"Share a Coke\\" campaign replaced the Coca-Cola logo on bottles with popular names and phrases. This personalized approach generated immense social media buzz and increased Coca-Cola's sales and engagement with customers. 10. Google's Algorithmic Overhaul: Hummingbird Update Background As the volume of online content grew, Google aimed to provide more relevant search results to users. The Maneuver The Hummingbird update introduced a new search algorithm that focused on understanding the intent behind user queries rather than just matching keywords. This significantly improved the accuracy of search results and enhanced user experience. Conclusion In the dynamic world of business, shrewd and smart maneuvers can make all the difference between success and failure. The examples mentioned above illustrate how strategic decisions, innovative marketing, disruptive technologies, and customer-centric approaches have propelled companies to new heights. As businesses continue to evolve, we can expect to witness more remarkable maneuvers that redefine industries and reshape the business landscape."},{"instruction":"Are accusations from a narcissist a confession?","output":"I wouldn't say a confession per say, because they are never wrong!

Back then we had our coaching classes on the weekends for the IIT JEE preparation and boy, were they not so long! So, one fine Sunday this friend of mine has a brilliant (stupid) idea to bunk our last lecture of the day. I gave in to the idea of missing the mathematics lecture by a grumpy old professor who would gladly spit on the first row students in his class, in order to catch the latest Hollywood action flick ‘The Avengers’. We sneak out in time and reach the movie theatre. We merrily empty our shallow pockets (which only fed on pocket money at the time) to check off the items on the list - Movie tickets - check Big popcorn bucket - check Cola (Soda) - check We were the first ones in the queue to enter the auditorium, all starry eyed and excited, toying with our 3D glasses. We took our respective seats and waited for the movie to begin. After the few initial trailers and the customary ‘anti-smoking campaign showing Mukesh’s story’, a middle aged couple walked in. I would’ve missed them had they not taken the seats one row below us. Hell no, I would’ve missed them had they not been my parents ! I mean what were the friggin’ odds ? The feeling of expertise tugged at myself only if my eyes found with my father’s. Alas! Too-late to perform. What taken place afterward is ‘yes’ to all your imagination to indeed ensure it is my worst experience with a movie theater."},{"instruction":"w would you handle a situation in business where an employee tells you they refuse to meet individually with a female or attend a business lunch with a female, because morally a married man should not meet 1 on 1 with a woman?","output":"I’m going to be short and sweet about this. People have blown up the “Billy Graham rule/Mike Pence rule” way out of proportion. Pence said he would not have dinner alone with a woman. He did not say he would not do business with a woman or refuse to meet in in a public place. He did not say he would not do business with a woman over lunch. That may sound like splitting hairs, but dinner is an evening engagement. Often, business dinners are held later in the evening and/or in a hotel dining room. Anyone in the public eye could be blackmailed with photos of them under those conditions (I suppose lunch is mid-day so it’s less likely to be perceived as a hookup sort of thing. I don’t know.) He did not say he wouldn’t meet or do business with women in or with a group. Apparently, it’s never caused him a problem in his employment in the past, and he never said he would ask anyone else to adopt his ‘rule’. He’s allowed to decide for himself what impropriety looks like and what it doesn’t. And I think there are more pressing issues our country needs to focus on."},{"instruction":"Silicon Valley reached its peak?","output":"No. But the right way to look at Silicon Valley is as a mindset.

Intentionally or not the Aboriginal peoples used fire to change the climate and shaped the land to their needs, not the other way around. That is what humans do."},{"instruction":"Why was Ezra able to save Ahsoka but not Kanan through time travel?","output":"There’s a paradox in discussions about time travel. The grandfather paradox. What if a time traveler travels back in time and kills their grandfather to prevent their own birth? The grandfather died before making a baby, so the time traveler is not born at all. But without a killer, the grandfather would be alive and have given birth. That would mean the time traveler was actually born. So it’s all contradictory with each other. In the case of time travel in Rebels, we run into the same paradox. Kanan sacrificed himself to save everyone, including Ezra. If Ezra time traveled and saved Kanan, there would not have been a Kanan to save Ezra at that time, and the time traveler would not be alive in the first place, and it falls into the exact same paradox. Obviously, the show did not want to try to solve this age-old paradox. Ahsoka didn’t want to try it out either. Therefore, she told Ezra not to do it. With Ahsoka, such a paradox did not exist. So she was saved. But not Kanan. NOTE: It was also an important lesson for Ezra, as he had to let go. It’s easy to say, but hard to do. Believing in letting go and saying you will let go is all good, but actually doing it is difficult and requires real courage, determination, and self-control. Ezra proved himself and showed that Kanan had taught him well. Kanan’s sacrifice would not be in vain."},{"instruction":"What are some facts that sound like 'BS', but are actually true?","output":"It blows my mind to know that my Dad died.

Most innovation depends on previous innovations, so we have to wait until other things are in place. Smartphones depend on advances in miniaturization, materials science, software, wi-fi, etc. Once those are in place, then innovation kind of explodes. What will we see in the future? Science fiction is inadequate to imagine what will be. I wish I could be around to see the future.

Don’t forget all the squabbling within The Rolling Stones. Badfinger had so much dysfunction, the two primary figures in the band committed suicide. Brutal, to say the least. The Go Go’s were famous for their internal strife, as were Talking Heads. And The Beach Boys… None however, in my mind, come up to Fleetwood Mac (except maybe The Mamas and the Papas?).

HTML, CSS, and content are all housed in one location in typical CMSs, making content reuse difficult. The presentation layer is separated from the body in headless CMS.

To pity something/someone is to look down upon them, while feeling sorry for them, upset about something. Maybe you pity someone because they aren’t as accomplished as you. Maybe you pity them for their choice of gaming consol. Whatever the means, pitying is looking down upon someone with a bitter sympathy. To find the opposite of jealousy, lets look at the definition of it. Being jealous is being resentful, mad, or upset because you want something (whether it be a trait, a better look, or the person you had a crush on,) that someone/something else has. What would be the opposite of being resentful of someone? Admiring someone. The opposite of jealousy is admiration - adoring someone because of something."},{"instruction":"Which is the best text editor?

The girl came back and told him rudely that you are seated on my place. I felt bad for him, the waiting room was also full so I told him uncle take my place my train is coming, anyway. There was still two hours I went on the platform and I found place to sit. I boarded the train later. Two weeks later, I was going home, again.

He asked me to come with him and then he asked someone to open the other waiting room which is for 2 AC ( women) passengers . That is how I had the whole waiting room just for myself.

For most historians, the cutoff for ancient China is the unification under the Qin, in 221 BCE. Before that, some Chinese may had heard distant rumors of a land called 身竺（身毒）ㄐㄩㄢㄉㄨˊ (chüantu, juandu), Hindu. Some Indians may have heard about a land to the north, across the impassable mountains. Later commerce developed, with articles passing through a long chain of hands both ways, but most Indians probably never saw an article of Chinese manufacture in their entire lives, and vice versa. They were rare and exorbitantly expensive. Buddhist monks from India reached Central Asia, and a few reached China. This led some Chinese Buddhist monks to travel to India for sutras. The journey was arduous and took years. We know of a couple monks who went and came back. Certainly many more went and disappeared into the desert sands and mountain glaciers. But if anybody told you that there was a war between ancient China and India, they’re pulling your leg."},{"instruction":"What are the best ways to invest money?","output":"Stocks: Stocks are shares of ownership in a company. When you buy stocks, you are essentially buying a piece of the company. Stocks can be a great way to grow your money over the long term, but they can also be volatile in the short term. Bonds: Bonds are loans that you make to a company or government. Bonds are generally considered to be less risky than stocks, but they also offer lower returns. Mutual funds: Mutual funds are baskets of stocks or bonds that are managed by a professional. Mutual funds can be a good way to diversify your portfolio and reduce your risk. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs): ETFs are similar to mutual funds, but they are traded on an exchange like stocks. ETFs can be a good way to get exposure to a particular market or sector. Real estate: Real estate can be a great way to build wealth over the long term. However, it is important to remember that real estate is illiquid, meaning that it can be difficult to sell quickly if you need cash. Commodities: Commodities are raw materials, such as oil, gold, or wheat. Commodities can be a good way to hedge against inflation, but they can also be volatile.

Gravity is due to the mass of a body (Newton's second law) and weight is defined as mass of the object times acceleration due to gravity. At a given location regardless of rotational velocity this is constant. The normal force applied by a given surface will change due to centrifugal force, but that is not weight. The forces acting on a body are a composite of the environment, rotational velocity, gravity and any other body forces (EM for example). Scales measure this normal force and generalized as weight since the other forces are generally insignificant."},{"instruction":"f Hannibal had forced a showdown battle with the Roman army, could he have captured Rome itself?","output":"Hannibal did not show great ability at sieges, nor did he have the materials to carry out sieges effectively. Pretty much every siege in Rome he undertook he failed at. He simply didn't have enough of his elite troops, nor the tools needed to conduct major sieges. In addition to strong walls Rome could raise some 40,000 infantry to defend the city, more men than Hannibal had after Canne, which was his best chance to besiege the city. The biggest factor however was that even if he had the materials to conduct it he never had the time. If Rome had truly been besieged there would have been 100,000 of soldiers rallied to rush to its defense. At the start of the 2nd punic war Rome could called forth some 375,000 soldiers. These weren't existing armies, Rome could quite literally snap her fingers and raise Legions in days… not only that, but these soldiers could seemlessly and virtually instantaneously, in proportion to the time, form into one of the most well disciplined and cohesive military forces ever known to man. The kind of logistical ability is simply unimaginable by modern standards. What's more, these brand new soldiers would fight to the death “with their faces towards the enemy” in the defense of Rome. Hannibal was a great commander, probably the second greatest general after Alexander, and would have suceeded in his mission if the politicals in Carthage would have supported him fully. What he did to the Romans at Canne is probably the single greatest tactical victory in the history of war, certainly in the top 5, I'm not as well versed in more modern wars. The point is, he was still only one man, with a single army, pretty much all of value he walked with from Spain… and he still accomplished stunning and legendary feats. But his limited and tenious army simply wasn't up to fighting the Roman logistical system without dedicated support from home."},{"instruction":"What are some hobbies that will heal an INFJ?","output":"This question can only be answered if you specify which INFJ you are talking about. Healing is very individualistic. For instance, meditation is not right for someone who has severe, chronic, complex PTSD. People who try to tell others how to heal or that they are not healing fast enough are retraumatizing the victim or victim blaming. It is not okay. Some things cannot be healed. Some things never should have happened to anyone. My son was so abused and discriminated against by society that there was no healing from what you did to him. HUMAN RIGHTS REALLY NEED TO BE TAUGHT IN OUR SCHOOLS!!!!!! Television drama and especially America's funniest home videos (laughing at people getting hurt) have changed people's perceptions I believe. The suffering of others is now seen as entertainment. Case in point: A woman walked who was stabbed and bleeding to death managed to make it to a convenience store to try to get help near Wichita State University in Wichita Kansas. What happened instead is that people (many of them students at WSU) stepped over her to continue their shopping and people made videos of her without rendering assistance or calling for help. It was a full 2 minutes before the clerk called 911. She died. Nobody tried to stop the bleeding. They recorded her. If she had survived I don't think she would be healing from that trauma. People today should really be ashamed of what they do to each other and innocent victims. HUMAN RIGHTS REALLY NEED TO BE TAUGHT IN OUR SCHOOLS!!!!!!!!!! All of the 192 members of the United Nations have signed on in support of the Universal declaration of Human Rights. We need to teach everyone to respect them."},{"instruction":"What are the best color of loafers to buy that go with almost everything (jeans, chinos)?","output":"Charcoal gray or navy blue color loafers go with almost an everyday-suit option.

It is simply due to the wave nature of particles. You can’t use human-sized intuition to work it out. You use the models that accurately match and predict outcomes of experiments. The mathematics of those models results in the fact that multiplying the uncertainties of position and momentum (or two other complimentary variables) is some necessarily nonzero number. One can either study and work through those models (I did many years ago and they worked at the time), or can just accept that there is an unavoidable uncertainty principle at work. There is a third possibility, that of making up new physics without understanding old physics to develop muddled models that explain things much worse than existing models. I don’t recommend the latter; it doesn’t add value and may cause others to start to avoid you."},{"instruction":"Can all Glock, MP, and other similar handguns be retrofitted with external and manual safeties?","output":"Glock won’t do it.

Was there a big buzz about it after they won this tournament?","output":"Cricket is not the most popular sport in England. It’s true that they invented the game and currently, they are the best team in all three formats of the game. But it’s not everyone’s favorite sport in England. England won the recently concluded T20 WC and it didn’t generate many headlines since the few people who follow cricket in England consider test matches as the ultimate form of the game and give more importance to tests and ODIs than T20s.Most of the times I have seen England play India or Pakistan in England, more than 50% stadium is filled by the visitors and not the Englishmen. At Edgbaston, Birmingham, the percentage is even more. This is because of a sizable South Asian diaspora living in the city.Football is the most popular sport in England and by a huge distance. There are 92 football clubs in the top four divisions of English football and hundreds of smaller clubs whereas there are just 18 county cricket teams in total across two divisions. Premier League, the first division of English football is the most popular league in the world, and the world’s best players play in that. The map on the left locates each football club in English football and on the right the 18 county clubs are shown. The duration of football is short and hence, people in England spend 90 minutes in bars every weekend to watch their favorite club play. Cricket is considered by many as a boring and long sport.Another reason why the T20 WC win didn’t generate big buzz is that the country’s and the media’s focus is on the upcoming FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar. The FIFA WC is considered the second-greatest event on Earth and the nation wants to win the WC for the first time since 1966.Cricket’s popularity can be measured by the sizes of the cricket stadiums in the country compared to those of football. Lord’s is the largest cricket stadium with a capacity of 30,000. There are 27 football stadiums that have a capacity of more than 30,000. Wembley is the largest one with a capacity of 90,000. Ipswich Town, a football club that plays in the third division has a stadium with a capacity of 30,300.

Usually skills that you have developed beyond mere competency are also motivated skills, desirable or fun. You will receive greater return on your effort by improving yourself in areas you are already good at. My preferred Kaizen is study. I read books on management, business, or communication - and I try to write something once in awhile that someone might like to read. I enjoy taking classes at night and online.

Specifically in this case you have to be careful about what you really mean by “observable”. Normally when we talk about observing something, we are talking about detecting it using light waves. Atoms are far too small to resolve with light waves, even using the most powerful microscope. Some very large molecules can be resolved with light, but not atoms. There are a lot of other ways to detect something, though whether you consider that observation or something else depends on how you want to look at it. Scientists can use scanning electron microscopes to create images of individual atoms. Mind you, the images produced do not provide any detail regarding the structure of the atom, and the smaller the atom is, the less distinct the image is.

Firstly, knowledge is essential. Bettors should have a solid understanding of the sport they are betting on, including rules, team and player performance, statistics, and trends. Researching and analyzing past games, injuries, and other relevant factors can help to identify opportunities for profitable bets. Secondly, having a clear strategy is crucial. This includes determining what types of bets to make, such as point spread, moneyline, or over/under bets, as well as deciding how much to wager and when to place bets. A well-defined strategy helps to avoid impulsive decisions and increases the chances of making profitable bets. Discipline is another critical factor in successful sports betting. Bettors should set a budget and stick to it, avoiding the temptation to chase losses by making larger bets or placing bets on impulse. It's also important to avoid getting emotionally invested in bets, as this can cloud judgement and lead to poor decision-making. Finally, successful sports bettors understand that losing is part of the game. Accepting losses and learning from them can help to refine strategies and improve future performance. In summary, the key to successful sports betting involves a combination of knowledge, strategy, discipline, and emotional control. By understanding the sport, developing a clear strategy, staying disciplined, and accepting losses, bettors can increase their chances of making profitable bets.

LOL Seriously teenagers need their parents or other adults to remember what it was like when they were a teenager. The things that their parents or other adults said to them. The era may have changed but there would be similarities. My sister-in-law who is 10 years my senior told me about how her dad didn’t like the height of her skirt, imagine what he would think now if he saw the height of some skirts. He didn’t like the music she listened to or the people she hung around. Now teenagers need to also try and understand the adults in their life. Sure all that advice is killing you, but they are giving it because they have life experience and they are trying to pass on this knowledge. Imagine if you were playing Metro Exodus and if you do then you know that stealth is the key to survival, imagine those adults in your life had played this game for quite a few years, they could pass onto you strategies to survive the game, which means you would make fewer mistakes and stay in the game longer. I also believe that if the teenager communicates to the adults that they do understand what they are trying to do and thank them, but assure them that you are not into (whatever their fears are) by saying (for example) I would never ever consider taking drugs, as only losers take drugs. Then they may start to understand that their kid will be okay. I liken the relationship of a parent with teenagers or kids to a teenager/kid with a pet. As the pet owner (owner means the person responsible for the safety and upbringing of the pet) you would want to make sure that your pet has a great life, doesn't end up in the pound or at the vet surviving a life-threatening injury or illness or even surviving a bait that was consumed(drugs).

SPOILERS Let's see their feats: Gojou Satoru Overwhelmed Sukuna powered Itadori's speed as if Sukuna was a joke. And almost every curses fears Sukuna. This simply makes Gojou the strongest in the series( which was already stated). Every curses are aiming at somehow trapping Gojou because that's the only way they could win.Has an infinite space between himself and the enemy. No matter what the enemy do, the barrier of infinity can't be broken unless the enemy is far stronger than GojouDisplayed an attack in one of the previous episode that obliterated an entire forest area and almost killed a special grade curse spirit as if it's piece of a crap.Has the ultimate domain expansion - Infinite void which throws in infinte amount of data to opponents brains that he cannot even move. It's like a time freeze. Saitama Strongest ‘hero’ in the show as far as they don't make Blast , a hero who haven't showed up until now, stronger than Saitama. I doubt tho. Even #2 was a joke for Saitama . Saitama tanked Tatsumaki's entire attacks and wasn't even scratched.Not a gag character anymore as enemies of Saitama's tiers are being introduced(God)Defeated another Limiter broken character like himself( Awakened Garou). But it was really simple. 3 serious series moves and a couple of normal moves and Garou got bodied. The same Garou who destroyed every S class heroes at the same time was nothing infront of Saitama.Obliterated an alien being with ultimate regeneration hax.Obliterated Elder centipede with a single punch which Blast failed to do a couple of years back.Impressed an S class hero Genos the Demon cyborg that he wanted to be Saitama's discipleMade two S class heroes sense ‘DEATH’ incoming in their brains when Saitama was gonna punch them as they challenged Saitama for a no mercy fight. Saitama didn't connect the punch tho. And had no intention of killing or even hurting them. S class heroes = Genos and Flash.Impressed S class hero Silverfang by destroying a meteor so easily which no heroes could. Not anyone upto #3. May be #2 Tatsumaki' can stop it with Teleknisis. But she wasn't around. Goku Just as a kid, this dude was a monster. Destroyed King piccolo who was moon tier back in the first arc of DbzDestroyed Emperor of the universe Frieza with Super Saiyan 1 . Frieza can simply place a hand on the ground and blast a planet like fodder without a sweat or energy consumption back thenAchieved God ki and god state and fought God of destruction Beerus who is one of the strongest of the godsAchieved the state of Ultra Instinct which even gods struggled to achieve. Of course Beerus already had UI. That's why I stated himas OPMastered Ultra Instinct and caught up with Jiren who is a monster in Dragon ball universe. Jiren was stated as stronger than even a god of destruction and can destroy a Super Saiyan Blue Goku with kaioken × 20 , like a piece of a trash.His punches against Beerus in his base form caused waves that was gonna collapse the entire universe before Whis , an angel had to stop them.Knows the technique of teleportation at will or known as instant transmission . Can teleport anywhere, anytime. No matter how far, he can teleport there in a single moment or use it infinite number of times even between a fight. 8. Goku's intense ki affects Void. Yes, that's a problem for Gojou. When Goku attains Mastered Ultra Instinct he was shaking the entire world of Void and heating it up. And he beat Jiren who overwhelmed time freeze/ time skip itself. So let's see, )(((((((((COMPARISON ))))))))))( Basically, Goku's simple punches would be superior than Saitama's serious series: serious punch. I don't know if there's a superior attack. Serious table flip and serious headbutt wasn't as powerful as Serious punch I believe. So by feats, Goku is far stronger. But since we don't know his Saitama's potential, we can't be sure. But I think Gojo will have trouble with Saitama before he'll have to deal with Goku. As far as we have seen Gojo's destructive force is nothing before Saitama's serious series. Gojo would be Awakened Garou tier. He was stomping every S class . And Tatsumaki was destroying entire cities in the fight who is comparatively weaker than Awakened Garou Unless Gojou uses his Domain Expansion there's no way he is gonna win this. When Gojou uses Infinite Void, I believe that Saitama can be tricked. But Saitama is a being who is out of emotions or reasoning. I doubt if it works on him. Also Saitama's Serious series: Serious table flip is a psychological attack as stated by Garou that you won't even understand what's happening and you'll lose your sense of position or direction. It's an attack involving infinite number of huge rocks flying and crushing into each other that everywhere around you, you only see the sky and no earth, no ground. Only huge rocks and dirt. So is Gojou could use Infinite void he can trap Saitama. But he can't defeat Saitama. Not with that level of destruction. Now Goku is a serious trouble for Gojou. Even with Domain expansion he can't tag Goku because of the ultimate state of Ultra Instinct. While in this state the mind is at peace, calm. No matter how much information you push into his brains, the mind stays free of everything and body fights on its own. This is because, this state awakens when Goku is fully wrecked and is almost defeated. It's like Goku doesn't even have to control his body. The body becomes another entity for defense. ((((((( Answer ))))))) So Gojou can trap Saitama, but can't defeat him. Thus a stalemate. But in Gojo's favour. Gojou can't beat Goku. He may, if Goku fails to attain Ultra Instinct. But that's a past story. Goku has learned it to attain the state. Goku has shown to cause shakes and quakes in infinity or void with his Ultra Instinct energy. This may even cause trouble to Gojo's 'infinity'. If Goku can't overwhelm the infinite space, Gojo favoured win by stalemate. Both Goku and Saitama can obliterate Gojou Saitama may have to use his full potential as we don't know much about infinity barrier of Gojou and how defensive it is and if his domain expansion would even affect Saitama. ((((((((((ANSWER IN SHORT))))))))) Gojo vs Saitama = Stalemate (Provided Infinite void affects Saitama). But this is Gojo favour. Goku vs Gojo= Gojo loses unless infinity can stop UI energy. If it can, Stalemate Goku vs Saitama = We really don't know( Saitama doesn't have a limiter or limits. But Goku's feats are so far above Saitama's. So we don't know. The answer uses them ‘in character' and Gojo and Goku from only the anime is used(manga versions not included). ( It's almost irrelevant to use Dragon ball characters at this point because anyone around or near Goku right now is already multiversal level and can even trancsend time by raw power)"},{"instruction":"w do I create my own mailing address?","output":"1.

There is a centralized content management system in Static WordPress, so you don’t have to worry about reformatting your content for each platform. Instead, you just need to publish the content once, and Headless architecture handles all the leg work for you. #More Lightweight and Simpler Redesigns When you go with Headless approach, there is no front-end to display the content, and the system consists of just a database and API calls. Consequently, future redesigns get less complicated because you can redesign your website all over again in a fraction of the usual time without the need for reimplementing the CMS itself. Thus, it eventually leads to a sleek, fast, and responsive content delivery. #Super-fast Performance Website Speed is another area where Headless architecture proves to be highly beneficial. The headless approach removes all the unnecessary things, primarily front-end, which may slow down your website. All that remains in Headless WordPress is the content database and API calls, making your WordPress site load at the speed of light, ¬¬even if you publish the content on a static site. #Better Scalability Lots of enterprises are embracing the Static WordPress approach just because of scalability. Since you rely on API calls to deliver the content, you can quickly scale everything up without your users experiencing any significant downtime. Your content database can continue to grow, and since you are now API-first, you can easily integrate with almost any other technology to meet your new business needs. #Tighter Security Headless WordPress is an extremely safe approach! Factually, no WordPress security measure or plugin can keep your site as secure as the Headless approach. Separating the front-end from the backend, you leave nothing for hackers to exploit or break into as your content lives separate from the front-end. #Greater Control No matter if you’re a front-end developer or content publisher, Headless WordPress gives you full control over the visualization of the content. Where the publishers gain nearly endless control over how they present their content to users, on the other hand, front-end development experts can leverage different technologies to deliver users an ‘outside the theme’ experience. #Future-Proof Tech Stack Since the API-driven, Headless WordPress can integrate with most platforms, you don’t have to worry about a specific technology becoming outdated or obsolete. You can easily upgrade to the latest technologies based on your users’ needs to make sure your tech stack remains future-proof for as long as possible. Additionally, being API-first, Static WordPress can support popular cutting-edge technologies and devices, such as AR, VR, and IoT, which gives you a significant edge over your competitors.

For that reason, most people live on the very outskirts of the region and commute in to one of the major cities, which often makes for a 4+ hour long commute for a round trip. So I think a better question is this: “What are the most affordable options that place me in an area where I would actually want to live?” Near San Francisco: Daly City, South San Franciso, Brisbane, and Hayward are short commutes by car or cab to SF, although Hayward is a weirdly long commute via BART if you are going towards the Downtown area, and still relatively affordable. If you make anything like the current median wage in this country or below, work in SF, and don’t have the time to devote the equivalent of a part-time shift to commuting, these are the places you tend to live. Near Berkeley/Oakland: Due to several colleges within a short distance, rising rents prior to the crash, and speculators buying up all the foreclosed properties in the Berkeley/Oakland area after the crash, the East Bay has become exponentially more expensive over the last decade and a half. If you want to live near UC Berkeley, you’re looking at around 2500/mo or above for a room in Southside in Berkeley, which is seen as the “sketchier” side of Berkeley. For that reason, most working class people in the East Bay are migrating either towards long commutes from the outer edges of the East Bay or shorter commutes from north of Berkeley, i.e. Richmond, El Cerrito, et al. While the latter option provides a reasonable commute via BART to Berkeley and Oakland, the downside is they are sort of notorious for violent crime."},{"instruction":"w do you create social media creative content?","output":"Here are some tips on how to generate content for social media: Plan ahead: Create a content calendar to plan out your social media posts in advance.

For example, there are presets that can give photos a vintage or film-inspired effect, or make them look like they were shot on a specific type of film stock. Users can also find presets that emulate the look of different types of cameras, such as a Polaroid or a toy camera.

He had his supporters and his detractors but overall, he is looked back upon by people on both sides of the political aisle with respect. John major is largely viewed as a useless tool of a prime minister but he’s only really hated these days by people who supported leaving the EU who are unhappy at him inserting himself into things when he has few achievements of his own to have authority on a very highly charged topic. Thatcher is different. A large section of her opposition dont just disagree with her, they hate her. That said she was repreately elected and not everyone who elected her has decided that not only were her critics right, her haters were right and thus changed their minds. It therefore follows that she remains a figure widely hated by those who dont like her, not merely viewed as a former opponent but she is also still loved by some who supported her and thus, her supporters will claim she did a good job. As an extreme example. Hitler is a very widely hated figure but there were a few people who said they liked him to their dying day. His little sister, diana mosley and although i dont recall if theyve been asked about him rather than their fathers but the children of himmler and goering probably view hitler as an mismaligned uncle of theirs."},{"instruction":"f you quit Quora, do you think anyone would miss you?","output":"Certainly not.

He had a place with my new nearby neighbor, and she said she'd had him for a long time. He appeared to be a piece slight to me when I saw him, and she said that he killed and ate untamed life so she didn't have to take care of him much. I've had a great deal of felines, indoor-just and indoor-outside, and I know that eating untamed life (to some extent in suburbia) frequently prompts worms and parasites that restrict supplements from being consumed. My better half realizes me well and requested that I keep the feline bound to the kitchen - he wasn't our pet and I think my significant other was partaking in his most memorable feline available energy since we had been hitched around 18 years prior. After two days Pippin the Miracle Feline began staring at the television with us (from my better half's lap, obviously!).

Election day was an arbitrary time picked by Trump. It didn’t happen to line up with the times required for development and testing. And, BTW, there isn’t a vaccine yet (Nov 9, 2020). The earliest front line health care workers are likely to get the vaccine is probably January. Maybe spring for most of us. There’s an announcement that the data looks good enough that Pfizer will apply for an Emergency Use Authorization in the next week or two. Back when the FDA announced that they would require 2 months data on the median Phase III participant, I estimated the beginning of December as the earliest possible approval for an EUA. That two month mark will come between the middle and end of November; Pfizer hasn’t said exactly. The fundamental reason the announcement of good results comes now is, this is when the data became available. Trials take time. It took time to get the trials started because it took time to enroll about 60,000 people representing as much of the population as possible. And the enrollment didn’t start sooner because it took time to do the earlier trials. And those trials didn’t start sooner because it took time to develop the vaccine."},{"instruction":"it safe for me to pet my cat after using lotion?","output":"If it’s not full of harmful ingredients, probably is safe, though kitty might wonder why her fur tastes so weird (or good) when she grooms after."},{"instruction":"What are some short stories about wives?","output":"The son decides to admit the father in an Old Age Home as desired by the daughter-in-law.

Am I fired, or did I quit?","output":"Two things to consider: In some states, you still receive unemployment benefits if you resign. You can resign for any number of reasons, including health, toxic work environment, school, etc. So, resigning does NOT negate your right to unemployment compensation, as long as the regulatory requirements are being met.Being “let go” or “being fired”, for cause or without cause (especially in at-will and right-to-work states), does not have the stigma that it once had. Each case is unique, though, so what you decide to do should be done knowing your rights and your employment prospects after this job. It doesn’t hurt to call the state unemployment office for advice—they will tell you the rules in your state. And rules do change, so always try to be better informed. Fun story—I had an employee who decided to not show up for work on Fridays consistently. There were other quiet quitting behaviors as well. This went on for many months, and the pattern of behavior was clear. At some point, he just stopped showing up—no notice, nothing. He did not respond to calls, mail, and emails from the company. No explanation, just “no show”. And this is someone we knew through the family. We even asked his family if he was OK. Nothing. We let this go on for 2 more months, but then we had to stop it and bring on someone who could do the work. This was just a bad distraction from our mission. The salary also stopped when his earned time for vacation and PTO were drained (the earned Vacation, Sick Days, and PTO bank had been drained long ago, no surprise). Anyway, we were absolutely shocked when he applied for unemployment benefits. I spoke directly with the State Unemployment Services division…and the agent explained to me “Yes, the employee can qualify for unemployment benefits, whether they were fired or quit or resigned…or just didn’t show up for work.” Me: “You must be kidding…that is like highway robbery. We pay into the pool for unemployment insurance. This just isn’t right. Is there anything that we can do?” The Agent: “Well, you can get the law changed, but that is about it.”"},{"instruction":"What do you think about the new Marvel comics characters Safespace, Snowflake, Trailblazer, B Negative and Screentime from “The New Warriors?”","output":"I've honestly not believed this is real for awhile.

The waitress was so busy flirting with the guys at the bar that she couldn’t bother waiting on us. We wanted to add dinner to our purchase but couldn’t get her to return. The couple next to us couldn’t even get a glass of wine. I am elderly and was with an equally elderly friend. We were just old ladies. Certainly not appealing young men. The couple next to us were in their late 30’s or early 40’s. They dressed nicely and may have been very affluent. She couldn’t be bothered with them either. We finally got the boy sweeping the floor to get her to bring us our bill. We paid our bill and left a 0.01 tip. We gave our note and our tip to the hostess explaining that if we had never been there before, we’d never return. But, if we had a different waitress we would. We went back about 2 weeks later. That waitress was nowhere to be seen. WE got waited on and received a nice drink and dinner. As for Tithing…I used to be in charge of the annual fund. I made an appointment with members of the congregation and took their pledge card to them for them to fill out.

So it’s better to go along with where they are. For example, my dear, sweet MIL would ask, “Where’s Phil?” (Her husband.) The first time I replied, “Now honey he passed away 5 years ago. I’m sorry.” Alzheimer’s had robbed that memory from her so she grieved as if he had just died because with her memory, she had just found out. It was horrible for her. The next time she asked I would say, ““He’s at work,” or “he went to the store.” That seemed acceptable to her and a few minutes later, her husband would be out of her thoughts again. Did I feel bad “lying” to her? At first, yes, but it was much more cruel for her to relive the deaths of her loved ones day after day and sometimes several times a day.

Some people believe that microwaves can cause food to lose nutrients or become contaminated, while others argue that microwave cooking is a quick and convenient way to cook or reheat food, and can even be a healthier choice than some other methods of cooking. To understand the safety and health impacts of microwave cooking, it is important to first understand how a microwave oven works. Microwaves are a type of electromagnetic radiation, similar to radio waves, that are used to heat and cook food. When microwaves are absorbed by the water, fat, and sugar molecules in food, they cause the molecules to vibrate and create heat, which cooks the food. One concern about microwave cooking is that it may cause the food to lose nutrients. Some studies have found that microwave cooking can cause a small reduction in the levels of some nutrients, such as vitamin C and some B vitamins, in certain foods. However, other studies have found that microwave cooking can actually preserve the nutrient content of some foods, such as vegetables, better than other cooking methods, such as boiling or frying. Another concern about microwave cooking is that it may cause the food to become contaminated. It is true that microwaves can cause bacteria in food to grow and multiply, which can lead to food poisoning. However, this is not unique to microwave cooking – all methods of cooking have the potential to cause food contamination if the food is not handled or cooked properly. As long as you follow safe food handling and cooking practices, such as washing your hands and cooking food to the recommended internal temperature, the risk of food poisoning from microwave cooking is no greater than the risk from any other cooking method. In fact, microwave cooking can be a quick and convenient way to cook or reheat food, and it can be a healthier choice than some other methods of cooking, such as deep-frying. When you deep-fry food, you add a lot of extra fat and calories to the food, which can contribute to weight gain and other health problems. In contrast, microwave cooking requires very little added fat or oil, which can make it a healthier choice. It is also important to use microwave-safe containers when cooking food in a microwave oven. Some materials, such as certain types of plastic and metal, can melt or catch fire in the microwave, which can be dangerous. Make sure to use containers that are specifically designed for use in the microwave, and follow the cooking instructions on microwaveable products to ensure that the food is cooked properly. In conclusion, there is no evidence to suggest that food cooked in a microwave oven is bad for your health. While it is true that according to some studies, microwaves can cause some small reductions in the levels of certain nutrients in some foods, it is important to note that the overall nutritional value of the food is not significantly impacted. As long as you use microwave-safe containers and follow safe food handling and cooking practices, microwave cooking can be a safe and healthy way to prepare food."},{"instruction":"What's your single best piece of advice for anyone?","output":"I have two, and can't decide which is better.

High Initial Investment: Acquiring and implementing robotic systems can involve significant upfront costs. The cost of purchasing, installing, and maintaining robots, along with associated infrastructure and software, can be substantial. This initial investment may pose a financial challenge, particularly for small businesses or those operating on tight budgets. 2. Limited Adaptability: Robots are designed to perform specific tasks or functions based on their programming and physical capabilities. They lack the flexibility and adaptability of human workers, who can easily switch between various tasks or handle unforeseen situations. Robots may struggle to handle complex or non-routine tasks that require human creativity, problem-solving, or decision-making skills. 3. Potential Job Displacement: The introduction of robots in the workforce can lead to concerns about job displacement. Depending on the industry and nature of work, some tasks previously performed by humans may be automated, leading to a reduced demand for human labor in those areas. This can result in job losses or require reskilling and retraining of workers to adapt to new roles. 4. Maintenance and Downtime: Robots, like any mechanical systems, require regular maintenance and occasional repairs. Technical issues or breakdowns can cause downtime, disrupting operations and productivity. Maintaining a skilled workforce to service and repair robots, as well as managing spare parts and downtime, can add additional costs and logistical challenges. 5. Ethical Considerations: As robots become more sophisticated and capable, ethical considerations arise. Questions around robot autonomy, decision-making in critical situations, and the potential for misuse or unintended consequences need to be carefully addressed. Ensuring robots operate within ethical frameworks and align with societal values is an ongoing challenge. It's important to note that while there are disadvantages to using robots, many of these challenges can be mitigated with proper planning, training, and implementation strategies. Careful consideration of the specific requirements and potential impact on the workforce and ethical dimensions is essential when incorporating robots into any industry."},{"instruction":"What are your silly little parenting tricks that you're so glad you discovered?","output":"I discovered that imitating a monkey and walk around living room like one make your kids happy and they talk to you a lot more."},{"instruction":"Currently, what is the most efficient renewable energy source?","output":"Solar and wind"},{"instruction":"w do you fix a “disk is likely to fail soon” smart error (16.04, battery, disk, overheating, Linux)?","output":"The important thing here is that ‘soon’ could mean ‘in five minutes’.

For this, we need to study almost all interactions of the particles in the System, & their value of deviations should help retrieve lost informations and improve on standard deviations of final results. ©"},{"instruction":"Why do cats abandon their owners?","output":"Intact cats tend to take off and roam when seeking a mate.

That doesn’t mean I know how to pick it. Security works because of the underlying mathematics—specifically the difficulty in factoring large prime numbers—not because nobody knows how it works. My stalker is once again creating fake profiles that look just like mine to send rape threats to other people. If you receive an abusive PM or comment, please check the profile carefully. It isn’t me."},{"instruction":"Can we break any unpolarized beam of light into two orthogonal linearly polarized light beams?","output":"Yes; there are special prisms that do pretty much that. Really good (and expensive) ones can achieve purity of one of the beams considerably better than 1%, and that was what I saw almost 20 years ago. Things may be better today. The other polariztion was less pure but still well polarized. These prisms essentially used all the light, just routing the two polarizations over two orthogonal paths. If you just want two polarizations which are fairly good you can use much less expensive beam-splitting prisms and then use polarizing filters (sheets or camara filters) to get the desired polarization for each beam. The light loss is substantial (maybe 70%) but often tolerable. The more expensive method makes sense when the best polarization is required and maybe the light in the case is very expensive (like the output of a precision LASER)."},{"instruction":"w do I get someone's name by their mobile number?","output":"I’m a legal immigrant and naturalized citizen. I can tell you that it’s a difficult, expensive and frustrating process for those immigrants who follow the rules. I became a citizen two years ago and cried when I put my hand on my heart and sang the national anthem side by side with other new citizens. I’m here because I fell in love with and married an American man, to whom I’m still married 18 years later. He had to show evidence that he could provide for me and that I wouldn’t be a strain on the public purse. I had to undergo medical testing to show that I had no communicable diseases, provide proof of immunization and swear that I had no affiliation to political groups that run counter to American values. Later, I had to prove I had a good grasp of the English language (not a problem as I was born and raised in the UK) and understood the American system of government. I have never claimed welfare of any kind and became a taxpayer as soon as I received my work permit, early on in the process. All of that was inconvenient, but absolutely necessary. It is horrendously unfair to legal immigrants, (many of whom, unlike me, come from dangerous and impoverished backgrounds), to have unknown and uncounted numbers of illegals streaming in and pushing in front of them in the line. It causes terrible backlog in the immigration system, delaying the applications of legal immigrants. Furthermore, it encourages the cartels to continue their human smuggling operations, causing great suffering to many of these people. It’s also extremely threatening to American culture, because while legal immigrants are limited by quotas per country (to avoid problems with lack of integration), Central American illegal immigrants are overwhelming entire communities. That’s not a criticism of their culture, it’s simply saying that their culture is not our culture. It’s also dangerous and irresponsible to allow multitudes of people to settle here when we simply don’t know who they are; are they sick with some communicable disease? Are they drug users? Are they gang members? Are they terrorists? Maybe, maybe not. We simply don’t know. I also think that it undermines the integrity of our justice system. Why should some obey the law if others flout it so openly? The law is impartial and protects us all equally, but now it’s beginning to seem as though we have different tiers of society - those who have to follow the rules and those who thumb their noses at it. This doesn’t always work perfectly, but I believe that the US constitution is the finest example of this intention anywhere in the world. I do have sympathy for these people. I’m a grandchild of 4 refugees (all Iranian jews), who fled their country with the clothes on their backs (literally). They never had any kind of welfare other than that provided by community charity, but worked hard and all of their children became fully integrated, useful contributors to society. I believe that to solve the problem of illegal immigration, we need to remove the incentives for people to come here illegally. A welfare system and unfettered immigration are two things that cannot coexist. Also, birthright citizenship is simply ridiculous in this day and age and we are one of the only developed countries that continues to offer this. If the mother doesn’t have legal status then the child also should not. Lastly, we can’t allow people to enter and stay here, just because they are in custody of a child. It has led to terrible, unconscionable abuse of children, with some of these kids being ‘recycled’ by cartel smugglers and also being exposed to illness and abuse along the way. I wouldn’t be against some kind of immigration reform, perhaps something that allows a greater number of work permits or even new pathways to citizenship, but it must be legal! I hope that people will begin to understand this and stop with the emotional blackmail tactics (“kids in cages” “concentration camps”)."},{"instruction":"What will happen to the twin flame runner if he does not do the inner healing work?","output":"I wouldn’t worry about that. I know you want to know that if he doesn’t do his inner healing, you might not get into permanent union. He is learning and evolving by experiencing life lessons, especially if he isn't spiritually involved or evolved/matrix twin. He is also being guided by higher power. You do the inner work for you. It will improve your quality of life. Don’t focus on his issues and try to work according to that. Connect to your guidance and see where you are being directed. You cannot heal for him nor can you tell him what to do. Both the twins learn through experiencing life. If you are a twin, any answers for your journey are unlocked in divine timing and by going within. Source wouldn’t want you to spend a lot of money on anything external to you."},{"instruction":"w should I write a speech about pets are for people who don't have children?","output":"Since that is utterly and completely stupid and wrong you should change your topic. You are denying children the joy of having a pet and writing a speech with that kind of hideous message would make you a pariah and worthy only of derision and public flogging. Change your speech to “Pets are a joy to own and here’s why.” Stop being a freak."},{"instruction":"Costco dog food good?","output":"Costco dog food is a popular choice for many pet owners in search of good quality nutrition for their canine family members.

The British colony became Malaysia and the Dutch colony became Indonesia. If they had never colonised the region, there would be no Malaysia and no Indonesia, but there would also be no country encompassing what is now Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Brunei (and even into the Philippines and parts of mainland Southeast Asia). There would be various countries like in Europe. There are also people who think that before the arrival of the British and the Dutch, the people of the region lived in one country, which is not true."},{"instruction":"w have you, as a survivor of narcissistic abuse, detached yourself from the trauma bond that is formed as a result of the abuse?

This is ideal because one may change the pattern as and when they please and it’s definitely less messy, compared to painting. Try to make kaleidoscopic patterns or you could also experiment with some cut-out mandalas designs."},{"instruction":"f you tell a taxi or Uber driver to just drive, where will they go?","output":"Iam not a truck driver I am the wife of a truck driver"},{"instruction":"Can someone who is wellinformed about guns tell me all the terminology related to guns? For example, magazines, clips, assault rifles, assault guns, assault weapons, ARs, etc.","output":"Absolutely. Google and Wikipedia are your knowledgeable friends. Simply query your specific, singular question, and voila, your answer appears nearly instantly. For example, the letters AR are commonly used shorthand representing ARMALITE RIFLE."},{"instruction":"What's your single best piece of advice for anyone?","output":"A young boy travelled far away form his home to study under a great teacher. When he met the wise old man, his first question was, ‘how long will it take me before I am wise as you?’ “The response came swiftly, ‘Five years.’ “’This is a very long time,’ the boy replied. ‘How about if I work twice as hard?’ “’Then it will take ten,’ said the master. “Ten! That’s far too long. How much if studied all day and well into the night, every night?’ “’Fifteen years,’ said the master. “’I don’t understand,’ replied the boy. ‘Every time I promise to devote more energy to my goal, you tell me that it will take longer. Why?’ “’The answer is simple. With one eye fixed on the destination, there is only one left to guide you along the journey.’” from the book, The Man Who Sold His Ferrari. Thanks for reading. :)"},{"instruction":"w does one get officially married if they don’t believe in God? Would you still have to have a priest?","output":"I went to a Roman Catholic wedding one time to discover from the priest that marriage is the one sacrament which his church doesn’t require a priest to enact. Two people on a desert island can marry each other and be recognized by such in the eyes of the church. This is a practical theology, and the history of Christendom has lots and lots of people who were “married” after they moved in together and proven fertile. In many common-law states, all people have to do is represent themselves as being married and they are married. (In the eyes of the state). Lots of places recognize marriages performed outside their jurisdiction which could not legally be done within that jurisdiction. “Officially” depends upon which officiality you care about. There is no universal officiality."},{"instruction":"Why is the microwave oven harmful to food?","output":"No, food cooked in a microwave oven is not necessarily bad for your health. Microwave ovens use electromagnetic radiation to cook food, which is similar to radio waves but at a higher frequency. This radiation causes the water molecules in the food to vibrate, generating heat and cooking the food. Microwaving food can actually be a healthier cooking method than some others because it requires less added fat and can help preserve more of the nutrients in the food. However, it is important to use microwave-safe containers and follow the manufacturer's instructions to ensure safe and effective cooking.Some concerns have been raised about the potential health effects of microwaves themselves, such as radiation exposure or changes in the molecular structure of the food. However, these concerns are generally unfounded as the levels of radiation emitted by microwave ovens are well below the safety limits set by regulatory agencies. Additionally, any changes to the molecular structure of food are likely to be minimal and not harmful to health.Overall, cooking food in a microwave oven can be a safe and convenient method, as long as proper precautions are taken and the food is cooked thoroughly."},{"instruction":"f Parshuram is the incarnation of Vishnu, then why didn't Parshuram recognize Ram during the breaking of the Shiva bow event?","output":"According to Puranas, Parasurama was the 6th incarnation of Lord Vishnu. He makes a brief appearance in Srimad Ramayana in penultimate Sargas of Bala Kanda. His story, in his own words, as described in those penultimate Sargas of Bala Kanda of Srimad Ramayana is as follows: Vishnu handed over a supreme bow to Sage Riciika, the son of Bhrigu, as a trustworthy trust. That great-resplendent Sage Riciika on his part has handed over this divine bow to his son with unmatchable deeds of religious merit, who is my father Sage Jamadagni. Adhering to a barbarous mentality Kaartvaviirya Arjuna put my father to death, when the ascetically powerful father of mine has isolated himself from arsenal. (Bala kanda 75th Sarga 24 -27 Slokas) “On hearing the unregenerate and highly perfidious murdering of my father, Irancorously extirpated Kshatriya-s as and when they are born, that too not for one time, going around the earth... and on getting the entire earth under my control I performed Vedic-ritual, and at the end of that Vedic-ritual, I gave all that earth to sage Kashyapa, a sage with divine soul and with pious observances, as a ritualistic-generosity... and I am at present on Mt. Mahendra practising ascesis and thus conjoined are the powers of ascesis in me.\\" \\"On hearing about the breakage of Shiva's longbow, then I promptly came here. Thereby, oh, Rama, wield this supernatural and superlative longbow of Vishnu, which is passed on to me from my forefathers and my father. Keep your fealty to Kshatriya-hood in view, and wield this as you have wielded Shiva's longbow” --------------------------- The Story of Parasurama also appears in Mahabharata, wherein it was mentioned that Drona obtained all his divine weapons from the former. Drona heard that the illustrious Brahmana Jamadagnya, Rama the son of Jamadagni, had expressed a desire of giving away all his wealth to Brahmanas. Having heard of Rama's knowledge of arms and of his celestial weapons also, Drona, who set his heart upon them as also upon the knowledge of morality that Rama possessed, set out for the Mahendra mountains. Arrived at Mahendra, Drona approached Rama the son of Jamadagni, worshipped Rama's feet, and told him that he came there with the desire of obtaining his wealth.' On hearing him, Rama said that he gave away his gold and whatever other wealth he had to Brahmanas! He further stated that the earth also, to the verge of the sea, decked with towns and cities, as with a garland of flowers, was given unto Kasyapa. And, he added that he was left with his body only and his various valuable weapons and that he was prepared to give either his body or his weapons. Drona prayed to give him all his weapons together with the mysteries of hurling and recalling them and Rama gave all his weapons to Drona, -------------------------If we study these 2 stories in depth, we will find 2 contradictions. 1) If the Parasu Rama the son of Jamadagni extirpated Kshatriya-s many times by going around the earth, then lineage of both Ikshvaku's, to which Dasaratha belonged, and Nimi's, to which Janaka belonged to, must have been broken, as Parasu Rama might have eliminated Kshatriya-s of both lineages. However, while describing the lineages of Ikshvaku's and Nimi's during the marriage ceremony of Sri Rama and Sita, Sage Valmiki did not mention about breakage of those lineages due to Parasu Rama's adventures. 2) In Mahabharata it was mentioned that Drona obtained all his divine weapons from Parasu Rama. Mahabharata followed Srimad Ramayana, as mention about Sri Rama can be found in Mahabharata but not about Pandavas in Srimad Ramayana. Many such instances can be quoted. So if Parasu Rama distributed all his riches along with entire land on earth to Kashyapa and retired to Mt. Mahendra for practising ascesis, how can he still wait for Drona of Mahabharata era for imparting knowledge in divine weapons and then retire to Mt. Mahendra? The answer is clear. Parasu Rama existed only in Mahabharata era but not in Srimad Ramayana era. Some learned Vaishnavites might have inserted at a latter date the story of Parasu Rama confronting Sri Rama, the son of Dasaratha, in Srimad Ramayana to make believe the readers that Rama the son of Jamadagni was holder of Supreme Vaishnava Bow and he was infact the incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Hence, we can conclude that Parasu Rama was not the incarnation of Lord Vishnu."},{"instruction":"What are the things that our brain constantly lies to us about?","output":"Have you ever heard the term “cognitive distortion?” It’s the way behavioral psychology tell you that your thoughts lie to you. The first person to come up with the cognitive distortion theory was Aaron Beck. A bit later, David Burns made it popular. Let’s take a look at the most common cognitive distortions, or, the most frequent ways our brains deceive us. Filtering: I go out on a date and it goes OK except for one small thing. I end up convinced the date was terrible. Filtering happens any time one detail filters out everything else. Polarized thinking: if I don’t get something perfect, then I suck. Polarized thinking is black or white, while reality is every shade and color. Generalization: one bad break-up convinces me I’m terrible at relationships. Generalization tells me one incident is proof that this is what will happen every time. Jumping to conclusions: someone is in a bad mood and my conclusion is that they hate me. Jumping to conclusions convinces me that I can determine another person’s thoughts or feelings, or predict things with no real basis to do so. Catastrophizing: my brain tells me that the only possible scenario is the worst case scenario, and that it will all happen to me. Personalization: my brain tells me that whatever happened happened because of me. This artist is also known as “taking things personally.” Control fallacies: my brain believes it’s in complete control of everything (you must be in a bad mood because of something I said), or in complete control of nothing (what’s the point of hard work if I am going to fail anyway?) Fallacy of fairness: this is when the fact that something isn’t fair fills me with anger and resentment. The fact is, things will very often not go my way. Blame: this is when we hold others responsible for our how we feel. He couldn’t make me happy, she makes me feel like a failure, he makes me feel like I can’t get anything right. Shoulds: this is when our head is full of things we and others should do. When they don’t happen the way they should, we feel either guilt or resentment. Emotional reasoning: this convinces me that my feelings determine truth. If I am angry, then that means you wronged me. The fact is, our emotions do not reflect truth. They just reflect how we feel. Fallacy of change: we believe another person has to change for us. I am very jealous, so you need to please stop seeing other people. I feel lonely so you need to keep me company. Global labeling: one person does one thing and that is enough information for me to determine that he is cool or a loser or a bad parent. Always being right: when being right is more important than another person’s feelings, or their friendship, or the possibility that they might be right even in the presence of me laying out a good argument. Heaven’s reward: that a force larger than us keeps score and that our good behavior will be rewarded. There are many, many other cognitive distortions: we underestimate our resilience, our attention is biased which makes our conclusions wrong, we don’t remember things the way they happened, we have unrelenting high standards, believe that the rules that apply to everyone do not apply to us, think our perspective is the only perspective, that berating ourselves will motivate us, that we should not give up on something we already invested a lot in, assume feelings are forever, see things the way people around us see them, assume people think like we think, prefer things that are familiar even if something else might be better, believe we can multi-task, repeat the same behavior and expect different results, and well. The conclusion is our brain cannot be trusted."},{"instruction":"w do I start making money at a young age?","output":"You can grow your own [LINKED_TEXT: business at any age] [URL: https://www.standout.digital/post/step-by-step-guide-to-kickstart-your-business-at-any-age] and laying the foundation for your future success for that Educate yourself in finance, both business, and personal.

With meticulous attention, we shall dissect these changes, meticulously dissecting each century, and subsequently extrapolate these remarkable trends into the boundless realm of the future. In the 15th to 16th century, a remarkable period known as the Renaissance emerged, characterized by a profound resurgence of Classical knowledge and sagacity. This extraordinary era paved the way for the exploration of scientific truths, igniting the flames of discovery and enlightenment. The advent of remarkable innovations, such as the printing press, has undeniably served as a catalyst for the dissemination of knowledge throughout the ages. In the wondrous epoch spanning the 16th to the 17th century, humanity bore witness to a profound transformation known as the Scientific Revolution. It was during this extraordinary era that the seeds of the scientific method were sown, forever altering the course of human inquiry and understanding. The profound advancements of instruments such as the telescope and microscope have served to augment our comprehension of the vast cosmos and the intricate workings of the biological realm. In the grand tapestry of human history, a remarkable epoch known as the Enlightenment unfurled its intellectual wings during the transition from the 17th to the 18th century. It was a time when the luminous beacon of reason illuminated the minds of many, and the cherished ideals of individualism were exalted. In the grand tapestry of human history, a momentous epoch unfolded known as the industrial revolution. This transformative era heralded a profound transition from the tranquil realms of agrarian economies to the bustling domains of industry and manufacturing. In the transition from the 18th to the 19th century, the profound impact of the Industrial Revolution reverberated throughout societies, reshaping the very fabric of human existence. The advent of railroads, propelled by the mighty force of steam power, and the remarkable telegraph system, ushered in a transformative era of unparalleled progress in the realms of transportation and communication. In the transition from the 19th to the 20th century, the relentless march of progress persisted, unveiling a cascade of technological marvels that would forever alter the course of human history. Among these remarkable innovations were the magnificent automobiles, soaring airplanes, and the awe-inspiring computers. In the grand tapestry of human progress, a resolute movement emerged, advocating for the noble ideals of universal education, healthcare, and civil rights. In the transition from the 20th to the 21st century, humanity witnessed the emergence of a remarkable era known as the Information Age. This epoch reached its zenith through the advent of the internet, artificial intelligence, and the awe-inspiring field of biotechnology. In this wondrous era of globalization, our planet has witnessed a remarkable surge in interconnectedness, forging bonds that span across vast distances. However, as we traverse this intricate web of interdependence, we encounter formidable trials that demand our attention, such as the pressing issue of climate change and the persistent specter of inequality. As we embark on a journey of projection, let us cast our gaze a hundred years into the future. In light of these remarkable evolutionary trends, we can envision a myriad of possibilities that may unfold in the forthcoming century: In contemplating the future of technology and artificial intelligence, one can envision a world where these remarkable advancements become an inseparable part of our everyday existence. In contemplating the future, one cannot help but envision a world where the realms of AI and automation reign supreme, overseeing vast domains of human existence. From the intricate web of transportation networks to the delicate realm of healthcare, and even the intricate dance of manufacturing, these technologies hold the potential to govern and shape our lives in profound ways. In contemplating the future of human social interaction, one cannot help but envision a world where virtual and augmented realities have seamlessly integrated into the fabric of our everyday lives. These transformative technologies hold the potential to transcend the boundaries of physical space, allowing individuals to engage in shared experiences and forge connections in ways previously unimaginable. As we peer into the vast expanse of possibilities that lie ahead, it is not inconceivable to envision a future where the utilization of virtual and augmented realities becomes as commonplace as the air we breathe. Health and Longevity: The remarkable progress in medical science holds the potential to usher in an era of personalized treatments, where the exquisite precision of gene editing can be harnessed to enhance our well-being. Through these advancements, the boundaries of life expectancy may be pushed beyond their current limitations, offering us the tantalizing prospect of extended and enriched existence. The convergence of biology and technology may, in fact, obfuscate the demarcation between humanity and machinery. The profound environmental impact of our actions necessitates the advancement of sustainable technologies, which, in an ideal world, would possess the capacity to effectively mitigate the perils of climate change. In contemplating the future, we envision a world where the boundless potential of renewable energy sources illuminates entire metropolises, casting aside the shackles of fossil fuel dependency. Moreover, we foresee a paradigm shift in our approach to sustenance, as the cultivation of nourishment transcends traditional boundaries and embraces the marvels of laboratory-grown meat, fostering efficiency and ecological harmony. In contemplating the intricate tapestry of societal structure, one cannot help but ponder the potential trajectory that lies before us. Should the prevailing patterns persist unabated, it is conceivable that a resolute impetus towards parity and the unimpeded dissemination of knowledge and wellness shall endure. However, it is of utmost importance to carefully navigate the societal ramifications of automation, particularly in terms of job displacement. In the grand tapestry of cosmic exploration, humanity's aspirations extend beyond the confines of our celestial abode. We envision a future where our species, propelled by unyielding curiosity, shall forge enduring colonies upon distant planets and moons, perhaps even the enigmatic realm of Mars. The vast expanse of space holds the potential to emerge as a novel frontier for the pursuit of knowledge, the acquisition of valuable resources, and conceivably, the establishment of human settlements. The profound interdependence of our planet may indeed require novel modes of governance and ethical contemplation, especially in light of technology's profound impact on the human experience and the consequential quandaries entwined with artificial intelligence, privacy, and the sanctity of human rights. In a grand synthesis, envision life a century hence as an enthralling amalgamation of technological prowess, societal enlightenment, and uncharted cosmic horizons, interwoven with the enduring quest to uphold parity, ethical stewardship, and ecological equilibrium. It is a grand vista brimming with boundless possibilities, yet intertwined with intricate intricacies that mankind shall endeavor to traverse."},{"instruction":"w do I get my neighbor to accept the survey staking of our shared property line that is in dispute?

And, especially if it is a large size. Imagine, you’re walking on the street. It’s a fresh morning and you’re heading towards your workplace with a sufficiently positive mindset towards your life. And, suddenly you see this besides the road: A person with his/her robust big eyes and open mouth attacking a 3 layered food with a destructive mindset as if there will be no tomorrow. Not only that, he/she is feeding ketchup and mayonnaise to his/her lips, cheeks, noses, fingers, and to the table as well. Every time he/she takes a bite, an innocent piece of lettuce slips from that burger and falls down on the food tray like a paper napkin gets dropped inside the trash can. By the way, do you know why McDonald's doesn’t provide ketchup with their fries? Because the customer needs to buy a burger first and paint his/her whole face with that burger sauce.

Aston Villa vs Leicester City : Premier League, 2015 Leicester City were unbeaten in the Premier League up until this point last season, as they walked on to the King Power Stadium to face Aston Villa. But unfortunately for the future Champions, Villa seemed to have them beat after Charles Gil tucked in the second goal fifteen minutes after the start of the second half. Things looked down and out for Ranieri’s men as they looked on course to suffer their first defeat of the season. However, just when things looked like they could have gotten worse, Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood handed them a lifeline. In a rather bizarre decision, the 48-year-old brought on two players but instead of bringing on two defensive players that he had on the bench, Sherwood brought on not one, but two strikers. From that point, things went downhill for Aston Villa as neither of the two changes made much impact, instead, it was Leicester City who changed the course of the game. Ritchie de Laet volleyed in the first goal of the comeback, before Jamie Vardy and Nathan Dyer clawed out two brilliant goals and finished the game with less than a minute of normal time to go. Extra time wouldn’t make any difference and Leicester went on to win both the game and later on the Premier League title. 2. Liverpool vs Manchester United: English Premier League, 2015 Less than a minuted and a half was all that it took for Steven Gerrard to get sent off, after his half-time introduction. The Liverpool captain was brought on after Liverpool went 1-0 down and Brenden Rodgers hoped that the experienced midfielder could inspire a comeback. However, the Liverpool legend spent less than a minute in his final Liverpool vs Manchester United match, after Atkinson barely hesitated and he brandished the red card after Gerrard appeared to have stamped on Ander Herrera. The central midfielder began his rather bizarre final derby in the famed red jersey with a brutal but legal challenge on Juan Mata, who had given the Red Devils their first half lead. Gerrard got the ball a few seconds later and just as he passed it towards the flanks, Herrera attempted to win the ball back which lead to Gerrard stamping him on his leg. The Reds were down to ten men and Liverpool fought back after Mata doubled the lead through Sturridge, who managed pulled one back for Liverpool but in the end it wasn’t enough. The red card meant that Gerrard missed the league matches against both Newcastle at home and Arsenal, the FA Cup replay and lost the chance to make himself an even bigger legend in his last United Derby! 3. Argentina vs Hungary: 2005, Friendly August 16th, 2005, Lisandro Lopez walks towards the touchline and leaves the field, not before patting the eighteen-year-old who was replacing him on the back. The eighteen-year-old, wearing the number eighteen just happened to be the player that would go on to dominate football in the near future. Lionel Messi walked on, making his debut for the Argentina national team, having won the U-20 World Cup less than two months before. The rival was Hungary, the same team that Diego Maradona had made his debut against back in 1977 and with Jose Pekerman’s Argentina leading 2-1, it seemed the perfect moment to bring on the starlet. The Barcelona player walked on and was immediately thrust into the play, Argentina was on the attack and Bernardi found Messi with a good pass. The then 18-year-old wearing the number 18, easily turned and drove towards the area, and had defender Vanczak right beside him, trying to get the ball off him. The Argentine raised his hands to fend off the challenge and the defender fell like he was hit by a truck, clutching his face. The referee called it a foul and then walked towards Messi, pulling out his red card and sent the forward walking back, less than three minutes after he walked out for his debut. Later an inconsolable Messi said, “It's an embarrassment, they're not going to call me up anymore,\\" and luckily that hasn’t turned out to be the case but the superstar is yet to win an international trophy!

The league has become one of the most popular and lucrative cricket leagues in the world, attracting top players from around the globe. The league has a large following and attracts millions of viewers both in India and around the world. Click here to know more about IPL cricket match: [LINKED_TEXT: IPL Cricket Match: A Festival of Power and EntertainmentThe Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India that takes place annually in the months of April and May. The IPL was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2008 and has since then become one of the most popular and lucrative cricket leagues in the world. The league features teams representing different cities in India, and each team is made up of a combination of Indian and international players. The IPL cricket match is not just a sporting event, but a festival of power and entertainment that brings together cricket fans from all over the world. The Excitement of Scoring in IPL Cricket One of the most exciting aspects of the IPL cricket match is the scoring. In T20 cricket, the aim is to score as many runs as possible in 20 overs, and this leads to some high-scoring games. The IPL scorecard is always filled with big numbers, and fans love to see their favorite players hitting sixes and fours. The league has witnessed some incredible batting performances over the years, with players like Chris Gayle, AB de Villiers, and Virat Kohli hitting massive scores. In fact, Kohli holds the record for the most runs scored in the IPL, with over 6000 runs to his name. The Thrill of IPL Auctions Another aspect of the IPL that generates a lot of excitement is the IPL auction. Before the start of each season, teams have to bid for players in an auction process. This is where some of the biggest names in cricket are bought and sold for huge sums of money. The IPL auction has become a major event in itself, with fans and experts eagerly waiting to see which players will be bought by which teams. The auction is also a chance for young, talented players to showcase their skills and get noticed by the big teams. Action-Packed IPL Matches But the real action takes place on the field, with each IPL match being a thrilling display of power and skill. The matches are played in packed stadiums, with fans cheering on their teams and creating a festive atmosphere. A significant part of the game is the IPL power play, which consists of the first six overs of each inning during which only two fielders are permitted outside the 30-yard circle, and teams try to maximize their score during this period. Bowlers try to take wickets, and batsmen try to hit as many runs as possible, making for an exciting battle between bat and ball. MS Dhoni: The Iconic IPL Player One of the most iconic players in the IPL is MS Dhoni. Dhoni is the captain of the Chennai Super Kings, one of the most successful teams in the league's history. He is known for his calm demeanor, sharp cricketing mind, and incredible finishing skills. Dhoni has led his team to three IPL titles and is widely regarded as one of the best captains in the history of cricket. His presence on the field is enough to intimidate the opposition, and his fans adore him for his leadership and achievements.

Burning of natural gas generated carbonmonoxide i.e. carbon & oxygen. Natural gas composition is carbon & hydrogen. So hydrogen & oxygen are very different elements i.e. Hydrogen has ONE electron, Oxygen has SIX electrons in its outer orbit. So hydrogen diffuses very fast than Oxygen. Propane is heavier than air, so a leak could potentially fill up a room, creating both a risk of asphyxiation or explosion. In market combo detectors are available which can detect carbonmonoxide & smoke (fire sensors)."},{"instruction":"What are the connections between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Muslim Turkic countries of Tatarstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Uyghur East Turkestan?","output":"There are a few things in the question that do not make any sense. Some of the Turkic nations mentioned above are not countries at all. Let’s begin with Tatarstan. Tatarstan or the Republic of Tatarstan is a province of the Russian Federation. Not an individual nation. Tatarstan as a part of the Russian Federation Next lets view the Uyghur East Turkestan. East Turkestan is not a nation either. The last time one can make an argument for it have been independent was in the 1940s for some time. Since then it has been a part of China. Currently it exists as the province of Xinjiang in China. Xinjiang, China East Turkestan as it once was for a few years. Now that leaves us with Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. These are actually independent nations, rather than provinces. The first thing to note is that all four of these nations are officially secular, not Islamic republics. However all of them are Muslim majority nations. Another thing to note is that Pakistan is not a Turkic nation. While there are some Turkic people in Pakistan such as the Hazara and Uzbek, the majority of Pakistani people are not Turkic. As for the similarity in the names of these nations. The suffix -stan means land/place of in the Persian language. That is why it is used so often in this region. For example the name Kazakhstan translates to the land of the Kazakhs. Turkmenistan Lets begin with the fact that Pakistan was one of the first nations to recognize Turkmenistan after its independence in 1991. Currently both nations are a part of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO). Pakistan has also allowed Turkmenistan the use of the Gwadar Port for trade. Both nations are working together on the Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan–India Pipeline. This pipeline will benefit all those involved and should be completed by the end of 2020. Uzbekistan Pakistan was one of the first nations to recognize Uzbekistan following its independence from the USSR in 1991. Soon afterwards the relations between the two nations worsened. This was due to the Afghan Civil War following the withdrawal of the Soviet forces. In this civil war, many nations were supporting different factions to gain influence over the nation in turmoil. Pakistan and Uzbekistan supported different factions. Pakistan was supporting Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and his Hezb-e-Islami. In the later stages of the war, Pakistan switched it’s support to the Taliban. Uzbekistan supported Abdul Rashid Dostum and his Junbish-i-Milli. This resulted in poor relations between Uzbekistan and Pakistan. Following the US invasion and fall of the Taliban and the death of Uzbekistan’s dictator, Islam Karimov, the relationship between the two nations has improved. Both nations have much to offer each other. Uzbekistan is a land locked nation that requires access to the maritime trade. Pakistan needs access to the Central Asian market. Both nations are also a part of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) and Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). If we look at it from a historical perspective, Uzbekistan has effected Pakistan more so than any other on this list. For example even the founder of the Mughal Empire, Babur, was from Uzbekistan. More specifically near the city of Andijan in the Ferghana Valley. A statue to Babur in the city of Andijan, Uzbekistan Kazakhstan Pakistan was once again one of the earliest nations to recognize Kazakhstan’s independence. Since then the two nations have always been on good terms. Kazakhstan, like Uzbekistan, is a land-locked nation. Development of a proper safe route can help increase the trade and relations between the two. Both nations are members of Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) and Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO). Kazakhstan has previously expressed that it would like to train some of it’s troops in Pakistan. Lets look at how Kazakhstan has historically influenced Pakistan. The Kazakh Khanate defeated the Uzbeks and drove them south. If it were not for this, then Muhammad Shaybani Khan would not have been able to unite the Uzbeks under him to drive out the Timurids from their homes. This included Babur from Ferghana and forcing him to flee to Kabul. From Kabul, Babur would launch his invasion of Hindustan and the rest we all know. \\"I will never forget that Pakistan is one of the first countries to support our independence movement.\\"- President Nursultan Nazarbayev President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan established ties soon after it’s independence from the Soviet Union. Since then the two nations have economic ties and friendly relations. However the relationship between the two in not very significant. In either a positive or negative manner. Historically speaking Abu Mansur Sabuktigin, the father of Mahmud of Ghazni, was originally from Kyrgyzstan near Lake Issyk-Kul. If it were not for him being taken as a slave, a large part of Pakistan may not be Muslim majority.

When something is found that is complex in biology, such as the bacterial flagellum (commonly used as evidence for intelligent design), intelligent design supports insist that investigation stops because the complexity is supposed so great that there is no way this thing could have evolved naturally. Further investigation (as with the bacterial flagellum) can show that the unexplainable complexity can actually be explained, and the origin of the flagellum from simpler systems is not only possible, but likely. “Intelligent design” is the closing of minds. It’s anti-science."},{"instruction":"What is your favorite guitar joke?","output":"My favorite guitarist joke is this: Q: What do you call a lead guitarist with excellent rhythm?

We never had that happen but when someone was knocking on the door in the middle of the night and I was telling him go away, my boyfriend came down with a gun and opened the door. The mad decided to leave so boyfriend went around the house and down the driveway to make sure he was gone. He was living on a farm when he came home and saw police on the other side of the road. He took a gun and went to the neighbors who were on vacation and walked through their farm then home. He was sitting on the porch when the police came petting his cat and had his gun against the wall. They said the dog tracked him and he explained he was watching their place since they were not home."},{"instruction":"Who was the superior sniper, Chris Kyle or Carlos Hathcock?","output":"Not even a question, Carlos Hathcock; but I will admit that the comparison is apples to oranges. Urban setting vs the Jungle. What factors are being used to describe the superior sniper? What made Chris Kyle superb was his bravery. His resume reflected combat experience as a sniper in the worst possible areas of Iraq at the worst possible times. In 2004, what was the worst possible area to be? Fallujah! In 2005–2007 Ramadi / Habbaniyah / 2008 Baghdad in Sadr City. There is far more to being a sniper than being a trigger-puller. The information gathering is the most important role. It was actually more advantageous for snipers to call in enemy forces so QRF could kill / capture or kill them from indirect fire by mortars. That way, the snipers could continue thei mission since some areas were so contested that there was little to no coalition support. Chris Kyle had high body counts because his deployments were in extremely target-rich environments. Most were not difficult shots whatsoever. He had way over 160 kills. It only makes sense to. How the SEALs made it home with limited casualties is a testament that God loves the SEALs. They would be the first ones into areas with no coalition presence of Ramadi and once they sent that first round, that hide site became a defensive position and the whole city was gunning for them. He was in the midst of the craziest areas at the craziest of times. He was in AO Topeka twice when it was at its peak. To those who were not deployed to the area during this time, it was INSANE. I only expected to get shot at once per week. Instead, we got mortared while back at the FOB, heading out to mission would hit at least one IED, once we got to location and hit the target, it wouldn’t be long before getting attacked then on the way home they’d definitely have an IED or 2 waiting for us to return to base. This was also during the period when the locals began defending their neighborhood. They had no uniform and would appear to be an insurgent unless notified prior. Communication was always an issue. It has been implied by some that a portion of his confirmed kills were actually friendly. This happened a lot of times, and I was told that Chris Kyle I believe this would’ve happened at least several times, but not necessarily due to Chris Kyle’s fault. Carlos Hancock has some absolutely crazy stories that are completely different than experiences Chris Kyle had. Hancock had to have much more patience and had the classic sniper due type battles that one traditionally thinks of when they think of what a sniper is. His battles are exactly the type of experience sniper school is created for while Chris Kyle was in situations where he’d be able to get off one shot and then be completely outnumbered by the enemy where the enemy could camoflauge itself within the population and the rules of engagement were part of the enemy’s armory. There is no data set that would allow a an accurate correlation between the two. A true comparison has to include all the different outliers and there is no possible calculation to find which of the two is superior. But I’d still put my money on Hancock based on the few amount of people who could accomplish what he did versus what Chris Kyle did. There are already people who have exceeded Chris Kyle’s accomplishments, you just haven’t heard about it."},{"instruction":"w is HTTPS any more secure than HTTP if literally anyone can implement it?","output":"I think you may not understand what “secure” means. In this context, it means “protects content”. HTTP does not protect anything about the transaction from snooping or interference. HTTPS does: you can tell that the client contacted the server, but you have very little further information. The client can also be fairly certain they’re talking to the authentic server. The security of the design wouldn’t matter if no one could implement it, or just people whose name begins with ‘K’, or everyone. Arguably a protocol is more secure if anyone can understand and implement it, since there are more opportunities to find and test for faults. Nothing about the system’s security depends on hiding the implementation - there are keys that must be kept private, but not the protocol. I wonder if that’s your misunderstanding. The protocol is not like a secret handshake, that if you know how to do it, you can defeat the “security”."},{"instruction":"What is a proxy, and how can I use one?","output":"If you need to get some data from the Internet, you go to a site and you search for it. But, this way your public IP address is noticeable to other people and you're utilizing restricted assets. Anyway you can use proxies to do the work for you. They are like mediator that sends a request to your site to get information and afterward recovers the information for you. A proxy is an alternate IP address you get, when you interface with a proxy server. since proxies have many benefits. A proxy has its own IP address, so you can conceal yours. You can utilize it to change your current location. It's particularly valuable for things like unblocking content or doing statistical surveying in an alternate locale when you don't need your location to affect the information you get. You can channel all approaching and active requests so you can impede malicious substance or limit admittance to specific sites like a firewall. If you need, you can even follow what your representatives are browsing for while at work. You can automate a large number of tasks. Price aggregation, data scraping, multiple account management, sneaker shopping - these are only a few examples of how proxies can save you time. Another way a proxy server saves you time is by accelerating your internet connection on that each time you enter a similar site there's no compelling reason to recover the information again - it has already been cached by the proxy server."},{"instruction":"it true that more and more male youths in both the UK and the USA are becoming more socially conservative, such that feminism will fade away within the next generation?","output":"How are the two phenomena related?

The lockdown declared on 22nd of March and started from 24th of March that time only 500 positive cases of covid-19 reported. Now when 90000 new cases are reported every day we are not in a condition to lockdown personally. More than near about 25 million people lost their job due to lockdown and most of the public services are suspended including transport and others. The decision taken without the experts guideline for lockdown and now we are suffering. Actually presently we need the lockdown all over the country for minimum 15 days.

How can I keep going along with my diet?","output":"You may not like this answer BUT the problem is your planned diet, NOT your adherence to it. Animals regulate their body weight quite effectively. If one inserts a weight into the abdomen of rodents, they eat less until they have returned to their original weight. Animals can tell when they have too little or too much of any nutrient. Not only do they choose foods with different levels of macronutrients, but they choose between animal and plant proteins. They can choose by flavor and aroma between foods based on even micronutrients because those appear in groupings rather than as individual traces. Do you have an attraction or an aversion to particular flavors such as bitter vegetables? Humans ARE animals and DO sense both weight and diet balance BUT they ignore what their bodies are telling them. They treat diet as a religion and honor it before their senses. To state that differently, “Do you believe your diet plan or your lying eyes”. STOP dieting! STOP counting calories and grams and steps. STOP expecting some spreadsheet to tell you what your body should be telling you. The problem is NOT too much fat OR too much starch OR too little protein. All of those are excuses for junk food. The big deal here is that modern ultra-processed foods confuse the natural feedback system. Understand that protein shakes and bars and keto products are all ultra-processed and are as much junk food as candy bars. Start by eliminating sweeteners. That first includes nutritive sweeteners such as table sugar (sucrose) and high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) but eventually honey, agave nectar, and even artificial sweeteners. Next comes alcohol. Males, especially younger ones, often succeed by just controlling those.

They stop menstruating somewhere below 20% body fat and often remain hungry until they range from 25%-30% body fat. We cannot maintain nor return to a skinny middle-school body BUT most of us respond to muscle mass similarly to fat mass. My wife and I lose at least one pound of fat for each pound of muscle that we GAIN. Forget the aerobics and do resistance/weightlifting. While it may not show a lot on the scale, both women and men look and feel better with more muscle even with the same weight. Fill your pantry with foods that are healthy REGARDLESS of how much you eat and then wait. You will naturally choose a balanced diet from those even though an individual meal or snack may seem unbalanced. Start with a well-researched HEALTHY diet, NOT the fad of the week or the cover of the latest “Women’s Day”.

While it sounds far-fetched, it’s true - and this isn’t some sort of a privilege reserved for government employees, is exempted from any train fare so that tourists can visit the Bhakra-Nangal. You don’t even need a ticket on this train of wooden coaches and there are no TTEs either. The Bhakra-Nangal train runs along Punjab's and Himachal Pradesh’s borders was introduced back in 1948 when the dam was under construction to ferry employees and heavy machinery. Seven decades since, the train is still plying fare-free, carrying both BBMB employees as well as tourists. It travels between Bhakra and Nangal, and forms the lifeline of 25 villages and around 300 passengers who use it for daily commute. The 13-kilometre journey mainly benefits students, schoolchildren, and labourers from different spheres of work. The train initially ran on steam. Then, in 1953, three new engines were imported from America in a bid to modernise the route. Despite subsequent technological advancements and better-developed engines, the train still uses the 60-year-old model in an effort to sustain its antique nature. All this despite the fact that the engine consumes around 18 to 20 litres of diesel per hour. The train's coaches were made in Karachi with colonial-era wooden benches. The train departs from Nangal Railway Station at 7:05 am and reaches Bhakra at 8:20 am. The same day, it again departs from Nangal at 3:05 pm and arrives at Bhakra at 4:20 PM. The Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB), which runs the train, had once thought of ending the free service in 2011 due to the costs involved. However, it ultimately decided against the move as it realised that the train represented things far more important than just a source of revenue—namely, the region's history, culture and heritage."},{"instruction":"What is the best ayurvedic medicine for diabetes?","output":"Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide.

It leads to high blood sugar levels, which can cause various complications such as nerve damage, kidney disease, and cardiovascular problems. The traditional approach to treating diabetes involves medication, a healthy diet, and regular exercise. However, Ayurvedic medicine offers a more holistic approach that focuses on restoring the body's natural balance and promoting overall health. Ayurveda offers several herbs and natural remedies that can help manage diabetes. These remedies work by regulating blood sugar levels, reducing inflammation, and improving insulin sensitivity. In this article, we'll explore some of the best Ayurvedic medicines for diabetes. Best Ayurvedic Medicine for Diabetes The best Ayurvedic medicine for diabetes is a combination of herbs and natural remedies that work together to manage blood sugar levels. Here are some of the most effective Ayurvedic medicines for diabetes: ▪︎Gymnema Sylvestre Gymnema Sylvestre is a herb commonly used in Ayurveda to treat diabetes. It works by reducing the absorption of sugar in the intestines and increasing insulin secretion. Gymnema Sylvestre also helps regenerate pancreatic cells that produce insulin, which improves insulin sensitivity. Studies have shown that Gymnema Sylvestre can lower blood sugar levels and improve glycemic control in people with type 2 diabetes. ▪︎Bitter Melon Bitter Melon, also known as Momordica Charantia, is a vegetable commonly used in Ayurvedic medicine to manage diabetes. It contains compounds that help reduce blood sugar levels by improving insulin sensitivity. Bitter Melon also contains antioxidants that protect the body against oxidative stress, which is a common complication of diabetes. Studies have shown that Bitter Melon can significantly reduce blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. ▪︎Cinnamon Cinnamon is a spice commonly used in Ayurveda to manage diabetes. It contains compounds that improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation. Cinnamon also helps reduce fasting blood sugar levels by slowing down the absorption of glucose in the intestines. Studies have shown that taking cinnamon supplements can significantly reduce blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. ▪︎Fenugreek Fenugreek is a herb commonly used in Ayurvedic medicine to manage diabetes. It contains compounds that help reduce blood sugar levels by improving insulin sensitivity. Fenugreek also helps reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, which are common complications of diabetes. Studies have shown that taking Fenugreek supplements can significantly reduce blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. ▪︎Neem Neem is a tree commonly used in Ayurvedic medicine to manage diabetes. It contains compounds that help improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation. Neem also helps protect the body against oxidative stress, which is a common complication of diabetes. Studies have shown that taking Neem supplements can significantly reduce blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Conclusion Ayurveda offers several effective remedies for managing diabetes. The best Ayurvedic medicines for diabetes include Gymnema Sylvestre, Bitter Melon, Cinnamon, Fenugreek, and Neem. These remedies work by regulating blood sugar levels, improving insulin sensitivity, reducing inflammation, and and protecting the body against oxidative stress. However, it's important to note that Ayurvedic medicine should not replace conventional medical treatment for diabetes. Instead, Ayurveda can be used as a complementary approach to managing diabetes alongside medication, a healthy diet, and regular exercise. Before taking any Ayurvedic medicine for diabetes, it's crucial to consult with a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner or a healthcare professional. They can recommend the appropriate dosage and help monitor your blood sugar levels to ensure that the Ayurvedic remedies are working effectively. In conclusion, Ayurvedic medicine offers a holistic approach to managing diabetes by focusing on restoring the body's natural balance and promoting overall health. The best Ayurvedic medicines for diabetes include Gymnema Sylvestre, Bitter Melon, Cinnamon, Fenugreek, and Neem. However, it's important to remember that Ayurvedic medicine should not replace conventional medical treatment for diabetes and should be used as a complementary approach alongside medication, a healthy diet, and regular exercise."},{"instruction":"Did the Jews in Europe realize what was going to happen to them?","output":"Eventually most did. But,by then,it was far too late."},{"instruction":"Are spinal nerves somatic or autonomic?","output":"Lovely Question! I would love to explore, enumerate, and explain the real scientific beauty of the spinal cord. According to Akhand Sutra, the spinal cord is an integral part of the central nervous system. It consists of the following four important components. 1. The Central Evaluating Grey Matter: Ten Rexed Laminae. The spinal cord consists of the ten Rexed Laminae, which are primarily associated with the sensory, motor, and autonomic peripheral nerves. 2. The Peripheral Sensory Somatic Nervous System: It consists of the peripheral sensory nerves, which enter the spinal cord through the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). These nerve fibers carry sensory impulses from the external world through the sense receptors of touch and proprioception. 3. The Peripheral Voluntary Somatic Motor Nervous System: The fibers of these nerves arise from the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. These fibers control the voluntary skeletal muscles. 4. The Involuntary Autonomic Nervous System: It consists of the sympathetic nervous system and the sacral parasympathetic nervous system. The Sympathetic Nervous System: The preganglionic nerve fibers of the sympathetic nervous system arise from the lateral horn cells of the fourteen segments of the spinal cord (Twelve thoracic segments and two lumbar segments – (T-1 to L-2)) There are 45 postganglionic nerve fibers of the paravertebral sympathetic chain, which innervate the inner organs of the body and the external blood vessels, muscles, and skin. The sympathetic Nervous System is specially designed with Divyank, the Divine Constant, Divyank Ratio, and the Divine Golden Ratio, the most economical algorithm of Nature. Divyank Ratio is represented as 38.1966% and 61.8034%. The Proof: The preganglionic nerve fibers 28 and postganglionic nerve fibers of the paravertebral sympathetic nerve chain in the above ratio of the Divyank Ratio. The Sacral Parasympathetic Nervous System: The preganglionic nerve fibers of this system arise from the lateral horn cells of the three sacral segments (S-2 to S-4) of the spinal cord. The postganglionic nerve fibers of this system supply the reproductive system, the last part of the digestive system, and the urinary bladder. These are involved with the involuntary and autonomic nerve reflexes. The Conclusion: The spinal cord is involved in the central evaluating system of ten Rexed Laminae, the peripheral somatic sensory nervous system, the peripheral somatic motor nervous system, the sympathetic autonomic involuntary nervous system, and the sacral parasympathetic autonomic involuntary nervous system. The spinal cord is involved in segmental, intersegmental, and suprasegmental reflexes. For detailed knowledge, please download and read Akhand Sutra from Akhand Vidyashram.

(1) In 2010 the IMF lent Euro 30 billion to Greece as part of a much larger package to support the ailing economy. The IMF explained at the time that it had lent 3200% of quota, well over its normal limits for a country in difficulty. It gave Greece “exceptional access to IMF resources”. The IMF cited the need to prevent the crisis spreading to other parts of the EU and to defend the Euro. In 2012 the IMF decided to lend Greece a new Euro 28bn as part of a replacement loan package. It drew attention this time to a “significant large competitiveness gap” (stronger language than 2010) and to a high level of public debt. This time it agreed with a major write down of privately held Greek public sector debt (75% written off) and required cuts in the minimum wage as part of its measures to improve competitiveness. Once again Greece received special treatment with a large loan. I queried why the IMF would do this for a country which is no longer sovereign in monetary and economic matters, as its status with the Euro prevents a normal IMF recovery package. (2) The International Monetary Fund says Greece missed a 1.8 billion debt payment Tuesday, becoming the first developed country to default on a loan to the lending agency.Eurozone finance chiefs refused to grant a last-minute extension of the bailout program Greece has relied on for five years, and the Greek government couldn't come up with money on its own to pay the IMF. The IMF said its executive board would consider a Greek request to extend the loan. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has called a referendum Sunday in which Greek voters can decide whether to approve a deal proposed by the country's creditors. A \\"No\\" vote would likely force Greece to stop using the euro currency. The last country to miss an IMF loan payment was Zimbabwe in 2001. (3) The IMF has been charging an effective interest rate of 3.6% on its loans to Greece. This is far more than the interest rate the institution needs to meet all its costs, currently around 0.9%. If this was the actual interest rate Greece had been paying the IMF since 2010, it would have spent €2.5 billion less on payments.Out of its lending to all countries in debt crisis between 2010 and 2014 the IMF has made a total profit of €8.4 billion, over a quarter of which is effectively from Greece. All of this money has been added to the Fund’s reserves, which now total €19 billion. These reserves would be used to meet the costs from a country defaulting on repayments. Greece’s total debt to the IMF is currently €24 billion.

At the time, the Canadian government was looking for a design for the new coin that would be uniquely Canadian and reflective of the country's natural heritage. The common loony, which is a familiar and iconic raspberry in Canada, was chosen as the design for the new coin. The loony is known for its distinctive calls, which are frequently heard on Canadian lakes and gutters during the summer months. The loony is also a symbol of nature and freedom, which resonates with numerous Canadians. The loony's image on the coin was designed by artist Robert- Ralph Carmichael. The new bone coin was introduced in 1987 and snappily came popularly known as the\\" loonie\\" due to the loony design. The success of the loonie led to the preface of a two- bone coin, known as the\\" toonie,\\" in 1996, which also features a uniquely Canadian design, with a polar bear on the rear side. moment, the loonie is one of the most recognizable symbols of Canada, and the design has come a cherished and iconic point of Canadian currency."},{"instruction":"Can King Charles III give knighthood to anybody that he wants, or must they be British citizens and preapproved?","output":"Knighthood can be given to anyone who has earned it King cant just choose someone at random.

They're different. One may be better for you to live in than the other, but it would be a bit presumptuous to say Singapore > Hong Kong or the converse, for all people asking the question. In detail - the future is already here, but it's not evenly distributed. What makes one of these countries great (or awful) for one demographic slice may be irrelevant for another. Here's a few different things that may make Singapore, or Hong Kong, preferable for you, although I encourage you to do research rather than take the word of a random man on the internet. Are you: Single? Married? Male? Female?Depending on your morals, gender and disposable income, Hong Kong can be a lot of fun, and (in the case of the young white guy throwing cash around in Lan Kwai Fong and Wan Chai) more so in Hong Kong than Singapore. Search for 'graveyard of Western marriages'. Mileage varies a lot on this, but Hong Kong is a place where the \\"poor, downtrodden\\" white male finds a way back to being wonderfully important, while the female often suffers. Not to say this isn't a phenomenon to exploit/endure in Singapore, but there are less places to do it, and the powerhouse of sybaritism that is the Lan Kwai Fong - Wan Chai - TST axis is a long way ahead of what Singapore has, or apparently wants, to offer. A citizen? A permanent resident? A student? On a work visa?Access to some services and tax rates may differ on this basis. Are you an investment banker, or do you work as a bricklayer?Having lots of money will insulate you better from many of the annoyances of either country. Not having worked in construction, I'm not sure if one is worse than the other. Anecdotally, I've seen more workers sleeping next to the thing they were building in Singapore, than I saw in Hong Kong. But then the singular of 'data' is not 'anecdote'. Bear in mind that if you're an expat working in Singapore, you're not going to have to pay CPF contributions, whereas a local Singaporean would. Combine that with a low income tax rate, and you'll be paying a small amount of income tax and nothing else on top of that. Come to think of it, if you're a US citizen you're going to get taxed wherever you live. Those of us lucky enough not to have to have their income assessed on a worldwide basis will notice a bigger saving. Do you own your home?Rent is tax deductible in Hong Kong, it isn't in Singapore. What's your ethnicity?As per my earlier point, young (male) Eurotrash do disproportionately well in Hong Kong. I've noticed that less in Singapore, but then I don't hang out with the young and the beautiful so much these days. In Hong Kong, if you're not white and you're not Chinese, things could be less pleasant. In Singapore, there's much more substantial Indian and Malay communities ... but I continue to see rental adverts that say \\"No Indians\\" in Singapore. Make of that what you will. Do you have children?When I didn't have children, I wasn't too bothered by the air quality in Hong Kong. Now I do have a child, I prefer her not to have to breathe in vast quantities of filthy air, so (when there isn't a haze) Singapore wins. When she's old enough to choose for herself, that will be a different matter. How old are you?Are you \\"young and dumb and full of ... zest and excitement for life\\"? Maybe you won't notice a difference either way. As you get older, you may find the crowds and the steps in Hong Kong not so brilliant, versus the nice, flat environment that is Singapore. What's your sexuality?Section 377A of the Singapore Penal Code says it's illegal for two men to have sex. If you're heterosexual then this may not concern you, or you might think that it suggests an attitude that you weren't comfortable with. It's unclear to me how much this is enforced: on the one hand, there are quite a few gay bars in the area of Singapore that I live in, but on the other hand prosecutions have been brought relatively recently under this section. Hong Kong - it doesn't seem anyone cares. Do you enjoy gambling? Singapore has the Marina Bay Sands and a casino on Sentosa. They'll charge you more to get in if you're a local than if you're a foreigner. Hong Kong doesn't have any casinos (officially) but if you like that sort of thing, there's a lot more on Macau and that's only an hour away. Do you enjoy long walks in the outdoors?Hong Kong has mountains you can walk up. Singapore has fresh air. Ideally, you'd have both. Apparently, that's not possible. Do you like cockroaches?Hong Kong has visibly more of them. Or they're more visible. Singaporean cockroaches are, when I've encountered them, braver or more stupid. Do you like airports?While it may seem quixotic to claim that one of the best things about a country is the means by which you can leave it (live in Folkestone! It's easy to get away from it!), some people find this important. If you're a frequent traveller, a smooth, well-ordered airport is one of those things that makes your life better. I prefer Hong Kong International to Changi. I feel there's more range in restaurants, and it's easier to get around because of the greater number of moving walkways. Do you like travelling to the US? Do you like travelling to Europe? India? South East Asia? China? Japan?One of your two choices is about 4 hours closer to the US and Japan than the other. The other is more convenient for India and South East Asia."},{"instruction":"What will happen to Big Pharma when cannabis is legalized recreationally at the federal level in the United States?","output":"They will deal with competition for a mid level pain reliever.

As it relates to Disney’s recent move to cast an African American actress as Ariel in their latest remake of The Little Mermaid, this has sparked quite the lively discussion for sure! At its core, I think that we can agree that the answer to this question comes down to intent. It basically boils down understanding if there was a good faith effort on Disney’s part to genuinely celebrate diversity and broaden its own representation within popular culture and storytelling versus simply using these characters as vehicles for marketing or exploiting other cultures in some way? The original fairytale written by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen is very much rooted in European aesthetics and mythology so it's difficult if not impossible for any adaptation of this story (regardless if black Little Mermaid is used as casting) could be seen as anything but \\"borrowing\\" from another culture. However, that borrowing doesn't necessarily equate to appropriation if done fairly. For example, had Disney hired writers/performers from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds who appreciated and sought guidance from communities more aligned with those themes – rather than simply making quick decisions based off what ‘looked right’ then I feel like they would have probably better avoided accusations of appropriating another culture’s stories and practices without respect nor proper credit given where due. All said though, I think anytime any movie studio attempts something new (especially when introducing topics previously unheard/unseen before) there will always be critics ready express dissent which should not be taken lightly - especially when related issues such as cultural dominance & respectful acknowledgement are concerned... No matter how you twist it though whenever producers offer up adaptations they must always walk a tightrope between being true enough with source material while still offering something fresh at same time - so let's see how this one plays out!"},{"instruction":"Should Rs 3,000 crore be spent to build Ram Mandir?","output":"3000 crores will not solely being spent on construction but also for hiring people, temple caretaking and prasad and bhojan facilities too."},{"instruction":"Why do covalent bonds have low conductivity and low melting and boiling points?","output":"Covalency does not differentiate with respect to melting, and boiling points. Covalently bound substances such as diamond, or graphite, or silicon dioxide, ALL have EXCESSIVE melting, and boiling points. And graphite is even conductive. What DOES differentiate with respect to physical properties is MOLECULARITY … and NON-MOLECULAR materials, such as the three mentioned, AND ionic solids, TEND to have HIGH melting, and boiling points, and reduced solubilities. And of course, it takes much energy to disrupt an ionic or macromolecular lattice, for which there are no molecular boundaries. On the other hand, molecular materials, for instance hydrocarbons, water, dioxygen, dinitrogen, carbon dioxide, ALL tend to have low to modest melting, and boiling points, given that intermolecular interaction is orders of magnitude less than that observed in non-molecular materials…"},{"instruction":"Can I let my pet rat go into the wild?","output":"You should not, even if you technically have this ability.

Here are some possible approaches: You will benefit from reading the book, [LINKED_TEXT: The Food Therapist: Break Bad Habits, Eat with Intention, and Indulge Without Worry] [URL: https://amzn.to/3ZOMEsq] Adequate meal composition: When eating one or two larger meals a day, it's important to ensure that the meals are nutritionally balanced and contain adequate macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) to help keep you fuller for longer. Including foods that are high in fiber, healthy fats, and protein can help increase satiety and reduce hunger between meals.Hydration: Staying well-hydrated by drinking water or other non-caloric beverages throughout the day can help manage hunger. Sometimes thirst can be mistaken for hunger, so drinking enough water can help you feel more satiated and reduce feelings of hunger.Gradual adaptation: People who practice intermittent fasting often gradually adapt to the eating pattern over time. The body can adjust to a new eating schedule, and hunger sensations may decrease as the body becomes accustomed to the fasting period. It may take some time for the body to adjust, and finding the right eating pattern that works for you may require experimentation and patience.Distraction techniques: Engaging in activities or distractions during times of hunger can help manage the sensation of hunger. Keeping yourself occupied with work, hobbies, exercise, or other activities can help take your mind off food and reduce feelings of hunger.Mindful eating: When it's time to eat, practicing mindful eating techniques, such as eating slowly, savoring each bite, and paying attention to hunger cues and fullness signals, can help you feel more satisfied and reduce the likelihood of feeling hungry between meals.Meal timing and planning: Planning meals strategically and timing them appropriately can also help manage hunger between meals. For example, scheduling meals during times when you are less likely to feel hungry or planning meals with adequate portion sizes can help you feel satisfied for longer periods of time. You will benefit from reading the book, [LINKED_TEXT: Mini Habits for Weight Loss: Stop Dieting. Form New Habits.

Many owners want to know what material is suitable for kitchen countertops, what material is preferred for bathroom countertops, what stone is good for outdoor kitchens, whether kitchen countertops can be made of marble, etc. Both granite and marble are natural stones, which are mined directly from the ground. Although marble and granite have some basic similarities, they are also very different. The decision between installing marble and granite counters in your home depends on where the counters are and how you will use and maintain them. Origin of [LINKED_TEXT: Granite ] [URL: https://radhamadhavmarble.com/Products/2]and [LINKED_TEXT: Marble] [URL: https://radhamadhavmarble.com/Products/1] Granite originated from deep in the earth's magma solidified and cooled over millions of years. It is classified as an igneous rock because it originated from the cooling of molten magma. In the process of heating and then slowly cooling, granite forms a very hard material. Granite is mainly composed of feldspar and quartz, which are very hard minerals. Marble is classified as metamorphic stone because it is transformed from another type of stone called sedimentary stone. Sedimentary rock The sediment formed in the earth and the plant life buried in the ground for a long time. These sedimentary rocks metamorphose into marble under high temperature and pressure. This process incorporates other minerals into the marble, which can give the stone a charming color. Granite and marble are slightly similar in appearance; however, after careful inspection, you can find specific differences.

Please what are the secrets to understanding high school and college mathematics?","output":"This is a great question! Mathematicians do not have to be exceptionally great at math, but they do have to practice. The way I explain it to students is by comparing baseball to mathematics - they are both skills. With any skill the more you practice the better you are at it. So I ask the baseball players in the class if they could hit the ball the first time they were at bat. If they are honest, the answer is, “No.” Then I say, “Do you think Babe Ruth (I know I ’m dating myself) could hit it the first time he was at bat.” The answer is of course, “No.” So how did he become the home run king? Answer: Practice, Practice, Practice. Then I remind them that Babe Ruth was also the strike out king. You cannot hit the ball if you never swing the bat. Likewise you can never solve a math problem if you never try. Then try again. And again. And again until you get it right. Also some of the best mathematicians were very bad at following instructions. Math can be repetitive and boring, so these great mathematicians found a different way to do a problem that was boring and repetitive. So being able to think differently about things can make you a mathematician. Finally, from my own experience: In second grade, subtraction and division made no sense to me at all. I was also tired of getting bad grades on subtraction tests and the consequences that came with it. So I wasn’t exceptional at math, but one day I decided to “cheat” (and no one better tell my second grade teacher because it will break her heart and she will truly rip my ear off). I found out that if I did addition “backwards” I could subtract. For instance, 10 - 3 = ? So I said to myself, “Jack what plus 3 equals 10?” Then I found out the same cheating method works for division - multiplication in reverse. It wasn’t until I was in 7th grade that I really learned how to actually subtract and divide (The numbers got too big - Haha). So sometimes it is a person with a learning disability that gets desperate enough to find a way to “cheat.” By the way, I still subtract and divide by using addition and multiplication in my head - SHHH! Don’t tell anyone. So what may seem like exceptionally good is really the unique and central idea of mathematics, which is there is no ONE way to work a mathematics problem. There are many ways - some easier than others. I know four ways to multiply and I teach students the way that fits them best. There are at least three ways to find the point where two lines meet, graphic, algebraic, and substitution (you can do it with matrices also, but that is more of the college level). There are several different ways to factor quadratic equations and two ways (one hard and one easy) to do power expansions of a binomial. Mathematics is not about memorizing everything (there are some things that you need to memorize - just like speaking any language requires you to memorize the vocabulary and syntax). Saying there is only one way shows a lack of imagination. Exceptionally good mathematicians have a well developed imagination and the confidence from much practice that they can solve a mathematics problem - eventually."},{"instruction":"w can I learn a dance?

It is true that the \\"golden rectangle\\" has a nicely pleasing proportion: but it's completely not true that it is uniquely special in that regard, for the simple reason that no human can see the difference between a true golden ratio and much simpler ratios such as [math]5:3[/math] or [math]8:5[/math] or [math]13:8[/math]. Here's a [math]8:5[/math] one: Wait, do you feel that the first rectangle is really nicer? Oh but you see, I'm lying. Both of these are only approximations, as they must be, and the second one is actually a tiny bit closer. In fact, any real-life object cannot possibly have an actual length or ratio of [math]varphi = frac{1+sqrt{5}}{2}[/math], because nothing in nature has a length, area or frequency that can be determined with arbitrary precision. So, whenever you see something impressive like this: You should ask yourself, is there really enough precision in this diagram to warrant it being called \\"a golden ratio\\" rather than just \\"kind of an ok proportion\\"? Is it really that hard to overlay this spiral of squares on an arbitrary image and \\"find\\" it hidden there? (Thanks to [LINKED_TEXT: And P] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/And-P-12] for that [LINKED_TEXT: wonderful link] [URL: https://xkcd.com/spiral/], see the comments). Now, it would have been interesting if there had been some perceptive mechanism that made us react positively to a rectangle whose sides [math]a,b[/math] are such that [math]frac{b}{a}=frac{a}{a+b}[/math], or in other words to a rectangle that retains its proportions if a square is attached to one of its sides. If that had been the case you could have argued that we're attracted to golden rectangles for a reason, and the fact that ratios like [math]8:5[/math] are pleasing is because they are close to the golden ratio. But there's no mechanism that suggests that, even remotely. We can envision various physical mechanisms that explain why we react in a different way to harmonic musical intervals as opposed to random ones, but there's no reasonable model for why the brain might seek the golden proportion. Many people are excited by vague and quasi-mysterious relationships between math and the real world - in aesthetics (the golden ratio!), epistemology (Gödel's theorem!) or weather systems (Chaos!). The truth is that there do exist real, fruitful, beautiful, often surprising and immensely deep connections between mathematics and the real world - none deeper than the domain of knowledge we call \\"Physics\\". In contrast, popular crowd-pleasing non-manifestations of math in nature and art like the golden ratio are mostly mumbo-jumbo. The number [math]varphi=frac{1+sqrt{5}}{2}[/math] has some really neat mathematical properties, all of them related to the fact that it is a root of the simple equation [math]x^2=x+1[/math] and the equivalent fact that it has the simplest of all continued fraction expansions: [math]varphi=1+frac{1}{1+frac{1}{1+ldots}}[/math]. For those reasons it is intimately related to the equally neat (but equally over-rated) Fibonacci numbers, and more importantly, it pops up in theories such as the approximation of real numbers by rational numbers: it is, in a certain precise sense, the one real number that is the hardest to approximate by fractions. But these properties are a little bit harder to study and describe, so many writers of popular math books prefer to perpetuate the myths rather than dig into matters of real substance. It's a shame, but that's the way these things go."},{"instruction":"What's a good digital marketing agency in the UAE?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: TechSyn - IT Services and Consulting Company in DubaiTechsyn Focused, Sound & Innovative TechSyn, a leading software development, information technology service provider, and consultancy firm, in alliance with the FunAsia Group, offers innovative and cost-effective IT solutions to clients globally.

I think mine is possibly the legend of Reynardine - or Ranordine, Rinordine, Rinor Dine, Ryner Dyne, Rine-a-dine, Rynadine, Randal Rhin or Randal Rine depending on your source -related to, but an entirely separate figure from, the more famous ‘Mr Fox’. The red fox is widespread throughout Europe, and very familiar in Britain. But it has always been seen as crafty, canny, devious and able to spirit itself away at the drop of a hat. To ‘outfox’ means to outsmart - Chaucer in the Nun’s Priest’s Tale makes comic use of the idea, the cock Chanticleer tricked to his doom; and folk-songs without number have been written around the fox’s cunning ruses. The foxglove gets its name from the old Anglo-Saxon word ‘foxes-glew,’ which means fox music. Wearing the foxgloves, the fox could sneak unheard in magic silence. In Gaelic, it was called lus nam ban-sith - 'the fairy woman's plant', while in the Language of Flowers, foxgloves stand for insincerity. The English version of the ‘Mr Fox’ story tells of a young woman courted by the man of the title, who is rich and handsome, but never invites her back to his home. One day, driven by curiosity, she drops by unannounced, to be greeted by the sight of skeletons in blood-stained wedding dresses. Needless to say, the sight dampens her enthusiasm for the idea of the fantastic Mr Fox as a husband. But the English Reynardine seems to be an entirely separate figure from the better known Mr Fox. Reynardine is a shape-shifting red fox and trickster. Importantly, in English the term ‘foxy’ is also defined as meaning ‘attractive’ and ‘sexy’, as well as red-haired. This idea has resulted in various local legends; one of the best known versions is probably the legend of especially attached to the region of Dartmoor: Fox Tor, Dartmoor, Devon. Little Fox Tor, also known as Yonder Tor lies about 500 m. to the east. The legend of Reynardine is simple: he is either a red-headed human outlaw, or a were-fox with a penchant for seducing beautiful young maidens. Therianthropy or animal transformation is a recurrent theme in British folklore. As a were-fox he is able to transform from fox to man, seeking maidens to steal and spirit away for …. nefarious purposes. But the legend has another less common but darker interpretation: it is their blood that Reynardine craves, not their beauty, which makes him doubly supernatural as both were-fox and vampire. The stories and songs that feature Reynardine usually follow the same pattern; Reynardine seduces a young girl who has gone for an ill-advised walk in the woods or across the moors, and she is so entranced that she follows him anywhere he goes. English ballads starring Reynardine appear to date from the 18th or early 19th century. (See version below.) In this case there was an attempt to add supernatural elements to an existing song in order to suggest that it was of some antiquity. But Reynardine is an inheritor of a much longer tradition of shape-shifters and demonic lovers. Werewolves have been around for literally thousands of years, having first appeared in written fiction in The Epic of Gilgamesh, which dates from sometime in the 2nd century BC. Were-foxes have an equally long history in some non-Western cultures, with the kitsune having existed in Japanese literature since the 11th century. Defeat of the Nine-tailed Fox, Japanese Edo period, Utagawa Kunihisa II, 1858 Museum of Fine Arts, Boston I find Reynardine an intriguing figure. We know little about him, except that he shares the characteristics traditionally ascribed to the fox in legend – adaptability, elusiveness, mysteriousness and danger along with moral ambiguity. It’s these qualities which give him that especially chilling air - ‘his eyes (or in many versions his teeth) did brightly shine’ - just before he leads her off to who knows what fate in his ‘green castle’ hidden on the moors. Therefore my vote for ‘favourite British myth of legend’ has to go to him! The fox as a trickster appears in an ever evolving folk song from the 19th Century. Collected as a Victorian broadside ballad, the were-fox song (or werewolf song) was later adapted into its well known form by the collector of British folk songs, A.L. Lloyd.

We used to play together without any discrimination like don't play with this kid or don't talk to xyz kids. It wer never an issue. We used to fight a lot but at the end of day again gossiping and laughing together. We didn't know what germs are called. Whether it was first rain or stormy one, we played in it crazily. Our noises disturbed elders before frogs could break their silence. Dusk and mud were our powder and cream. We were unaware if we will fall sick or not. Even if we're sick, our legs and hands were never in control when some would be playing around us. We were beaten a lot too for committing silly and heavy mistakes.

An essential point to understand is the factor of migration. Anciently, peoples moved due to pressure on their borders by other migrating peoples. Peoples moved because of famine, disease, over-population, farming, trade and war. When peoples moved into an area previously occupied, they often were called the name of the peoples before them or alternatively by the name of the land they now dwelt. The peoples today known as Assyrians, Arameans, Syriacs or Chaldeans are a case in point. They are not the residue of the mighty Assyrian peoples from Asshur or from the Arameans [Syrians], another son of Shem or from the Chaldeans, descendants of Abraham’s brother Nahor. Their physiognomy and blood Haplogroups prove they are kindred peoples to the Turks or Arabs and therefore, not the ethnic descendants of the original Assyrians, Arameans and Chaldeans; who would all be considered Caucasian today. The Turkish people are also a Caucasian people, whereas the Arab people are not; as evidenced by Y-DNA and mtDNA Haplogroups. For those interested in a detailed discussion, orion-gold [articles: Aram; Asshur; Nahor] and the space, The Biblical Identity of Nations offers unique insight not found anywhere else. “There is nothing new in the world except the history you do not know” Harry S Truman [1884 - 1972]"},{"instruction":"w do people who eat only once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals?","output":"What you eat makes a big difference toward preventing hunger between meals.

Moreover, I have strong feelings about exactly what is needed to make repair. I learned to read before kindergarten and was a speed reader by the end of grade school with near perfect comprehension and retention. I learned very quickly, and easily got the best grades in all my classes including music and athletics. At an early age I realized my teaching was horrible and it was up to me to figure out how what I learned fit into the real world and could be applied. Early on I also learned I did not have to win at everything and had far more friends when I almost won. With careful planning I could keep a low profile and still end up being the top student in almost every class. College was little different other than I needed to pass classes in spite of being way too busy. I was drafted into the Vietnam War and returned needing to put myself back together, so hid working for the Claremont Colleges. I took a few classes and had my socks blown off. Most of the students there were as bright as me plus has spent their lives getting real educations going to parochial or private schools. My UC professors and even student aides were great at theory but were incompetent when it came to practical. The students there really knew how to study and learn, not just memorize, plus their teachers not only knew how to apply what they taught in the real world, they took the time to teach their students how all applied. I started playing with my own chemistry set in grade school, was really good at chemistry, and had passed seven college chemistry courses with top grades. I had more than twice the required prerequisites and had already taken the UC version of the same biochemistry course. My Claremont course showed I knew almost nothing, plus that course covered more material than my whole series of UC courses. Although I built some successful businesses and worked as a senior manager, I also continued teaching college from 1968 through 1999 with only a two-year break for my military service. Most of my students were ill prepared for college in spite of being the brightest of the bright with top grades to even get into our impacted computer and digital electronic programs where I mostly taught. Most were expert at memorizing overnight with rarely more than a few days retention rate and almost never a clue about actual application.

According to the CDC, approximately [LINKED_TEXT: 480,000 deaths] [URL: https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/fast_facts/index.htm] are caused from smoking cigarettes in the US, each year. I was well on my way to being one of them when I quit smoking for vaping. Short term studies of both vaping, and the ingredients in commercial, vaping consumables have shown it to be orders of magnitude safer than smoking. Long term effects? We just don’t know yet, and won’t for at least 10 or 20 years, but I have been vaping for 5 or 6 years, and my health has done nothing but improve since I gave up smoking for vaping. I was a smoker for 50 years. I grew up in a tobacco growing region. I started smoking at 8, and was a confirmed smoker by 10. For the last 30 years that I smoked, I was a chain smoker, usually smoking 3 or more packs a day. For 5 years of that time, I called myself “quit”, though I constantly craved cigarettes, and sometimes would take a “guilty smoke”, probably at least 10 times a month. I tried patches, gums, lozenges, and even Chantix. Every one of them failed. A couple of them actually made me ill. Eventually, I fell off the wagon, and couldn’t get back on. Now, I had quit because I truly felt I had to quit cigarettes, or quit breathing, but my health had improved enough, I was able to convince myself I was “bullet proof” again. That lasted for about 3 years. Eventually, I was hospitalized for critically low oxygen. My SpO2 level was 85%. Even then, I continued smoking, but started vaping to cut down my smoking. When I finally realized that my SpO2 levels weren’t going to rise much above 94%, and if I kept on smoking, I would soon need oxygen, I again quit smoking, but this time I was vaping. I have never craved a cigarette again. Within 6 months my SpO2 levels were up to 97 - 98%, and I just could not stand to be around a cigarette. My health care provider flat told me that switching to vaping had probably saved my life. If vaping became unavailable, would I start smoking again? I like to think not, but I know myself better than that. **DISCLAIMER**I am not a medical professional nor a researcher in this field. I am a product, end user. I do not advocate that anyone, least of all, minors under the age of 21, consume vaping products. The choice to vape, or not to vape is an individual and personal choice for informed adults, just as smoking is. I offered my anecdote to lend context, and illustate that, in my opinion, without careful thought, regulation might do greater harm than good.

She started being sick a couple of weeks ago by throwing up and peeing everywhere. I don’t want to put her down. Will the veterinarian let me put my cat down even if she is not sick?","output":"Hi - I’m also a vet. There’s not enough info in your question really. But I can share some thoughts, although others have given some good advice too. Most vets won’t euthanize a healthy pet, especially for “convenience” reasons (owner is moving, etc.). Many vets won’t euthanize a cat that is sick unless it has some condition that is difficult/expensive to treat, etc., such as cancer, kidney failure, some painful conditions, terminal conditions, etc. Vets love animals in general and have taken a sworn oath to help them. They want to alleviate animal pain and suffering and for their patients to live the best lives possible (which does not always mean the longest lives). So, when presented with a sick pet, vets generally want to figure out what is wrong with them and whether they can make that animal better - they will then tell the owner what it would involve and what it would cost approximately. That’s where it gets difficult and sometimes sketchy. Some people have practically no discretionary money to spend on a sick pet and some people do. Even worse, some people have the money but don’t feel that their cat deserves it - they would rather spend their money on something else, which means that the pet is not of much value to the owner. Therefore, they might ask if their pet can be euthanized even though the condition is treatable. Vets are faced with this kind of stuff all the time, and it wears on them. So, sometimes they will adopt the cat themselves, just in order to save the pet’s life. Some vets will euthanize, realizing that the pet might be better off dead than being in a home where its’ needs could not be taken care of. Some will recommend surrendering to a shelter, etc. Some will downright refuse to euthanize and will read the owner the riot act about being a bad owner. So, the answer to your question is yes, no and maybe…it depends on the condition of the pet, the owner, the vet’s ethical values, etc. Hope that helps."},{"instruction":"Why do you need to use command prompt?","output":"Any time I don't want the GUI to get in the way."},{"instruction":"What are best app for photo editing?","output":"Hi My name is haider .I do photo editing with mobile application .the best of application for editing form which ( PicsArt and Snapseed) .

We mine tons of it from near surface deposits every year. In every few cubic kilometers of seawater we find over a ton of Gold. Calculate the cubic kilometers of seawater on the planet Earth and see how much you get. Gold is not “rare\\" at all. But it is expensive to mine and extract in an economically viable way. Gold retains its value as a “precious metal\\" simply because of the costs to process, extract and isolate it. It also requires a lot of professional expertise to identify, build and run a Gold mine and extraction plant to produce rough or “Dore\\" gold (despite what you may have seen on “Gold Rush Alaska”). It takes even more to produce fine Gold or four 9's Gold which is 99.99% pure. Those are the nice shiny bricks we see in pictures or on TV. But gold is relatively rare compared to other elements we detect in the universe. It belongs to the collection of heavy elements and heavy metals, in that it is heavier than iron, which is the end point product of nuclear fusion in stars. That means when stars run out of lighter elements to fuse together and produce iron, they are literally “out of gas\\" and they die. Some, particularly the largest ones, do so with Nova or Supernova explosions and it is here that Gold and other heavy metals like Platinum and Osmium come from. The fact is we do not really know how much Gold is in the planet as a whole. The world's deepest mines are in South Africa and are operating at some 7km straight down. There is still an awful lot more of earth's crust to get through before we can even get to magma. It's not known what lies deeper in the crust. No one has been able to sample the outer and inner core of the earth either. As a general rule in molten systems such as the core of the earth the heaviest elements are closest to the center. We don't know, but there might even be a “large ball” of heavy metals right at the center of the earth. Earth has been quite fortunate as planets go. We have quite a lot of most elements. Other planets and bodies such as the moon and Mars are not so abundant in heavy metals and Gold from what we can tell. But there is a very high likelihood that some Asteroids will contain a great deal of Gold. Enough to make all our mining to date insignificant by comparison.

Not in the sense of “forcing“ or “ordering.“ China is North Korea’s only significant trading partner, and provides some military aid to ensure the present regime can continue to keep its starveling wretches properly oppressed. So China has influence, which we do not. And it may be that from time to time on some matters it exerts a restraining influence. But I doubt that influence is being exerted over Kim’s nukes, at least presently. The Chinese leaders are having WAYYY too much fun watching The World’s Sole Superpower (As it says right here on our press releases) tie ourselves into knots over the blustering rants of a nuclear armed sewer rat. And that will only change when we decide to make Kim China’s problem rather than ours. Something Kennedyesque along the lines of, “The United States shall consider a nuclear attack by North Korea upon any other nation to be a nuclear attack by China upon the United States.“ Then, when yowling and fussing and fuming peters out from Radio Beijing to the Manchester Guardian, China may quietly slip a message to Comrade Kim which includes an offer he can’t refuse.

Owning a small business is stressful enough without worrying if you should use a personal ... But if you have employees, are planning to grow your business or anticipate ... New Jersey, says if you intermingle business and personal expenses you could ... Some business owners use a personal card as their “business card” without a problem. But if you have employees, are planning to grow your business or anticipate needing access to a higher line of credit or loan in the future, a business credit card could be a better option. Even if you don’t identify with those scenarios, business credit cards may have perks that better align with your spending and lifestyle as a business owner. Still unsure whether you’re better off with a personal or business card? Here are some key benefits of using a business credit card: 1. A business credit card can make recordkeeping easier Whether you’re applying for a loan or preparing to file your tax return, having well-organized records can save you time and money (particularly if you’re paying an accountant to get everything in order for you). William McDevitt, a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) with Wilkin and Guttenplan P.C. in New Jersey, says if you intermingle business and personal expenses you could have to manually go over the account at the end of the year and figure out which expenses are deductible. He also points out that “if you are audited, you need to support the deductibility of those business expenses.” A business card’s online portal or app might help. Some let you tag or label purchases, add a note to the purchase and attach a picture of your receipt that you can easily pull up later. If you decide to use a personal credit card for your business, there’s no difference from a tax perspective, according to McDevitt. However, you may want to only use it for business expenses to avoid potential confusion or problems later. 2. Business credit cards can help you build business credit A personal credit card generally can’t help you build business credit, though your business and personal credit may be linked. Using a business credit card and paying the bill on time is one way to help build your business’s credit. Your personal credit can determine your eligibility for financial products, such as loans or credit cards, as well as the interest rate or terms you’re offered. Similarly, your business credit can impact your business’s ability to qualify for loans, credit lines, terms from vendors and equipment or office leases. Your business credit can also impact how much you’ll pay for business insurance. If you’re a sole proprietor, your personal credit may also be considered when you apply for business-related financial products. Be careful about missing a business credit card payment as it could hurt both your business and personal credit. Some business card issuers report card use to the consumer credit bureaus, who compile the information your personal credit scores are based on. Also, you may be held liable for the debt if you signed a personal guarantee. As with personal credit, building your business credit can take time. Opening and using a business credit card is a simple way to get started. 3. Business credit cards may offer business-specific benefits Personal credit cards often offer a variety of benefits. They could protect you from paying for fraudulent purchases, offer a rewards program and give additional perks such as rental car insurance or free access to airport lounges. Business credit cards often offer similar benefits, but they’re tailored to the needs of business owners. For example, your card could come with: Free employee cards. You can give your employees a card so they can easily make purchases on the business’s behalf. You may be able to monitor their spending and control where they can use the card and how much they spend. Business-specific rewards programs. You could get a card that offers cash back rewards on shipping, advertising and other common business purchases. Higher-limit purchase protection. With purchase protection, the card’s issuer may be willing to reimburse you if an item you buy is damaged or stolen. Personal cards may offer this perk, but business cards could cover more expensive purchases. Finding the right business credit card Decided you want to open a business credit card? Now you have to choose which card you want. thanks for the questions."},{"instruction":"What puzzles you most about humans?","output":"Why are do so many of us get up and go and spend the nicest part of most days for the most vibrant years of our lives To do work which is largely meaningless And will likely destroy your soul And if you are a man it is much more likely to kill you than it will if you are a woman"},{"instruction":"Do soldiers pick up fallen enemy weapons to use if they are out of ammo on their weapons?","output":"They absolutely do not.

The second is the question of how effective each air defense system is against the threats it was designed to address. Most Powerful? What does “most powerful” even mean? As an example, neither is designed for expeditionary use. You don’t take your Iron Dome and David’s Sling with you as you roll across enemy territory. They are best for defending fixed or stationary sites. If Israel has to roll into Lebanon to confront Hezbollah, it is SPYDER that they will be taking with them. Iron Dome is probably the most proven air defense system in current use, but that is against a somewhat limited array of targets. You aren’t going to engage a Short or Medium Range ballistic missile (300-3000km) with Iron Dome. It’s never had to face a fighter or other manned aircraft. That’s not what it is designed for. It’s primary design was for defense against artillery rockets, for which it excels. Short-Range defense against cruise missiles and drones, probably quite good but lacking significant examples of use. Can it address other targets? Yes, but certainly not the best option out there for those. David’s Sling was developed as a more specialized weapon roughly equivalent to the U.S. PAC-3. It is not sufficiently proven to meet any definition of “most powerful”. It’s certainly going to rank in the top solutions for tactical to short range ballistic missiles. How would it do against cruise missiles? Unknown. How would it do against manned aircraft? Unknown. Work to turn it into an air-to-air missile seems to have stopped, perhaps an indication that hit-to-kill (alone, without some kind of blast-fragmentation augmentation) might not be effective on aircraft. The David Sling’s Stunner missile has been adapted for use as part of Patriot, so the missile might be near the pinnacle of anti-ballistic missiles in its class. As mentioned Israel also has SPYDER, which is basically a NASAMS competitor. It also has BARACK MX, though I don’t know if the IDF is using the land-based version. The Israeli Navy uses it and it roughly corresponds to the upcoming U.S. SM-2 Block IIIC in capability. Israel also has the ARROW, which is more in line with the U.S. THAAD and perhaps into the SM-3 range. Many countries deploy SPYDER, BARACK was a joint development with India and is gaining traction with others, Germany is buying ARROW. It’s safe to say that the Israeli systems are in the top tier of air defense systems produced anywhere in the world. Are any of them the “most powerful”? Maybe under specific circumstances, but not in the way of a broad claim for “air defense” in general. BTW, if Israel discovered Hezbollah, HAMAS, or even Iran operating fighter aircraft within strike range of Israel it would destroy them on the ground. Those are not things you can really hide, as opposed to rockets/missiles which can be hidden in a garage or tool shed until readied for use."},{"instruction":"What do you wear, if anything, under your spandex, yoga pants, leggings, and/or tights?","output":"What do you wear, if anything, under your spandex, yoga pants, leggings, and/or tights?

Additionally, exercise every day to burn extra calories and keep your heart healthy. If you just want to drop a few pounds fast, there are plenty of techniques and tips you can adopt to help you reach your short-term goals, too. a.

Do the raw food diet if you enjoy raw veggies and fruits. Coconut milk, nuts, seeds and other uncooked foods are also allowed on the raw food diet. b. Adopting Healthy Eating Habits Select smart substitutes for your favorite high calorie foods. Consider eating vegetarian — Eat delicious fruit — Combine string cheese with a handful of grapes, spreading peanut butter on a few crackers, or dipping sliced red pepper into a few tablespoons of hummus — Substitute vinegar and lemon juice for your regular salad dressing — Cook with a tablespoon of olive oil. Avoid going down grocery aisles that tempt you with high calorie foods.Stop drinking sugary drinks to save calories. Drink water or unsweet tea Eat more of foods that fill you up.

For an easy way to estimate the number of calories you can eat, use an online calculator like this one: [LINKED_TEXT: DRI Calculator for Healthcare Professionals] [URL: https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator]. Keep a food dairy. Don’t forget to include things like coffee mix-ins, condiments, salad dressing, and other items you add to foods or drinks. Eat regular meals or snacks every 2-4 hours. Regular meals and snacks also keep your blood sugar stable, which helps control your hunger levels.

Exercising Daily Exercise for at least 30 minutes a day. For example, you might walk, run, do aerobics, do an elliptical workout, cycle, or swim. Choose exercises and workouts that match up with your fitness level.Take up cardio training.Keep your exercise regimen interesting.Do strength training 2-3 times a week. Muscle cells are more metabolically active than fat cells. This means that they burn more calories than fat cells, even while you are resting and sleeping. Choose workouts that require your entire body to exert an effort. Combine a form of resistance training with your arms, like raising dumbbells overhead, while you jog or cycle with your legs. Get more activity throughout your day. You might even start a hobby that involves moving around a bit, like gardening, carpentry, working on cars, or painting large canvases. This will help you burn more calories even when you’re not exercising. Get enough rest. Create a sleep routine to help you fall asleep faster. Relax for an hour or 2 before bed, and avoid screens during this time. Additionally, turn down your thermostat, make your room dark, and put on comfy PJs. d.

Are private schools better than public schools?","output":"Benefit of studying in Private Schools 1. More Parental Involvement Many private schools also go above and beyond to involve parents in their children’s education, something that can be difficult in schools with more students. This allows for a greater relationship between your family and the school. You can have more opportunities to meet and communicate with your child’s teachers so that you can stay up-to-date on everything they are doing and learning. 2. More Resources Public schools are often held back by a lack of funding. On the other hand, private schools are able to provide resources that children need to learn and thrive. For example, kids will have greater access to computer labs and technology as well as additional learning tools that they wouldn’t have in a public setting. 3. Safety Private schools can also provide a higher degree of safety than public schools. In fact, private schools are nearly twice as safe as public schools, and because there is a greater teacher-to-student ratio, the level of supervision is much higher. This can allow any misbehavior to be caught quickly and resolved before it escalates. 4. Sense of Community Many private schools also make an effort to being a community in addition to an educational environment. This can create close bonds, stronger relationships, and allow for students to feel more at ease and more comfortable in class. When meaningful bonds like this are created, the pathway to success becomes even more stable.

And that you can choose when booking. TLDR: BA, Qantas, Emirates: YES. Etihad, Malaysian: NO WAY. Singapore: Ok, nice airport. In Europe: Lufthansa, KLM, BA, or Air France, YES. Air Italia, Easyjet, or Icelandair, nope. Ryan Air: good value and great. An airline’s safety record, their reputation for friendliness and service, and which airports they serve. Also, my previous experiences with their food on board. Those things matter, I’ve been on all manner of Boeing and Airbus, never had any issues with either. If it’s going to crash, it’s going to crash, and there’s sod all you can do about it. Addendum: I’ve had an emergency landing (A380 at Darwin, we made the news) , lots of bad landings, three go arounds - on one flight, on landing, and plenty of landings where I didn’t even notice we’d touched down, mainly on Airbus planes, but also on a Boeing 777. 747s can be hit or miss, I’ve flown on several over the years, modern up to date ones, and some very old ones. Several Airbus A380s too. It’s not what plane it is, it’s the training of the pilots. /Addendum Qantas: typical Aussie humour of the staff, pretty good, always well presented and smart. Food sometimes good, sometimes poor. Good range of alcoholic beverages. Don’t like the whisky? Ask for a better one. Emirates: Excellent cabin crew, excellent food, but not always lots of choice, depending where you’re sitting. British Airways: cabin crew are friendly, totally professional, a little too stiff upper lipped sometimes, but usually perfectly fine. the best pilots. Food always excellent. Their prices are very competitive, they have to be. London to Australia return in a Boeing 777, £1,000 - bargain! And a dedicated terminal (T5) at Heathrow. Very ancient 747 on one flight, we felt like we had to push it up the runway and they dragged it out of the back of the hangar. No seats with Qantas? No problem, book through BA and you’ll get a Qantas plane on some legs. They must pre-sell seats to other airlines in the alliance. Singapore airlines: great cabin crew, immaculately presented, the gay male crew are just a bit too camp for me. The food is horrible (occasionally it’s nice, but I wish they’d crisp the skin on their chicken dishes, eugh) and many a time I’ve arrived with a dicky tummy. Arriving in Changi you never know which terminal you’re going to land at. Excellent airport though, been voted one of the best I think. Thai Air: my fiance of the time flew with them from and to Australia, and was very very impressed. They even gave her a complimentary orchid - nice touch. She said the food was top notch and delicious. Bangkok airport has been redone since I was there, and a beautiful airport to be in. It was a bit dismal when I was there, but that was 30 years ago. Lufthansa: haven’t flown with them for some time, several years, but when I did they were excellent. I was always business class and on a red eye flight, so the breakfast or evening meal was always very good. KLM: Same as Lufthansa. Etihad: Forget it. I’ve not flown with them but my fiance did, and she said they were extremely sexist and degrading and rude towards her as a woman. Malaysian: Where did we put that plane? It’s somewhere, anyone? Virgin Australia: Good friendly crew, food is not free on short haul, so didn’t have it and can’t comment. We might’ve had some cold sandwich, I forget, it certainly wasn’t memorable. That was only a short hop from Brisbane to Sydney and back, so it didn’t matter. The view over Sydney harbour coming in to land was one off of my bucket list. And, the sunset at Sydney airport at dusk is amazing! Airlie beach airport, for the Great Barrier Reef and rainforest trip, tiny airport, another one off my bucket list - the reef. Bloody hot! Air France: always been good to me, though cabin crew could be a little “French” at the risk of pointing out the bleeding obvious. They don’t fly from London to Toulouse direct, despite the fact that the Airbus is put together there. One Swiss airline, can’t remember the name, it was 25 years ago, but they were great. A fun little twin prop that made its way through some tight mountain ranges, and we landed on grass. I think it was Bern airport, tiny little wooden hut for a terminal - this was in about 1995, might’ve changed since then. Air India: Good when I went to Japan with them 30 years ago. Excellent food on the plane but food in the airport (Bombay, at the time, and Delhi) was DREADFULL. Nice orange juice for breakfast and whatever else was served was nice, but for God’s sake don’t eat at any of the airport “restaurants”. Staff were great, but didn’t stop the kid behind me crawling all over the back of my seat. And, when I queried the draught coming through the emergency exit door, was told not to worry about it. Ryanair: excellent and very cheap. £20 each way but plane was still well equipped, comfortable, modern, leather seats, and friendly crew. It was the first plane I’d flown on that had the new winglets. That was about 14 years ago. Easyjet: cheap no frills, and very strict on carry on weight and size (didn’t use the check-in facility). Staff at the terminal were extremely sour, slow, almost rude, bare minimum of everything. Air Italia: hmmmm, the flight there was ok, missed our return flight because they can’t even send you to the right terminal, let alone right gate. Icelandair: we had a 70 year old pilot who’s idea of a good landing is one you can walk away from."},{"instruction":"What was the strangest fast food order you've seen?","output":"Pizza.

The resources not only include money or talented staff, but also decisions, clear task descriptions and strategic directions. As an early-stage startup CEO, you'll often need to do a little more operative work, because your team is just not large enough to delegate everything.

There has been much mixing of population in the last 500 years, so I’m pretty sure whatever ethnicity Vlad was, it doesn’t have direct descendants today’s Romania. I cannot say, looking at Vlad’s portraits, that he exhibits any facial features common to any subgroups that today we call ethnic Romanians.

I am from Poland, a western country that doesn’t have nearly any muslims, and yet even some Poles were victims of ISIS propaganda. However they were allowed to come back as different people who were completely changed and were very sorry for their mistake. Now the main problem with these things is that in some western countries it is easy to get hold of citizenship very quickly without any problems and requirements to be even culturally close or care about the nation that you are citizen of. That’s when problems like that arise. And it doesn’t mean that it’s only the problem of the country that hands out its citizenship like warm buns. It’s also other countries’ problem because we have things like free movement and Shengen area so people who shouldn’t have access to these things can move around with no problem.

Basically, it plays a major role in simplifying the job of developing a web application. It makes the job of Node.js developers easy. It can be considered as one of the best choices for indulging in cross-platform run-time environments and real-time applications. There are many companies but there are many reasons for choosing a perfect web application development company who are having developers who understand Node.js. The Node.js platform is able to distribute the workload to a number of service providers as well as client requests. Node.js is specially chosen when a business owner is looking for generating dynamic content of reading, deleting, and creating files on the server easily by using data modification. Got [LINKED_TEXT: NodeJS Development] [URL: https://ditindia.com/services/nodejs-Development/] project in mind? Let’s discuss it. Reasons why companies are shifting to Node.js development It is basically loaded with the version 8 engine that is being powered by Google is able to comply with the Javascript for running machine code in a very fast way. Because of this, it is able to speed up the processes of the framework. Some of the major benefits that are making the companies switch to Node.js are given below- Fast It is possible to build an application in a fast and flexible manner that is able to handle multiple connections that are parallel. The response time has been reduced to 35 percent by PayPal. Moreover, PayPal is also able to handle double requests because of this Node.js. Sharing is easy Because of the Node.js, it is possible to share in an easy manner by using the Package manager of the node that is known as the NPM. It is having a storehouse of bundles which amounts to 50,000. This helps the designers in making necessary provisions before the project is started. Moreover, this will also help the developers in sharing refreshing, and also reusing the code without giving any extra effort. The web development companies basically utilize the dynamic bundles and make the most out of it and so they are able to meet all the requirements of their clients. Realtime web application Node.js is very important for those developers or development companies who makes real-time application like messenger apps and gaming apps. An event-based as well as a non-blocking server is required for building those kinds of web applications. Node.js is therefore the best way to develop a real-time web application. Hire node js developer who can fulfill all your requirements for making the perfect real-time web application. Single codebase It is basically a tough job to send data between client and server for effective synchronization. Here also Node.js can make the work of the developers easy. Node.js will help the developers to write Javascript for the client as well as server distinctively and so your next project is completed easily by seeking a Node.js developer. Data streaming In the case of developing any successful product, t is very essential to handle top-notch I/O. The process is very much tough when using the responses and requests of HTTP0. Node.js is able to handle these kinds of processes very easily that will allow users for transcoding media files at the same time when they are uploaded. Utilizing the skills of developers Every developer is having a little bit of knowledge about the JavaScipt. It is very difficult to find a perfect web developer. So it is very useful to choose a platform that is known by everyone. So Node.js is the best platform that is very easy to use and is mostly preferred by many developers. Hosting is simplified The Node.js platform is responsible for adding more facilities and is also multiplying the speed for adding extra features and this is because it is preferred by most of the open-source development companies. This is very useful for PaaS services that will be reducing the organizations to a solitary order. The full form of PaaS is Platform-as-a-Service. This is the main reason why Node.js is preferred by Heroku. Read the blog- What Steps Should I Follow To Hire A NodeJS Developer/Team? Boost in productivity Because of the compile-time error handling, Node.js is considered to be highly productive in Java. The process of product development can become faster easily by blending frontend as well as backend teams into a single team. SEO friendly SEO is very much essential in case of developing any web app. The number of competitors is increasing daily and so to stay at the top of the search engine it is important to have good SEO. The Node.js helps in backend rendering and so the visibility as search engines is more and is able in optimizing the React projects. Both the high speed as well as top-notch performance also helps in making the SEO better along with a good quality user experience. Community A comprehensive library is maintained and supported by the company. There are more than 1000 contributors. The community is a helping community and the people present there help each other which helps the developers to have knowledge about the latest technology. Hire dedicated developers who are engaged with the community so that they are technologically advanced. Open toolset The main reason why many companies are preferring the use of Node.js is because of the ecosystem which is highly engaging and is available for free. This means that all the necessary tools for developers are available like Flux and Redux when they are running the backend of Node.js. Single-threaded platform It is very easy for the Node.js platform very easily because of its single-threaded nature. The platform provides its developers with all the tools that are necessary to build web applications that are performance-driven in very little time."},{"instruction":"Did China have no choice but to implement the One Child Policy?

Though bugs and errors can occur for a number of reasons — some due to poorly created websites, or server errors, regardless of which, you’ll want to know what steps to take to place your website in optimal state should an error occur. At the point of building your website, it is a standard practice to have the complete backup of site, to safeguard your content in the advent of errors or crashes.

Update WordPress version Downloading and updating your WordPress version could save you a whole lot, since this replaces your existing installation with updated folders. This is another great fix, since it doesn’t replace any content you have created on WordPress. Image Errors Another common WordPress error occurs with images. Content images may not get uploaded into the post, or may not display properly. Sometimes your entire media library doesn’t display. Image errors mostly occur due to bad image types, or a change in folder permission. Most times a reset on plugins would restore permissions and allow you get past image errors. Post schedule errors Scheduling your posts on WordPress allow you a great deal of flexibility because you can be away due to travel, and your posts still gets published as you’ve set them to. Imagine the horror if you scheduled for a full week and none of those posts got published! To fix this error, check the WordPress missed scheduled plugin and activate it (this would automatically check for all missed scheduled posts and post them appropriately) Errors and bugs would definitely reduce the momentum of any team, since your users would need to rely elsewhere to get the services you provide.

Then in 2015 my husband and I decided we wanted to leave Bangkok, me for grad school and him for more career opportunities. Since he's a techie, I have US citizenship, and my parents live in the Bay Area, it seemed like a no-brainer to move to the Bay. It was a pretty big risk though with COL being so high and neither of us having jobs on arrival. We stayed with my parents for a short time until we had sent in his green card application and he had approval to work (you get that before the application is approved). Then we moved to Berkeley temporarily (blowing through savings like there was no tomorrow) so that I could do the prerequisites I needed for grad school applications. When my husband got a job in SF, we moved here to avoid commuting. I was also working part-time in SF by then. We've been really fortunate that the stars aligned for all of this because if any one thing had gone sideways the whole plan could have fallen apart.

Then we have to talk to people politely, talk to our parents politely. Have dinner, act like we’re not tired then do homework and the rest of. So we’re tired, sue us we do not have to revise all the time I have exams coming up and my parents want me to revise when I come home. I guess they just don’t realise that revising is what I do all day and not something I need to do after school, especially with the amount of work I do on the weekends. It’s ridiculous and i’m tired We need privacy This isn’t teens trying to hide things from you, nor is it a sign that you’ve ‘failed’. Just because we want to close our doors, doesn’t mean we want to completely shut you out. And this isn’t an invitation to force the information out of us, whether by confronting us or searching our rooms/phones. It’s just decency really you can’t treat us like teens, but expect us to act like adults you get one or the other. If you want me to be an adult, then treat me as such. I will act how you treat me and you don’t get to expect me to make life changing decisions accurately while also not trusting me to make those decisions. This is for everything like money, friends, studying. Let us make mistakes we may not be perfect, don’t worry we know we’re not, but let us make our own mistakes. Let us splurge on things we don’t need so we learn not to do that in the future. Let us decide our revision timetables so we know how to tweak it in the future. LET US MAKE MISTAKES (without berating us afterwards) We’re not perfect and neither are you Support don’t criticise This is an odd one, but basically you’re job isn’t to say ‘you’d be prettier/more popular/smarter/etc. if you…’. Don’t make criticisms of our appearance or popularity or intelligence because we are already critical of ourselves. Just accept us for who we are, acne and all. We get enough of that from social media, we don’t need it from you too Everyone has a food stash Every teenager has a small stash of food in their room. It’s a completely normal teenage thing and if you find it, it’s not going to stop, we’re just going to get better at hiding it. I personally have what might be considered a large stash, but it’s not massive, I’m not unhealthy and I always make sure to balance it with healthy food and exercise. Sometimes it doesn’t always balance out, but I’m a teen. I’m not going to be super healthy or have a perfect diet. As long as it isn’t having a huge impact on my health, it’s going to happen. And no I don’t want you to buy the food for me. I don’t know how to explain it, but it’s just something that’s mine and I don’t want you seeing it. Just because we can’t articulate something, doesn’t make you right Sometimes we’re too emotional or just not quite educated enough to talk about something, and that doesn’t make you right. Just because I don’t know how to say ‘privacy is a basic human right’ in terms you’ll understand, doesn’t mean I am wrong. Also when we’re talking about more adult topics. I care a lot about those things and I try to educated myself as much as I can on them between studying and sleeping. But I don’t know everything. For some reason as soon as you don’t know one thing or get something wrong, every other valid opinion you’ve said counts for nothing. my age does not equate to my intelligence there are probably more, but these are the ones that just first came to mind"},{"instruction":"Why is SRK the biggest superstar in India?","output":"Shahrukh is the excellent actor of our Bollywood . 1- his neture is meking the biggest star of the world . 2-he is richest actor of the world 3- Shahrukh movie is running World wide like pathan, Chennai express,raone etc. 4- sahrukh movie songs always blogbuster.

The idea behind a “battler” is that he (or she, but the stereotype is almost invariably male) is a particular kind of worker. My copy of Don Watson’s Worst Words, which has a typically pungent definition in it, is on holiday at the moment, but if you think about that very blue-collar, manual-worker type of person, you’re probably not far off. Jimmy Barnes’ “Working Class Man” would be a pretty decent description overall, although the “did his time in Vietnam/Still mad at Uncle Sam” is perhaps a bit dated. The term, as far as I can see, came about due to the perception that the ALP - traditionally the party of the blue-collar working man - had moved its focus to the “inner-city elites” during the Hawke/Keating era. Thus, the people “working hard to make a living” (sorry, once you start on Barnesy it’s hard to stop) were being ignored, and were ripe for rediscovery by John Howard."},{"instruction":"the U.S., you need a birth certificate to get your Social Security card, and you need your Social Security card to get your birth certificate, so what do you do if you have neither?","output":"The law allows for persons with no birth certificate.

It's a server that acts as a \\"intermediary\\" between end-users and the web pages they visit on the internet. An IP address is used when a device connects to the internet. This is similar to your home's street address in that it directs incoming data where it should go and provides a return address for other devices to use. Proxies provide an extra layer of security to your screen. They can be configured as web filters or firewalls to protect your device from internet threats such as malware. This added protection is especially useful when used in conjunction with a secure web gateway or other email security items. This allows you to filter traffic based on the level of safety or the amount of traffic your individual computers can handle. Proxies are used by certain people for personal reasons, such as concealing their location when watching movies online. They can, however, be used by an organisation to accomplish a number of important tasks, including: Improve securitySecure employees’ internet activity from people trying to snoop on themBalance internet traffic to prevent crashesControl the websites employees accessSave bandwidth by caching files or compressing incoming traffic How a Proxy Works A proxy server serves as a go-between for a device and the internet since it has its own IP address. When you send an internet message, it is forwarded to the proxy, which then receives the response from the web server and forwards the data from the website to your computer's browser, such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge. How Is the Server Set Up? To use a proxy server, you must first configure it on your machine, device, or network. Check the steps needed for your device or network, as each operating system has its own configuration procedures. In the vast majority of instances, however, setup entails the use of an automated configuration script. There will be options to enter the IP address and the relevant port if you want to do it manually."},{"instruction":"What kind of damage would Phonon Maser weapons do, thermal or kinetic?","output":"Fictional made-up weapons can do anything you like them to do. MASERsA maser is a microwave version of a laser (and was developed first), but they are too weak to be much of a weapon. Astrophysical masers are powerful enough to cause damage but controlling them as weapons is definitely science fiction for the foreseeable future. PhononsA phonon is a quantum of vibrational energy in a crystal. Quanta of optical energy, i. e. photons, can be absorbed as phonons in certain crystals. For example, phonons played a role in longwave infrared absorption in sodium chloride and potassium chloride crystals which were of interest in the 1960s and 1970s when carbon dioxide lasers were being explored as weapons. An example of such weapons is the ALL (airborne laser laboratory - KC-135 described in Airborne Laser - Bullets of Light). I worked on the XLD (eXperimental Laser Device) at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft in Florida in 1977-8 and also the bi-reactant carbon dioxide laser. Combining maser and phonon into a weapon name is purely fictional as far as I know and there is no potential as an actual weapon. Laser WeaponsLaser weapon development has had a curious cycle. 1960–1964 The ruby laser started it all but the limitation in ruby crystal size soon led to the development of Nd:glass lasers. These were flash-pumped and incredibly inefficient. 1964–1974 Gas dynamic lasers took the lead, particularly the carbon dioxide laser. (Wavelength about 10 microns) 1973–1995 Experiments with chemical lasers led to the deuterium fluoride laser and the hydrogen fluoride laser. The Tri-services laser, MIRACL, MADS, RACHL Sigma-Tau, Alpha, and THEL were examples of this type of laser. (Wavelength 2.6 to 4.3 microns) 1993–2006 The chemical oxygen-iodine laser (COIL) at 1.315 microns wavelength was the next development and it was used in the ABL (airborne laser YAL-1), and the ATL (advanced tactical laser) 2002-present The military decided that massive gas and chemical lasers (powered by not only explosive chemicals but also by rocket engines) were not practical for military deployment. There were experiments with free electron lasers, but the military has most recently gone down the path of diode-pumped neodymium and erbium-doped glass fibers. (Wavelength about 1 to 1.5 microns) Maser WeaponsWe have never had maser weapons and don’t foresee them as potential weapons. This has not precluded high power microwave beams, but microwave beams are easier to generate electronically than with masers. Despite the science fiction lore, you can’t just shoot phonons through the air because they aren’t really universal quanta of sound energy. Since air is not crystalline, it doesn’t work, though it sounds good to non-science people. What is a real phonon maser?I know, I know, I am raining on the parade. But did you want the real answer or not? So what in science is an actual phonon maser? A phonon maser is a device that uses the quantum properties of matter to amplify the radio frequency signals of weak microwave sources. The masers amplify the microwave signal by using the matters' quantum excitation (such as the excitation of a phonon) to stimulate the electrons in the matter to emit a photon; a pump laser can maintain the excited state of the electrons.

It's like if you took an INFJ, who's all about feelings and intuition, and you added a little alpha to the mix. So, you got someone who's empathetic, but also assertive as hell. Now, you might be thinking, \\"that sounds like a damn unicorn or something,\\" and you're not wrong. An alpha INFJ is a rare breed, like a Bigfoot or a sensible politician. But when you come across one, you'll know it. They're the ones who can read your mind, but also tell you to get your shit together. These folks have a strong sense of intuition, so they know what's up before you even open your mouth. They're like a psychic who can also bench press your weight in gold. They might not always say what you want to hear, but they'll always say what you need to hear. But don't get it twisted, just because they're in touch with their emotions, don't mean they won't kick your ass if you cross them. They got that alpha energy, which means they're not afraid to stand up for what they believe in. They'll go toe-to-toe with anyone who tries to mess with them or their loved ones. So, if you ever come across an alpha INFJ, don't mess with them. They might seem all nice and empathetic, but they got that alpha energy too. And trust me, you don't want to mess with a psychic Bigfoot who can bench press your weight in gold."},{"instruction":"What is it like to have a good/best friend of the opposite gender?","output":"You feel fortunate enough:) It was untill recently that i found him.

Then i met akki( akash). Coming to his description( hope he never reads this answer, sir pe chadega sala). He is a sensible , practical, matured ,at the same time cool , funny , insane. Now coming to the question , how it feels. Terribly awesome because you don't have to do any formalities , nor you care what he thinks, because he doesn't. Sometimes you talk daily, something you dont even for a week or two,it doesn't matter much, because deep down you both care for eachother and will be there , when needed. you can make fun of him and vice versa, to which neither you get offended nor he. You can praise any guy infront of him and vice versa, since we don't see each other as couples , so we are like\\" nevermind\\". At hard times he is there to teach you what's good and what's not, he is there to hold you when you need. You can tell him whatever you feel . Akki is kind off a kiddo but at the same time mature enough at an age of 19 . So yes that's what i appreciate the most about him. So having a guy as best friend that too , much more mature than you , is like a free cup with the big pack of Nescafe. Thats it, isse jyaada tarrif uski pachegi nhi.

So, each sprint begins with sprint planning. Sprint planning is a recurring, just-in-time activity that occurs at the beginning of each sprint, when the entire Scrum team gathers to agree on a sprint goal and to select a subset of product backlog items it can commit to accomplish during the sprint. For a two-week to month-long sprint, sprint planning should take no longer than four to eight hours to complete. The participants, inputs, outputs, and basic process of sprint planning are shown in the image below. PARTICIPANTS IN SPRINT PLANNING The full Scrum team collaborates during sprint planning. This includes the development team, the product owner, and the ScrumMaster. INPUTS TO SPRINT PLANNING Sprint planning relies on a set of inputs that guide the development team in determining what value it can realistically deliver during the sprint. These sprint planning inputs are as follows: Product BacklogThe highest priority PBIs should already be groomed, which typically means the PBIs have acceptance criteria, and have been sized appropriately, estimated, and prioritized. Team VelocityThe team's historical velocity is one indicator of how much work is practical for the team to complete in a single sprint. ConstraintsThe team should have identified any business or technical constraints that could materially affect what the team's can deliver. Team CapabilitiesThe team should know which team members are available (and what their availability is) for this particular sprint, as well as which skills each team member has. Initial Sprint GoalThe product owner should have identified the business objective he ideally would like to see accomplished during the sprint. OUTPUTS OF SPRINT PLANNING At the end of sprint planning, the development team communicates its commitment through the two sprint planning outputs: a finalized sprint goal and a sprint backlog. SPRINT PLANNING PROCESS The process of sprint planning can be accomplished in several ways, but in general there are two approaches to sprint planning: two-part sprint planning and one-part sprint planning. Both approaches begin with the team determining its capacity. Determine Team Capacity Put simply, a team's capacity is the estimated total number of hours the team will have available to work on product backlog items during the sprint, minus other regular sprint activities, non-sprint commitments, and planned time off. The capacity should take into account individual team member skills as well, especially highly specialized skills that might have very limited availability during a sprint. Most teams also reserve some buffer time against the unplanned and unexpected including but not limited to maintenance, run the business and impromptu meetings based on past experience. Sprint Planning Approach The development teams begins by determining its capacity to deliver work. Based on available capacity, the sprint goal may need to be refined. Next, the team selects the highest priority requested product backlog item and acquires confidence that the selected item will reasonably fit within the sprint, given other items already included in the team's evolving commitment. This cycle is then repeated in priority order until the team is out of capacity to do any more work. At that point, the team finalizes its commitment and sprint planning is over. Refine the Sprint Goal The sprint goal summarizes the business purpose and value of the sprint. The product owner comes to sprint planning with an initial sprint goal, but the sprint goal would be refined over the course of sprint planning to match the reality of what can be delivered during the sprint. Finalize the Commitment At the completion of sprint planning, the development team finalizes its commitment to the business value it will deliver by the end of the sprint. This commitment is expressed in a refined sprint goal and sprint backlog."},{"instruction":"What are the best baby skin care products?","output":"A baby’s skin is very soft, gentle and sensitive.

You feel a positive energetic bounce. You have a beautiful energetic frequency that empowers you to unlock your spiritual gifts in your way. You are infectious with love for everyone you encounter You beam with Light that you uplift and heal those in your life. Inner healing work is a very intimate sacred journey you take within yourself to take personal inventory. It opens your core wounds to heal them. You stare into the darkest parts of your soul to uncover any inner demons you are hiding from. The spiritual awakening process lights you up within. Every part of you comes to light: The good, the bad, and the ugly. If a twin flame resists embracing self-work and inner healing processes, life becomes painful and very complicated. You suffer in quiet desperation. You feel disconnected within. You cannot run away from your pan and yourself for too long.

In other words, the ring of the black hole (or Accretion disk) does not go over and above the black hole as we see in the pictures… The gravity of the black hole is so strong that it bends the light coming from the rear part of accretion disk and makes it appear as if it is facing towards us… . One more interesting fact about the black hole is that it is the only sphere whose all sides can be seen at once. That means you can see the front side and the back side of the black hole altogether at once. . Here's a video from a youtube channel, Veritasium, that helps to understand the structure of a blackhole better. .

The internet — and The Metaverse — is just a reflection of the people who use it. It doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and it doesn’t create itself. So if there is a corner that is occupied by angels (so to speak) it will be nice, and a corner that is occupied by devils, it will be a craphole.

That means a suit, well dressed and a lot of certificates and degrees on the wall. That does the trick for many. No wonder this goes wrong. Especially in family offices etc. Some clients will look at past performance, and based on that decide to go all in. Only a few just go for an actual conversation with the guy and see if what he has to offer, suits their risk appetite. How much are you willing to lose, what is the risk you are willing to take, does that match with what he has to offer? If you have no knowledge of finance in your life, I'd take a friend who might know a thing or two about investments. Obviously, one you don't pay."},{"instruction":"What would you do if one of your bridesmaids didn't like the dress you have chosen for her?","output":"If I were choosing the dresses I’d out why she’s not digging it.

No one benefits if she looks bad or is so uncomfortable that she’s miserable. Other than those considerations, the bridesmaid has to decide whether or not she’s willing to sacrifice her opinions without complaining, and allow the bride to have her day in the sun. If the bridesmaid is mature this shouldn’t be a problem but if she isn’t then, unfortunately, there wil be some hurt feelings and resentment over it. If that’s the case let someone else run interference so the bride doesn’t have to deal with it. They can smooth things over after the wedding."},{"instruction":"ving at 62, I have no pension.

But people with Alzheimer’s can have periods of delusions and may in fact think they are on vacation. My gran for example thinks at times she is in her own home with two bedrooms even though she is in a care facility. She passes 20 odd rooms each day (with people in them and doors wide open) and shares with another woman, but she still thinks she is in her own home, living by herself! I have quickly learnt telling her the actual reality doesn’t go down to well. Instead it stresses her, makes her very agitated and she thinks I am lying to her and is basically less trusting of me. You don’t want that, instead you want you’re love one to feel like they can trust you. It’s really strange but for some reason if they feel you have broken their trust, they actually remember it the next time they see you. For example my gran now constantly keeps thinking doctors are lying to her, because they have probably told her some reality she doesn’t understand or believe. She is now fixated on doctors who lie to her and now is less trusting of them. She apparently has reported them to the newspapers and it’s going to be on the news, because they lied so much! If I disagreed with her assessments and tried to explain where the doctors were coming from she would just start to get agitated and distrust me too. So I have basically learnt you have to play along with their reality a bit and try to redirect conversations. So if they say they are on a desert island and they can see the lovely palm trees in the distance, you go “oh palm trees are great!” and then you redirect the conversation to something like “so tell me about your childhood granny”. Redirect them to something they enjoy talking about (my gran loves talking about her childhood). I can tell you through experience that this method makes a person with Alzheimer's less stressed and interactions are so much more enjoyable. Teepa Snow on YouTube is very good at giving great tips on handling and redirecting conversations for people with Alzheimer's."},{"instruction":"w do I transfer a Word document to a PDF?","output":"Open the Word document in Word Online (upload it).

However, there are some concerns about the use of plastic or other synthetic containers in the microwave, as some chemicals from the container can leach into the food. To minimize this risk, it's best to use microwave-safe glass or ceramic containers and avoid using plastic containers, especially if they are old or damaged. Additionally, it's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions for using the microwave and to avoid overcooking or burning food, as this can create harmful compounds.

There are several factors that have contributed to Apple's decision not to implement touchscreens in Macs, which I will explain in detail. First and foremost, Apple has always believed in creating distinct experiences for different devices. While the iPhone and iPad are designed specifically for touch interactions, Macs have been designed for use with a keyboard and trackpad. Apple's goal is to optimize the user experience for each device, and combining touch and traditional input methods in one device may lead to a suboptimal experience. This is why Apple has focused on refining the trackpad experience for Macs, introducing features like Force Touch, Multi-Touch gestures, and haptic feedback. Another consideration is ergonomics. Using a touchscreen on a laptop or desktop computer can lead to an uncomfortable user experience, especially during extended use. Reaching out to touch the screen of a Mac would require the user to lift their arm repeatedly, which can cause strain and discomfort over time. This is commonly referred to as \\"gorilla arm\\" syndrome. By contrast, a trackpad allows users to maintain a more natural and comfortable posture while interacting with their device. Apple has also been concerned about the potential impact of touchscreens on the overall design and aesthetics of Macs. Adding a touchscreen could result in a thicker and heavier device, which would compromise the sleek and lightweight design that Apple strives for in its products. Additionally, touchscreens typically have a glossy surface, which can be more prone to fingerprints and glare, potentially detracting from the premium Mac experience. Instead of adding touchscreens to Macs, Apple has focused on other ways to bridge the gap between touch and traditional input methods. For example, the introduction of the Touch Bar on some MacBook Pro models provides a touch-based interface that allows users to access context-sensitive controls and shortcuts. The Touch Bar is designed to complement the keyboard and trackpad experience, rather than replace it.

Este producto ya está terminado y está mostrando excelentes resultados. ¿Cómo puede esta nueva fórmula salvar millones de vidas en España y por qué está disponible con un 50% de descuento? Este tema será el tema principal de nuestra discusión de hoy. Reportero: Luis, estás entre los 10 estudiantes más brillantes del mundo. ¿Por qué decidiste especializarte en la investigación y el estudio de la diabetes? En realidad, me resulta difícil hablar de esto públicamente porque el motivo es personal. Hace varios años, mi madre murió de diabetes. Resulta que la diabetes es una enfermedad oncogénica. Los picos continuos en los niveles de azúcar en la sangre contribuyen a la aparición de radicales libres, que pueden conducir a la aparición de tumores malignos o cáncer. Cuando los especialistas finalmente descubrieron el estado de mi madre, ya era demasiado tarde. Es por eso que comencé a estudiar varios temas relacionados con la diabetes y sus estrategias de tratamiento. Me sorprendió saber que la mayoría de las píldoras que se venden en las farmacias contienen sustancias químicas peligrosas que solo agravarán la condición del paciente. Mi madre solía tomar estos productos todos los días. Es por eso que solo me he centrado en investigar este tema durante los últimos tres años.

I think I wore my hair up. I also brought a leather binder that has paper and pen for notes. I’m told I interview well and I think part of it is that I hide nervousness effectively and use a measured way of speaking. Anyway, I walked up to the area where the interviewing was to take place and watched the other candidates look at me and I could tell they felt underdressed in comparison. We were brought into the interviewing room and asked various questions. A bit later, I was asked to stay behind and I heard someone whisper, “I knew it!” I got the job. Another time, and I’ve written about this before, I’d been working at a health food store and none of the gals there shaved their legs so I thought I would try it out. I didn’t like it much but I’d not had a chance to shave before an interview at Bullock’s. I was acing the interview, I could tell by the interviewer’s reactions to me, until her eyes roamed down to my cream stocking-covered legs and she got a gander at my hairy legs!

So instead of answering myself, I'm going to quote a comment from one of the users (adminbeast). Here it is. “Despite all appearances to the contrary, brutalism actually emerged as a fundamentally democratic, people-focused architectural movement. Go on Google Images, plug in \\"brutalist architecture\\", and you'll find features like: Enormous public spaces both inside and out. Part of the reason brutalism is associated with huge buildings is because their public spaces are oversized and prominent. (Common features include enormous public squares, overhead walkways, atriums cutting though the centre of the building, and either raising the building up on stilts or cantilevering upper floors in order to create additional public space at ground level.) Highly decipherable purposes and layouts. (Where's the entrance? Where's the staircase? Where are the public spaces vs. the private spaces? It's often obvious even from outside the building.) Prominent windows and skylights, attracting natural light from all directions. (And often balconies as well, even on commercial and institutional buildings.) Planters, water features, and other elements to break up the grey. Moreover, the first brutalists genuinely believed they were creating enhanced human experiences. They envisioned brutalist buildings as experiments in democracy and pluralism, creating greater equality and enhanced public spaces: instead of being closed away in an office or an apartment, the life of these buildings would spill out into walkways, atriums, stairwells and corridors. These buildings would put human needs first, and would be more humane and accessible than anything which had come before. But they were wrong. It failed in one big, obvious way: \\"good\\" brutalism costs an awful lot of money, and produces inefficient spaces. Do you have any idea how much money it costs to operate a ten-storey atrium with a huge skylight, lush gardens and water features? The electricity bill alone, to say nothing of what that skylight does to the heat and cooling costs, or what the landscaper charges to water and maintain all those plants, or how often the fountains break down... and it's dead space, at that: it's a room people walk through. It doesn't make the landlord a single cent. As such, the architecture got squeezed almost immediately, and these public spaces began to shrink or even disappear altogether from brutalist buildings. (Indeed, you can find lots of brutalist buildings which look amazing in photographs from the 60s and 70s, but which, having had their planters emptied out and their fountains switched off and the art taken down and the carpet replaced with cheaper surfaces, look bland and oppressive today. Here's an interesting 1-for-1 comparison.) By the 70s, Brutalism had become synonymous with economical building: cheap and standardized, no frills, textured cement and plate glass, pack the people in. Ideal for council housing, university campuses, government buildings, and nuclear bunkers -- and wholly unsuitable for anything else. But brutalism failed in another, perhaps more important, way. The brutalists were just wrong about what people wanted. Like, yes, people do want nice public spaces. We like a nice atrium. But especially in the northern hemisphere, we don't want to hang out in them all the damned time. If you put up a building in Montreal, and it includes all these gorgeous public squares and walkways in the sky, they're going to be unused for four months of the year, because it's too cold, too windy, too icy, too snowy... (And during those four months, it looks fucking awful. No greenery, nobody in sight, just snow and ice and exposed cement.) And the brutalists also often went a bit overboard, including public features largely for the sake of having them. The building gets a walkway, a public square, a common room or a roof garden more because we like the idea of having this public space, rather than because we've actually studied whether people will use it. As it turns out, with apartment buildings in particular, people do mostly want to hang out in their own apartments. (And brutalist institutional buildings are often veritably filled with walkaways which might only be used a few hundred times per year, if that.) This created several nested problems: dead space is never a good thing, but dead space in public buildings often attracts miscreants. (And not just because of low traffic: those vast, empty public squares are great for drug dealers, and those wind-swept walkways make for prime escape routes if the cops show up, while the shadows beneath them are good hiding places...) Couple that with reliance upon brutalism in building public housing, and you've got a real problem: poor people trapped in ugly, awful buildings which don't actually meet their needs, but which often do meet the needs of the sorts of criminals who prey on poor people. (And public housing is chronically underfunded in most countries, so these buildings were constructed on the cheap and basically not maintained.) Finally, over top of all of this, brutalist architecture came to popularity during an era of Urban Renewal: between the 50s and 70s, it was very fashionable in municipal planning to tear out established neighbourhoods in favour of \\"planned development\\": expressways, tower blocks, sterile landscapes and lots and lots and lots of brutalist architecture. This movement became increasingly controversial, in part because they failed so catastrophically at their own goals. (The new neighbourhoods often became slums almost overnight, were generally unpleasant places to live, and have been chronically under-served by commerce: in many cases, this movement created food and retail deserts on what had previously been perfectly healthy neighbourhoods, and these deserts have often endured for 50+ years.) Because so many of these projects turned upon brutalist construction, the style got married to the movement, and each ends up associated with the sins of the other. That's lots of reasons to hate it. Why do some people love it? For some of us, brutalism still looks futuristic somehow, in the same way that art deco often feels like a vision of the future even though it's more than 100 years old. Brutalism is Star Trek, brutalism is Epcot, brutalism is Soviet monuments to the future, and brutalism is Mass Effect. Some of us also like the idea of cheering for the underdog. There are lots of beautiful brutalist buildings in the world, and they often go un-championed because the style is so controversial and unpopular. But personally, I'm into brutalism because I like the ideals the original brutalists had in mind, if not necessarily how they excecuted them. I like the idea of utterly democratic architecture: architecture which tries to give the people who use the space as many options and as much prominence as possible. Architecture which invites you to linger and explore, and gives you interesting spaces to inhabit beyond your own private realm. Architecture which views public spaces as a place for people, rather than as a tool for getting people to their \\"rightful\\" places. And, yes, architecture which challenges our assumptions about what can be beautiful, what can attract attention, and what people will do with the spaces you present to them. With all that in mind, when I say \\"I love brutalism\\", I don't mean that I love every building described as \\"brutalist\\". Many of them are terrible, and I wouldn't lose sleep over their being torn down. But I'm very sympathetic to the ideals, visions and promises at the centre of the movement, and I believe that, despite its reputation, brutalism has led to many remarkable and successful structures, to say nothing of what application of those ideas has done in other schools of architecture. (Blobitecture in particular has essentially plundered the brutalist playbook, taking everything but the concrete.) And I think that's a legacy worth defending.” Here's the link to the thread: [LINKED_TEXT: Why so much hate/love for Brutalism?] [URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/brutalism/comments/g29ehs/why_so_much_hatelove_for_brutalism/] Also, I've made a short describer video on Brutalism, if you want to check that out as well!"},{"instruction":"f evolution were true (it clearly is not), what would observable evidence look like?","output":"What is clear is that you haven’t a clue what evolution is. don’t be lazy, go Google the answer, read and learn something useful for a change instead of spouting nonsense!"},{"instruction":"With how hard it is being an undocumented immigrant, why not just give them citizenship?","output":"Wtf should we reward criminals?!"},{"instruction":"Would Hillary Clinton have made a better President than Donald J Trump?","output":"No way!"},{"instruction":"Why were coins first made out of gold and silver but now most coins are made from base metals such as copper or zinc?","output":"If you talking of monetary coins or currency coins, they are no more made of precous metals as the price of precous metals are now changed everyday subject to market forces. if you talking about investment coins, they are still made of mostly pure gold ( 24K ) or of alloyed Gold ( mostly alloyed with Si and or Ag - Cu ) known as carat coins. 22K coins either with copper or combination of Cu and Ag are the next popular investment coins."},{"instruction":"Would Hillary Clinton have made a better President than Donald J Trump?","output":"Is this a joke?

However, there are several steps you can take to reduce overall body fat, which can lead to a reduction in face fat. Follow a healthy diet: Eating a healthy, balanced diet that is low in calories can help you lose weight overall, including in your face. Focus on consuming plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains while limiting your intake of processed foods, sugary beverages, and high-fat foods.Exercise regularly: Engaging in regular cardiovascular exercise, such as running, cycling, or swimming, can help you burn calories and lose weight. Additionally, incorporating strength training exercises into your routine can help you build muscle mass, which can increase your metabolism and help you burn more calories throughout the day.Drink plenty of water: Drinking water can help you stay hydrated and reduce bloating, which can contribute to a puffy-looking face.Get enough sleep: Lack of sleep can lead to increased levels of cortisol, a stress hormone that can contribute to weight gain. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night to help keep your cortisol levels in check.Reduce stress: Chronic stress can also lead to increased cortisol levels and weight gain. Finding healthy ways to manage stress, such as through meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises, can help reduce the impact of stress on your body. It is important to keep in mind that losing weight and reducing face fat takes time and effort. Be patient, stay consistent with your diet and exercise habits, and celebrate your progress along the way. I've put together a list of 5 excellent products if you're interested in learning more about tried-and-true methods for losing weight effectively, and I think one or two of them would be of particular interest to you.

The area wasn’t too big but it was beautiful. The time of year was around mid Oct and the campground was going to be closing that weekend for the Winter months. Now the campground rules where that people were to be at their site by dark and quiet by 10pm. Since it was late Fall it was getting dark early and I was out and about taking my last hike before I have to call it a day. I walked by a back trail and there wasn’t a soul to be seen. My dog started to growl low in his throat. He kept looking at the woods. I figured deer, wolves, or something in those lines. Told myself, “Keep moving and don’t run!” For some reason I looked to the ground just off the road and a bit into the woods. I saw something pinkish. I wanted a closer look than I wished I hadn’t. It was a hand. A human hand! No body and Just the hand. I kept moving heading for my camper. Trying to justify what I had seen, (Someone’s idea of a joke!) Not real! Should I call the police? Than as if in a horror movie it started to rain hard! I reached my camper and I just didn’t like the atmosphere. The whole setting. I called the police and told them about it. Mention that it might just be a prank since Halloween was just around the corner. It was then that they told me a murder had been committed and the victim had lost her hands.

Am I fired, or did I quit?","output":"Disclaimer-While I am an attorney, my answer should not be construed as legal advice. I encourage anyone in this situation to consult with an attorney barred in their respective jurisdiction for formal counsel. Direct answer-you have neither quit nor been fired. They want you to quit. In this situation, even if you have another job lined up DON’T QUIT, DON”t RESIGN. They want you to do this to avoid giving you unemployment and severance pay. Let me explain why. Now, generally, unemployment insurance is only available to those who lost their job due to no fault of their own. Exceptions apply. If the manager let you go due to not being able to keep your position, then this is would be a layoff and thus you’d be entitled to unemployment. Once you claim unemployment, the company received an increase in their unemployment tax rates. Companies don’t want these rates to go up-especially when they are facing cash flow difficulties, like your company is, which is why they need you to get off payroll. This increase in unemployment for them is avoidable if you resign-as that is now a lost job due to your own fault. This is why they want you to resign, so that you would be deemed as quitting without a valid legal reason to justify receiving unemployment. Additionally, it is often the case that if an employee resigns or quits as opposed to is terminated, then the company can avoid paying out specific severance packages as required by internal policy. So if you are ever in this situation, DON”t RESIGN. This is what you do instead: Make sure you make sure you get copies of all your performance reviews. This is to make sure if they do try to contest unemployment on account of fired due to bad performance, you can rebut it.Review internal policies to make sure you understand what severance policies are. Also, make sure you have an accounting of all outstanding leave and other benefits you are owed but have yet to receiveMake it clear, you are not Resigning-and do this in writing(paper trail). Make them lay you off.

Both the statement looks almost similar if you read the definition but once we start looking at the equation of karma in detail it might start making sense both statements are different and miles apart. Statement 2 puts human/creature as the center of the subject. Cases will be launched through the eye of the subject. Judgment should be passed concerning the subject's action. Here we are talking about justice around each species under the sun and recording of there karma and learning about the story from their point of view. Consideration should be made not just by action we should respect intention too. It is almost certain one might take the wrong action though having the right intention(we don't have access to the future). To make things simpler if we remove intention from the equation and the external environment which affects action it is still challenging to define the judgment. Defining right and wrong itself is a super hard problem. It varies from culture to culture. It is not a function of evolution also. Current wrong actions might be a possible implication of old actions or influenced by the current environment or worse by our culture change. It might be also possible our silly genes and gray matter couldn't keep up with the pace of right and wrong ever changing defination and do things through the impulse that is flowing to us for the last 5000 years through evolution. The second statement doesn't give importance to anything it just runs based on balance. Nature need to eliminate 5000 people .It will simply kill 5000 people whoever they are criminal or saint. Example of statement 2 Consider the case there might be termites or ants in our kitchen will we kill them selectively? cause some insect stole my pastries of 500 rs and others stole cheap sugar. We will not do that way. It doesn't matter they are not important. Consider the case of rabbits increasing in Australia we kill rabbits to control their population without the action they invade our agriculture land. we kill them and shoot at sight. It might be possible rabbits not coming to agricultural land will be killed less as we dont see that sample sets often. But they(rabbits) can argue themselves they are not killed because of their good karma not destroying human crops. Humans are on the same scale as rabbits if we start discarding our self-importance. I firmly believe the truth lies in middle. Nature hardly discriminates whether you are a murderer or a saint when it comes to balancing things both of their act is so negligible against the problem it is trying to solve. It will randomly take action that helps to achieve her goal. Karma/Justice notion came because of culture. Humans have already hacked the mutation by introducing the culture. Culture is evolving super fast(only in 500 years I am sitting peacefully typing on a computer in an AC room rather than waging war in the field).500 years is a blink if we run the timeline for evolution. So justice(what is defined) by culture is more available to us. If we are still thinking I have seen people struggle because of bad karma remember this statement In an infinite set of events, there will always remain a pattern that makes you believe this is the law. We see things that we want to see in this infinite event #peace"},{"instruction":"Which is the best UberEATS clone in 2020?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: UberEats clone] [URL: https://www.pakodus.com/ubereats-clone.php] is a multi restaurants on-demand app which is developed to provide quick service to customers by placing an order and delivering the food to doorstep.The online ordering feature offered by app solutions is dominating the delivery industry.

Most of the viewers here could be serious about preparation but this was the mistake which I made. Most of us join coaching without proper research. Each coaching specialises in a particular subject depending on material or faculty. One must seek the right one depending on their subject rather than just following brand names.But this is not where I failed. I joined a coaching with proper research and was even serious when it started. But with due course of time, I lost interest. As Friend circle grew we used to hangout at nearby market or go for movies after coaching. I became very casual with approach. But as the exam was approaching, deep inside I was worried and burdened by guilt for not being serious throughout tenure. This is not just my story, I have seen many other aspirants having similar traits. Even my dad saw this shift in attitude and consoled me. They encouraged me to give my best shot and reassured me that they won't judge me whatsoever my score be. They made all efforts to remove performance pressure and it indeed was big relief. In short, I had only 4 months left and did systematic preparation during this time and was able to crack GATE. I would also recommend others to follow this approach. First I bought toppers note and previous year papers with solutions from an online site like Notes4u (I ordered from here you may refer others). This helped me build a perspective with which I should prepare, learned some tricks and got to know the pattern. Than I re-attempted all my coaching material and marked different types of questions for revision. Once that was done, I ordered question bank and mocks of other coachings. During this time also prepare for GK and join online forums and social media groups for more refence material. Now this all may sound like an appoarch that is obvious but believe me very few are able to stick with it till end. This is may require lot of efforts but guarantees success. Finally I would say don't adopt a casual approach and practise a lot but in right direction."},{"instruction":"My 3yearold insists on sleeping on the floor.

Plus, you don't have to worry about secondhand smoke or lingering odors. Another reason why I vape is that it's more cost-effective than smoking. You don't have to constantly buy packs of e-cigarettes, [LINKED_TEXT: e-juice liquid] [URL: https://vocal.media/stories/vapor-boss-collection-of-vape-juices-for-an-incredible-burst-of-fruity-flavors] and you can choose from a variety of [LINKED_TEXT: Vape e-juices online] [URL: https://vocal.media/stories/vapor-boss-collection-of-vape-juices-for-an-incredible-burst-of-fruity-flavors] and flavors to customize your experience.

Now, the question asserts that the aliens are indeed invading; thus they are extraterrestrial in origin and have advanced spaceflight capabilities. If they are not from our solar system, they’ll probably possess warp drive capabilities, which means they’ve unlocked zero-point energy technology. As for their intentions, what are they? Do they seek to merely pester us? Exploit? Subjugate? Utterly annihilate? What is their philosophy? Do they even view warfare the same way we do? As much as the film sucked in many ways, I feel that Battle: Los Angeles was a great depiction of an alien invasion. The aliens came here for the water, and their warriors were war-hardened under-resourced cyborgs who obviously didn’t have the best access to everything, despite their civilization’s interstellar travel capabilities. (The directors of the film even hinted that the aliens in the film were actually the losers of a war on their own violent homeworld, and that they were likely in space for a very long time, searching for a new home, hence their lack of resources and starved/worn appearance.) Remember, every civilization is finite. In the effort to build 3–4 starships capable of warp drive, they may not have enough resources left over to equip all the troops with the best gear. Look at human history. Humans always error on the side of being too frugal, because resources are in short supply. I think other civilizations would do the same. Just because a civilization has unlocked zero-point energy and what not, that doesn’t mean they won’t still use old gear to fight. It’s a quite interesting question. To be honest, if you want to take the alien invasion conspiracies seriously, it seems that the main issue that prevents aliens from taking over Earth has to do with various forces that we ourselves may not be aware of. Think of it like this. We’re way greater than ants right? Okay, there’s a fire ant hill over there. Go destroy those ants. Uh…can I have some gloves first please? Maybe a blowtorch too? Some gas? So I can light them on fire? Maybe raid spray at least? I don’t wanna get bitten! As humans, we’re very aware of our own vulnerabilities, and we automatically assume that the enemy will “fit right into the glove of our misfortune” and screw us right where it hurts. However, to them, they don’t wanna get bitten by us. So they’ll be careful. They’ll be sneaky. I hope that helped. This is a really interesting question. I’d love to see more opinions."},{"instruction":"Scottish whisky better than American whiskey? Why or why not?","output":"You, my friend, have asked a question that has been debated for centuries.

In addition, PaintNET as the name implies has many tools for painting. You can use layers and a large selection of tools, but their functions are not as detailed as you might want.

Both have similar speeds yet the M2 type is way more expensive.","output":"“Similar” speeds isn’t exactly correct. There’s an issue with M.2 in that it allows for 2 different types of connection. Both the regular SATA connection as well as a PCIe connection. Just the fact that a SSD is connected by M.2 port doesn’t mean it isn’t a SATA based SSD. Then why have M.2 for SATA anyway? Well, the M.2 port (and its associated form factor) means the drive itself can be both smaller and placed direct onto the motherboard. This is a huge space saving and a complete removal of any cables or ribbons. Ideal for things like laptops. So even just that means a manufacturer starts charging a “premium” for the smaller form factor (rightly or wrongly - they’d still do so in order to make more profit, if competition doesn’t keep them from doing so). From a cost perspective, after the R+D has been recouped, the cost of making a card fitting into a M.2 slot “should” be less than building a casing for a 2.5″ (or even 3.5″) SSD to be plugged into a SATA port with a cable. Thus you may expect thm to become cheaper, but my guess is the manufacturers are riding the “this is new” train and keeping sell prices higher than needed. But what if the SSD is actually using that PCIe connection you mentioned? Well, here’s another problem. That PCIe connector has a larger limit than the old SATA could handle. The major difference is in the throughput. The most common SATA in computers is SATA III, which can handle up to 6gbit/sec (around 600Mbytes/sec). But the most common PCIe over M.2 is a PCIe version 3.0 running 4 lanes concurrently - this gives around 40Gbit/sec maximum throughput and can get to around 4Gbytes/sec - that’s close to 7 times more data in the same time. Also PCIe (and in particular the protocol used over it - NVMe instead of the usual AHCI over SATA) allows shorter latency. When looking for a measurement on this it’s usually listed as Input-Output-Operations-per-Second (IOPS for short). I.e. the figures listed is the opposite of how latency is measured, instead of listing how long each operation takes, it lists how many of them can occur in a second. On AHCI some SSDs get up to 100000 IOPS (translating to around 10 micro seconds per operation 1sec/100000IOPS = 0.00001sec = 0.01ms = 10us. But some NMVe based SSDs (like Samsung’s 960 pro) can get to 400000IOPS - meaning it’s around 4 times quicker from starting a read to getting the first bit of data. However - this doesn’t necessarily mean that NVMe SSDs on a M.2-PCIe connector gives those speeds and latency. The drive itself has its own limits. Those are just the best possible over those connections. E.g. you may find some high end stuff able to get to 4GByte/s transfer speeds and 400000IOPS, but then you also get some only doing 1.5GByte/s and 200000IOPS. <Off Topic>BTW, this is the major reason HDDs “feel” so slow. E.g. a typical 7200rpm HDD has IOPS of between 75 and 100, meaning it’s around 1000 times slower to responds to read/write requests than a good SSD on that exact same connector. Added to this that a HDD has a maximum transfer speed of 60 to 150 MByte/sec as opposed to SATA based SSDs getting between 200 to 600 MBytes/sec - there’s a huge difference. The difference between SATA-SSD and PCIe-SSD isn’t as great, even though it still is there.<Back on Topic> Note though, it’s highly unlikely that a SSD designed for NVMe and PCIe is at the SATA+AHCI limits. They’re usually (if not always) slightly better. At least around twice as good. But the actual experience between these is likely very minimal. On the latency front, there’s diminishing returns - a 100000IOPS isn’t going to feel 4 times slower than a 400000IOPS drive. That’s because nearly nothing in a computer needs to read or write so many different things in just one second. Also this is starting to get to the limits of the CPU and RAM, i.e. there are other parts of the computer interfering with this maximum rate of operations. One part you just might find to feel faster is the transfer speeds. Copying a large file across from one drive to another can make use of the higher transfer speeds of PCIe. E.g. copying a 50GB file from one SATA SSD getting 600MB/s to another similar can be done in a minimum of around 90 seconds. But doing so between two NVMe+PCIe SSDs able to do read/write at 4GByte/s means it would only take around 15 seconds. Manufacturers do have to produce better types of SSDs to reach those maximum throughput and latencies the NVMe+PCIe connection can afford them. Thus cost does go up, and translates to higher sell pricing. Over and above the “this is new” marketing hype to push prices further. My big gripe with this is: How many times a day do you copy a 50GB file? How much impact does this transfer speed gain really make your computing feel faster? This is why the latency aspect is of so much greater importance. Booting up, starting a program, etc. All those tends to have many small reads / writes going on all over on several different files - meaning the latency has a much greater influence over how quickly the entire task completes. And why it feels so slow on HDDs while it feels near instantaneous on SSDs. But since the latency on these never NVMe SSDs is only minimally faster, and it has some diminishing returns, there’s not a great reason to go for them in general - only really useful if you’ve got some specific need to constantly do huge transfers. So is a PCIe NVMe SSD really worth it? Perhaps not for every one. Most people would only derive a small benefit from it. So IMO they’re overkill, and just paying more for no “real” benefit. What about M.2 SATA then? Here it’s a case of needing less space. Thus for things like laptops, AiOs, set tops, minimalist PCs, etc., it really does provide some benefit. It could mean that laptop can be built thinner and lighter. Who doesn’t prefer a thin light thing to crry around as opposed to a thick bulky beast? So perhaps a “slight” premium for these may be justifiable - at least in the short term, even though it may not exactly be backed by a true cost increase and just a way of making extra profit. For computers such as desktops, it’s not really much of a benefit at all. A 2.5″ SSD isn’t going to take up that much space in a desktop, normally. It could help with cable management, and might free up some space to use for something else - e.g. better cooling systems. But it’s not as great a benefit as it was for those minimal space sort of computers."},{"instruction":"What do gun fanatics have to say about the fact that there are over 130 studies proving that gun control works?

Why did they use red anyway?","output":"Initially they didn’t paint the barns at all. And the wood deteriorated. However, farmers didn’t have a lot of money for paint, but if they had cows, they had milk. So they could use a mixture of skimmed milk, lime, and iron oxide. Iron oxide has the advantage of being a fungicide, and if you have a wooden building that’s going to be subject to rain and snow and moisture, you’re definitely going to get mildew and fungus. And since iron oxide is rust, when that mix dried, it was a kind of reddish color. Eventually farmers found out that adding a little linseed oil made it even better, forming a plastic-like coating that lasted for a long time, which is why you still see some old red barns today. Milk was actually a common component in paint. The casein from milk acts as a binder in paint and people have been using it for that purpose for centuries. In the late 1700s, early 1800s, they figured out that adding finely ground chalk and a few other compounds produced a cheap and durable paint. Other recipes used other ingredients, such as one that used water, rye flour, linseed oil and tailings from copper mines."},{"instruction":"There are 81 members in a Telegram group, however, there are 300+ views.

Enduring intense enemy fire and without regard for his own personal safety, Corporal Martinez launched a captured enemy rocket propelled grenade into the building temporarily silencing the enemy and allowing a wounded Marine to be evacuated and receive medical treatment. After receiving additional fire, he single-handedly assaulted the building and killed four enemy soldiers with a grenade and his rifle.

I’m probably going to say the same things as everyone else, but I really want to speak because I was reading some of these answers on the verge of tears. I want my mother to look and see and realise what the heck she’s doing wrong because I’m really trying. Which comes to my first point. WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO BE A PERFECT CHILD. PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT. We are not some machine you can code and program. We may not follow every instruction you give us. We love you so much, and we really do want to make you proud, but we can’t do that if all you do is point out everything we do wrong. WE ARE TRYING! We are not perfect, we are human beings, just like you. Also on this, I hate the “practice makes perfect” saying. ‘, no practice does NOT make perfect. It helps a bunch sure, but not perfection. When I was in primary school, my year one teacher told me instead “practice make progress”, and I totally agree. We are not perfect. 2. If you restrict things from me now, when you give it to me I’ll abuse it because it’s like my last chance. Just like drugs. Okay I’ve got to admit. This was kinda my fault, but at the same time not? I didn’t pay attention sometimes in Kumon (like I talked to a friend or something) which meant I regularly made mistakes and didn’t go forward. My mother responded by telling me I was an idiot and taking away things from me. I responded by cheating (yes i know idiot me but I was 10 I’m trying) and when she found out she was furious and called me a ‘bloody mistake’ and punched or slapped me. She took away things and when she gave them back, I would always abuse it by sneaking it in my room at night or what not. I was addicted, but you know what actually made me addicted? You taking it away. That’s right parents, taking away a device DOES NOT make the child learn. HECK! I tried to disguise one phone so that I could watch ASMR so I COULD SLEEP AT NIGHT (yeah we’re not all just staying up until 5am watching things, I do like my sleep thanks) and when i she found out and took it away, I did with my computer, when she took that away I took another spare phone my grandmother gave me, and when she found that guess what else I did?! I BOUGHT MYSELF A PHONE. And since she also found that OUT! GUESS WHAT?! My friend is giving me HIS SECOND-HAND PHONE BECAUSE I PAID HIM. We are going to constantly try and find new options, so you might as well just give it to us, let us LEARN the damn consequences, anD THEN GUESS WHAT! WE ACTUALLY LEARN. Now don’t get me wrong, understandably some of us are actually addicted to the internet. Understood, but we are normally mature enough to see the results of staying up late and not working on homework. We do want to get good grades, so understand that we get it. If we don’t, just nudge us. Sit down and have a good talk with us. I have cried too many times during a heartfelt lecture and I really DO try afterwards. There is no need to take away anything. It’s useless honestly. 3. “Respect your elders.” I will only respect you if you respect me. I understand this saying very well, and a lot of times I go by it. But DO NOT TELL ME that if an old woman decided to degrade you on your passions, your opinions and your life, you’d still be all nice and say “Yes, I understand. You’re right because you’ve lived longer.” I bet you’d probably tell her off and call her an asshole. Parents, this is the same for us. We will respect you. We will, but you need to show US respect first. Don’t tell me that crap of “You should be grateful I MADE YOU” when you literally did the same TO YOUR OWN PARENTS. That’s so hypocritical. Yes, I am grateful you kept me and gave birth to me. I am eternally in debt, but just because of that, I am treated like you picked and chose my personality traits. If I am not obedient, there’s probably a reason why. I will help out if you ask nicely. If I do not, I must be doing something, like texting a friend or watching a video. We have a life too. We just came from school/tuition/whatever and just want to relax. We have stresses just like you. 4. Don’t tell me how I should look like. I’ve become horribly insecure of myself because of my mom. She told me I should eat less because at the time of my growth spurt, I ate a bunch. So I did. I started getting diets and now I’m underweight by about 5 kilos. Thankfully not much, but I actually want to get to 43 kilos, which is 10 kilos underweight. Unhealthy I know, but I want it badly. She also points out my acne and buys me skincare products when at first I didn’t care. Now I buy every skin care product out there and she’s complaining because sometimes I ask her to buy it for me. I’m not the prettiest girl. I know. But please don’t attack my flaws. I don’t tell you that you look like the grouch made out with acne scarred teenager and made you did I? 5. It’s my house, so my rules/things. I kinda get the my things bit. You did buy it. But you gave it to me, so it is mine. Technically. It’s like giving a friend an item. You can’t just go to their house one day and take it back. You gave it to them. It is now theirs. Same applies to the things you give your children. You gave them a device for their birthday. That does not give you the right to throw it away if they misuse it. Yes, that happened to me. What’s even worse, my parents didn’t pay for it. My grandparents did. It was a cute walkman. I loved it. I still keep its cap for keepsakes. I had bunches of songs on it and I made my on radio show on it, it was truly a treasure. But I had trouble sleeping sometimes and I used the music as bg noise so I could sleep. My mom thought this kept me up at night, so she made me throw it away. I was crying and sobbing and trying so hard to keep it, but she grabbed it from me and crushed it under her foot. I was heartbroken. And the worst thing? I had even more problems sleeping than before. She then blamed the journals I kept under my bed. Sure I stayed up until 11pm writing a journal entry/story/song idea/rant, but isn’t that better than me staying up with my 3DS or phone watching youtube? She threw out countless journals, diary entries which I really treasured and now miss horribly. I think she’s realised and doesn’t do it anymore, but she threatens to and I utterly hate her for it. Now for the my rules bit. Yes. This is your house. You paid your good, hard-earned money for it. Okay cool, understood. I will not trash the house. However, I will not become the perfect child BECAUSE you put a roof on my head. It doesn’t work like that. I wish parents would understand this concept. 6. We have opinions we feel strongly about. If we are passionate about it, do not call us “obsessed”. You may not get it, but that thing/person/whatever is important to us. We want you to understand. So I love the kpop band BTS. wow I’m such a stereotypical teen. I’m not gonna go on why I like them because i’ll be saying the same thing as everyone else, so I’ll just say what I want the parents to understand. I love BTS with a passion, they made me feel good with their music. They are idols I look up to. My mother teased me about them, told them they looked girly, told me their music sucks, asked me “why are they saying n**** so much? This is such bad music!” (It was actually the word naega, which in korean, means I. Nothing derogatory). I got mad at her ONCE and snapped at her, which made her angry and ask if they would get me out of jail or if I would beat everyone who decided to diss BTS. Now let me get something straight. If you KNOW someone likes something, you NORMALLY do not diss the thing they like IN FRONT OF THEIR FACE. You can say criticism or your opinions, but do not blatantly judge them in front of us when you haven’t even delved into it yourself. I talked to my mother about it and now she understands, she even likes some music, but some parents really hurt their kids by dismissing their idols, passions or things they love. They are trying to connect with you and share with you, don’t push them away. 7. Just because “you’re not as bad as grandma” doesn’t mean you’re not bad. So you had it worst than me. So you had it worst and did even better. Ooookay… But I’m not you. You realise that right? My grandmother wasn’t a nice person, period. She beat my mother for no reason, made her study under annoying conditions (watching tv while she worked, making noise, etc) and was just horrible. My mother is definitely MUCH better than she was, but she still has a long way to go in being a good parent. Not saying I know what to do as a parent, heavens no, but I do feel like there are things she needs to realise that works, and things that doesn’t work. I also constantly hate it when they compare their older life to yours. “back in my day” excuse me but it’s not 1980s. I am not in the age where digital things were not invented yet. We are a generation that is trying to make life easier by using technology. Also, things that were not proper in your day, is now accepted today. Homosexuals are now proudly flaunting themselves, girls and boys are having playdates, gosh just LIVE IN THE PRESENT. I’ll add more when I can think of them, but I would like to say something at the end here. I did not write this to talk bad of my parents. I love my parents dearly. I was actually supposed to be aborted, but my mother saved me (whether of her own choice or my grandparent’s I’m not sure, but I’m grateful anyway). My step-dad gave me a wonderful life and education and I really am in debt. But they struggle to realise that sometimes what they try to instil in me by taking away things, degrading me, etc, doesn’t work. They were brought up in the asian culture, and I understand, but if you want your child to be better, wouldn’t you learn from your parents’ mistakes?"},{"instruction":"As a police officer, have you ever responded to a call and once you got there said to yourself, “Nope, not worth it” and just left?","output":"Almost every cop does that every day.

Who's fault, selector, captain, or coach?","output":"In a T20 innings, there are 3 sessions to be precise. Overs 1 to 6 - Powerplay Overs 7 to 15 - Middle Phase Over 16 to 20 - Final Phase For a team to put up a competitive total, they need to win a majority of the sessions while batting and bowling. Throughout the tournament, our opening batters have done a miserable job. Our opening bowlers have been effective, Arshdeep especially. Our middle order batting looked rock solid except the game against South Africa. Our bowlers took a lot of beating in the middle overs. Our batting finishers were below average. Since Virat and Surya ran the show for the major part of the tournament we didn't really feel the need for our finishers. When it came to bowling we were not at all effective in the final phase of our matches. With so many loopholes you can't win a World Cup. One needs to take accountability for the position they are in. Every time it can't be Hardik or Kohli. Look at Pakistan. For them, bowling is their strength. They haven't allowed any teams to score more than 158 in their matches. In fact, most opponents barring NZ and India have only managed to score around 135 in 20 overs. If we take pride in saying that batting is our strength it should reflect that way. Our achievement has been registering a total of 175 plus against associate teams. If we are such a batting-heavy unit, why haven't we posted totals over 200? We are paper tigers. Rohit Sharma is a gifted player. He can time the ball better than Virat and many others. Honestly, he doesn't need to try too hard. But his execution and fitness levels are worse than a teenager. We are no longer in the era of 90s where Ranatungas and Inzamams were given an extended run with their pot bellies. This guy doesn't deserve to be on the team, not for his caliber but for his low fitness levels. There was a time when his hook shots used to be a treat to watch. Look at yesterday’s match. He was not even able to keep his balance after hitting two back-to-back boundaries. On the other side, look at Hardik Pandya. I'm amazed to see the level of maturity of this guy. His 2.0 version is giving dividends to the team. From an immature guy talking nonsense in Koffee with Karan to a guy batting sensibly and coming good with the ball in every single match. We need players like him. It seems KL Rahul who was his partner in crime in that TV show is yet to transform himself. I don't remember any single event when this scored heavily in a knockout game. Do we really need such dimwitted players? Certainly not. Lastly, as a team, we need to stop doing appeasement of experienced players. Ashwin clearly didn't deserve a place on the team and so was DK. I think it’s a culture of the Indian team to field players who are playing their last World Cup. Another thing: As a unit, we give maximum exposure to some players stating they are in our scheme of things for the World Cup but when the time arrives they are just made to sit on the bench or dropped. Case and point - Ambati Rayadu. He was given a long run before the 2019 World Cup. Later he was not even in the 15-member squad. Chahal or Bishnoi could have been utilized to good effect in this World Cup but they were not even given a game against associate teams. Well, it seems common sense is so uncommon with Team India. Between 2 World Cups, we as a team start and end our campaigns with 10-wicket defeats. That very much tells the sad state of affairs in our team."},{"instruction":"Does ethical obligation go beyond standard ethical conduct?","output":"I would put them on the same level: ethical conduct means fulfilling you ethical obligations."},{"instruction":"What exercise can lose face fat?","output":"Reducing face fat involves a combination of overall weight loss, specific facial exercises, and lifestyle adjustments.

He was, not just in my opinion but in the opinion of many, one of the most remarkable and important writers of the second half of the 20th century, although his career started much earlier. I also think that he would have been profoundly embarrassed to have that said about him. In an important way, and for (I think) interesting reasons, it took him a while to find what you might call his ‘voice’. All of his most famous and most influential work was written after he’d turned 40. I have a slightly idiosyncratic opinion about him, which I’ll get to later. Beckett was born in Dublin, Ireland, into a middle-class Protestant family. The particular area he grew up in, Foxrock, is well-known in Dublin as one of the more middle-class suburbs. This is the street Beckett grew up on (thanks, Google Street View): This is not the countryside. This is one of the wealthiest parts of suburban Dublin. Behind those giant hedges are detached houses. Beckett’s family’s house, Cooldrinagh, is on the right. I am familiar enough with Foxrock to know that, although this photo was taken in 2021 or whatever, this street has looked like this since 1900 or so. He had a warm relationship with his father, who was a mild-mannered quantity surveyor, and a more difficult relationship with his mother. He was a very bright student, and went to Trinity College Dublin, where he studied modern and Romance languages. He was also a very good cricket player, cricket being a sport which is/was, in Ireland, overwhelmingly played by middle-class Protestants. He played first-class cricket against Northamptonshire. Basically, he was all set for a career as maybe a teacher, or university lecturer. But it was not to be. He taught briefly at Campbell College in Belfast, where he was unhappy and made no secret of it. His employer took him aside at one point and remonstrated with him, saying The young men at this school are the cream of society! Yes, Beckett replied, all rich and thick. He left that job soon after. In 1928, aged 22, he got a job teaching English at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, one of the most prestigious educational establishments in France. By this point, he was absolutely fluent in French. He was introduced to James Joyce, who was then working on what would become his last book, Finnegans Wake. Beckett enormously admired Joyce, who shared his appetite for languages and learning (and booze), but who was (lapsed) Catholic where Beckett was an agnostic ex-Protestant, and a family man where Beckett was solitary by nature. They used to sit together having long silences, interrupted by almost impossibly arcane snatches of conversation. Once, after several minutes of nobody saying anything, Joyce said How could the idealist Hume write a history? Beckett replied, A history of representations. Whereupon they fell silent again. (What Joyce meant was something like: how could David Hume, whose metaphysics was based on the idea that reality was a matter of impressions and ideas in human perception, have written his enormous [LINKED_TEXT: The History of England] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_England_(Hume_book)], if he thought that ‘England’ was only a set of mental objects? Beckett, as we can see, had an explanation.) Beckett published some poetry, and what I remember as a very good critical study of Marcel Proust, although I haven’t read it in years. His relations with Joyce cooled down a bit after Joyce’s daughter Lucia fell in love with him and he turned her down. Joyce didn’t like people who upset his family members. In 1932, Beckett wrote his first novel, Dream of Fair to Middling Women, which he decided, I think rightly, wasn’t worth publishing. He converted some of it into his first short story collection, More Pricks Than Kicks, most of which IMO isn’t that great, but which does contain one very good story, ‘Dante and the Lobster’. In the late 30s, he published his first novel Murphy, which some people love. I don’t. If I seem a bit hard on Beckett’s early work, I’ll explain why later. In 1938 he was attacked in the street by a pimp named Prudent, who stabbed him. This aroused the paternal sentiments of James Joyce, who forgave Beckett for turning down Lucia, and got him a private room at a hospital. In the subsequent legal proceedings, Beckett asked Prudent why he’d stabbed him, and Prudent replied Je ne sais pas, Monsieur. Je m'excuse: ‘I don’t know, sir. I’m sorry.’ Beckett was so struck by this non-answer, and found his attacker so generally likeable, that he decided not to press charges. In 1939 there was the small matter of World War Two. Beckett joined the French Resistance, for whom he worked as a courier. He had formed a relationship with a young woman named Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil, and in 1942 their Resistance unit was betrayed to the Gestapo and they fled on foot to the south of France, where Beckett worked with a Maquis unit to sabotage German forces. Suzanne Dechevaux-Dumesnil. Beckett and Suzanne lived in the south of France until the end of the war, whereupon they returned to Paris. In 1945, Beckett went on a trip back to Dublin to see his family. During that trip, he had some sort of major internal experience, in which he suddenly and briefly glimpsed that the artistic direction he’d been shoving himself in for about 15 years was not his true one, and in fact his true direction was quite different. The result of this was that, between 1946 and about 1957, Beckett had, for him, an unprecedented and never-to-be-repeated outburst of creativity. One of the peculiar features about this was that, while it went on, he stopped writing in English, his native language, and started writing in French. Between 1946 and 1957, Beckett wrote the following works, most of which are his greatest masterpieces: ‘L’Expulsé’, 1946, short story, translated in 1967 as ‘The Expelled’‘Le Calmant’, 1946, short story, translated in 1967 as ‘The Calmative’‘La Fin’, 1946, short story, translated in 1967 as ‘The End’, although a partial translation had appeared in 1946Mercier et Camier, 1946, novel, translated in 1974 as Mercier and CamierEn attendant Godot, play, c. 1947–49, first produced 1953, translated 1954 as Waiting for GodotMolloy, novel, 1948, translated 1955Malone meurt, novel, 1948, translated 1956 as Malone DiesL’innomable, novel, 1950, translated 1958 as The Unnamable — this and the two previous novels are generally referred as ‘the Trilogy’Fin de partie, play, 1955–57, translated 1957 as Endgame In terms of the life, that’s pretty much it. Beckett lived on in Paris, writing prose and plays, and he became a very good director of his own plays, which isn’t as easy as it probably sounds, since the plays themselves are extraordinarily hard to put on, because of their brevity, intensity and extreme minimalism. But Beckett somehow intuited how they might work as drama, which is remarkable for someone with so little practical experience in theatre. There were other plays that were well admired, such as Krapp’s Last Tape and Happy Days and Rockaby, and Beckett also had a go at writing his own version of TV drama (Eh Joe) and radio drama (The Old Tune, an adaptation of a play by his friend Robert Pinget.) He wrote one more novel, How It Is, and then the prose got inexorably shorter and shorter and shorter, as if he were finding it harder and harder to write. But, basically, he lived on for four decades, declining interviews, leading a quiet life, conducting the odd discreet affair but being mostly faithful to Suzanne, who he married in 1961 so that she could inherit the rights to his work. In 1969, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature, to his considerable embarrassment. He didn’t show up to collect the award in person, and he didn’t make a speech, which was customary for Nobel laureates in Literature. He gave the £30,000 prize money away, most of it to his old university, Trinity College Dublin. Suzanne Beckett died in July 1989. Samuel Beckett died in December 1989, a time when, if you were me, and you were in any way active in Irish cultural circles, which I was at the time in a very small way, he was by far Ireland’s most eminent living writer. So, who was Samuel Beckett? Well, the following is the result of my own being obliged to think about him and take him on board, seeing as I’ve tried to be an Irish writer, and have sometimes been one, and he was there while I grew to almost-adulthood, as the Dark Eminence—the massively uncommunicative and terrifyingly silent Living Master—of Irish Literature. Which is to say that the following can’t be “objective”, although I have gone back and forth between loving his work, and finding it irrelevant and annoying, before finally arriving at a point where I think I can live with it. I’m sure that other Irish people who write haven’t had the same kind of Beckett obsession that I’ve had, and for good reasons. But I did have one, and now I don’t. Let me explain. Beckett came from considerable privilege. Unlike his hero James Joyce, he had a very comfortable adolescence. His father’s job ensured that the family had a good life. He was also from the same class in Irish society that I come from, on my dad’s side: the Anglo-Irish Protestant middle-class. Beckett’s background was such that his destiny was almost written out for him: exam success, Trinity College Dublin, a comfortable teaching/lecturing position, eminence in that sphere, retirement, death. He defied this. Something in his makeup wouldn’t let him do it. When, in the 1920s, he came under the influence of Joyce, he consciously embraced it, but he failed to fully absorb it. What I mean is that Beckett’s early fiction, from his posthumously published first novel Dream of Fair to Middling Women to the last novel that he first-drafted in English, Watt, suffers from the fact that Beckett was, on the one hand, trying to write about his deeper themes of solitude and loneliness, and on the other hand, he was still so dazzled by Joyce’s techniques of verbal proliferation and virtuosity, that he used them, even though they had nothing to do with the subject matter of his work. The result is that Beckett’s early fiction suffers from, to my ear, a constant grinding noise, which is the result of the dissonance between Beckett’s deeper preoccupations, and the style in which he chooses to write. The really impressive thing about him is that he realised this, sometime during the composition of Watt. And his solution was radical and extraordinary: in order to curb his own tendency to indulge himself in words, he elected to write his books in another language. Writers had done this before. Joseph Conrad, a Pole, had taken up writing fiction in English, having never written anything in Polish. Vladimir Nabokov (who was almost certainly unknown to Beckett in the 40s) had been a successful emigré writer in his native Russian, but took up writing in English so that he could reach more readers. But Nabokov and Conrad switched languages because their native languages were inhibiting them from success; and Nabokov actually became a more exuberant and original writer in English than he’d been in Russian. Beckett took up French as his language so as to force himself to be less extravagant. Writing in French meant that he couldn’t do his clever-ass puns and verbal fireworks. He had to keep it simple. The result is the great work of his mid-career: Godot, the Trilogy, and Endgame, which last title I will always associate with him, and not with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. What makes Beckett’s mature work so special? I think Beckett’s experiences during WW2, in which he and Suzanne were forced to flee Paris on foot, and live in poverty and obscurity, hiding from the authorities, permanently drilled into him something about the nature of the world. Something about what it was like to be not privileged. And he transformed this into something universal, as only great writers can do. He talked about it afterwards only in the most oblique way, saying that whereas Joyce’s work was a heroic effort of expanding outwards, and understanding everything and doing everything, his own work was about weakness and impotence. Once he truly understood this, he built it into the very syntax of his writing. The literary critic Christopher Ricks’ book Beckett’s Dying Words is really good about this. You can see it in the writing of the Trilogy, and of Godot and Endgame: there’s no more pissing about. Beckett is writing directly about a level of human destitution and weakness that his earlier work couldn’t even imagine, but sort of leaned towards anyway. You can see it even more blatantly in later works like Imagination Dead Imagine and Ill Seen Ill Said and Worstward Ho, where the language itself is stripped down to a kind of breathless gasp, a deathbed attempt to say something, a desperate need to both admit the void and to defy it: Enough. Sudden enough. Sudden all far. No move and sudden all far. All least. Three pins. One pinhole. In dimmost dim. Vasts apart. At bounds of boundless void. Whence no farther. Best worse no farther. Nohow less. Nohow worse. Nohow naught. Nohow on. —final lines of Worstward Ho, Beckett’s penultimate major work of fiction The younger Beckett’s work is full of a kind of disgust and horror at the idea of death and decay, but the mature Beckett lets them in, and gives them a cup of tea, and a whisky chaser, and sits down next to them, and is quietly respectful. This, I think, is why Beckett became so beloved and revered. At least, to some people. That said: when I was a young writer in the 90s, Beckett’s universally acknowledged pre-eminence felt like a dead weight. I had more than one encounter, as a young man, with middle-aged/elderly, Irish, arts/culture administrative types, invariably men, who would both rhapsodise about Beckett, and at the same time behave in the most boorish or obnoxious way. Beckett became for them an Official Writer, in a way that I think he would have hated. Maybe it was me being a young punk. Maybe it was them being assholes. Perhaps both. The Gate Theatre in Dublin, from the 80s to the 00s, made a habit of producing his dramatic work in what became a tedious house style: invariably heavy, mournful and mildly sardonic, like a sort of modernist Tennyson. (Long-overdue regime change at the Gate has [LINKED_TEXT: since made things better] [URL: https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/18/endgame-review-frankie-boyle-gate-theatre-dublin].) It didn’t help that the Beckett estate was and is very hostile to any attempt to re-interpret his work, if such re-interpretations didn’t strictly obey his own stipulations as to how it should be done. It started to seem like, if you couldn’t be as bleak about everything as Beckett was, then you weren’t deemed to be a good writer. So I think Beckett’s work now exists in a kind of limbo. There are signs that people want to inject new life into his dramatic work, which I welcome. I suspect that his fiction, which was once as admired as his plays, will not be read as much as it used to be; certainly, James Joyce’s flame seems to go on burning, but whereas Beckett once seemed like a sort of necessary corrective to Joyce, he no longer seems to have that kind of prestige. This is maybe because Beckett’s cosmic pessimism isn’t necessarily something that younger writers want to attend to. I always had a problem with it myself, and on the larger scale of things, Beckett seems to me like a heroic and melancholy farewell to an older tradition, not so much the beginning of a new one. Anyway, that’s my take on Beckett, in September 2022. A wonderful writer whose music I love, even if I don’t want to play it myself.

believe in them. Why? For money, fame (or infamy), perceived political gain. These theories really shouldn't be lumped together since some are more perfidious than others and can be both harmful and hurful to individuals as well as groups of people. The holocaust deniers are notorious in their attempts to explain away the atrocities that happened in the Nazi extermination camps during World War II. David Icke and his followers believe, or pretend to believe, that certain politicians are in fact reptiles masquerading as humans, or at least reptilian hybryds. Among the “suspects” are Donald Trump and Barack Obama. No party favoritism here. Others believe that the world is secretly run by a cabal of Freemasons, Satanists, and Illuminati. Not unsurprisingly most of these puppet masters and conspirators are supposed to be Jewish. Maybe the men and women behind this theory are holocaust deniers as well. In addition there are a few strange beliefs that can't really be called conspiracy theories. The Hollow Earth Theory still has its believers, while others are equally certain that the earth has the shape of a pancake. The Ancient Astronaut theorists believe that man was created by space travellers from another planet. One of these ancient astronauts was Jesus, who may have been the son of a plutonian by the name of Gilgamesh. What the believers in all these wild and fantastic theories have in common is a feeling of superiority, something that sets them apart from the common herd.

His vision mostly came from Steve Jobs. But he’s doing good things now. Is this a good measure of a ‘genius’ programmer? Maybe, maybe not. For a start, the entire Art of Computer Programming is not a complete work. Several volumes are still waiting to be published. So, really no one has read the whole thing. But even getting through Volume I: Fundamental Algorithms is no mean feat. I first attempted Fundamental Algorithms as a student. I can’t remember getting too far. I did read all of Dijkstra’s Discipling of Programming, which at the time was somewhat beyond me, but others just put it down and hated it. I reread this about five years ago, and understood a lot more. I’ve also read Structured Programming by Dahl, Dijkstra, and Hoare. Most computing books I tend not to read cover to cover. I have four book marks in Fundamental Algorithms. The first is at p 92–3, a Dr Who catalogue dated 2015, which I think represents my last attempt at thorough read. The next is a punch card reading “CALL LINETO(55,8,1,0)”, I think a graphics program I did as a student. This is on p 132 in the description of MIX. The next marks Table 1, summary of the operation of MIX instructions. Then a blank punch card at p467. I think I was trying some of the exercises. I never seem to get past MIX. I have seen defences of Knuth's invention of an assembler language for expressing his algorithms. I still don’t understand why he did this, and would say MIX (or updated MMIX) kills off most readers. So his writing is mired in obscurity. My copy of Sorting and Searching seems mostly untouched. I’ve just glanced through it occasionally, putting it aside until after I have got through Fundamentals, which seems the key to interpreting the rest. Of course an algorithm is an implementation of a specification, so perhaps Knuth wanted to express how to compute things, rather than just give the specification. Since I know Knuth wrote one of the first ALGOL compilers as a student intern at Burroughs in three months ([LINKED_TEXT: http://www.ianjoyner.name/Files/Waychoff.pdf] [URL: http://www.ianjoyner.name/Files/Waychoff.pdf]), I don’t know why he didn’t use such an algorithmic language. But he did use the word ‘computer’, not computing or computational. This seems a shame, because really programming should be to express problem solutions, not how they are mapped to any particular ‘computer’. Knuth also suggested the define to Burroughs which was adopted in their version of ALGOL. This was done right with the # terminating the define (although you had to make sure you didn’t miss the #). It was a controversial extension at Burroughs, but C took it and botched it. Knuth also defended the use of goto. This has rather been misunderstood, because what he shows is that one can write structured programs with goto. But this is a subset of all programs and goto can be used to create horrible messes of rat’s nest code. Perhaps when Knuth planned The Art, he envisaged all computing people and programmers would be trained to an excellent standard. But really anyone can enjoy programming, no matter what their level of expertise. Not many will be at the level of being able to read The Art, maybe only top-level researchers."},{"instruction":"What is the most misunderstood picture that has become famous (or infamous)?","output":"How about this one?

This can be actively tracked, sensing the sun, or just mechanical systems that move at the same rate, or can even be manually moved every now and then, although this is better for the vertical, seasonal tracking than the daily horizontal. For a fixed system the angle is decided based on the latitude (or shadow of a stick), but if the array is entirely fixed, you need to consider that in the winter you are getting much less sun anyway, so you may want to have a greater angle (i.e.) point more toward the lower winter sun than the higher summer sun. Personally I would suggest, if you aren’t going fully tracked, that you should consider an adjustable frame with at least two vertical angles to get more from the winter sun whilst not wasting the summer glut.

Many people, over many years, have intimated that every team in the NFL were foolish through 5 rounds of selection for passing him over. But at least one person never criticized any of them. You can easily guess who that is. You are correct if you guessed Tom Brady. Another true story. I once drove over the road for a large carrier and was fired for a fairy flimsy violation. A short time later, I would have a conversation with the local teamster business agent on a matter unrelated to my firing. He would suggest that the issue I had should be easily resolved between myself and the company. I would tell him that I had been fired by the company and there is much tension with the company. He would ask me what I was fired for. I would tell him. He would say “that is a load of crap. If you want, I can have you back on the job within 24 hours”. I would say “ I appreciate the offer but I would not accept reinstatement. They have 1200 operators and central operations know little about any of them.

Seriously, try and cite where Trump told people to go around and cause trouble, you know… like how Democrat politicians and a number of media sites did in 2017 that led to a riot in DC 4 years ago at Trump’s inauguration. The “riot” that just happened had 50 people arrested, in the “protest” 4 years ago there were well over 200 people arrested. And even if you completely discount the difference between them because “Orange man bad!”, compare that “protest” to an actual inaugural protest like the one in 2005 against Bush. No one went around burning cars or the American flag, no one was calling to go after “enablers”… and even then 70 people were arrested.

When used properly, it can be applied on the face overnight to help hydrate and soothe the skin. However, there are a few things to keep in mind to ensure safe and effective use: Use pure aloe vera gel: Make sure you are using pure aloe vera gel and not a product that contains additives or other ingredients that could irritate your skin.Patch test first: Before applying aloe vera gel on your face overnight, it is recommended to do a patch test first to check for any adverse reactions. Apply a small amount of the gel on your inner arm and wait for 24 hours to see if there are any signs of irritation or allergy.Don't apply too much: A little goes a long way with aloe vera gel. Applying too much can cause the gel to not absorb properly and feel sticky on the skin.Use it in combination with a moisturizer: While aloe vera gel can provide hydration to the skin, it is not a substitute for a moisturizer. For best results, apply aloe vera gel on the face first and follow up with a moisturizer to seal in the hydration. Overall, applying aloe vera gel on the face overnight can be safe and beneficial for the skin, but it's always best to patch test and use the product in moderation. If you experience any discomfort or irritation, discontinue use immediately and consult with a healthcare professional."},{"instruction":"w do homosexuals decide who is the alpha; coin toss?","output":"Straight men confuse me.

Whether the top-flight British cheeses are an acquired taste, or just a source of perpetual, instant wonder, I dunno. Much less ambiguous status attaches to Mushy Peas: These are an acquired taste even to some brits, never mind the visitors."},{"instruction":"The Mahabhar","output":"Mahabharata is a complex piece of art. In Mahabharata, the warriors are multifaceted. Their goals keep changing every day. Someday everyone is trying to capture Yudhishtira. While on the other days, they are trying to protect Jayadratha etc. Hence, there is a lot of chaos added in the epic. I will probably rank them in following order. 10. Bheema - Bheema is only on the list who isn’t Maharathi. He is physically most powerful of this list. Bheema did try to stop Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Ashwathama from time to time. Even though he has been defeated many times, he was never killed. It is said that any army which had Arjuna or Bheema will never be defeated. Bheema has been protector of Yudhisthira in the entire war. He has killed many Kaurava sons including Duryodhana and Dushasana. He has stopped Drona from capturing Yudhisthira. 9. Abhimanyu - Abhimanyu is worthy warrior. He battled Bhishma on the very first day and almost stalemated him. He has constantly defeated Duryodhana and rest of the members of Kaurava army save Bhishma, Karna and Drona. When Arjuna is taken away from the army center, Drona had created Chakravyuha which would have surely captured Yudhisthira and ended the war. Abhimanyu broke all 7 layers of the Chakravyuha killing thousands of Rathis and Atirathis. A chakravyuha is very complex battle formation to break. He was finally surrounded by Drona, Karna, Ashwathama, Kripacharya, Duryodhana, Dushasana and Shalya (Dushasana’s son). Getting surrounded by multiple warriors is a routine occurrence during Drona parva. He was killed because he was alone. 8. Bhagadatta - He was repeatedly occurring character during the war. He killed more than 1 Akshauhini Pandava army. He did fight Arjuna multiple times. During their battle, he used Vaishnavastra on Arjuna which Lord Krishna countered. Arjuna didn’t know the counter for it so he was saved by Krishna. He was killed afterwards by Arjuna. 7. Satyaki - This Yadava warrior was student of Krishna and Drona. In the Kaurava army, he is probably the second most feared warrior after Arjuna. He has constantly taken on heavyweights of Kaurava army (Bhishma, Karna, Drona, Ashwathama). 6. Ashwathama - He is son of Drona. During the 18 days of the battle, he killed more than 1 Akshauhini army of Pandavas. He was routinely battling with Arjuna, Satyaki and Bheema (Panadava heavyweights). He is immortal. When Drona is killed unfairly, he becomes very angry and defeats almost all Pandava warriors except Arjuna. He uses Narayanastra and creates havoc in Pandava army. 5. Ghatotkacha (night time) - Ghatotkacha was present since day 1 in the battle. But during the daytime, he was not as feared as the Maharathis. During the night battle, being Asura, he could use all the illusions. He created Havoc on the 14th day during the night battle. Arjuna was battling with Drona. The entire Kaurava army was getting routed by Ghatotkacha. He faced Karna who was more than his match until Ghatotkacha started using his illusions. He killed Karna’s horses and Sarathi. Karna started becoming helpless and had to use Vasavi Shakti to kill him. Vasavi Shakti is once only usable Astra so Ghatotkacha did big favor to Arjuna by attacking Karna. 4. Drona - Now we are in unreal realm. All these warriors are almost unbeatable. It used to be said that Drona is unbeatable if he had even 1 weapon with him. He was very experienced Army General who used his army strategically. He has fought with Maharathis like Arjuna, Satyaki, Virata and other warriors like Bheema every day. He routinely defeated Dhrishtadyumna who had to run away every time. Although, he is ranked below the other three for two reasons. First is under him, all the rules of battle were broken. Multiple warriors started fighting a single warrior. The battles started going into the night. Astras like Brahmastra become frequently used in the battle. All these escalations finally lead to the killing of Abhimanyu under his leadership. Second reason is he was unable to capture Yudhisthira even in the absence of Arjuna. And when Arjuna was trying to kill Jayadratha, Drona didn’t follow him saying Arjuna’s speed is too much for his old body. 3. Karna - He was most feared warrior from Kaurava army simply because he had vowed to kill Arjuna. Bhishma was unbeatable but he fought softly vs Pandavas. His results on the battlefield are mixture of good and bad results. He wasn’t allowed to enter the war until 11th day. From the day he had entered, he routinely fought vs Satyaki, Bheema, and Arjuna. He used to take on many warriors together, at one time taking on all the above mentioned Pandava warriors single handedly. He had stalemated Arjuna on some occasions while Arjuna was more focused on Drona or Jayadratha other times. He defeated Bhima, and other Pandavas but let them go. On 14th day during battle vs Ghatotkacha, he was really into his element. He was countering many illusions created by Ghatotkacha and holding his own while entire Kaurava army was routed. He killed Ghatotkacha in the end. He also entered day 17 with Vijaya bow for the first time. That day the battle became so fierce that even Arjuna fainted for a brief moment. Ultimately Karna was killed when he was trying to remove wheel of his chariot from the ground. He had participated in Duryodhana’s plans and had sinned which resulted in him getting multiple curses. Despite those curses, he held his own during Kurukshetra war vs Arjuna. 2. Bhishma - He was the grandfather of Pandavas and Kauravas. Being the eldest Kuru, he fought softly vs Pandavas. He routinely defeated great warriors like Satyaki, Abhimanyu, Bheema and all. He was invincible in the battle. Under him, the Kurukshetra war casualties reached 100 million. He was never beaten in the whole 10 days and always protected his army. He might be great warrior but his indecisiveness was the reason Kauravas could neither win nor lose the battle. His fame came when on day 3, Lord Krishna broke his vow to attack him. 1, Arjuna - what else can be said about this warrior? He is the best among the best. He is equal to Karna in fierceness. He is equal to Bhishma in invincibility. He is equal to Drona in war strategies. He is one man army. He single handedly routed Pandava army on multiple occasions. Where Arjuna’s chariot went, destruction followed. He was feared like lord Mahadeva himself. Arjuna battled vs all heavyweights of Kauravas including Bhishma, Drona, Karna, Ashwathama, Bhagadatta, and others. He killed Jayadratha in a single day of epicness, running from one end of the Kaurava army to other end battling vs all the warriors and ultimately killing Jayadratha. An entire army of Kauravas was not able to save Jayadratha when Arjuna was angry. Ashwathama and other Maharathis ran and hid from the fear of Arjuna. He was probably the most compassionate warrior from this list. He didn’t want to kill Drona because he was the teacher. He didn’t want to hurt Ashwathama because he was son of Drona. He didn’t want to wound Bhishma because he was the grandfather. Krishna had to encourage him to fight vs his family members. The kauravas had very good number of maharathis but one by one they started dying. When Bhishma was wounded, they still had Karna entering the battle. When Drona was killed, all hopes were on Karna. But after the death of Karna, they were morally defeated.While Pandavas had lost Abhimanyu, Ghatotkacha, Panchala and Virata kings. But they always had Arjuna. Arjuna is bigger than an entire army so Pandavas were never in doubt about who will win.

Is it primarily to learn or to acquire credentials for a future job?","output":"It depends on many, many things. It also depends on the University, even the country you are talking about. Studied in Europe (Greece, UK), Civil Engineering w/ specialisation in Transportation Egineering and did my MSc in Computer Science. First part the 5 year Engineering course. Had a lot of fun, drank as much as I could drink, been with as many girls as I could and did discover myself. Not because of the university but because I had free time and (almost) unlimited funding from my parents (Universities are free in Greece and I managed to get accepted to my home town’s University) I also learned to learn. Not just to memorise, not just to apply pre-defined solutions to existing problems. I learned how to look for solutions and think out of the box. How to turn the circle into a square (every engineer KNOWS that). For my MSc I moved to Manchester to go to UMIST (now University of Manchester). I had been programming since my early teens (that’s the 80s mind you) so I just did a course on computing to get the right credentials because I always knew that I was never going to build a house but I was going to be involved with computers/technology. Even though the course was quite hard for many of my classmates I found out that my basic high-school education was far more theoritically advanced than other countries so I had an advantage. I already knew programming, another advantage. So more fun time for me. Living abroad does tech you things about differnt people and different attitudes. But besides character traits and credentials I got something else. Something that I didn’t grasp at the time: I learned structured thought and got an academic background/foundation in computer science. Programming is programming right? No, it’s not. At least it wasn’t so in the old days before the advent of Internet and of information at your fingertips. When I came back I went over some previous programming work I did and didn’t believe what I was reading. “Did I write this piece of garbage? No way!”. But I had only just a year or two ago! I immediately discovered that even on a course than I found easy and completed just for the credentials, I did learn something that I wouldn’t have learned otherwise. So is it all worth it, now in the information age? Is it worth it if you have to get into 6 digit debt? I can’t answer that. It was worth it for me.

Since my daughter loves performing on stage, but has a less-than-wonderful report card (5th Grade), I’ve been thinking a lot about this lately. Kids who are drawn to theatre have unusually high levels of empathy, which is why you don’t find a lot of bullies in school shows. They work extremely hard. If they apply one tenth of the energy they employ to getting their performances just right, they’ll do very well in other classes. Doing theatre teaches a lot of things: Teamwork. In most businesses, employees are part of a huge ant farm of operations, working together to create profits for the company. They rely on each other, communicate with each other, and there’s usually some hierarchy, or, at the very least, different team members with different duties. In a school play, which is never thought of as a practical course in how businesses operate, everyone relies on others, respects complex hierarchies, performs different proscribed functions, and takes pride in the ultimate team accomplishment. Interpretation. A play is dramatic literature. Every actor needs to understand the lines, and what’s being said to them (if the character understands). There are subtle nuances, and, often, allusions. In life, we often have to read with a level of comprehension that goes beyond the surface. This might be a contract, instructions, rules or e-mails. There’s going to be more to these documents than you can get from a glance. You have to read deeper, and do the sort of investigation of text that every actor must do. History and sociology. Ask me what it was like for a black family to be moving in to a previously all-white neighborhood in 1959. Would I know anything about that? That’s before I was born and I’m white. And yet I read A Raisin in the Sun, studied it in school. As a result, I know a little bit about the subject, things I wouldn’t know if I hadn’t studied theatre as a teen. And that’s just one example. You learn much about the world, how different people feel, various things that have happened in the past, by participating in as many plays as you can. Speaking. It’s a lot of people’s worst fear when they’re called upon to make a presentation in front of a crowd of some size. But this happens a lot in business, academia and the law. For those with no experience doing theatre, it’s hard. You have to seem natural, enunciate, use your voice, and body language is an essential ingredient. Now I’m just remembering the time my wife had to address the city council to urge them to install a speed bump on the street where a child had been hit by a car. What profession she’s in didn’t matter. Convincing the council did, and she drew on her theatre training. Improvisation. Not every theatre program utilizes improvisation. Just the good ones. Learn the simple steps to thinking on your feet and you’ll have a skill that’s very valuable in all sorts of professions. It’s essential to get out of your head and to be a good communicator. Improv, when you watch it, looks very difficult. The experience of becoming a good improvisor involves discovering it’s not hard at all. In so many life situations - like being pulled over by a traffic cop - your improv background will serve you well. Creative thinking. Brains work differently when you’re working on plays and this outside-the-box cogitation is good exercise. Imagine a nerd, diligently coding all day. When it’s time to do something else, he’ll find is mind is less adaptable to other situations, as if stuck in coding mode. What one needs for life is a flexible brain, and the “break” one gets from stage time is likely to help in all subjects."},{"instruction":"What is the string theory about?","output":"That's what Wikipedia is for... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory"},{"instruction":"What should I eat before lifting weights?","output":"Depending on some of the issues with your own health history you may not need to eat anything.

It's just crumpled pani puri puris with a few finely chopped vegetables, sev, and corn flakes served in a hot gravy. It may not seem appetising, but believe me when I say it is. (4) Dabeli- Gujarat and Maharashtra are well-known for it. It may resemble Vada Paw in appearance, but it tastes nothing like it. It's the ideal balance of sweet, sour, and spicy flavours. **5. Kanji Vada** - \\"Kanji Vada\\" means \\"Kanji Vada\\" It's also a less well-known type of street cuisine. It's a vada cooked with moong dal that's drenched in a spicy watery sauce. It hails from Rajasthan and is utterly delectable. **6. Chilla**-It resembles a Dosa cousin but is composed of besan rather than rice. It's lightly fried and served with two chutneys (pudina chutney and tomato chilli chutney ). It's delicious when served with the chutneys. **7.

The Oldsmobile F-88, designed in 1952 and 1953, was one of those dream cars that wasn’t destroyed and is today considered one of the greatest expressions of automotive design to ever come from North America. Only two were manufactured, with one of those now on display at the Gateway Auto Museum. Purchased for 3.24 million, the two-seat roadster with a fiberglass body is the collection’s crown jewel and possibly the world’s rarest automobile. BMC Mini Proof that necessity is the mother of invention, the Mini was created by the British Motor Company in a period of drastic gas rationing in Great Britain in the late ’50s and early ’60s. Despite being just 10 feet long to achieve better gas mileage, the earliest Mini comfortably sat four people thanks to an engine that was mounted transversely, instead of front to back, allowing for more interior room. Since then, the Mini has been the inspiration behind later generations of small and smart cars. Ford Mustang In the first six months of production in 1964, the Mustang was the fastest-selling car in history. It has since become an icon of style and performance among American automobiles, escorting in the “pony car” class of affordable sporty coupes with long hoods and short rear decks. Competitors raced to release their own versions, such as the Chevy Camaro, the Pontiac Firebird, and the Dodge Challenger. In 1964 alone, the Mustang was the pace car for the Indianapolis 500 and won both first and second in class at the Tour de France international rally. The museum is home to a 1967 Mustang Shelby GT 500 Fastback, designed by the legendary car constructor and race car driver Carroll Shelby."},{"instruction":"w can you stop a car if someone cuts the brakes?","output":"The easy answer to this question is first DO NOT panic. That is easy to say but harder to do. However you have to to remain in control. Everything depends on you distance to another obstacle car, bridge, wall. If you find yourself in this position the first thing to do is apply the parking brake (emergency brake). If it is foot activated slowly and steadily apply pressure until the car stops or the pedal is on the floor. If it is hand operated again slowly pull up on the handle. This is a separate mechanical system and does not require fluid pressure to work. DO NOT stomp or yank on the “E” brake at high speed it will cause the rear wheels tp lock up and that can cause all types of reactions. If after doing this and the car is still moving (hopefully much slower) turn the ignition off and steer clear. The second attempt you can make is to down shift the transmission. It doesn’t matter if it is automatic or stick shift. Reach over and select each gear range at a time. Once you have selected the final gear range then slowly apply the emergency brake until you have stopped. Lastly one that everyone forgets about is simply turning off the ignition. Again automatic or stick shift if you shut the engine off the car will slow dramatically on its own. The major disadvantage is you will loose power assist to the steering but you will still be able to steer with muscle power. Pumping the brake pedal once you have lost fluid will do nothing. It will not allow air pressure to stop you it will not cause any further loose of braking. I sincerely hope you never find yourself in this situation, but maybe something I have explained will help."},{"instruction":"What is issuing authority in a passport? What should I write in it?","output":"When you apply for the visa this question is common regarding providing details about your passport issuing authority and place. To find the issuing authority open your passport and very first page or inner side of the passport cover you will find the Seal of Government of your country and beside that seal you can see a stamp of signature and a stamp of the officer name, who is issuing you the passport with his designation as Passport Officer and the city/taluka of Passport office. So, in simple words the passport issuing authority is that Passport Officer. In my passport, the name of passport officer is T.D. Sharma from Regional Passport Office, Thane, and the passport issued in Thane, Maharashtra, India, which is written in the stamp. 2.

I would be ‘that uncle’ who nobody talks about and doesn’t get invited around any more (and that’s apart from the Crossdresser thing). Education.. Unless the 14 yo has a definite career goal then a lot of conventional education is ticking boxes. You must be literate and numerate, develop a good handwriting style, a skill I sadly do not possess. Improve your vocabulary, your speech, have elocution lessons if necessary, conversation is enjoyable when you can do so at any level. You will be invited more often to parties if you are a good conversationalist, a witty raconteur, have a wide breadth of knowledge. Having the ability and the confidence to speak intelligently with anyone will open more doors than an A in pottery, unless of course you want to pursue pottery as a passion. Don’t look for a job, look for a passion. Embrace the arts… you can draw, paint, appreciate a painting or sculpture every day. Learn to play a musical instrument, if you can’t cope with the theory then plonk or strum away, recognisable sounds eventually materialise. Being able to hammer out a song will get you laid, reciting Pi to two hundred places … unlikely. In 45 years, apart from one year doing statistics at university, I have never used a quadratic equation. Having said that an understanding of algebra is good for developing the mind just like Latin or Ancient Greek. Literature should play a huge part of your life especially the classics; Greek and a Roman mythology, chuck in a bit of Egyptian and bits from other cultures, a bit of philosophy… all makes for endless entertaining, fascinating conversations. Explore the world but do not forget your homeland. Sex. I always wanted two daughters (never happened) part of me would want that they didn’t have a boyfriend until they got married but for their sakes I would hope that they had a very full, active and adventurous sex life. I would counsel them to do their ‘wild’ stuff outside their circle of friends, having a threesome with two boys, two girls, a boy and a girl is best done with strangers not with friends and should be kept private and revealed to nobody. Keep it safe!!! Marriage. I loved being married but I would advise my daughters don’t, for many women having a husband is just like having a grown up child. For many men it’s ‘what the hell have I done wrong now?’ I honestly believe that if you get married or have a committed partnership then don’t live in the same house, most people will drive each other mad! Have your own places, stay overnight and at weekends on a whim at each other’s but the sheer bliss of closing that door and being in your own space… Don’t have children unless you can afford the time and the money to give them a good, safe, healthy and character developing environment. Too many have children and are then dependent on benefits to raise their children and lack the skills to do so in a nurturing and developing way. I know I’m a horrible person, what is the point of having children when they are going to be raised in an environment where they are at heightened risk from, crime, drugs, poverty and limited prospects only for themselves to have children in the same circumstances. Health and fitness. Do not squander this! Be active, keep active, seek challenges. It is wrong that at my age I am fitter than most people who are half my age. Running, cycling, swimming, group classes like Zumba etc is great for fitness, floods you with endorphins and a fantastic aid to mental health. Money/possessions. Don’t be obsessed by it. When you sit back and think about it we waste so much; money and possessions cause so much unhappiness. You get something.. yayy… it becomes outdated or breaks … sigh… so you buy the new model … yayy… etc. Don’t become a consumer become an individual. Let the others be consumers, just like the Matrix they will be content. By developing as an individual you don’t need all the crap that we are told we need to be happy and measure our success by. You don’t need 200 TV channels when you can play an instrument, have a collection of books you can read and reread, have a good circle of friends you can have good conversations with. Our life cycle is truly bonkers; we obsess about studying to get a job that saps our energy and life away over time to leave an empty husk of a person so that when we retire we don’t know what to do with our remaining time. When you get that final handshake and walk out of the office for the last time on the Friday your replacement is getting excited at the prospect of starting their new job on Monday. We were not meant to live just so we can work to pay bills then die. We start off in a bed sit, get a two bed apartment or house, get a three or four bed house then work all the hours god sends to pay for it and the 2.4 children, put them through school and university, they go off start their cycle so move down from a four bed house to a two then to a two bed apartment then a bed sit, sorry luxury retirement suite, then die.

If you’re wondering how to learn english faster and more completely, look no further! Here are 9 expert tips that will help you find the best way to learn English 1. Look for patterns. This is the most important tip for English learners. Language can’t be defined neatly into rules, and rules are often bent or broken. So the best thing to do is to look for patterns and spot things that are generally true for English. Looking for patterns will help you pick up details like “verbs in the past usually have -ed at the end”. Also, you’ll notice sets of words that we often use together. For example: “We’d love to hear from you.”“We’d love to have you over.”“We’d love to see you.”“We’d love to come visit.” These patterns will save you time and effort when speaking English and will help you use language in a more natural way later.

In my opinion, the innovator is always the best. Judas Priest were the innovators in that style and Iron Maiden ripped off the look with the leather and studs that Judas Priest created as the heavy metal look. Judas Priest were the first heavy metal band to have two guitarists who played harmonized leads. Iron Maiden copied that. Judas Priest was the first heavy metal band to have a singer who had a vocal range capable of hitting the high notes Rob Halford is famous for. Judas Priest had such a distinctive sound partly because there was nobody in heavy metal or any other style of rock that used those types of high screams in their vocals. Iron Maiden only had moderate success with Paul Dianno who had a limited range, so they hired Bruce Dickinson who was very influenced by Rob Halford and also did high screams. After hiring Dickinson, Iron Maiden opened for Judas Priest on the Screaming For Vengeance tour and finally got large scale exposure performing in front of sold out arenas every night. Then Iron Maiden started to have major success too. Without Judas Priest there would be no Iron Maiden as you know it."},{"instruction":"f you and your wife were laying in bed and you both hear a noise downstairs at 3 AM, do you believe that it is your duty as a man to investigate the noise and put yourself at potential risk to protect you and your wife?

A lot of the subject matter didnt really benefit anyone and government corruption cant exist, school was a complete waste of time we all lived in commercial properties and a digital technology world in the 1980s and 1990s besides everyone liking to go outside and do things in parks or outdoor stuff. They just forced us to go to school so they could force us to be around other people or have them around us and could try and steal our money (I guess). They even made the day really long where we had to eat lunch there and still gave us homework (it was an outrage). Sonetimes they made us stupider by teaching false information or forcing us to repeat subjects we passed with average or high academic levels. They just liked pissing us all off and stressing us out so that we all used drugs or something and flooded everything with capitalism of cheap drugs and junk food and then they will all sell them for more money and not get in trouble or they will force or spread communism on us all. It was weird that anything microsoft was in a school because apple always did this school or office work thing but microsoft was more professional and there was many different independent business people or computer owners. And the USA did not exist or was known of by anyone during that time. Nerds loved it and they all focused on getting the elections and stuff going but junk food and urban areas still had to exist in it and of course communism or them getting free stuff and learning or knowing nothing but government stuff and corruption. It was pointless to read books or information and memorize it without having a photographic memory. Even over twenty years ago we were saving information on cobalt or silicon nitrate and swallowing it and the information would be stored in our brains like in a computer. The school system just became about experiments, sharing new or unknown information, writing, the arts, and music. Socializing with people or doing other activities wasnt that bad. Countries of people have to interact with each other or know each other at least a little bit. Some people were very independent and did not talk to others and school would help them come out of their shells and sometimes going to school prevented accidents or crime from going on. Or they like spreading communism there and bringing immigrants in to spread it. It was an outrage to be mad at students for talking or having fun or using cell phones or listening to music if bored. Atleast they attended the school. It became where it was a set up to hook everyone on drugs, get kidnapped, or have sex with the children. Some people also lived far away from towns and cities or lived in areas that were less densely populated so they didnt talk to many people in their daily lives and would possibly become shy or antisocial. The school system was also to educate people in laws and how the united states federal government operates or functions. It was also to somewhat train people to be in prison or in the military (army, navy, marines, Air Force, CIA etc.). It almost just became about the court and prison system and laws since no one wanted to learn or it was unnecessary because of technological advancements. It is important to have a good thinking brain. So we dont get why factory workers and other employees dropped out of school or refused to go or why they thought everything was just working or bills in the united states of America. Urban areas and suburban areas were practically illegal in the united states and we dont know why the city governments started doing this federal law thing."},{"instruction":"When Brazil released the R10 polymer banknotes in 2000, they were a huge failure because they tore apart very easily.

Polymer banknotes were an Australian invention/technology, and we were the first country in the world to use them. Brazil did not licence the technology from Australia; they obviously didn’t do it right. I don’t know why some (many) countries still haven’t switched to polymer banknotes.

It is important to note that some people may experience skin irritation or allergic reactions to aloe vera. If you notice any redness, swelling, itching, or other signs of an allergic reaction, stop using aloe vera and consult a healthcare professional. Also, be sure to use pure aloe vera gel, free from added fragrances, preservatives, or other additives, as these can irritate the skin. If you have sensitive skin, it is always best to consult a dermatologist or healthcare professional before using any new skincare products, including aloe vera gel.

[LINKED_TEXT: Basic assumptions of science - Understanding ScienceHome → Basic assumptions of science Science operates on the assumptions that natural causes explain natural phenomena, that evidence from the natural world can inform us about those causes, and that these causes are consistent. Basic assumptions of science The process of ​​ science builds reliable knowledge about the ​​ natural world . To see ​​ evidence of this reliability, one can look around at the everyday products of scientific knowledge: from airplanes to antibiotics, from batteries to bridges. These ​​ technologies only work because science does. The process of building scientific knowledge relies on a few basic ​​ assumptions that are worth acknowledging. Science operates on the assumptions that: There are natural causes for things that happen in the world around us. For example, if a ball falls to the ground, science assumes that there must be a ​​ natural explanation for why the ball moves downward once released. Right now, scientists can describe gravity in great detail, but exactly what gravity is remains elusive. Still, science assumes that there is an explanation for gravity that relies on natural causes, just as there is for everything in nature. Evidence from the natural world can be used to learn about those causes. Science assumes that we can learn about gravity and why a ball falls by studying evidence from the natural world. Scientists can perform ​​ experiments with other falling objects, ​​ observe how gravity affects the orbits of the planets, etc. Evidence from a wide range of experiments and observations helps scientists understand more about the natural causes of gravity. There is consistency in the causes that operate in the natural world. In other words, the same causes come into play in related situations and these causes are ​​ predictable . For example, science assumes that the gravitational forces at work on a falling ball are related to those at work on other falling objects. It is further assumed that the workings of gravity don’t change from moment to moment and object to object in unpredictable ways. Hence, what we learn about gravity today by studying falling balls can also be used to understand, for example, modern satellite orbits, the formation of the moon in the distant past, and the movements of the planets and stars in the future, because the same natural cause is at work regardless of when and where things happen. These assumptions are important and are not controversial in science today. In fact, they form much of the basis for how we interact with the world and each other everyday.

It transforms your inner dream world into a living alternate reality - where everything you see, hear, feel, taste and even smell is as authentic as real life. Lucidity occurs during altered states of consciousness when you realize you are dreaming - and your brain switches into waking mode inside the dream. In normal dreams, your self awareness is shut down. That's why they often feel fuzzy and distant. But when lucid, the conscious brain wakes up during sleep. While astral Projection is the phenomenon where one’s out of body experience is interpreted. It is believed that our soul is capable of leaving our physical body and entering the astral body to travel in a plane called Astral Plane.

You must never reveal what I am about to tell you except to a fellow homo sapiens. Think of it as a fraction. The top number in a time signature shows you how many counts in a measure; the bottom number shows you what note value gets counted. In 4/4 time the quarter-note gets one beat. Same for 2/4, 3/4, 5/4, 6/4, etc. A 2/2 time signature, also known as “cut time”, counts half-notes; also in 3/2 time. There is no practical way of showing a three-way division of one count, but groupings of eighth notes are used, giving us 3/8, 6/8, 9/8, 12/8, all of them indicating how many eighth notes are counted in groups of three. This is also the way odd rhythms are notated, such as 5/8, 7/8, 11/8, 13/8, etc. These meters have beats of unequal length, some of two eighth notes, some of three. If you run into music with a 1, a 16, or a 32 in the bottom of the time signature, run away! Some composer is just trying to show off at the musician’s expense.

So, how do we deal with people just using sick days and filling up waiting rooms? We don’t, really. You see, when you don’t have to worry about hospital bills, you might go more often and get help early, like getting antibiotics before you get seriously ill. Get allergy medicine before the season starts. Get your flue shots before the flue season. You just go to school or work or where ever you are needed instead of waiting in hospitals near sick people. It is really the last place a healthy person wants to be in. Simple, we don’t. People who are hypochondriacs get marked as such and they do get the help they actually need, mental help.

Mice and rats were a problem on ships because they would eat the sailors' food stores and damage the ship's rigging and other equipment.

I guess a 1:6 teacher to student ratio is pretty good, but are the teachers better at teaching or is it just something that the affluent can brag about?” Perhaps the biggest advantage is disruptive students.

You get inf so: let inf = Double.greatestFiniteMagnitude Which is [math]1.7976931348623157E+308[/math] Which is big enough for my purpose here. The gist being: ‘don't ever give up’. It seems like a platitude, but it's very profound in that it sinks more in my brain (at least), as when I look back and realize how giving up never helped me at all, while not giving up always produced favorable results. The other key element is trying different solutions when one doesn't work. The final being, there will always be problems. Accept it, fight onwards, keep moving. Like the for loop I defined above. Appendix A (for programming newbies/enthusiasts) The above one-liner is actually a for loop. Suppose you have an array of ingredients for some special dish. (Line 34). On 36, we initiate a function that takes two arguments: how many arrays to produce and of what length, such, that each array presents no duplicate elements, and randomly selects from ingred.

Now, the same function can be also written more concisely: The figuring out of the one-liner is left as an intellectual exercise to the gentle reader.

I have used the touchscreen on the Dell maybe 1% of the time. First of all my finger tip is not small enough nor is my hand movement as instinctive and precise as moving a cursor. Interestingly I use my iPad Pro so much that I do occasionally reach up and touch my MacBook Pro screen to select something. I grin and go back to the track pad. My thoughts about the question is that since the MacBook pro has not been built this way since inception it would take a substantial re-engineering of the hardware and OS to add a layer that is checking to see if I have touched the track pad, moved the arrow keys or touched the screen. Apple seems to satisfy most of their customers with the computers as they are. The reason I like Macs soooo much better than my Windows computer is that EVERY version of windows screws with many of the key elements necessary to use the computer. Nothing in this version is where it was in the last version and so forth. MS reached peak performance and optimum user interface design with Windows XP. That is why there are still tens of millions of Win XP computers all over the world - even years after MS quit supporting it. My Mac still works very much like it did 10 or 15 years ago. So I have to spend very little time figuring things out every version. Each version adds things but does not screw up many of the previous items.

So, part of that small transition phase between the late Gen Xers and Millennials, born between ‘82–’87. It’s gonna be different for everyone for many reasons, but this is just something unique from my own POV. I feel like my generation we’re always constantly seeking approval, even though it may not be warranted or necessary. At same time, we want to do our own thing yet fit it into boxes for approval. Kinda emotional with that extended adolescenthood mindset like the millennials but it didn’t quite marked our identity per se (or depends how you grew up). But not as free spirited and definitely not as shrewd as Gen Xers. From an American POV, I think the Xennials are the last ones who will remember how a slice of life was like before all the significant changes the 21st century as brought so far. We just became adults or were still teens when the War on terror started. Started entering society, trying to get establish or at the end of the schooling when the Great recession started. Many became or were already are parents with young children, got businesses or did other mid life transitions when all the major events happened the last 5 years. Growing up, I don’t think many of us really understood the world, with the Middle East tensions or Rise of China or the rocky situations from where Latin American migrants come from. Depending where you live or what you were taught, the exposure was limited. This marked a difference with the real Millennials and Gen Z(oomers) who were not only exposed but took those facts as something natural. We still remember life before social media and the paranoia when flying or just going to school (again depends where you live, some places was always bad). Race situations wise…I know many will get offended, but I think the Xennials will be the last ones who would know how life was like when there is an unspoken racial hierarchy or how openly derogatory (though viewed as normal) we were when it came to non-white, non American people. Again, this really depends where you live and how you grew up, because different parts of America had different demographics. Gender wise, there’s still some in my generation, and a few Millennials, who hold misogynist views or traditional gender roles. We also remember how dangerous it was to come out or express different sexual identities. It was still dangerous after us, but it’s just we weren’t as brave during our youth as later generations were. There’s more to say, but overall: I think we the Xennials are unhappy (or maybe happy) at how the transitional the major milestones of our lives were.

It is easy to ban Hong Kong independence organizations, and it will take time to completely solve the Hong Kong problem. Objectively speaking, young people are currently the main force of \\"Hong Kong independence\\", which may be due to their lack of economic \\"sense of accomplishment\\". Hong Kong does have some economic problems. Some young people cannot share the dividends of china development. It is easy to attribute some social conflicts or personal setbacks to China Mainland, which gives the social soil for \\"Hong Kong independence\\" to breed. \\"One country, two systems, unchanged for 50 years\\" is the fundamental reason for the status quo in Hong Kong. The continuation of the colonial era policy actually led to the continued control of the Hong Kong government's policies by capitalists and professional bureaucrats. The essence of the Hong Kong problem is that Hong Kong capitalists squeeze the people at the bottom and backhand lead public opinion to criticize the china mainland.

The sikhs were not a major force in those days, and had not won any battle till those days, except the earlier battles fought by Banda Vairagi. But that battles fought by Banda Vairagi, in his initial days, when he fought against the Nawab of Sirhind were an exception, since that had the tacit support of the Mughal king of the day, Bahadur Shah-I, who was himself unable to punish the Nawab, but felt indebted to the 10th Guru, for the help given in the war for the throne. After Bahadur Shah -I left the scene, the winning spree of Banda Vairagi was halted, and the phase of defeat started. Sikhs were fighting for a political cause, disguising it as a religious cause. They were in conflict with the mughals and Afghans only because they wanted political dominance, otherwise there was no problem from the Mughals and Afghans till they kept confined to their religious agenda. Sikhs were on the side of the Marathas, when the latter came to Punjab, and went upto Attock. Both of their armies were combined force, and they defeated the Afghans, forcing them to flee. Afghans soldiers were captured, and made to clean the pond of the present day Golden Temple of Amritsar, which they had defiled by throwing carcasses of cows in the same. It was the only time when Afghan forces were captured in this part of India. But the sikhs were not prepared to draw the Afghans in a straight battle, and always relied upon plundering them, when Afghans were returning with the heavy booty. They left the field open to the Afghans, when they came to raid, and even vacated the city of Lahore, only to reoccupy it later on. The Maratha force was the paramount force in India, in those days, and they controlled the largest part of India, with the Mughal Emperor under their protection. To show their supremacy, they had to fight against the Afghans. They fought and lost. The sikhs were not even prepared to fight the Afghans, since Ahmed Shah Abdali was a big force in those days. Sikhs knew that they may not gain anything even if the Marathas won, since that might lead the Marathas to be the force in Punjab. Sikhs were political creatures, and wanted gains for themselves before entering the war. That was not to come, and in case of a win of Marathas, they had to play a second fiddle. They were not ready for it. So, the Maratha armies had to fight a lonely battle, some two thousand kilometres from their home. Sikhs remained mute spectators. While the Marathas were defeated, still Abdali accepted that they were rulers of the land south of Narmada. In stead, the sikhs were subdued again and again by the Afghans, after they had won Panipat. The reason might be the shortsightedness of the sikh leaders of those days. They might have thought to reap the benefits, if the Afghans and Marathas grew weak after fighting with each other, leaving Punjab open for the sikhs. Had they been on the side of the Marathas, Abdali might have come to negotiations, and the sikhs also might have won some concessions in the area of Punjab. That would have increased their influence in the area, and the sikh empire, that rose up in the nineteenth century, might have been a reality at least half a century before. But that was the misfortune of India, that they never fought unitedly."},{"instruction":"What do you think about Chelsea Clinton saying she may run for elected office in the future?

The issue with American political perspectives is lack of, well, perspective. Since too many Americans don’t want to travel abroad, or if they do it’s just for business without caring to find out anything about the foreign nation, they can only use the current local status quo as a benchmark. And given how much the whole country has moved to the right, even the most timid, moderate social progressive looks like a fierce flag-weaving Trotskyist today. When Bernie Sanders decided to fight Hillary’s candidacy tooth and nail, I was pissed, realizing that he was handling the victory to Trump (indeed he did). But on the other side, I thank him for reminding America that “progressive” is not a four letter word. People like AOC and Rashida Tlaib would not be possible without that momentum. Of course, we’re still far to the right. I hear now that Warren is “too extreme” for 2020 -a rich, high bred East Coast academic which would be considered “center” in any country that has a real Socialist party.

It’s masterfully skillful work to not get that wrong, and change their look. Tom Cruise is a good example. He is aging, sure, but he looks nothing like the average 60 year old. Hair transplants, good diet, staying in shape, and all the rest can make a big difference, but surgery can help too. In this video a plastic surgeon estimates that on the high side Tom Cruise has had 245,000 worth of work done: Even more amazing, Jennifer Aniston looks almost like she did back in the Friends tv show run in the 90s, now at age 53, while none of her co-stars match that, even though aging isn’t such a terrible thing to undergo. That surgeon estimates that she has “only” had 160,000 worth of work done: What is this work, if the point is to not change appearance? His well-informed guess is this: Only two of those procedures relate to structural changes, a nose job and chin reduction. Since that is just a guess she might have had more or less work done, or maybe alternate procedures than the ones he is guessing. I know nothing about plastic surgery myself, so this isn’t a claim about that, but in looking up the Tom Cruise video I caught a little speculation about why he might’ve been heavier in a photo a few years ago, fuller in the face, even slightly bloated (shown in that link thumbnail photo). That surgeon didn’t know for sure, and speculated that normal and temporary weight gain can change appearance, or use of testosterone replacement can, or using fat injection treatments in the face instead of fillers, a related but different approach, which will normalize after some weeks. This complexity accounts for why so many stars end up looking strange after multiple changes; a surgeon needs to factor in how results could be somewhat hard to fully predict, and how side effects from slight changes to improvements can add up. It seems like almost a philosophical point but that surgeon recommends only making changes that adjust for aging input, or to correct slight perceived flaws, but never to make moderate but significant changes to facial appearance. A series of those would leave the subject looking like a different person. These other answers often show people who look radically different based on much more significant changes, typically getting that work done in their 20s. That’s something else, that somehow also seems reasonable, as the range of this topic goes, making a significant appearance change earlier in life that aligns with the more significant natural changes between one’s teens and mid-20s. For a television or movie star, or model, who hasn’t really become established in their industry yet why not? For others without the financial backing to get the most skillful surgical work done it seems to involve more risk, perhaps for more limited gain, just to look better."},{"instruction":"attending your youngest daughter's wedding in direct violation of a protective/restraining order a bad idea even if you have a wellrehearsed apology speech attheready?","output":"It is worse than ”a bad idea.” It is a crime !

[LINKED_TEXT: SANDIPAN DEB] [URL: http://www.outlookindia.com/peoplefnl.aspx?author=Sandipan%20Deb&pid=1322] Contrary to popular belief, the vast majority of IITians do nothing of note in their lives. Indeed, many of them became IITians because their parents told them that’s what they should mug their butts off for, and aim to hit the US of A, so that’s what they did. They attended classes, took notes, passed exams, took the gre, applied to a dozen American universities, and disappeared into that country’s vast technological underbelly, to reappear only in the matrimonial columns of Indian papers with a dollar salary multiplied diligently by the day’s exchange rate. Or they stayed in India, working at unexceptionable jobs, doing reasonably well. In either case, they got beautiful brides (often from rich families) and presumably lived happily ever after, meeting classmates once a month and chatting about their IIT days, and how Hippo has just changed jobs, and Zap is three rungs away from the top in Cisco Systems. Each of them had intelligence well above the average, and most, exceptional academic tenacity. A decade and a half out of IIT, I wonder how many of us IITians achieved our potential? How many went to seed in remote dusty townships, tending massive pipelines and drinking in the township club? How many wilfully walked away from their natural talents in favour of safe MNC jobs selling diapers and hire-purchase schemes? How many, trained to think rationally and without bias, never managed to figure out the nuances of Indian office politics, and were relegated to obscure corridors in huge buildings? How many, obsessed with the American dream, settled for second-rate US universities, hung in for a green card, and today work at unfulfilling jobs in Idaho? There’s another angle too to this. How many IITians, determined to stay engineers and in India, ignored the siren songs of the USA and the IIMs, and joined Indian industry, only to find that all the technical designs came from abroad, that you couldn’t change them even if you knew they were flawed, that all the engineering you got to do was maintenance, and knowing all that, they either settled into mediocrity, or went off to the US or the iims? What was my IIT education all about? It was about IITians: 400 academically exceptional boys (and 12 girls) on a campus, which, in the case of Kharagpur, where I went, was far enough from civilisation to have very interesting effects on our coming of age. Many of us were truly extraordinary. There were boys from village schools who were leagues ahead in knowledge of the urban convent-educated type. There were those who mugged night and day, or simpered at professors from first benches, and there were those who also had a vibrant and busy life outside academics. I’ve found that the latter did better in life, even in fields like pure research. I also had friends who never needed to study, they had been apparently born with engineering wisdom in their genes. There were guys who spent most of the semester in a drug haze, but sobered up a few days before the exams, cracked them, and went back to their pharmaceuticals. Others did not have such control. Like Allen Ginsberg, I too saw some of the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness. A few dropped out (I met one of them years later in Shillong, a stridently devout convert to Catholicism, and a lowly government clerk, but he seemed happy), a few killed themselves. But, most of us survived. I suppose we became tougher, more mature, more knowing, and more aware of our dark sides. We lived and ate together, and shared our joys and heartbreaks and good times and bad times, in competition and camaraderie. We compared our philosophies and, bit by stumbling bit, developed our value systems. Never were stronger bonds forged between young people. Years from now, if I meet an IIT wingmate on the road, I know we will carry on as if nothing had changed, and nothing actually would have. A couple of years ago, there was a small visual trick on an Outlook cover, which was my idea. A close IIT friend, whom I had not been in touch with for years, called up from Singapore: \\"Some other name is mentioned in the cover credits, but it was your idea, right? I know the way you think.\\" No one knows me better than these mates of mine from IIT. IIT was also a whole insular world in itself, complex and complete, and it sucked us in. As The Chosen, we lived a full life with no necessity of any contact with the outside world. Totally cut off from politics and \\"the bigger issues\\", our delights remained in competing fiercely on the field or the stage with other hostels or other colleges. There were few material pleasures. Lifestyles were spartan, the food abysmal. The vast majority of males were totally deprived of female company. The girls lived a strange life-on the one hand, they were hounded by dozens of would-be suitors; on the other, they faced the petulant hostility of the majority which saw them as undeserving of so much adulation and so many free lunches. When we graduated, we went out into the world with a rare confidence and strong tribal loyalties. The confidence eroded a bit over the years, and we learnt some humility when we discovered non-IITians as smart as we were, and also people who could outwit us because they were intelligent in a different way-in a sly political way-an acumen we had not developed in our isolated environment which, above all, inculcated a sense of fairness and a respect for ability. We came to terms with a world that compared poorly with our beloved campus, and some of us even went ahead and conquered it. Others didn’t do well, but knew that the ties between them and the masters-of-the-universe classmates would never change. They were ties born of the pride of being an IITian. That pride would never diminish. It never can. The author, Deputy Editor of Outlook, is an Electronics Engineer from IIT Kharagpur. He also met his wife at IIT.

Throughout this period, buddies and workmates have been asking me \\"How's your Bhutan journey?\\". After a brief time out, I frequently found myself responding \\"it was wonderful, but it was likewise tough\\". Puzzled as to why this ended up as my post-Bhutan 'motto', I started attempting to find out why this trip was various to the other trips I 'd taken in the past ... which's how this post happened. In the end, I think that as much as I 'd like to make it like it was a best vacation, I believe it's more beneficial just saying things as it is-- both the excellent and the bad. Ideally, my ideas and observations will help other visitors level their expectations and be much better prepared for their own journeys to this amazing (but somewhat exasperating) country. 1. Prices's steeper than a comparable trip somewhere else Initially up, be prepared to pay more for this journey than a similar holiday in another nation. That's mostly since the Bhutanese government mandates a minimum invest of US 250 per person daily for all tourists (US 200 during low season). This allows for low impact tourist whilst providing visitors a low volume/ high quality experience. Also Visit - [LINKED_TEXT: Paro Haa Thimphu Holiday Package] [URL: http://www.swantour.com/paro-haa-thimphu-holidays-package.php] And unless you use skilfully in writing to the federal government, you'll practically need to go to Bhutan via a certified Bhutanese trip operator (or a global partner). You can't just get a visa, fly in and explore the nation by yourself. This is why Bhutan's thought about one of the world's most exclusive tourist locations. Just 44,000 travelers checked out in 2013, that averages at 120 visitors a day ...! The land cost for our 10-day trip in Bhutan was US 2200 pax (marked down because we were a largish group of 13). By comparison, my 8-day Myanmar trip back in 2011 expense us US 977 pax (including domestic flights) for a personal group tour of 10. However before we begin groaning, keep in mind that from this minimum invest, US 65 per individual per day will be given to the federal government as a 'sustainable tourism royalty' to assist fund for free education, healthcare, poverty relief and the structure of infrastructure in Bhutan. I took a little comfort in the reality that a part of our tour cost is being used to assist the nation and its beautiful peoples. With this minimum daily spend, you'll be supplied with all your meals, lodgings, a dedicated tourist guide and driver, entry to all the places in the schedule, and all transportation other than domestic flights. So you wind up costs not that much throughout your trip, really most of my loan was invested on alcohol to go with our meals and ideas for the guide and motorist. 2. Half the time, you're about the only trip group around Among the loveliest aspects of this trip will have to be how uncommon it was to see fellow tourists. On our first evening when we visited Tashi Cho Dzong in Thimpu (the nation's capital city), I was stunned that there were only a little scatter of a couple of other trip groups there. Even the most renowned tourist location in Bhutan, Tigers Nest in Paro, had at most 30-50 travelers inside the temple at any time There were even some nights where we were the only tourists remaining in our hotel! Also Visit - [LINKED_TEXT: Le Meridien Thimphu Bhutan] [URL: http://www.swantour.com/bhutan-tours/le-meridien-thimphu.php] Compare this to a visit to the Louvre in Paris, where getting near adequate to Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa without requiring field glasses can be a Herculean job, and you'll begin to really value Bhutan's focus on low impact tourist. This was likewise among the couple of nations I've visited in Asia where the children do not request for 'photo money', and pleading is almost non-existent here (it just occurred to us as soon as in Bumthang). In a nutshell, I was definitely captivated by how unspoilt this country was from the results of tourist, and impressed at how delighted the people of Bhutan were. Tips aren't anticipated in dining establishments and hotels, and I was also amazed to see that it's the Bhutanese women who 'd (with a huge smile) offload our travel luggage from the bus and bring it to our rooms. Speak about culture shock! 3. Whatever works on Bhutan time You'll have to be client in Bhutan. Even credit card makers have to go 'ermmm ...' and think like insane prior to accepting deals ... ha ha ha! When some of us wished to alter cash in Paro, it took us ages filling up types at the workplace counter. Our lovely tourist guide's bus trip quotes were likewise way off. We 'd ask for how long it 'd take to get to a destination and he 'd reply '3 hours' ... in the end we 'd discover that it's more like 6 hours !! More frequently than not, our guide did not offer us curfews or time limits unless we needed to be at a crossing at a very particular time of day. He 'd simply wait and let us take our time, permitting us to proceed only when we're ready. What this means is: in order to delight in Bhutan, you may require to let go of your OCD timekeeping tendencies (on this front, I'm guilty as charged). Go at your very own rate, follow the circulation of the group, and do not expect to see everything that's listed on the schedule. Also Visit - [LINKED_TEXT: Le Meridien Paro, Bhutan] [URL: http://www.swantour.com/bhutan-tours/le-meridien-paro.php] 4. Your tour is completely escorted, but really customizable Continuing from the previous point, I 'd like to explain that because you're currently engaged with a tour operator via the proper channels, you can in fact modify your travel plan to match your choices. Seeing that timekeeping may not be the Bhutanese people's strongest fit, it might work to go over with your guide which places in the schedule you 'd actually prefer to see and which ones you're delighted to skip. For the most part, the suggested schedule is a bit packed and you have the tendency to lose out on a few places each day unless you move quickly and don't take photos. So it's much better to establish with your guide which positions you're more keen on seeing. For example at around day 7, we in fact drifted away from the schedule and went to a few places that only our guide knew about, including a visit to a local Bhutanese house in a village near Bumthang district. That was the highlight of my trip ... for me, being able to glimpse into the lives of the locals is a lot more valuable than continuously seeing remarkable temples and fortresses. Similarly, we likewise asked our guide to let us roam the municipalities of Chamkar and Paro for an hour approximately instead of seeing sights due to the fact that we took pleasure in having some free-and-easy time checking out settlements and viewing the Bhutanese way of living.

You might be walking lots and at high elevations Perhaps it was my lack of reading the tour travel plan on my part, but one thing that I wasn't rather prepared for with this trip was just how much strolling/ travelling it involved. Well ... fine perhaps just 3 from the 10 days included tough uphill treks. The first one took place on day 2, where we went up a mountain towards Tango Goemba abbey. The walking was implied to take only an hour however we took almost 2 hours because a few of us experienced acute mountain sickness and burning lungs. However the toughest climb for a lot of visitors in Bhutan will probably be the 900m ascent up to Tigers Nest-- 3100m above sea level, which normally occurs at the end of your journey as the (orgasmic) emphasize. Fortunately, the whole group of us understood that we aren't the fittest travelers around. So aside for Fakegf and The Angmoh, the rest people all surrendered and rode horses up to the temple ... ha ha! Bottom line is, be gotten ready for a little hiking throughout your Bhutan trip even if your tour itinerary does not necessarily explain it to be so. And comprehend that a one hour hike might wind up taking longer since of the high altitudes you will be trekking in. And most notably, be clinically prepared ... bring elevation illness pills and take a trip illness tablets (see listed below). It will make your journey a lot simpler! 6. Driving in Bhutan is sluggish, windy and rough I'll come out and say it: THIS was the main reason that I had actually mixed feelings with my trip to Bhutan. Also Visit - [LINKED_TEXT: Bhutan Packages from Delhi] [URL: http://www.swantour.com/bhutan-tours/bhutan-tour-packages-with-airfare.php] If you take a look at Bhutan on Google Maps ... it is basically all mountains mountains! As soon as you're beyond Paro and Thimpu, the quality of the roads goes downhill really quickly. Some sections between cities were unpaved, and even taking a trip on areas of paved roads will not guarantee a smooth flight. Considering it's traffic in two instructions, the roads looked just somewhat larger than the bicycle paths back in Melbourne. There's lots of hairpin turns, bumps, holes and frightening vertical cliff drops. Cousin trouble and geek hubby who sat at the back of the bus flew a foot or 2 off their seats during the bumpiest parts of the ride. While the government is attempting to upgrade the roads in between towns over the next couple of years, I believe it will still be slow going since of the severe terrain. From our 10 days in Bhutan, almost 4 to 5 days were invested in these insane roadways from sunrise to sunset (albeit including stops to go to locations). Our average bus speed was around 20-25km/ hr. By day 6 to 7, I was quite much over it and boarded the bus each morning with a feeling of fear. As well as though I'm usually great with vehicle illness, I in fact had to ask cousin problem for travel illness tablets a number of times because spending so lots of hours on these roadways really did take its toll on me. Personally speaking, my idea of a great vacation doesn't exactly constitute stuffing yourself into a little bus and passing through these impossibly tortuous roadways for hours on end. However regrettably, these are things that you don't realise you'll be experiencing on your vacation until you're actually in the middle of the trip! The larger, more comfy trip coaches that's generally utilized in other nations are too large for the narrow twisty roadways in Bhutan. In retrospection, I've probably not travelled in a nation that's more mountainous than Bhutan aside for Nepal (where I did more trekking and had no bus trips anyway). We had a pretty comparable kind of smallish bus on our Myanmar trip, however the bus rides were shorter and the roadways much straighter. So the combination of mountainous surface, high elevation and long bus flights actually made this trip to Bhutan hard. Looking back, I'm beginning to think that Bhutan might be a fantastic country to go travelling in, where the bus rides will be kept to a minimum and the stunning landscapes cranked to an optimum.

Smaller sized tour groups may be better After a little bit of post-holiday research, I discovered that in 2013, 81% of the trip groups going to Bhutan consisted of groups of 4 or less people. The federal government's minimum day-to-day spend requirement indicates that the group size does not actually alter the per person expense of the trip that much (unless it's a group of a couple of persons where a US 30-40 everyday additional charge uses). However what does change significantly is the type of lorry you'll be travelling in. We got a bus while the smaller groups rode SUVs/ Landcruisers. The other feature of smaller sized groups is it's a lot easier to reach a quorum with where you 'd like to go and exactly what you 'd prefer to see in the travel plan. The trip rate will also be quicker due to the fact that a SUV will take a trip faster than a 22-seater bus. The time saved can then be utilized to offer yourselves a little itinerary \\"breathing time\\" (which I truly missed in this trip), or you can use it to see more sights. Again, I 'd like to stress that these are things that you 'd realize only after you've started your trip to Bhutan. I am, in no other way, complaining to cousin problem ... who worked so hard arranging this journey and bringing 13 relative and buddies together to experience this beautiful landlocked nation. If we were travelling together in a various nation, a number of the special challenges that specify to Bhutan would not have even appeared.

Consider taking domestic flights Continuing with my thoughts around standing Bhutan's tough roadways, how about taking a trip one method by roadway and the other method by plane? This assists lower the travel time on the hard roads, allowing you to see more places and at a more unwinded speed. For my trip, our start point was Paro, where Bhutan's only global airport resides. We rode the bus all the way to Bumthang then rode the bus back to Paro. Seeing that there's in fact a thrice weekly domestic flight in between Bumthang and Paro, you might wish to (if your funds allow it) check out a tour schedule that consists of a one-way flight in between Paro and the furthest point you 'd be taking a trip to. 9. A journey length of 7 to 8 days may be enough Another unusual thing I observed about Bhutan was how the architecture stayed very consistent throughout its districts ... with colourful wood frames mathematically put against white walls, thin detailed windows and square, carefully sloping roofs. This standard architectural style becomes strikingly recognizable across the entire country, but it likewise suggests that aside for incredible changes in landscape, the dzongs (fortresses), lhakhangs (temples) and houses can begin to look a bit repeated. By day 6 to 7, some of us were practically \\"dzonged-out\\" to the point where we 'd rather simply wander about a town, observing the Bhutanese way of living rather of going to another architecturally impressive (but all too familiar) fortress or temple. Also Visit - [LINKED_TEXT: Bhutan Honeymoon Packages from Delhi] [URL: http://www.swantour.com/bhutan-tours/bhutan-honeymoon-package-from-delhi.php] Once again this is a retrospective observation, but Fatbee and I agreed that unless there were less bus journeys and more complimentary/ expedition time, a trip length of 7-8 days would've been perfect for us. It's a time frame where you can still have that sense of awe and wonder with going to the dzongs and lhakhangs in Bhutan. And you can leave the country with that intangible feeling of wanting to see juuust a little bit more. 10. The majority of your meals will be buffet-style This final dot-point about Bhutan is a cheeky tribute to cousin trouble's greatest problem with Bhutan- the food ... OMG the food ... ha ha ha! She may have endured the insane roads better than myself, but by day 5, she started having problems with the meals that were attended to us. All our meals in this journey were included in the trip cost, and 95% of them were buffet-style, with the lunches and suppers typically including about 6-8 different types of veggie dishes and one meat meal ... all being in bain marie trays. (Breakfast was more Western however again served as a buffet). We’d generally have our dishes with steamed red rice and chilli cheese (pickled chillies in a light cheese-based sauce). Problem is, due to Bhutan's cold environment, there's a propensity for the food to have quite a heavy existence of butter and oils in a lot of the meals. And in terms of spices, it usually focuses on soya sauce and oyster sauce, and at some places it can be insane salty! Also Visit - [LINKED_TEXT: Best of Bhutan Tour] [URL: http://www.swantour.com/bhutan-tours/best-of-bhutan-tour.php] I was great with the food at first, but as soon as a few people made some observations about the uniformity of the meals, a group cascade impact quickly followed. I ultimately began avoiding the ubiquitous trays of (frequently overcooked) broccoli/ mustard leaves/ carrots/ cauliflower fried in loads of oil and soya sauce. I also started to miss out on having the ability to go a la carte with my meals. It reached a point where we ended up taxiing into town and purchasing Bhutanese pizzas (sadly with truckloads of cheese) for dinner on day 8 and had Malaysian food on day 9! All that said, our tourist guide was terrific sufficient to permit a small menu modification demand, and some of our meals further down the track likewise included a plate of raw peeled carrots (ie. oil and salt-free) ... which a number of us savoured like it was the finest thing in the world!! Conclusion Prior to I end, I 'd like to highlight that this post isn't about pinning the blame on the nation or anybody in particular. It is more about looking for to understand why I found this trip discouraging. To put things into much better point of view, let me say that I treasured the time that I spent with my cousins (and good friends) on this trip. And I'm deeply grateful to cousin difficulty for organising the journey and caring for the well-being of the whole group right through the 10 days. I likewise appreciated how attentive and responsive our tour guide was to our requirements and how expert our driver was. I confess that I began getting quite cranky from around day 6-7, but that's mainly to do with the long, uncomfortable bus trips than individuals I was travelling with. I acknowledge that my current experiences with luxury travel in Bali this year could have turned me into a little bit of a more difficult-to-please holidaygoer. Cousin difficulty even provided me a metaphorical slap in the face when I spoke (without believing) and compared the pains of this trip to backpacking. In the end, I believe everything boils down to the dollar value that you put into having a distinct experience in an unaffected nation with its idiosyncrasies, its pleased citizens, and with few fellow tourists. Your complete satisfaction will also depend on your ability to endure some pretty difficult drives and the occasional mediocre hotel (Bhutan's variation of 3-stars isn't really rather international requirement). I still think it’s certainly worth visiting this difficult nation, simply done so with an open mind and a little additional planning. Hopefully this post will assist you with some of the decisions for your trip. If your budget plan permits it, I think going as a smaller sized group, including a domestic flight into the schedule and maybe upgrading to much better hotels will help a lot. It has actually now been a month since my go to, and I'm beginning to forget the pains of the trip. On the other hand, beautiful insights from exactly what I 'd seen are beginning to concern the surface area ... and I feel all set to begin collecting these memories and turning it into a trip journal.

Now Poco M3 Pro 5G smartphone starts at just 180 for the lower variant and is under 200 bucks for the higher variant. However, is it also important to know that Poco M3 Pro 5G is the rebranded version of Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 5G smartphones that was launched globally some time ago. So here are some of the specifications of Poco M3 Pro 5G that would really help you get a better idea about it: · Poco M3 Pro 5G is a sturdy device with a really catchy design and bright colors. It contains a 6.5-inch display with 90Hz display refresh rate. Plus, it also contains a 1080p display resolution and Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection over the display. · The smartphone is powered by the most affordable Mediatek 5G chipset- Mediatek Dimensity 700 that is octa-core in structure with a primary clock speed of 2.2GHz. It also contains Mali-G57 MC2 as its GPU and Android 11 support over MIUI 12. · Poco M3 Pro 5G occurs in 2 variants of RAM and ROM. The most affordable variant contains 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage while you can also get the higher variant that contains 128GB ROM and 6GB RAM. I think both these are sufficient for the regular users as well as for the gamers. · Talking about the camera section, Poco M3 Pro 5G comes with a 48MP main camera while there is a 2MP macro camera and a 2MP depth sensor as well. It also comes with Dual LED, dual tone flash with HDR support to help you take great images and videos at night. However, the selfie camera is the regular 8MP one which has been a part of the budget devices for ages, and I think the budget buyers deserve something better than this. · The smartphone comes with a huge 5000mAh that can last a pretty long period of time and it also supports a good 18W fast charging support for the users that can help the battery get charged pretty quickly. · If you look at the security features, the smartphone comes with a face unlock feature and side-mounted fingerprint sensor. It also contains features such as accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass, 24-bit/192kHz audio, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band, Wi-Fi Direct, and hotspot etc. Besides all these, Poco has chosen very interesting tones of colors which are named as Poco Yellow, Power Black, and Cool Blue and you can choose the one that suits you the best. However, when Redmi Note 10 5G was already available with the same specs, I hardly understand why Xiaomi should bring an exactly same smartphone in the US market. Just because this smartphone is so popular in the Asian market? Well, this could be understood only by Xiaomi but the reactions of the fans should be really interesting. Most Americans are really interested in having smartphones that are launched in Chinese and Indian markets and this could be one of the reasons why the Poco M3 Pro 5G is considered a wonderful launch.

Why or why not?","output":"I am not going to give you a reason to believe in Karma. It is your choice. But I am going to put forth an interesting notion about Karma. Karma, a Sanskrit word refers to the principle of cause and effect. The actions and the intent of a person influencing his future (even his future birth). This is a short explanation. The concept of Karma is followed by many Indian religions. Long back, Indian people were divided into four major Varnas. For people who do not know about the Varna system in India. There were four: Brahmana > Kshatriya > Vaishya > Shudra (in the order of their importance in ancient India) Now what happens if there is a such a separation, where one strata enjoys while the other suffers. There will be dissent among the masses. You have to give them a reason regarding why they belong to a particular caste. Lo and Behold there comes Karma. Brahmins told the Shudras that because of their negative Karma, they were born in that Varna. And that, they should suffer in this life to enjoy in the next life. This is clearly a Machiavellian technique (or Chanakya thanthra) to control the masses. Won’t you guys agree that Indians were a clever lot. In the name of this Karma, different communities in India were suppressed and exploited. I am not saying that the principle of Karma is bad. Many things in the world were created for selfish reasons. But it depends on the people who use it. The takeaway here is that you should do good deeds but not with the belief of/in Karma thinking that you will get something back out of it.

Seattle Supersonics (1990s) They have a roster varies in degrees of Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp, Detlef Schrempf, Derek Mckey, Alton Liston, Michael Cage, Dana Barros and Rickey Pierce. The backups includes Nate McMillan, Eddie Johnson, Sam Perkins, and sometimes Rich King (I’m just throwing that name in there). Don’t know how, but George Karl fine tuned the team in early 90s with Key components including Gary Payton and Shawn Kemp as the center pieces. Took the team to a NBA final, then have peaked with a best record in 1993–1994 season. but then self imploded with the first ever lost in first round series by a #1 seeded team of a 8 team conference playoffs. Majority of those guys mentioned on the main roster happens to stay together in better part of the 90s before the beginning of the end after the team finally made it to the NBA final in 1996 and lost to the Bulls. Always one of the best team in the Western conference in the 90s, but never able to top the Utah Jazz or Houston Rockets to consistently get to the Final. Honestly, they would still lose to the Chicago Bulls anyways. I picked this team because the main starting roster is roughly the same for better part of the 90s. The coach is roughly the same with George Karl as the coach and the GM was Bob Whitsitt, before he took off for Portland’s gig in the late 90s. This is rare for today’s NBA as most team get disassemble after three years if a team doesn’t improve.

It is neither a realistic or obtainable goal to speak in the same way as a native speaker in almost all circumstances. However, the great news is that it should not even be the goal! So often, people come with the vague goal of ‘speaking like a native.’ This is nebulous, hard to identify and not even a particularly positive thing. The goal of a language is to communicate. If you are successfully communicating then you are successfully using the language. Let’s take accent, as that’s often the most talked about factor. Most people want to sound like native speakers by imitating their sounds and prosody. This is actually extremely difficult (actually almost impossible.) Accents are part of what make languages such a pleasure. They are markers of cultural heritage, of frustrating time learning and a mark of the effort you have made as a second language speaker. So long as your accent is understandable for almost all the words there is no need to imitate native speakers. Unless you spend a lot of time and money (see [LINKED_TEXT: this piece] [URL: https://williamcookecoaching.com/blog/teachers-conundrum/] I wrote about client expectations from courses) working with an accent trainer you will not see perfect results and even then speaking in isolation will be much easier than if you are actually processing a conversation, this is why actor’s imperfect accents often slip during emotional or difficult scenes. After infancy we lose our abilities as universal listeners, therefore we can no longer learn all the sounds of language. We will never imitate perfectly and even then imitation is just that, it does not create good honest communication between parties. Make it understandable and make it representative of you. This also applies to grammar, if somebody says to me ‘I go to park’ I can understand from this, anyone who doesn’t is lying (or your communication skills are not good enough). Luckily English is a pretty contextual and flexible language. That is why it is widely considered easy to get the basics and difficult to master. Focus on making your communication clear rather than focusing exclusively on grammar rules, that you may believe ‘native.’ We don’t actually even really learn grammar in school in the UK, at least, I didn’t! Finally vocabulary: You can improve your vocabulary to be more ‘native-flavoured’ by learning idioms that we commonly use. But you must be careful not to use these wrongly or too much. Therefore, I recommend adding them after you have actually heard them used. There is no point learning these huge lists of irrelevant idiomatic phrases you see online and making yourself sound strange or that you are trying too hard. This involves contact with the target culture (UK language is substiantlly different to US) speaking with locals over a period of time, using local media etc., there is no quick fix. Learning a language is a holistic process of gaining communication skills. Focus on these rather than ‘being like a native speaker.’ You will not only grow in skill but also in confidence because you are no longer comparing yourself to a needless, impossible standard. You will be free to communicate confidently with the world."},{"instruction":"What are the characteristics of a genuine person?","output":"Honest, vulnerable, ego-less, direct, comfortable in their own skin and isn’t a “follower” has their own opinions on things to name a few characteristics.

The behavior of a consumer while buying a coffee is a lot different while buying a car. Based on observations, it is clear that purchases that are more complex and expensive involve higher deliberation and many more participants. Consumer buying behavior is determined by the level of involvement that a consumer shows towards a purchase decision. The amount of risk involved in a purchase also determines the buying behavior. Higher priced goods tend to high higher risk, thereby seeking higher involvement in buying decisions. Complex buying behavior is encountered particularly when consumers are buying an expensive product. In this infrequent transaction, consumers are highly involved in the purchase decision. Consumers will research thoroughly before committing to invest. Consumer behaves very different when buying an expensive product or a product that is unfamiliar to him. When the risk of buying a product is very high, a consumer consults friends, family and experts before making the decision. For example, when a consumer is buying a car for the first time, it’s a big decision as it involves high economic risk. There is a lot of thought on how it looks, how his friends and family will react, how will his social status change after buying the car, and so on. In complex buying behavior, the buyer will pass through a learning process. He will first develop beliefs about the product, then attitudes, and then making a thoughtful purchase choice. For complex buying behavior customers, marketers should have a deep understanding of the products. It is expected that they help the consumer to understand about their product. It is important to create advertising message in a way that influences the buyer’s beliefs and attitudes."},{"instruction":"Why do some people like to stay in an abusive relationship?","output":"People stay in unhealthy or abusive relationships for many different reasons.

They have enough time to get started in that and also get very good rankings in that. There are a lot of articles, videos on Youtube, College lectures to get started in that but most of the time they are not complete and so confusing that rather than explaining the proper journey they even confuse a lot of students. And After that confusion, many students get a lot of fear about Competitive Programming. But Let me tell you exactly about that. Competitive Programming is just a Sport. Like other games that require a lot of hard work and practice, the same is for Competitive Programming. It actually requires a lot of Coding questions, Tricky Questions, and sometimes very hard questions, which usually can take even days to think. Some students are even extraordinary in that they solve very few questions and they have very good problem-solving skills and they get very good ranks. And Many students get a lot of tension from that as their peers are scoring too much and even after practicing you are not scoring well. This actually hurts us but We should be consistent in that time and It is well said that The Person who handles that and practices even after that situation, always wins the race. Let’s talk about few Points which one should do before starting their journey: - First, Learn any Programming Language: - Yes, First you should learn any programming language and preferably C++ or Java.Many students continue with C but C++ is very easy and has a lot of features than C like OOPS, STL which helps a lot in Competitive Programming.And Also Never do Python or Javascript as Your First Language. Some students even love to do Python as their First Programming Language because it is easy to write and has a lot of functions that you can write directly. But those functions don’t make our foundation strong.In C++, Java Those functions are not available or very few functions are there and We actually write a lot of functions according to our need which actually helps a lot.After learning that, Also focus on OOPS and spend 1 month learning about OOPS. There are a lot of courses available on Youtube. I myself have done from Saurabh Shukla Sir Videos on Youtube. Learn Data Structure and Algorithms: - Now after spending 2–3 Months, You have learned a language and learned the basics. And now it is a very important part to learn about Storing and Structuring various kinds of Data. And For that, We have Data Structures. One should learn about that very properly before actually deep-diving into Competitive Programming. One should learn about all Data Structures likeLinked ListsStacks and QueuesTrees including Binary Trees, BST and then move to AVL Trees, Segment TreesGraphs and some Advance algorithms of Graphs also.Dynamic Programming There are a lot of courses available on Youtube like Apni Kaksha, Abdul Bari Sir, and Some Paid Courses like Coding Ninjas. I myself have done Coding Ninjas Course and that was the best course about Data Structure and Algorithms. The doubt support in that course was really amazing and the concepts being taught were also up to the mark which I loved a lot. I actually felt The course is really worth it.Start Practicing: - This is one of the most important steps in Competitive Programming which requires a lot of hard work, patience, and determination. Before directly moving into the contests, Start Practicing at various sites.First, solve Hackerrank Problem Solving Skills Questions which are also very good.Solve Codechef First 50 Beginner’s Friendly Problem. And Then start giving some contests like Long Challenges and always start with that,And then start solving the A2OJ Ladder of Codeforces. Those ladders are really amazing and The Questions given in that are very sorted. And Now You are ready for contests and that will help you a lot. Learn New Algorithms and Maths Concepts: - There are a lot of algorithms and Start learning that from various articles, Youtube channels like Striver Videos, Rachit Jain Sir Videos, and those really help a lot in learning new concepts. You should learn a lot of new Algorithms and Concepts at this time.BacktrackingAdvance DPSegment Trees and Fenwick TreesNumber TheoryAdvance Graph Algos Upsolve the contests: - This is really very important and a lot of coders ignore this but they realize this mistake very later. They give contests but Never Upsolve the Contests and Never try to do some hard Questions, which is not a good practice, One should always upsolve the contests which are actually very important. Some Special Points: - Always try to do the algorithm in mind before actually writing on the code.Make Proper Notes of DSA which will help you a lot in Interviews.Always Try to run Your Algorithm before actually submitting anywhere.In Contests, Always think of edge cases that will help you a lot.Never get frustrated by your friend’s ranking. Just focus on your ones and that will help you a lot.Always do things with dedication. You can learn a lot but The Important Qualities that you need are: - Dedication, Consistency, Practicing.Sometimes You will even get lower ranks. You know students generally start from 2* on Codechef and In my 2nd Contest, I directly got jumped to 1* and even after solving 3–4 contests, I was not able to go to even 2* but Practice is the only thing which made me successful at that time. At last, I just want to say that, If You will do Competitive Programming as fun, Just like other Sports, You will definitely learn a lot."},{"instruction":"f you could go back and change one event in history, what would it be?","output":"Donald Trump not going to Vietnam during the War.

Other areas nearer the poles have opened up but most of them are still not available for agriculture. All of this has reduced the overall land area available to humans. And many of the larger coastal cities have flooding problems. As a result of the above, there was a lot of disruption in society, which led to conflict and famines and disease. The net result was that the total population reduced significantly. As in previous similar situations (after Black Death and World War 1/Spanish Flu for example) this led to increased social equality since workers became so much more valuable. Combining this with improvements in all areas of science, particularly automation, most areas of the world offer a UBI (universal basic income) which is sufficient to live on comfortably, but not luxuriously. There are, however, some areas in the world where the rich hung on to all the power, with the rest of the population being little more than slaves. But, with the surplus production from other areas, there is less of a problem with immigration. So there is a gradual population decrease in these tyrannies, which are expected to collapse entirely within a generation or so. For those areas where everyone does have UBI, there has been a cultural renaissance. Many people who would have struggled to earn enough to live in the past now have free time for handcrafted goods, and theatre and music are common. There are still trolls, however, and some go in for extreme displays purely for shock value. With the increased lifespan for most people, the population is gradually increasing, even though some people warn of the dangers of overpopulation. So far as anyone knows, interstellar travel is not practical, except for robotic probes.

Single-shot rifles, even some time ago, were more accurate at longer ranges when firing a pointed bullet (bullet length, mass, and rifling is more influential to long range ballistics anyhow). But when the first repeaters were made, bullets were loaded end to end in a tube magazine. Think of a lever action 30–30. Because the bullets are end to end, you are restricted to round nose or flat nose bullets to avoid a sharp end igniting the primer in the next bullet. Additionally, having shorter rounds allowed you to load more rounds in the tube at one time (which meant stubby bullets and shorter cartridges for powder). These rifles typically only had iron sights anyway, so long range accuracy wasn’t much of a concern. Fast forward to vertical internal box magazines in bolt action rifles. You can chamber a round while lying in the prone position, the vertical magazine allows for long, pointed rounds (albeit only 3–4), and you throw a scope on top and viola, you have an accurate long range rifle. As far as a bullet actually being sharp, you have to understand what a bullet’s purpose is. It is not to pierce a hole in a target, it is to wreck a hole in a target, which means deforming within inches of impact. Part of that involves not being so sharp. The bullet material determines this as well, whether you have a lead bullet, partial or full copper jacket, or pure copper (there are many more bullet materials, but these are the most common). But to the point of the question, having a very sharp tip does not serve the purpose that most ammunition is made for. In fact, soldiers have been known to scrape down the tips of their bullets in order to expose and flatten the lead to make them more deadly against unarmored enemy combatants. Now the other bullet type we haven’t covered, handguns. Shorter barrels and iron sights limits range and velocity, especially for heavy bullets. The objective of a handgun round is not to hit a dime at 100 yards, and it is not to rip a hole through steel plate. It is to travel a very short distance, and upon impact with human flesh, flatten and deform as greatly and uniformly as possible, damaging as much tissue on its short path through the body. Round/flat/hollow bullets in handguns has nothing to do with the mechanics of loading/firing or trajectories like rifles, but has everything to do with its affect on a human target at close range."},{"instruction":"w would you handle a situation in business where an employee tells you they refuse to meet individually with a female or attend a business lunch with a female, because morally a married man should not meet 1 on 1 with a woman?","output":"You forget to say alone without your wife.

People can believe in whatever deities they wish and appeal to them as they feel the need.

Mind you, it does not matter what religion one is talking about. They all become basically the same once they assume political power. In the USA it is Christians who are making the greatest effort to turn their religion into law, and who are in the best position to do so. We are reminded of that every time a Christian fanatic declares “the USA is a Christian nation!” Also consider that this applies to atheism. A state which actively promotes atheism as superior to theism is not better than a theocracy. The only way to preserve human rights and dignity is for the state to remain secular, that is for the state to officially declare religion to be a personal, not a political matter."},{"instruction":"Can a Jew become a nonJew?","output":"Yes, he needs a pair of regular underwear and a shaver to shave of his light beard."},{"instruction":"My blood pressure was 138/83 and my pulse was 52.

[LINKED_TEXT: Russell Bryan · Jan 22If Deku catches Goku off guard, can he one-shot him?Yes. ——————————— Edit: tldr because some people don't seem to be reading the whole answer. No, Izuku is nowhere near Goku's power, even on Izuku's best day and Goku's worst. However, the very nature of Goku's power means that he could reduce it as much as he wants to at any given time. If he can reduce it so much that he can be bruised by a bullet from a pistol, he can absolutely choose to lower it to the point where Deku could one-shot him. I am in no way saying that Deku is stronger than Goku, in fact if you actually read the answer I'm saying the exact opposite. Edit 2, copied from an earlier comment: Hopefully I won't have to clarify this again on this answer but I'm not arguing that Deku would beat Goku, because he wouldn't and not by a long shot. Rather I'm saying that there is a specific circumstance entirely within the power of both characters where Deku could beat Goku, and that difference is important. Whether they know they're fighting each other, want to fight each other, or have the ability to quickly raise their defenses is irrelevant to the conversation. The question was about a possible scenario, not a probable one, and that's what I answered. It'd be dishonest for me to deny it just because I like Goku more than Deku. The real answer begins below. ——————————— Goku is naturally very strong even at rest, but his defenses weaken significantly when he's off guard. This is because he lowers his power when he believes the battle is won, in order to avoid exhausting himself unnecessarily (and probably also to avoid destroying his surroundings by accident). He has, in the past, acclimated to an elevated state (Super Saiyan during the Cell saga) to the point where the form didn't stress him at all, but he still reverts back to normal and lowers his power to this day. Now to be clear, in his base form Goku is still many times Universal level, but even after achieving this power he's shown to take damage from weak attacks if he's goofing around. Examples: bruised from a normal round from a pistol after catching a full clip from an assault rifle with no issue. And of course, being injured by Sorbet's Bad Ring Laser after having a universal level fight with Frieza. Now to be fair, Sorbet's Laser was made with some of the most advanced technology in the known universe, but that doesn't discount the fact that this only worked after Goku relaxed from fighting Frieza. Goku could be “off guard” and reduce his power to such a level that anything could hurt him. That includes Deku, especially using the powers of One For All. ——————————— Postscript; hopefully the final edit.

[LINKED_TEXT: Maikeru Marmoon · Mar 4Does it make any sense that Goku was badly hurt by that mini blaster in Resurrection F?Yes. As that moment was to give a reason to why Goku doesn't let down his guard anymore. {{As before it he's never had any Really bad experiences with letting down his guard // 1st time Got hit with a small rock, 2nd time got knocked out by Vegeta, the 3rd Well let's just say the 3rd was the lucky charm which we are currently talking about}} {{Please note that not training will also weaken a persons guard}} Also a note before the fight with Frieza Whis had been repeatedly telling him that he needs to stop lowering his guard ((by guard they mean Ki shielding)) and during Ressurection F he lowered it thinking the fight was over just to get blasted in the back by a laser after wards however Whis more or less Got onto him about it and since then he hasn't done so again. //// Now something you should know the WEAKEST OLD MODEL FRIEZA FORCE LASERS from DBZ are capable of Destroying moons (which btw wer specifically designed to be far weaker than a Generals personal blaster) and this what he was hit with was a NEW MODEL GENERAL laser, so for Goku being able to survive a MOON — PLANETARY+ blast through the heart is a statement in itself. As u can see here that most of the lasers destructive power went into piercing Goku and here is the remaining destructive power of the Laser That's a GIANT hole…. So as U can See Goku's unprotected Body TANKED most of the laser’s destructive power which would be roughly CONCENTRATED MOON — PLANET tier+ power that harmed the OFF-Guard Goku. And it would have to be repeated to Kill Goku as In Ressurection F the laser that went through his heart doesn't kill him. ///// Now as for those of you that are like “” BUT WAIT HE WAS TRANSFORMED HOW DID HE NOT HAVE A SHIELD “” Please note that forms don't instantly grant a Shield it AMPLIFIES all the users abilities so if said user lowers there shield the Shields effects won't be applied due to not being active… ///// {So ye down players can kiss my Shiny Titanium Ass} {common Shtick “BUT IF HIS GUARD DOWN BUT IF HIS GUARD DOWN\\" hey Dumb ass if your putting your weak ass character against a Goku past Ressurection F his gaurd won't ever be down as he keeps his ki shielding up 24/7 ever since the little Laser incident} /// Here's a WAY STRONGER laser hitting Goku in the face with his guard up ((aka Ki shielding up)) Thank @John Jones for requesting my answer.] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Does-it-make-any-sense-that-Goku-was-badly-hurt-by-that-mini-blaster-in-Resurrection-F/answer/Maikeru-Marmoon?ch=10&oid=321547056&share=9d2abe56&srid=uy9aKt&target_type=answer]/// Now let's examine this a bit further shall we? Deku comes in at around: Small Island — Continental, AT AN ABSOLUTE MAX IN HIS SCALING of AP/DP While Deku's Defence comes in around: Super Human at a maximum Thus even if Deku wer to atk an Off guard Goku Deku would most likely end up hurting himself rather than hurting Goku at all LET ALONE if we were to use Current Goku who even when Beaten down to the point he passes out has a Body guard that won't let him be killed by an attacker as shown Below. .. This is SUSUANOO GOKU who at all times after his creation in the Moro-Arc keeps Goku protected from Lethal atks when Goku himself is unable. This Susuanoo Goku is capable of everything Goku himself can do but on a much higher & larger scale as he has the capability to Increase his size on a whim to how ever Small or Large he wishes the full extents of said sizes are unknown but we do know they can be quite drastic as will be shown below the current image. .. As you can observe below Susuanoo Goku goes from being Slightly smaller than PLANET Moro (who at this point is roughly the size of mountains and is slowly increasing in size) to Dwarfing him and the surrounding mountains entirely. VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVVV So on closing as u can see above not only would Current Off Guard or even a Nearly Dead Knockedout Goku be entirely Unaffected by a Blow from Deku, Deku would also be nothing more than a red Mist left over after a ki blast from either an Off guard but very much still Alive Goku, or Vaporized by the Goku Susuanoo who is protecting a near flatlined Goku.

You should be more concerned with the kids that ride in those shopping carts than a small dog riding it it. As long as the dogs don’t urinate or defecate in the cart or store, they aren’t any more unsanitary than the people mulling around the store.

The choice primarily depends on factors such as scalability, complexity, time-to-market, and your familiarity with the technologies involved. Let's explore some popular options to help you make an informed decision. Node.js with Express: Node.js is a popular JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, and Express is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. This combination allows you to build the backend using JavaScript, providing a seamless development experience for React Native developers. It offers a vast ecosystem of libraries, easy integration with databases like MongoDB or MySQL, and great scalability. If you are already comfortable with JavaScript, using Node.js with Express can be a solid choice.Firebase: Firebase is a comprehensive backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform offered by Google. It provides various services like authentication, real-time database, cloud functions, cloud storage, and more, all integrated into a single platform. Firebase simplifies backend development by handling server management, scalability, and security for you. It has excellent support for React Native, making it a convenient choice, especially for smaller projects or prototypes.Django: Django is a powerful and high-level Python web framework known for its simplicity and robustness. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and offers features like an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer, built-in authentication, and a powerful admin interface. Django is well-suited for building complex and data-intensive applications. If you are comfortable with Python and require advanced functionality, Django can be an excellent backend choice for your React Native app.Ruby on Rails: Ruby on Rails (Rails) is a popular MVC framework written in Ruby. It emphasizes convention over configuration, enabling developers to focus on building the application rather than managing configurations. Rails provides many useful gems (libraries) and follows best practices, making it a great choice for building robust and scalable backends. If you have experience with Ruby or prefer its elegant syntax, Rails can be a solid backend option.GraphQL: GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs. It allows clients to request specific data and avoids over-fetching or under-fetching, providing flexibility and efficiency. You can use GraphQL with various backend technologies, including Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, or even as a standalone server. GraphQL is particularly useful if you have complex data requirements or plan to consume multiple APIs in your React Native application. #appsdevpro #reactnativeapp"},{"instruction":"w much will liposuction cost in India?","output":"No matter how much you diet or exercise, there are those stubborn body areas left with unshakable pockets of excess fat that just won’t shift.

Most people will be familiar with the Sword in the Stone and the Quest for the Holy Grail, but there’s way more beyond that. My favourite is Gawain and the Green Knight. ** There are many different adaptations to this story. This is the one I tell my kids, as it was passed down to me. I know it varies from the original prose version in some details, but the basic thrust of the story is the same. ** Gawain a proud and brave knight wants to join Arthur’s Court at Camelot. When a mysterious giant knight in green comes to Camelot and challenges anyone to a contest, Gawain willingly steps forward, keen to show Arthur how brave he is. The knight says that Gawain can have a free swing at him. But once he’s done, the knight can reciprocate. Gawain accepts the challenge. Gawain chops the knight’s head off in one powerful swing, much to the crowd’s delight. But then the knight’s headless body gets back up, finds its head, and pops it back on. Everyone is stunned… including Gawain. The knight then says that rather than take his swing there and then, Gawain should meet him, in exactly one year, at the abandoned green chapel in the old forest. Once there, the knight will have his turn. He then leaves. For the next year, everyone tries to convince Gawain not to willingly go to what would be almost certain death. But Gawain was not a coward; plus he was proud and had given his word and wanted to show everyone that a knight’s word was his bond. A week or two before the date, Gawain sets off to find the chapel. Upon riding through the forest, he comes across a castle. The lord and lady of the castle welcome Gawain as a guest. Gawain explains his quest and the lord tells him that the abandoned chapel is very close, and he was welcome to wait for his remaining few days with them. After a bit of food and wine, the lord requests to play a game with Gawain. He would go out hunting, and whatever he catches he would give to Gawain. But in return, whatever Gawain collects during his day he has to give to the Lord. Gawain is puzzled at this odd game but cordially agrees. On the first day, the lord goes out hunting, and the lady of the house comes to Gawain’s bedroom and tries to seduce him. He rebuffs her, and she gives him a kiss on the cheek. Later that day the lord returns with a deer. He gives it to Gawain and in return, Gawain kisses him on the cheek. The lord is angry, eyeing his servants suspiciously, but Gawain says nothing, having not agreed to tell the lord where he collected his gift. The second day is the same. Once again, Gawain spurns the advances of the lady of the house, but this time, she gives him two kisses on the cheek. Once again, Gawain passes the kisses on to the lord, much to his consternation. The third day was Gawain’s last day before his showdown with the green knight. The lady comes to his chambers and pleads with him to lie with her. Gawain is tempted… she is beautiful and it is his last night on Earth after all, but his honour prevents him from agreeing. The lady sighs in resignation, gives him three kisses, but then hands him a green garter which she explains is a precious magical relic which is imbued with a powerful protective charm and it may help Gawain survive his encounter with the knight. Gawain reluctantly accepts the gift. When the lord returns, Gawain gives him three kisses. When the lord asks if there was anything else he had to give, Gawain hesitates… feeling the garter tucked away under his clothing, but says “no”. Gawain figures that giving such a powerful artefact away in a frivolous game was pointless when it could save his life. The lord nods and they feast on the food he had caught. The next day, he bids farewell to the lord and lady and heads off to the chapel to face his destiny. After a while, he finds the chapel, and in a clearing out front is the green knight, sharpening his axe. He regards Gawain and then nods in acknowledgement. Gawain offers himself to the knight, who - without ceremony - swings his axe at Gawain’s neck. Gawain recoils in fear, and the green knight laughs heartily and mocks him for it. Embarrassed at his display of fear, Gawain recovers and offers himself once more. Again, the knight swings, but stops just short of his neck. Gawain does not even flinch; the knight regards him and gives him a bow of respect. Gawain is angry at the knight’s games and demands he just gets on with it and land his blow. The third time the knight does connect, making a painful but superficial and certainly not fatal cut. He then puts his axe down and laughs. Gawain, stunned at being hurt but otherwise alive, demands to know what is going on. The knight then removes his helmet to reveal he is, in fact, the lord of the castle he had been staying in. The knight then explains that he had been put up to the task by Merlin to test Gawain’s bravery, strength and honour and that he had passed and would make a fine knight of Camelot. When Gawain asked why the knight had injured him anyway, he explained it was punishment for lying about the garter. The lady of the house had been in on it too. Gawain was dejected at having his deceit revealed. He returns to Camelot to face Arthur, to whom he explains that he’s not worthy to be a Knight of the Round Table on account of his deception. Arthur laughs and explains that Gawain was probably the bravest knight he had ever seen; travelling willingly into certain death simply to uphold a vow. His one lapse in judgement was a lesson that they could all learn from. Arthur decided that all knights should, from that day forward, wear a green sash as a reminder of the need for honesty. Gawain was added to the Round Table and became one of Arthur’s most famous knights."},{"instruction":"f you were 80 and you had the option to become 30 again, would you do it?","output":"Am I going back in time or is my body just youthful again?"},{"instruction":"What exercise can lose face fat?","output":"Reducing face fat requires an overall approach to weight loss, as spot reduction of fat is not possible.

These are just a few of the common breakfast foods in the United States. There is a wide variety of other foods that may be eaten for breakfast, depending on the region or culture. For instance, in the southern United States, biscuits and gravy are a popular breakfast food, while in the Southwest, breakfast burritos are a popular choice. Breakfast tacos, chilaquiles, huevos rancheros, breakfast sandwiches, breakfast pizza, breakfast casseroles, and breakfast skillets are all popular breakfast items in the United States. Breakfast is an important meal of the day, and the foods eaten for breakfast vary greatly from culture to culture. In the United States, eggs, bacon, sausage, oatmeal, pancakes, waffles, cereal, muffins, toast, yogurt, fruit, smoothies, granola bars, and juice are all popular breakfast foods.

However, as a solution to one of the simplest possible quadratic equations, the Golden Ratio appears in unexpected places. One of the most exotic is the appearance of the Golden Ratio as the probability of spontaneous uninformed choice between two alternatives, say in referenda. In 1990, I came to the office of Vladimir Lefebvre, a Russian philosopher who emigrated to the USA and worked at University of California at Irvine. He immediately tasked me with sorting 100 almost identical and meaningless objects: small transparent plastic bags with two red beans in each of them, into two groups, the ones I liked and the ones I did not. I liked exactly 62 bags. 0.62 is a good approximation of the inverse of the Golden Ratio. Lefebvre had a theory behind bizarre appearances of 0.62 everywhere, he called the phenomenon \\"fast reflection\\". This is a very crude explanation: when making an impulsive choice between two options (with one slightly more preferable, but for unknown and not explicated reason), a person picks the \\"good\\" option with probability [math]p[/math], subconsciously reflects on his choice and changes it *with the same probability* (and this is the key assumption borrowed, I understand, from intentionalist philosophy and Uznadze's school of psychology (\\"set theory\\", where \\"set\\" = установка, ustanovka): intensity of intention in making a choice and in changing it on impulse, without reasoning, is the same). Hence \\"bad\\" choice is made with probability [math] p^2.[/math] But this is the complimentary probability to making \\"good\\" choice, hence equals [math]1-p[/math], and we get a quadratic equation [math]p^2 = 1 - p[/math], with a root equal to the inverse of the Golden Ratio. Therefore the Golden Ratio is deeply imprinted on human psychology and affects our vision of the world. This is why we find it everywhere. On of the most bizarre examples is this one: A fight in the Ukrainian Parliament serendipitously fits into the classical “golden spiral” composition. Caravaggio would be envious."},{"instruction":"Was Elvis Presley merely the first white musician to offer rock music to the masses, having borrowed heavily from what was already widespread within black culture?","output":"The answer is “Yes, but…” There WERE a lot of white artists in the Fifties who merely did inferior versions of songs already popularized by black artists. Pat Boone was one of those. But Elvis was a lot more than MERELY a copycat. He merged many styles of music and MANY different influences into something his own. Did he imitate many black gospel singers? Heck yes! He’d grown up going to black Pentecostal churches, and that music made a lasting mark on him. He was influenced by blues men like Arthur Crudup and rockers like Chuck Berry. But he was also influenced by bluegrass artists like Bill Monroe and mainstream crooners like Dean Martin. It’s a damn shame that great black artists of the Fifties couldn’t get the radio airplay, exposure, and acclaim given to Elvis. But Elvis was an innovator in his own right, NOT just an imitator. I can’t find the link, but I saw a quote from Jackie Wilson that said, essentially, black musicians copied Elvis at least as much as he copied them."},{"instruction":"People say that I shouldn't give Parle G to stray dogs.

AngularJS is the original version of Angular and is based on JavaScript. It uses a two-way data binding system that synchronizes the model and the view efficiently. However, AngularJS is no longer actively maintained and is not as powerful as Angular.On the other hand, Angular is a complete rewrite of AngularJS and is based on TypeScript, the core of JavaScript. TypeScript adds several features to JavaScript, such as strong typing and user interfaces, making it easier to write and maintain large applications. Angular also uses a more robust change detection system, resulting in faster performance. In conclusion, while AngularJS was a pioneering framework at the time, Angular is a more advanced and robust framework that offers significant improvements in performance, maintainability, and scalability."},{"instruction":"What is the weirdest object you've ever found?","output":"Once, while at the beach with my youngest daughter, she picked something up in the distance and turned toward me to show me what she’d found. It looked like a dead American lobster (Homarus Americanus), a species seldom found in North Carolina waters. But, on closer examination, however, I could readily see that it was not a small lobster at all, but a giant shrimp, about 10 inches long. I thought nothing of it at the time, but my daughter carried it all the way home and put it in a small aquarium she had in her room. Later, she went to work investigating her find. She actually made several trips to the Kill Devil Hills Library some 27 miles away to borrow books on sea creatures. And, in a week or ten days, she handed me a typed, 5 page research paper on the specimen she had found. Her final document was entitled “The Mantis Shrimp,” and it proved to be more than interesting to me. There were some purely informative details, such as: Latin labels, including Kingdom, Animalia; Phylum, Arthropoda; Subphylum, Crustacea; Class, Malacostraca; Subclass, Hoplocarida; and Order, Stomatopoda; and that only about 50 species of the shrimp are known from fossil records, the earliest being from the Lower Jurassic or Cretaceous periods, or about 140 million years old. Of particular interest to my daughter were the facts that: the Mantis shrimp is monogamous and remains with its partner for up to 20 years; they share the same burrow and coordinate their activities; and that in some species both sexes take care of the eggs, while in others the female will lay two clutches of eggs, one tended by the male and the other by the female. Of particular interest to me was the fact that the largest mantis shrimp ever caught was 18 inches long, and was found in the ocean off Fort Pierce, Florida, within sight of my Spanish cannon. More importantly, the research paper detailed some remarkable data of particular interest, in the abstract, to my inventions and dream investigations. The mantis shrimp has the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom and one of the most elaborate visual systems ever discovered. Each eye possesses trinocular vision and depth perception and is so precise it can perceive both polarized light and multi-spectral images. Infrared radiation was discovered in 1800 by astronomer Sir William Herschel. The discovery of ultraviolet radiation was made in 1893 by the German physicist Victor Schumann. The first military night vision devices were being developed by AEG in 1935 and introduced by the German army as early as 1939. Everything that man can see as well as what he cannot see within the range of Infrared and ultraviolet is well within the range of the Mantis shrimp’s eye. Put simply, a shrimp can see things that a human cannot, yet what it sees that is beyond our capability to see is no less real. Equally interesting is that the mantis shrimp’s raptorial claw, which can accelerate at 23 meters per second, generating 100,400 G's of load and strike with a force of 1500 Newtons, about 1106 foot pounds, a force greater than a .45 APC bullet leaving the barrel of a 1911 Colt automatic pistol. The cumulative effect of all of this is sonoluminescence arising from acoustic cavitations – the formation, growth and implosion of small gas bubbles in a liquid blasted with sound waves above 18,000 cycles per second. The collapse of these bubbles generates intense local heating, with temperatures in excess of 35,540° F (hotter than the surface of the sun), and creates light. The cumulative effect of all this is that sometimes in striking at their own reflections in aquariums the Mantis shrimp will break the glass without even making contact with it."},{"instruction":"the claim that Palestinian ethnicity doesn't exist, and is actually a mix of different Arab nationalities (Jordanian, etc) just a false conspiracy theory?","output":"Zionist propaganda to dehumanize the Palestinians and enact genocide by omission."},{"instruction":"What will happen to a human on the Earthlike planet Tau Ceti b?","output":"Just to give a recap, Tau Ceti has five rocky planets orbiting it, some of which fell within the Goldilocks Zone. The planets seem to be earth-like in size, as they are all estimated to have a mass between 2 and 6 Earth masses. So we have small rocky planets (check), they are withing the habitable zone of their star (check) and are a comparable size to Earth (check) SETI has checked it out as these planets may contain life. The idea was to get any broadcasts eminating from Tau Ceti. Needless to say, we were disappointed. What is very important to note, is that even though these planets check a few boxes, WE KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THEM. Anybody looking at our solar system from afar would figure “ah! Look at those two big rocky planets!”, not knowing that Venus is just about the most inhospitable place in this solar system, barring the sun. Another point to make is this - you would NOT have wanted to love on this planet 3 billion years ago; Earth was not very friendly at the time. The same thing could be the case at Tau Ceti. The planets may all be in a similar state to Venus. Maybe they are geologically dead. Maybe they have no water. Maybe they have superstorms. Maybe they lack an atmosphere. Maybe the rate of rotation is so slow that one half is a hellish desert and the other side a block of ice. Maybe they get pelted with asteroids ever year. Maybe the atmosphere is highly acidic. Maybe the barometric pressure is off the scale high. Just because a planet ticks off three boxes that suggest it may be earth-like, don't forget that there are a million boxes that needed checking for us to evolve on here.

Not only giving your body relaxation, but a good mattress will also help you to correct your posture. As the pandemic period is still going on the majority of the population is still at their respective homes, therefore it is very important that give their body proper posture and relaxement. But the main concern of every individual is that how can we identify that the mattress which we are choosing for us is appropriate or not? Mentioned below are some of the parameters which might help you to find a good quality mattress and comfort your body and provide it a proper posture!- Comfort Level: Comfort is considered to be one of the most important features while selecting. Comfort comes from the size, firmness, and materials used in the mattress. If the size, firmness, or appropriate materials aren’t used in the mattress then no comfort would be experienced by the customers.Sleeping Position: Sleeping Position is also considered one of the important factors to be kept in mind while selecting the mattress. For example, side sleepers may get a night of better sleep with a plush or pillow top mattress that might support your spine’s natural curve with a firmer comfort level.Temperature: Temperature plays a significant role as heavy comforters can affect the quality of your sleep.

A trained physical therapist can make some suggestions to improve your body positions as you move through that squat and work with improving your range of motion. But here is the thing: Most likely you will not engage your back muscles equally because your back is inherently asymmetric in structure. Right now with scoliosis your spine and also your muscles have an imbalanced dynamic happening. So this is not going to be a matter of equally engaging your muscles as much as it will be a matter of working with your body assymetry. Your lower back muscles will engage differently because they are structured differently. But different is not necessarily the same as bad or wrong. It is just different. To me the bigger issue is whether or not squats will negatively impact your back, especially if you are really loading up on the amount of weights. Right now I am working with a personal gym trainer who herself has scoliosis. We are working on creating core muscle strength and correct body positioning while using weights which do not place compression on my spine. There is a ton of work with utilizing correct body positioning in weight lifting anyway and scoliosis adds just one more level to deal with. However I am not working with very heavy weights and I am also not at this point in my weight lifting program doing any squats. My body positioning is just not good enough for me to do them correctly at this point. However, I am actively working on that and within 6 to 8 weeks hope to be doing squats. I would caution on placing your body in any weightlifting position where really heavy weights are compressing or pulling on your spine. You might still squat but perhaps with less weight, and most likely no lift and jerk stuff as that places a ton of stress on that low back area, in my opinion. It is really worth it - YOU are really worth it - to first go to an osteopathic doctor to get some x-rays and an assessment. And then connect with a quality physical therapist or trainer who has a high level of knowledge about back structure and can work with your specific scoliosis curvature and back issues in creating a tailored weight program. I have no way of assessing your specific needs, but a doctor working in tandem with and trained therapist or really highly qualified body trainer can. If you can find someone who specializes in scoliosis that would be the best as most quality physical exercise trainers have a good working knowledge of body mechanics but scoliosis has very specific dynamics. Because learning to do correct body positioning will go a long, long way to preventing injury and also preventing your scoliosis from worsening."},{"instruction":"People associated with Harvard; people who got admitted, would you say I have a good chance of getting into Harvard, considering the acceptance rate, of course.

And, all the while living with that disease, I stood by doing everything I could for our family, with our dear Bogart. Although the sickness got hold of him only in the last decade of those years, I never heard any complaint—he’d often need to fend for us because I rely on projects as a freelancer, or denial of God, or desperation, or even sign that he’s giving up or in dire pain—although he’d have great difficulty breathing when he moves or walks (his lungs have lost the ability to expand) and would call for “Mama” in his sleep, he never became mad at the world or hopeless with us. And despite our disagreements, he’d always see his friends’ back through thick and thin, never a bad word about anyone. I must admit those years weren’t easy or comfortable lives, but the Lord has made ways for us to remain steadfast despite the lack. Many were envious because we had been blessed in our own little ways, even gifted a puppy that we considered our child. He never blamed anyone or anything. And despite the dangers we’re literally surrounded with, he made me safe wherever we go and live—even in the streets for some time, under the bridge beside the wet market downtown, wherever, in Manila or Pasay or in the outskirts in Cavite here in the Philippines. More than that, wherever we go, give him a day and he’d be acquainted with everyone, our home—whether a shoebox cart or a rented room, would be everybody’s shelter and safe space. There’s so much power and strength there, here, with our Angel, and I’m learning to do as well since Bogart followed a year or two after our Angel’s passing. And even his last breath proclaimed God and His role in our lives. He’s a blessing in disguise. He’s a blessing sent by Heavens for me to keep to and learn from. My father had been overseas most of our lives to see us through university, and Angel became the other father as I had been the other father to him and Bogart.

Basically all Koreans have them, except for a few areas in the far southern tips of Korea (however at least 98% of Koreans have them). Nearly all Mongols and Siberians have them. Japan a bit different, not as common there to have a full epicanthal fold, this is because Japan has Jomon race mixed with Korean race, the Jomon didn’t have epicanthal folds. Remember it doesn’t matter if you can see the crease on the eyelid, all an epicanthal fold, is a fold of skin towards the inner eye (like near the tear duct). Essentially the eyelid on the eye folds behind this. Here is a good example of the epicanthal fold. However a lot of other Asians (who aren’t Chinese/Korean) often don’t have epicanthal eyes. For example the below Indonesian man, his eyes are not epicanthal. In places like Japan, often a full epicanthal fold is not that common, to the degree in a Korean or Chinese. This is because Japan are a mixture of Korean and Jomon, the Jomon had an eye structure deep like Persians for example. Therefore not many Japanese have the full Korean eye, because the Jomon genes affect the eye a lot, being an opposite type eye. Japanese who are more Korean will be more epicanthal, Japanese who are more Jomon will be less epicanthal, but most Japanese are somewhere in the middle. Here is an example. When a lot of Japanese open their eye like that, it simply opens, this is because the outside area of the skin that is the epicanthal fold in Koreans, is often just a much shorter and closer piece of skin in most Japanese, and thus it never forms it’s own full blown layer in front of the eye, instead it’s just carried with the main lid as they are closely joined, simply not enough skin for a proper epicanthal fold. Therefore the Japanese lid on the eye drives the entire opening in most Japanese, thus it’s not much different than the structure of Samoan, Indonesian, Native American etc. There are some Japanese who nearly have epicanthal folds however, but they are never quite to the degree of the Korean eye. Such as the below Japanese person. That above eye is certainly somewhat epicanthal, however it’s not properly epicanthal like a Korean or Chinese however. Because it’s still forming a sharpness on the inside and you can see the tear duct easily and the eyelid is lifting the general structure, however the above could be said to be a partial epicanthal eye. I don’t know if I mentioned it before, but most Sherpa and southern Chinese actually don’t have a proper epicanthal fold. It’s really only seen in Korean, Mongolians and northern Chinese.Here is a northern Chinese woman below, another classic example of a true epicanthal fold. Her actual eyelid is hidden behind the front piece of skin, what it means is that she can open the inside eyelid as far as she wants, but it won’t move the outer separate layer of skin that is the epicanthal fold. People with epicanthal folds thus are perceived often as not showing as much facial expression, because functionally their eye cannot vary as much during their expressions. Sometimes they may even be interpreted as less friendly, because they appear more serious and emotionless to other populations, this is commonly said about Chinese and especially Koreans."},{"instruction":"Why am I not making any money on my affiliate marketing?","output":"I had an economics professor who once said “get rich” schemes don’t work because as more and more people participate in the scheme the original opportunity no longer exists. The same could be said for affiliate marketing. As more companies direct potential customers or visitors to third-party sites who pay per sale, cost per action, cost per click or cost per mille, the less opportunity exists to make money.

Now he is 17 and my same size so that is not needed until he has grandkids one day! The other trick was on my rare day off, I spent it with him! All day, from the toys and playing in the park to the grocery store with Mom and the other things, of course watching his favorite cartoons and kids shows and some sing-songs too. I did this at least once a week and it served us both . One day as he was getting older and had many other kid friends I competed with, he let me know that he would be OK if I skipped a Father-Son day together. But when I offered to bring him and his play pals to get ice Cream or a beach boogie boarding session or a water-park afternoon, He always jumped on that and that sort of thing was the new routine for the POP and SON days! He brought Brody with him everywhere for a week. Brody was a little stuffed bear from his classroom and all the children had Brody for a week and when they brought Brody back they supplied pictures and told of their Brody adventures. I was so blessed with such caring and inventive teachers for Wales. I used to bring these teachers gifts of silk and handmade crafts when I returned from my Thailand business trips! The Teacher is the most undervalued professional that the world has neglected!

Who's to blame?","output":"He was not clearly the best college player at the time. The person considered the most dominant college player at the time was Patrick Ewing. When Jordan’s team won the NCAA Championship, it also contained Sam Perkins, James Worthy and nine others who ended up being drafted into the NBA. Which one of these players made the team champions? Was it the combination of all of them? With Jordan but not Worthy, North Carolina did not make it to the final four. One could still make the argument that the Houston Rockets made a better choice by picking Hakeem Olajuwon. Teams do not choose in the draft based solely on who is the best player. They pick based on what player will help them win based on the team’s needs. Sam Bowie was also a big. strong player, even though he did not star in the NBA. The mistake was not picking Bowie instead of Jordan. The mistake was picking Bowie instead of Perkins or Barkley. Remember, nobody knows the future. Michael Jordan was in the league for 6 years before he won his first championship. Although people love to use hindsight, Jordan was not an obvious choice at the time. He was actually considered a little small for forward and not skilled enough to play point guard. By 1984, NBA teams hadn’t won many championships with “two forward” ball. The team that won usually had a dominant center. That made Olajuwon and Bowie the safer choices. -—\\"When I drafted him, I said, 'OK, we're gonna get a good player here,'\\" said Rod Thorn, the Nets president who was Chicago's GM when the Bulls had the No. 3 pick in 1984. \\"I thought, he'll come in and play and help us.

However, Fyre Festival turned out to be a scam, giving out 2 slices of bread and a piece of cheese for dinner instead of the promised gourmet dinners. These models are all facing legal consequences for their actions of promoting FF. They may all receive subpoenas to appear in court through their modeling agencies. On Monday, a judge allowed the companies representing the high profile models to be subpoenaed - which means they might have to reveal the payment documents made by Fyre’s organizer, Billy McFarland (who is currently in prison serving a 6-year sentence for his part in the fraud). The ruling is part of a wider investigation into how McFarland received 26 million in investor funding before the festival, 5.2 million of which was paid out to the models to participate in promotional activity, because the funds have gone “missing”. Example: Kendall Jenner made 275k in January 2017 to promote Fyre Fest on Instagram and draw attention to the artists from Kanye West's record label who were billed to appear."},{"instruction":"What industries need lead generation and marketing?","output":"Below are some of the largest lead generation niches out there, along with examples of each: Insurance.

The pork is what Texas disagreed with, not the aid. Congress filled it with a wish list of unrelated items, and Texas called them out on it. Wouldn’t it be wonderful to hold congress accountable to only attach related items to bills! It will never happen though. Pelosi is all time queen of pandering. That is why 5k page bills (that no one has time to read before it’s voted on) get pushed through congress with little outrage….for instance, they throw the public a 600 covid emergency bone, so society ignores literally billions in unrelated mismanaged funds, and demands it to pass…but the REAL money went to pet projects and foreign aid.

When people say the government “bailed out” a business, they really mean the government bailed out its creditors. A business that gets in trouble files for bankruptcy and continues operating. Its investors take a loss, but it doesn’t matter for the business itself. When the government bailed out AIG in the financial crisis, it really bailed out Goldman Sachs and all the other companies that had lent money to AIG. When the government bailed out the auto companies the same year, it really bailed out their unions who had invested heavily in the companies. Everyone who hasn’t lent money to a creditor of a troubled business hates bailouts—liberals, conservatives, economists—and politicians constantly decry them and promise this is a one-time emergency action that will never be repeated. But Wall Street banks and unions are big political donors with the clout to get money from the government. Bailouts for individuals are more popular, as long as they go to people who are genuinely needy or deserving. We have many programs for forgiving student loan debt to people who got worthless education, or were lied to, or who don’t make much money, or who take public service jobs, or qualify in other ways. What outrages some people is extending student loan relief to people who qualify for none of these programs—who got valuable degrees, who accepted honest loans for good value, who make good money and chose not to teach or serve in the military or otherwise accept public employment. Similarly during the 2008 financial crisis, there was widespread support for helping home buyers who were coerced or defrauded or who were honest and needy. But the Tea Party formed out of resentment against proposals for mass forgiveness (which eventually foundered on administrative issues rather than political opposition)."},{"instruction":"Why did Florence, Italy become the center of the Renaissance?","output":"Florence is often named by experts as the birthplace of the Renaissance and there is widespread agreement or consensus about that.

In the south of England we have Jellied eels, which are eels chopped up and boiled and the gelatin in them sets into a clear jelly. We also like whelks which are large sea snails. Blood sausage, oxtail, ox tongue, pigs feet and very many regional dishes unique to various counties."},{"instruction":"Some people argue that developers should not be involved in testing their own codes but that all testing should be the responsibility of a separate team. Give arguments for and against testing by the developers themselves?","output":"\\"After each bug fix, you need to run the entire set of test cases against which the system was tested before.\\" Below I will provide a list of tests that, in my humble opinion, should be written by developers. Not an automation tester. These guys complement the test environment with other outlandish beasts such as scalability testing, load testing, stress testing, more detailed functional and e2e testing, etc. Lists of test cases grouped by projects and groups/features could be stored in TestCaseLab. Unit test, Block test, Component test A unit test is used to test one logical and isolated unit of a system. Most often it is a class method or a simple function (although I assume the whole class as well). Isolation of the unit under test is achieved with Stubs, Dummies and Mockups. System test, Service test This is a comprehensive test that tests a bunch of several components at once. In this case, the system is perceived as a black box. We can say that this is a unit test, where a module is a bundle of components. The bundle is united by a kind of facade that provides the appropriate API for it. Integration test, Contract test, API driven test This is actually a kind of system test. This term is often used to refer to tests that directly cover the public API of the service. The focus is on checking the interaction of different systems on a service-client basis. Those. for example, the Data Access Layer methods are covered by system tests. Controller methods that call functions to calculate useful information for the business (Business Layer) are also covered by system tests. Functional test (Functional or End-to-End test, GUI test, Walk-Through test) A test designed to completely emulate the behavior of the end user of the system. In fact, you have to write a robot that will use your system in a test environment. More often this term is used in relation to the GUI, i.e. interaction of the user and the graphical interface of the system. One of the most popular templates that makes it easier to write such tests is the Page Object (Screen Object). Snapshot test A snapshot is a kind of test that sits somewhere between an integration test and a functional test. Most often, these tests are typical for the user interface and its components, as they check the visual component. Although, such tests can be applied to other parts of the system, for example, checking database dumps or code conversion results. The essence of the test is very simple, with the help of a specialized tool, we create a reference snapshot of any UI component or page - this is, in fact, the result of rendering. In tests, we mount a UI component with certain inputs and, on each new launch, create a new snapshot. Next, we compare the reference snapshot and the one generated during the test run. Health check (Smoke test, Sanity check) This is a special case of an integration test. Usually these are very small tests that are run before starting the system to make sure that the third-party software is working, which is necessary for the correct functioning of our system. In case of failure of such tests, we can notify the user about the problem or even stop the system from starting. Learning test This is a kind of integration tests that are written by the client developer (integrator) as part of the process of learning the system with which he will later have to integrate. Kent Becks and Robert Martin briefly mention this type of test in their books TDD: by Example and Clean Code, respectively. Regression test This can be any kind of test described above that is written after the problem has been identified. The test should emulate exactly the steps to reproduce the problem. Having such a test after fixing the problem guarantees that the exact same bug will no longer appear in the system. Acceptance test, Story test This can be any type of test described above. The basic idea is that one such test corresponds to a specific user story. Those. a positive result of acceptance tests is a guarantee that you have implemented the functionality exactly the way the customer wanted it. Vulnerability test (Penetration test, Pentest) Checking the system for various vulnerabilities. A good example would be tests that check the escaping of SQL commands (injection protection), data accessibility and authorization with an expired token, etc. The difficulty in writing such tests is taking into account all the bottlenecks. Usually, public information about known vulnerabilities and exploits of the platform used is used for this. Fuzzing test (Fuzztest, Random test) More often a type of system test or vulnerability check. The idea is to feed a random, deliberately incorrect, or unexpected input data stream to the input of the system. The purpose of such a test is to try to detect violations of the validation and verification logic, application logic in edge cases, sudden server crashes, attempts to detect memory leaks or information leaks about the internal device of the system through raw error messages (stacktrace) P.S. What types of tests do you use?"},{"instruction":"w make money with affiliate marketing?","output":"Here are some tips on how to start making money online with affiliate marketing:Find a niche: The first step is to find a niche that you are passionate about and that you have some knowledge about.

Unfortunately It does not help in prevention. Early diagnosis may not save lives, prevention does (one of the points I emphasise a lot on my talks)It does not help in avoiding recurrence.It has a lot of side effects and often the patient succumbs to the treatment or its side effects. The quality of life is also deteriorated.There is no diagnosis yet to predict whether a person will get cancer or not. And if a person is likely to get cancer because of various reasons like genetics (as they say, but not true), history, cancer markers etc, even in such cases where in the body will come cannot be predicted by any diagnosis. Even after spending billions of dollars and lifetimes of really dedicated and brilliant minds over so many decades, science has not been able to get answers as to Why a person gets cancer?Cancer is taken as a genetic disease but we have not been able to identify any one specific genes or a set of genes which definitely causes cancer. There is no improvement in the treatment of Last stage cancer patients. Sadly. Even after so many decades of research. There is no research being done dedicatedly on the impact of diet and lifestyle on cancer which are the most potent causes and treatment in the growth and remission of cancer. [LINKED_TEXT: To Restrict the Growth of Cancer and Convert it into a Cancer without Disease or Remission by Changing Dietary Patterns] [URL: https://www.omicsonline.org/open-access/to-restrict-the-growth-of-cancer-and-convert-it-into-a-cancer-1948-5956.1000320.php?aid=39072] A case study that we published of remission of Last stage cancer patient by diet and lifestyle. (primary cervical cancer) I have seen many cases of remission of Last stage Cancers including Cancers of liver (hepatocellular carcinoma), Glioblastoma (brain tumor), Cervical Cancer and many more getting into remission by diet and lifestyle. In my experience of treating cancer patients in the last decade in over 26 countries, I can confidently say that to avoid recurrence of cancer, prevent cancer and also put cancer into remission diet and lifestyle is the key. In many cases I do support Chemotherapy and other treatments. Also including non conventional treatments like ayurveda, herbal treatment, homeopathy, unani, yoga, meditation, etc. For reasons: A person needs to eat food anyways.May well eat food that is healthy and may help you eliminate and prevent cancerSometimes the diet and lifestyle when starts putting cancer in remission (killing cancer cells), even then it takes a long time. Agents like Chemotherapy speeds up the process and the person can be free of cancer quicker.Diet and lifestyle reduces the side effects of Chemotherapy and that helps the person tolerate it better. Only certain cases like liver cancer in my humble opinion drugs and Chemotherapy should be avoided. (I am not a doctor and medically not allowed to recommend to start or stop any medication, it is a personal opinion based on past experience). Surgery is a great option. Liver is the organ with maximum functions and really vital for recovery. Sometimes the drug causes a lot of stress. Drugs processing and elimination are all taken care by the liver. In some cases even if the cancer does not grow, the liver fails at one point. So in such cases it is a better idea to avoid, reduce the dosage and frequency of the drugs including Chemotherapy. This year I am looking out for some food conferences and also international journals where I can present and publish a few case studies: Case of an old man with a liver lesion of about 13 cm. The total size of the liver is 15 cm. With only diet and lifestyle changes we were able to reduce the size of the lesion to 7cms as per the last reports.Case of another man in his fifties who was diagnosed with Glioblastoma a brain tumor and also the deadliest form of cancer mankind has ever known. The median survival rate of 12 months meaning more than 50% people die within 12 months of diagnosis. 5 year survival rate is less than 5%. After surgery the tumor was still remaining and doctors gave 2 weeks to 2 months of survival. After over 2 years now, the person is completely free of tumor. Diet and lifestyle are very powerful and important aspects of cancer treatment. So to answer your question, to avoid recurrence of cancer: Change your diet and lifestyle.The internal environment of the body dictates the outcome of the cells. Whether it will grow as cancer or normal cells.It is not genetic in most cases. (I have dual degrees one in Dietetics and the other in biotechnology). I under nutrition and genetics very well.Mental calmness and happiness plays a vital role as negative emotions consume a lot of energy. Basically most Cancers differ from normal cells in the way they produce energy. laugh a lot.

But it seems to me unless and until you have a “sighting” of the cat, you can’t really put all the pieces together and know for certain.

[LINKED_TEXT: Gun Facts | Second Amendment, Origins and Court Rulings] [URL: http://www.gunfacts.info/gun-control-myths/second-amendment/] It is worth noting the several states had “keep and bear arms” clauses in their Constitutions before the U.S. Constitution, much less the national Bill of Rights was ratified. It is also worth noting that it was mainly northern states that had these clauses (Pennsylvania, Vermont and Massachusetts on the short list). Northern states were also vocal, through their representatives in the new Congress, to add a “keep and bear arms” clause to the Bill of Rights (New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island). Why were the Northern states leading the way with both RKBA clauses and petitions for a national version? Because they encountered the most denial of arms abuses by the British during the war and fought some of the bloodiest battles in the revolution. All this doesn’t even touch on the tricky bit — namely how the “anti-federalists” wanted strict protection of states rights, which meant having the means to fight the federal government. That meant they needed protection for arms and local militias."},{"instruction":"Why do cats abandon their owners?","output":"I don't know, I have never had that happen"},{"instruction":"What’s the most important thing to know when you want to learn how to use a ham radio?","output":"That location and the antenna is 98% of everything.

One of the biggest airlines in Europe, Lufthansa offers a variety of locations and practical travel schedules. They are a well-liked option for both business and leisure travelers due to their reputation for punctuality and efficiency.

While each warrior had their own unique abilities and contributions, there are a few notable figures who are often considered as some of the most powerful warriors: Bhishma: Bhishma, also known as Bhishma Pitamah, was considered one of the greatest warriors in the Mahabharata. He possessed immense skill, experience, and physical strength. Blessed with the power to choose the time of his death, Bhishma fought on the side of the Kauravas and played a pivotal role in the Kurukshetra war.Arjuna: Arjuna, the third Pandava prince and the central character of the Bhagavad Gita, was known for his exceptional archery skills and combat abilities. He was a highly skilled warrior, guided by Lord Krishna. Arjuna's proficiency with various weapons and his unwavering focus in battle made him a formidable opponent.Karna: Karna, though initially fighting for the Kauravas, possessed extraordinary martial skills and was often considered a rival to Arjuna. Gifted with divine weapons and immeasurable strength, Karna was known for his valor and unwavering loyalty. His skills in archery, chariot warfare, and hand-to-hand combat were formidable.Dronacharya: Dronacharya, the royal guru of the Kuru princes, was renowned for his martial expertise. He was an exceptional archer and skilled in various forms of combat. Dronacharya's knowledge of military strategies and his ability to train warriors made him a significant force in the war. It is important to note that the Mahabharata is replete with numerous heroic characters, each possessing their own unique strengths and abilities. The power dynamics and individual achievements of these warriors are a subject of much debate and interpretation. Therefore, determining a single \\"most powerful\\" warrior becomes subjective, as different warriors excelled in different aspects of warfare and displayed their might in various ways."},{"instruction":"What's it like to have a 150 IQ? Is life easier? What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","output":"One of the traits you will find when a person reaches the 150+ range (1/2,000) is their ability to pick up unfamiliar concepts very quickly. Processing speed is much high than moderately intelligent folks. Personally, I have little patience for people who have lower IQs. How much of that is IQ related, I honestly don’t know. Funny thing is there is literally a surplus of people with IQs 150+ searching for certain types of employment: academic positions, strategy consulting, hedge fund analysts. IQ alone won’t get you very far."},{"instruction":"it true that there are no French children who are picky eaters?","output":"Like everyone else, I'll say: that sounds BS. Of course kids are picky. However, from my experience (and I traveled a lot), the variety of food is larger in France than in many places. Even if we were to stick to French food (and we don't), that would be very variable, as every region, town, village has its own special kind of tomato, cheese, cold meat product (saucisson, etc.) and/or bread. That helps to keep open-minded about food. Indeed, everyone in the household eats at the same time, and eats the same thing. That is very important. Typically, no eating in the sofa, either ; everyone comes to sit at the table. Times are changing I'm told, but on this, not much. Also, like in a number of countries, most parents are adamant about one thing: you might not like it, but you WILL try it. And perhaps again next week or month to see if you changed your mind (kids tastes do change overtime). Again, like in a number of countries, we hate wasting food. It has to do with those \\"times when people didn't have much food\\" which aren't so long ago (my grandparents lived through some) and respecting the cook \\"who spent lots of time and efforts cooking for you\\". So this ends up like this: either your parents don't give you much of that food that you might not like, or like in my family's case, you WILL finish your plate. And you'll sit at the table until that prophecy becomes truth. There is also the alternative route of parents finishing the kid's plate, which I take with my kids if they made a decent effort of trying (and if I'm not sure they'll like it, I don't put much to start with). I'm nowhere as strict as my parents for most things about my kids. But trying the food is a rule I kept. I have to admit though, my parents education ensured one thing: I eat everything that comes in my plate. I might not like it (some exotic dishes are just ...), but I'll do my best to be polite and respect the cook. As a whole I'd say, it depends on how conservative/strict families are, and the way the problem is handled, but in the end, there will always be picky eaters, because not everyone can like everything."},{"instruction":"Was Arnab Goswami more deserving than Ravish Kumar for the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 2019?

These so called journalists and anchors are master presenter of Raag Darabari. These sycophants are degrading the journalism with all their might. These are not on knees but are prostrating before the government. Such type of media is harmful for the citizens of a nation. Ravish Kumar is doing what a journalist should do. Journalist should do a ground homework and a good research before doing a programme on a subject. If ‘ A’ says economy is in danger and' B’ is saying that economy is growing rapidly, then instead of arranging an unconcluding cockfight in the studio ,anchor should have to present the actual economic condition of the nation. A real journalist is not bound to befool the nation by putting words of ruling party in his mouth and pushing into the ears of citizens. If it not the duty of journalism then who will stand with the citizens to know the truth. Ravish Kumar and many like him still doing their duty without careing of their trolls.

These people get readymade material and thoughts to copy paste any where on any platform and even in public toilet. Kiran Bedi got this RM award , RM award is nationalist because she joined BJP and she is nationalist. Kejriwal got this award before Anna Andolan then RM award was nationalist now Kejriwal is against BJP hence RM award is also anti national. RM award of Ravish Kumar is also anti India and intonational. Because Ravish kumar is not ready to be an official singer of Rag Darbari. He educates citizen and awakes (तेरी गठरी में लागा चोर मुसाफिर जाग जरा)informs them what people should know and asks pertinent questions from a democratic government. Hence he is an anti national,leftist,financed by Pakistan and Ford Foundation to destabilise India. Where stands this Godi Media?

Your pre and post-training diet should be designed based on your training duration & training intensity. So, it’s a bit tough for me to give you the exact answer without knowing your body and your training type. During training, your body needs more energy than usual, and carb is the only source to provide instant energy after ATP-CP. Carbohydrate is the primary macronutrient to keep you going. Pre-training snacks should always contain carbohydrates and TRY TO HAVE SNACK NOT A MEAL half an hour before training; otherwise, you can have tummy troubles, and it will disturb your performance.

I sometimes won't eat because I'm afraid I'll get into trouble. I'm scared to set schedules or hang out with people. I feel I'll inconvenience my parents and that I'll get in trouble if I make plans. I hide my phone, never leave it open or unattended. I make sure they don't see me put in my password. I don't trust people. Everything sounds backhanded or aggressive.

Listening to 60s pop/rock I'm impressed by how many instruments seem to fit into the mix compared to when I use synths in a DAW.","output":"Has nothing to do with acoustic vs. synth. It has to do with survivor bias and chops. Music from that era had the best engineers and producers ever. There will probably never be any as good as that cohort again. These albums were very, very expensively engineered and produced by the top people available because recording cost a whole lot of money. Also, survivorship bias. The stuff you’re still listening to from that era is, for the most part, the cream of the crop from that time. Abbey Road, Motown, Elektra/Asylum, Mussel Shoals, Capitol Records and so on had very good equipment and fantastic studios. Believe me, there were tons of crappy-sounding records in the old days. Not everyone was as good as the Beatles or Frank Sinatra,and not everyone could afford to record at The Record Plant. You just don’t hear those anymore because they suck.

One of those days (I can’t remember) I was sitting in my room, as usual, writing or playing 1-person games. I overheard another patient in her room having a mental breakdown. Somebody came to visit her (I think it was her mom??). I remember her saying “I don’t like it here, please get me out of here!” and saying more stuff like “please! I just wanna go home!” and just overall having a severe panic attack. I never saw anything, but I think my door was open (if I were to have heard anything), and this was based on my hearing. It sounded like either her stay was causing the panic attack (cuz I know some people don’t like certain settings, ig) or else it was something in her outside life that needed to be solved and she was locked inpatient in prevention from solving that problem, idk. But one thing that was crystal clear to me was that whatever she was dealing with was a pretty bad nightmare come true. And as all that was going on I stayed silent, but felt so extremely bad for her, and wanted to step in and do at least something, even if it was the least I could do. I remember she was like, hyperventilating and crying and raising her voice and sounding too damn miserable. Whatever it was must’ve definitely been undoubtedly scary. But despite this girl’s pleas and cries and obvious signs of distress, I heard that visitor of hers saying “well I can’t help you. I have to go.” and she got even more distressed after those words were said, being like please, don’t go, as in don’t leave me stranded here in some dangerous situation. So that visitor left and she went really outta control. But, stayed in her room, so no “measures”/”procedures,”/”protocols”, etc. were taken, as it wasn’t bothering the others. I just couldn’t stress how bad I felt for that poor girl.

When I'm feeling down or stressed, I remind myself that I'm human and that I'm allowed to make mistakes. I also remind myself that I'm not alone, and that there are people who love and support me. Being kind to myself has helped me to: Improve my self-esteem. When I'm kind to myself, I start to believe that I'm worthy of love and respect.Reduce stress. When I'm kind to myself, I'm less likely to beat myself up over mistakes. This helps me to relax and focus on the positive.Be more productive. When I'm kind to myself, I'm more likely to take care of myself physically and mentally. This helps me to have more energy and focus. If you're struggling with self-doubt or stress, I encourage you to try being kinder to yourself. It may not be easy at first, but it's worth it. Here are some specific tips for being kind to yourself: Talk to yourself the way you would talk to a friend. Would you ever tell a friend that they're stupid or worthless? Of course not! So why would you say those things to yourself?Give yourself time to heal. When you make a mistake, don't beat yourself up about it. Instead, learn from your mistake and move on.Do something nice for yourself every day. This could be anything from taking a bubble bath to reading a book.Surround yourself with positive people.

Being kind to yourself is a lifelong journey. But it's a journey that's worth taking. When you're kind to yourself, you'll start to see the world in a more positive light. And you'll start to feel better about yourself.

They live in the visionary landscape and dream big. They are the ones who help their companies become major players in business. Mid-level group.

He/she tells HR that the need to hire. HR recruits. They get 500 resumes. Hmm. The mid-level person cannot talk to 500 candidates. No time. HR screens the pile down to 10 resumes that list key requirements needed. The mid-level person reads the resumes and tells HR to bring in five for interviews. Mid-level screens it to two or three. Reference checks, maybe a second interview, etc. Then, mid-level hires. This is how it often works. Does it miss great candidates? Definitely. That’s why a candidate needs to think out of the box. Bottom line, NETWORK. Do things like attend socials and business meetings. Meet people. Do you have friends or family who know people?

What kind of performance/artistic side do you expect from a more mature EXO?","output":"Thanks for the question. I am not really sure but I feel like to answer this randomly. For now, I would expect a repackaged album of Obsession with a few new songs with Xiumin and Kyungsoo. Due to their enlistment, they were not in the whole Obsession era. We already saw the footage of the boys that Xiumin practiced Obsession dance with the boys. He also dressed in X-EXO and performed Obsession alone in Xiuweet Time. I would love to see Kyungsoo together with Xiumin and the members to perform some songs in Obsession. Also, due to their enlistment, they couldn't perform in EXplOration concert where few songs in Don't Mess Up My Tempo album were performed. I am very happy that Xiumin also covered a medley of Sign + Damage + Gravity. I would also love Kyungsoo to do so with all members. There is rumor that the boys have done something for their 10th anniversary which is 2022. My brain went blank when I heard of it. I don't know what kind of music I would expect. What I want is to see them perform together, no matter if it's 5,6,7,8 members. 9 will be PERFECT.

H. erectus has a more barrel-shaped ribcage, rather than the chimpanzee-like, cone-shaped ribcage of australopiths, and in general its postcranial (below the skull) skeleton differs little from our own, except that the arms are relatively longer and the bones more robust (heavier). Again, Australopithecus species vary in degree of advancement (and paleontologists disagree on whether some species, like Australopithecus/Homo sediba are advanced australopiths or primitive humans), but while they have human-looking leg bones, the pelvis is not fully modern. Most notably, of course, H. erectus has a significantly larger brain than Australopithecus; the latter’s brain is roughly gorilla-sized, whereas the former, while showing significant variation in size, overlaps the lower range of modern human brain sizes. The overall appearance of the skull is much more modern, despite the protruding face and prominent brow ridges. H. erectus also has a more human-looking jaw (more parabolic rather than the U-shape of a nonhuman ape or australopith lower jaw) and teeth. Behaviorally, australopiths used only the crudest of stone tools — either unprocessed nut-smashing rocks, as chimps also do occasionally, or perhaps crudely chipped rocks like the earliest members of Homo. H. erectus, more advanced than the earliest members of genus Homo, made fairly elegant chipped stone tools, but was very conservative in its technology, barely changing over a million years. It’s generally assumed that H. erectus was considerably smarter than australopiths but not as smart as modern humans, but there are considerable difficulties in giving IQ tests to collections of old bones."},{"instruction":"w do you get a name changed on a birth certificate?

If the wrong dad is on your birth certificate your real biological dad can adopt you and get his name on there that way but the original information will still exist in the records.

Scaffolding is a temporary structure used to support workers and materials during construction or maintenance work. It typically consists of a series of platforms, boards, and poles that are assembled to create a stable work surface at a height. [LINKED_TEXT: scaffolding queensland] [URL: https://ringally.com.au/] is designed to be easily erected and dismantled, and it is not typically designed to carry heavy loads or support structures. On the other hand, a truss or frame is a structural system that is designed to support heavy loads and provide stability. It typically consists of a series of interconnected triangles that distribute the load evenly across the structure. Trusses and frames are commonly used in the construction of buildings, bridges, and other large structures. While there may be some similarities between scaffolding and trusses/frames in terms of their construction and design, they are fundamentally different types of structures with different purposes. Therefore, scaffolding is not considered a truss/frame. Ring Ally is a reputable company that provides high-quality upright scaffolding rental services in Queensland, Australia.

At the end of 2015-16, it had the world's fourth-largest railway network, with 119,630 kilometers (74,330 miles) of total track and 92,081 kilometers (57,216 miles) of running track across a length of 66,687 kilometers (41,437 miles) and 7,216 stations. We've compiled a list of intriguing facts regarding Indian railways. Highest Rail Bridge The Chenab Bridge is a railway steel and concrete arch bridge being built between Bakkal and Kauri in Jammu and Kashmir's Reasi district. When completed, the Chenab River bridge will span the river at a height of 359 meters (1,178 feet), making it the world's highest rail bridge. The Chenab Bridge will be 35 meters taller than the Eiffel Tower. Railway Staff Indian Railways is the world's seventh-largest employer. It employs almost 1.5 million people. Route Relay Interlocking System New Delhi station holds the title of having the world's largest route relay interlocking system, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. Passenger Load Indian Railways (IR) transports more than 25 million passengers per day, which is more than the combined population of Australia, New Zealand, and Tasmania. Indian Railways transports 7.2 billion passengers annually (almost 6 times India's present population). Railway Track Indian Railways has created a track that is so large that it can rotate the earth one and a half times.

They fought like buggery to defend one of the most pivotal points of the battlefield. At the time the Guards Regts were considered the elite of the British Army (sort of like the SAS are now) and the “Red Suits” or as most people call them Parade Uniforms (Number 1 Uniform in the Army) are a proud reminder of their heritage a bit like the US Army guards at Arlington in their funny “Blue Suits, with antiquated rifles”. The funny black hats they wear are due to a Guards line regiment taking down the much vaunted Napoleon Imperial or Old Guard who never retreated never surrendered, they originally wore the Black Bear Skin and the British Guards were awarded the honour of wearing the same ever since. To sum it up the Guards are trained to the same standard as any regiment in the British Army and able to take down any threat that is presented to them with the level of violence that is appropriate to the situation in hand,"},{"instruction":"f you agree with Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan that its time to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security because the deficit has skyrocketed, what percentage of cut to each program would you support?","output":"Listen to Heather Cox Richardson on this entire position of GOP plans.
