Fifteen years before, she lobbied for a federal anti-lynching bill. But FDR refused to publicly support it because he feared losing southern votes needed for pre-war rearmament. Eleanor continued to push for the bill, drawing criticism to her husband. She recalls him saying, “Well, I can always say I can’t do anything with my wife.” She spotlighted racial discrimination when she resigned from the Daughters of the American Revolution in February 1939 for barring world-renowned Black singer Marian Anderson from performing at its Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. “You had an opportunity to lead in an enlightened way and it seems to me…your organization has failed,” Roosevelt wrote to the DAR president. Wiesen Cook, author of a three-volume biography on Roosevelt, said the hypocrisy of having a segregated U.S. military in a war against Nazis—and their brutal racial supremacy—was not lost on the first lady as she walked miles of hospital corridors on the front lines, holding up bottles of plasma for wounded soldiers. “Eleanor Roosevelt was reviled by the Dixiecrats [conservative southern democrats], by the conservatives, by members of Congress and by the press because she stood for justice and she stood for civil rights at a time when, even during World War II, the military is segregated, blood plasma is segregated, it’s segregated black and white,” said Wiesen Cook in a 2013 interview. “Everywhere she goes, she is demanding racial justice.”","output":"1948: Roosevelt wrote against segregation. 1933: Roosevelt lobbied for an anti-lynching bill. 1939: Roosevelt resigned from the Daughters of the American Revolution for their racial discrimination."},{"instruction":"Write a haiku about students waiting for the end of the school day.

Founded in 1776, the library is part of the oldest still-operating monastery in Austria and features a stunning white and gold Baroque style interior. Atop the gilded shelves and columns in the library's grand two-story interior, curved ceilings feature stunning frescoes painted by Bartolomeo Altomonte, an Austrian who was known for painting large-scale frescoes. Today, the library is home to more than 200,000 sacred texts. With its two stories of dark wood arches encompassing a collection of more than 7 million volumes, the Old Library at Trinity College, is not only one of the world's oldest libraries, but one of the most renowned. Located in the center of Dublin, the dark and hallowed halls of the Old Library were constructed in 1712. It's a key attraction for tourists, many of whom purchase advance tickets to view the Book of Kells, an illuminated vellum manuscript of the four gospels that dates back to the fourth century. Every day, a different page of the book is displayed to the public. Unlike the other libraries on our list, this one is practically new. The Tianjin Binhai Library opened to the public in 2017 and was described by Time magazine as a \\"ziggurat,\\" with its white undulating bookshelves surrounding a spherical auditorium. The 363,000 square-foot (33,700 square-meter) building was designed by Dutch firm MVRDV and can hold 1.35 million books.

Escher’s ‘Relativity’ is the gold standard for those who love art, optical illusions, and defying the laws of physics. It can even be the centerpiece of your collection if you adore a good mental workout. Let’s go on to dissect this iconic piece properly. There is, of course, masterful use of perspective––it’s definitely a metaphorical elephant in the room. It’s certainly not unusual to see a three-point perspective, but to see the vanishing points form a triangle is impressive. If you remember from early school days, you’ll know a typical formation of a three-point perspective involves two horizon vanishing points and the third being above or below. As for lines, Escher used cross-hatching to create depth and shading. Even the faceless humanoid figures look eerily real due to the expert lines. The direction of the lines is also important, as they seem to mold the structures within the piece In conclusion, M.C. Escher’s ‘Relativity’ takes us through a parallel dream world in which gravity is only a suggestion and not a law.

In 1989, a man got more than he bargained for at a flea market in Adamstown, Pennsylvania when he bought a framed painting for 4. He found a document folded up behind the painting, which experts later identified as a rare first printing of the Declaration of Independence. The document is one of about 200 copies the printer John Dunlap made after the declaration’s ratification on July 4, 1776. The ink was still wet on this copy when it was printed, an auction expert told The New York Times, evidenced by the first line of the Declaration’s text appearing in reverse at the bottom of the page. In 2000, TV producer Norman Lear bought the copy discovered at the flea market for a record 8.14 million through Sotheby’s, a global auction house.","output":"Norman Lear bought the copy of the Declaration of Independence at an auction in 2000."},{"instruction":"Write a podcast script for an elementary school that includes a school announcement, science facts, and a joke of the day.","output":"Intro You're listening to the Sunnyvale Elementary School podcast and this is Episode 10. I'm Polly and joining me today are Milford from Ms. Hager's 4th-grade class and Tisha from Mr. Bonner's 5th-grade class. Today our topics include an announcement about school lunches, some interesting facts about space and of course, our daily joke. First, Matthew, please share your important announcement. Segment 1 Thank you, Polly. This is just a reminder that every Tuesday is Don't Wrap It, Bag It Day. Please remember to bring your lunch and snacks in reusable containers or bags. The class with the most Bag It lunches will get free ice cream cups for lunch on Friday. Now, Tisha will give us a few space facts. Segment 2 The 4th graders have been learning about the solar system this week. Here are a few fun facts about the solar system: • It's really hot inside Jupiter! No one knows exactly how hot, but scientists think it could be about 43,000°F (24,000°C) near Jupiter's core. • Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, and its gravity is very weak. This means that it would not be able to hold on to its moon for very long. Any moon that Mercury did have would eventually either crash into the planet or be pulled into orbit around the Sun. • Saturn's rings are one of the most iconic features of our solar system. They are made up of billions of tiny particles of ice and rock, ranging in size from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are so thin that they are almost transparent, and they can only be seen from Earth when the sunlight hits them at just the right angle. Segment 3 Here's our joke of the day: Q: What do you call a sleeping bull? A: A bull-dozer! Outro (ending) Thanks for listening to the Sunnyvale Elementary School podcast.

The first is that My Photo Stream, the free cloud-based photo syncing feature Apple launched in 2011, is still up and running in 2023. That’s despite it being effectively superseded by iCloud Photo Library roughly eight years ago. Now that you’re up to date, the second piece of news is that My Photo Stream is shutting down in a couple of months’ time on July 26th, according to an Apple Support page spotted by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The end of My Photo Stream won’t come as too much of a surprise. Although it was free, it came with a long list of restrictions on the amount of photos you could upload, and these were only saved on Apple’s servers for 30 days. Photos saved in the cloud then had to be manually saved locally if you wanted to keep them on a secondary device and, perhaps worst of all, 9to5Mac notes that high-quality photos weren’t synced in their original resolution. iCloud’s free storage may be relatively limited at just 5GB, but at least it acts like a modern cloud storage service with photos and videos stored in their full resolution. Apple’s support page notes that new photo uploads to My Photo Stream will come to an end on June 26th, and that the feature will disappear entirely a month later. “The photos in My Photo Stream are already stored on at least one of your devices,” Apple’s page notes, “So as long as you have the device with your originals, you won’t lose any photos as part of this process.”","output":"Q: Is My Photo Stream, Apple's cloud-based photo syncing feature, still available in 2023? A: Yes, My Photo Stream is still available in 2023 despite being superseded by iCloud Photo Library. Q: When will My Photo Stream be shutting down? A: My Photo Stream is set to shut down on July 26th. Q: Is the end of My Photo Stream surprising? A: The end of My Photo Stream is not surprising because it had limitations such as restricted photo uploads, photos saved for only 30 days, and a lack of syncing high-quality photos in their original resolution. Q: How does iCloud differ from My Photo Stream? A: iCloud offers modern cloud storage with photos and videos stored in their full resolution, unlike My Photo Stream. Q: When will new photo uploads to My Photo Stream come to an end? A: New photo uploads to My Photo Stream will come to an end on June 26th. Q: Will users lose any photos when My Photo Stream shuts down? A: “The photos in My Photo Stream are already stored on at least one of your devices,” Apple’s page notes, “So as long as you have the device with your originals, you won’t lose any photos as part of this process.”"},{"instruction":"Write an instructional-style article on how to make smores at home. Make it nostalgic and descriptive. Use a numbered list to give various options for making them.","output":"S'mores are a delicious treat most often enjoyed over a summer campfire. Who doesn't remember a cool, summer evening out with friends and family enjoying a little bit of crispy, chocolatey goodness? In this article, we will explore three simple ways to bring that s'mores experience inside your home. 1. Microwaving S'mores: The microwave is the simplest and most often used method for making a homemade s'more. It is a simple process. All you need to do is put a graham cracker down on a microwave-safe plate or napkin, then top it with a piece of chocolate, and then the marshmallow. You are going to want to watch it closely depending on the power of your machine so try to do it in 15-second intervals. As soon as you see the chocolate starting to glisten and the marshmallow itself change shape it is time to take it out and use the other graham cracker to smush it down. Then it is ready to eat. 2. Air Frying S'mores: Air fryers are the new wonder machine of the modern kitchen. They can impart a toasty flavor to the graham cracker giving it a hint of campfire goodness. When you close your eyes, you can hardly tell the difference. To make a s'more in an air fryer you first put both graham crackers in the bottom of the basket. Top one of the graham crackers with a marshmallow and set your device to around 400 degrees Fahrenheit. It should take about 5 minutes for the marshmallow to brown and heat up. When it does, pull out the basket, put a chocolate bar piece on top of the marshmallow, and then complete the sandwich using the other toasted graham cracker half. Enjoy immediately. 3. Oven S'mores: Making s'mores in an oven is nearly the same as in an air fryer. Place graham cracker halves on a baking sheet, place a piece of chocolate on one and marshmallow on the other, set the oven to 400 degrees, place the sheet on top rack for a few minutes then pull it out. From here, you can put the two halves together, and now you have a delicious s'more to enjoy at any day or time. S'mores aren't just for summer; bite into one all year round!"},{"instruction":"Write an email from a travel agency informing a customer of an alteration to the customer's flight plans.","output":"Hello Johnathon, We hope this message finds you well.

In 1977, in the space of two days, three teenagers, all of whom were separate at the time of the sightings, swear they saw a creature with “large eyes that glowed and tendril fingers.” When authorities plotted the sightings on a map, the path was a straight line for two miles, but the creature was never found. That’s the only time the creature was ever spotted in Dover, Massachusetts, but those three sightings sparked legends for decades. 2. Yowie – also known as Sasquatch, Skunk Ape, Bigfoot, and Yeti (depending on where you go to hear about sightings). This large, hairy, humanoid creature has many names, and many cryptozoologists believe that there are hundreds of these creatures across the world because of the numerous locations of supposed sightings. Grainy photographs have captured massive footprints and what could be eyes in the wilderness, while other pictures show human-like figures, covered in hair, from very far away. The first-ever reported sighting of Bigfoot was in 1811 in Alberta, Canada, but Native Americans have talked of similar creatures in their stories and folklore for centuries. 3. The Jersey Devil. The folklore of The Jersey Devil spawns from a story about Mother Leeds, a New Jersey woman with twelve children. She discovered that she was pregnant with her thirteenth child and, in a fit of rage, cursed her pregnancy, offering the child to whoever listened. When the baby was born, it sprouted the features of a goat, horse, and bat all at once, then flew off into the trees. Some of The Jersey Devil's legend has been proven as fact. There was a Mother Leeds, and she left a written will to 12 children, but there’s never been documented evidence of the thirteenth child. There have been over 1,000 sightings of The Jersey Devil up until 2016, and the cryptid is often blamed for any bad luck that New Jersey farmers have with livestock and crops. 4. Champ (or Champy) Sea serpents have been the subject of cryptozoological sightings for centuries, but Champ is one of the most famous in Vermont, New York, and parts of Canada where Lake Champlain extends for 125 miles. There have been 300 sightings since 1609, but the most notable was a report in 1970 that described the creature as “a twenty-foot-long serpent, thick as a barrel, with a head like a horse.”"},{"instruction":"Please cut down this text to three sentences only, keeping only the important details.

Peas are high in protein, but it is hard to mask their taste when they are used as a meat substitute in large amounts in vegan dishes. Scientists discovered a gene for pea flavour 30 years ago. The research was stopped as there was no use for it. Now it could be the basis of a new industry. \\"The world has changed.

Don’t bog it down with science and facts, but do talk about how dangerous pesticide food is within industrial farming. Less than 300 words.","output":"Millions of Americans have restricted or completely cut out gluten from their diets. While some skip gluten because of a chosen diet, most people do so because their bodies have rejected gluten. But a Harvard study has recently released new and incredibly interesting information which states that millions of people who think they are allergic or intolerant to gluten actually have no problem with gluten at all! We’re here to tell you that if you believe your body cannot properly digest gluten, or even if your doctor diagnosed you with an allergy, it is extremely likely that you have no problem with glutenous food that contains wheat. In fact, you’re likely not allergic to wheat at all. The Harvard study found that it is actually the pesticides used on wheat that are causing millions of people to struggle with gluten digestion. That means that if you grew wheat in your yard without any pesticides, you would probably be able to eat anything you made with it without any issues at all! Now, it’s important to note that this is not the case for 100% of those Americans with gluten allergies. A select few may actually be intolerant to gluten itself; however, for millions of Americans, this could change everything. But in order for the masses to be able to enjoy glutenous products again, something needs to change in the way we allow industrial farmers to treat and grow wheat. Exactly how that will happen is still unclear. But there has certainly been a lot of talk since the study was released about exactly what these big farms are putting on our food and how it’s affecting not only what we eat but also how we feel."},{"instruction":"What should I make for dinner tonight?","output":"There are a lot of options, can you tell me what you do or don't like to eat or if you have any allergies or food aversions?"},{"instruction":"I'm lactose intolerant and I don't like broccoli or pork.","output":"That is helpful, thank you!

Students poured out of the school for the final time that day, with the teachers seeing them off as they went home. That day, Kofune walked with two of his friends. It was an ordinary day like any other. They talked about whether they would get the new game that had come out recently. As they talked, their everyday surroundings blended into the same indiscernible backdrop. As their attention shifted inward, calamity struck. A truck ran the red light at an intersection that had always been perfectly safe. Kofune was the first to see it. His body reacted before anyone else's, and he shoved his two friends out of the way of danger. He wasn't so fortunate, and the impact brought him within inches of death's door. As he lay there, the world fading, he wished he could have continued to live out his life. He regretted not being able to do the things he'd always dreamed of. Kofune woke with a start in a forest. He checked his body, but there were no injuries. He also had no idea where he was and searched his memory for clues. He remembered being struck by a truck, then he heard the voices of his friends followed by sirens. Then there was a voice of a woman who asked him what his deepest desire was. He remembered answering that he wanted the strength to live out his dreams. His wish was granted, and the next thing Kofune knew, he was waking in the forest. He looked around, but nothing was familiar. He didn't recognize the types of trees or any of the plants.

He tried as best he could to evaluate the situation in front of him with objective scrutiny; he was told by many people to \\"get rid of the dogs, they cost you too much money\\" and \\"get a job.\\" Those people were right, but Melvin's emotions and other factors played into his decision to stay at home and be a father to his four children. But on one fateful day, he decided to answer an online advertisement for writers for a new company. He knew his capabilities; he was a good typist and a decent writer. Driven by the fear of having to live another day without enough money for food for his family, Melvin applied for the job, and after being hired by the company and working there for several months, he had enough money to pay for food at the grocery store. While at the store, something caught his eye: the national 50 million lottery. Melvin decided to take a small chance and put down the 10 for the ticket, with the slimmest and most remote of hopes that he would hit it big. That hope became extraordinary joy and disbelief when his ticket was the winning ticket for the 50 million, and now he was a multimillionaire virtually overnight. However, his joy and happiness were soon replaced by feelings of emptiness and sorrow as the people around him, those he considered friends, began asking for more and more money and left when the money ran out. Melvin had spent the entire 50 million within the short span of a year, buying a house, throwing lavish parties, and blowing through the rest with reckless abandon. Melvin bought seemingly useless or meaningless items, such as a dinosaur's skull, a comic book collection, diamond-studded jewelry for his sons, and diamond-studded collars for his dogs.

I love public and historic sites and parks, as well as any buildings that are just cool to look at.","output":"- Point State Park: Point state park is one of the best in the city. It’s located where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers meet to form the Ohio River. The area played a big role in the French and Indian War in the mid-1700s, and it houses the Fort Pitt Museum and Fort Pitt Block House, as well as the Three Rivers Heritage Trail. There are tons of plaques, monuments, and markers that detail the park’s history. It’s also a great place to watch the sunset. - The Cathedral of Learning: The Cathedral is one of the most stunning landmarks in Pittsburgh. The Cathedral of Learning is a 42-story skyscraper and is home to many classrooms, libraries, a theater, and many other things. When it was built, it was the tallest building in the city, and it is still the second-tallest educational building in the world. - Old Allegheny County Jail: This prison was open for a hundred years between the late 1800s and late 1900s.

Since the Soviet army already occupied much of eastern Germany, the Soviet Union was put in charge of the northeast quadrant, which included the capital Berlin.

Often, home repairs are as simple as painting the front door or replacing the bathroom floor. Though these types of repairs can certainly work up a sweat and take up your whole weekend, they are usually pretty straightforward and don’t take a rocket scientist to complete. Occasionally though, you may be faced with repairs that are way beyond your scope of expertise. These days you can find a YouTube video that describes how to complete just about any repair imaginable. There are some areas, however, where you may find it much more beneficial (and safer) to hire a pro. All electrical work should be completed by a licensed electrician. That mindset goes for plumbing as well, except for the occasional leaky faucet or clogged drain. Rewiring or re-plumbing a whole house is not only a huge undertaking, but most cities require that this scope of work be completed by a licensed pro in accordance with city codes and permits. That way, your city can set a certain standard for the whole community so that your family can feel safe knowing that all the houses on the block had to pass inspection on their electrical wiring, plumbing, and building specifications. Do some research to find several reputable companies. It’s pretty easy to find out if an electrician, plumber, or builder has gotten bad feedback from past customers to determine if they're worth your time."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this article as if it were a news script for a news station called USN. Special counsel Jack Smith's office has obtained a recording of former President Donald Trump discussing a classified planning document that he had taken from his time at the White House, a source directly familiar with the matter told NBC News. The planning document Trump kept was related to Iran, the source said, and the former president acknowledged on the tape that it was classified. The recording was made in July 2021 during a meeting at Trump's golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, that included people who were helping former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows write his memoir, the source said. The tape was played during testimony provided to the grand jury that has been investigating Trump's handling of classified documents, the source added. The evidence appears to undercut Trump’s claim that he declassified all the government documents that came into his possession after he left the White House, and it would be important in any effort by prosecutors to prove that Trump knew he possessed classified information. News that federal officials had obtained the audio recording was first reported by CNN. NBC News has not heard the recording. The special counsel's investigation into Trump, which focuses on his alleged mishandling of more than 100 classified documents that were discovered at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last year, appears to be approaching an end. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, rebuffing allegations that he mishandled classified documents. He claimed last year that he can declassify documents “by thinking about it.” FBI agents said in a redacted affidavit last year that they found 184 unique documents that had classification markings in the 15 boxes that Trump returned to the National Archives in January. The affidavit stated that 25 documents were marked as “TOP SECRET,” 67 documents marked as “confidential” and 92 marked “secret.” That then led to the Aug. 8 search of Mar-a-Lago by FBI agents who recovered a trove of top secret and other highly classified documents, court documents unsealed by a federal judge said.","output":"(Breaking News Intro Music Plays) (Fade from Black) (Camera 1 - Close up on Susan) Susan - \\"Hello, and welcome to USN News.

It should include the symptoms and signs of a bad filling, while also urging the importance of early treatment.","output":"Dental fillings are usually made from composite resin, metallic amalgam, or a special type of gold alloy. Though some are made from special dental grade porcelain that initially looks just like real tooth enamel. They are cemented to the surrounding tooth enamel to treat a small area of tooth decay or a physical defect like a chipped tooth. While they are meant to last a long time, all dental fillings have a finite lifespan. If you struggle to maintain a good oral hygiene regimen, the demineralization effect on your tooth enamel can gradually weaken the seam between the natural tooth enamel and the dental filling material. As this continues to progress bacteria could gain increasing access to the area. As the bacteria starts to affect more and more of the tooth, you might notice discomfort or newly developed sensitivity. In some cases, you might also notice a change in surface texture or color. Without professional treatment from a dentist, the tooth could suffer from worsening complications. If you’re lucky and it’s just a small dental filling that’s just started to fail, the dentist might be able to simply replace it with a new dental filling. This usually involves removing a small amount of the surrounding tooth enamel before applying a slightly larger dental filling. If the bad dental filling is large or a new area of tooth decay has developed in the adjacent tooth enamel your dentist might recommend treating the tooth with a dental crown restoration. This will call for completely replacing the entire tooth enamel layer. Though one thing's for sure. The longer you wait to get a suspected bad filling treated, the more likely it is to fail. The more time that goes by without a dentist's attention the more likely tooth decay is to develop under the bad dental filling. In some cases, it could even allow bacteria to invade the root of the tooth causing a toothache, which might require a root canal."},{"instruction":"Home automation is all the hype these days and I am wondering if it’s a good investment.

Three obese hamsters wearing clothes and hats are sitting in a private lounge. Servants scurry through the room taking orders and attending to the guests. Low light comes from a hanging chandelier whose crystals twinkle softly as a backdrop to the hamsters' conversation. ALOICOUS It's rather hot in here, don't you think, Stevens? STEVENS Quite. Perhaps ask one of the servants to turn down the heat. PERNELLA I can't imagine what you mean. It's not hot in here at all, you two. Let the servants alone for once.

Can you provide some different methods I could try?","output":"Potty training your dog to go outside can be hard. Here are some helpful tips for you to try. 1. Outdoor Confinement: Create a small area of confinement outdoors. When your dog wakes in the morning, take them to this area of confinement and stand back. If your dog goes to the bathroom within the first ten minutes praise them. However, if they do not bring the dog back inside, keep them on a short leash under your watch. If the dog tries to go to the bathroom inside, interrupt them and take them back to the area of confinement. Slowly ween your dog out of the area of confinement once they are fully using this area within 10 minutes. 2. Bells: Hang bells on your door knob. Each time you go outside use your dog's paw to tap the bells. The idea behind this is that when the dog needs to go to the bathroom, it will tap the bells, alerting you to the fact they need to go outside. 3. Be Alert: Be alert to your dog's elimination patterns. Do they need to go to the bathroom after eating, sleeping, or playing? If there is a pattern, you can easily take your dog outside after these activities. This also includes signs your dog is exhibiting when needing to go outside to potty, such as: • Spinning in circles. • Going to areas where they have previously had accidents. • Hiding in another room, around corners, behind furniture. • Scratching or barking at the door. 4. Timer: Set a timer! Sometimes we can lose track of time if the dog is not showing signs when they need to go outside. Remember to practice patience and not give up. Your dog will start going outside to potty before you know it."},{"instruction":"What is the moral of this story? This is the story: In ancient Greek, there was a king named Midas. He had a lot of gold and everything he needed. He also had a beautiful daughter. Midas loved his gold very much, but he loved his daughter more than his riches. One day, a satyri named Silenus got drunk and passed out in Midas’ rose garden. Believing that Satyrs always bring good luck, Midas lets Silenus rest in his palace until he is sober, against the wishes of his wife and daughter. Silenus is a friend of Dionysus, the god of wine and celebration. Upon learning Midas’ kindness towards his friend, Dionysus decides to reward the keg. When asked to wish for something, Midas says “I wish everything I touch turns to gold”. Although Dionysus knew it was not a great idea, he granted Midas his wish. Happy that his wish was granted, Midas went around touching random things in the garden and his palace and turned them all into gold. He touched an apple, and it turned into a shiny gold apple. His subjects were astonished but happy to see so much gold in the palace. In his happiness, Midas went and hugged his daughter, and before he realized, he turned her into a lifeless, golden statue! Aghast, Midas ran back to the garden and called for Dionysus. He begged the god to take away his power and save his daughter. Dionysus gives Midas a solution to change everything back to how it was before the wish. Midas learned his lesson and lived the rest of his life content with what he had. Choices for the moral of the story: 1. Hug your daughter tightly, as she might turn into gold tomorrow. 2. Don't be greedy and feel content with what you have. 3. It is good to drink a lot and pass out. 4. There is no downside to being able to turn everything into gold.","output":"2.

Here is the source I used. https://www.kudos.com/blog/8-habits-of-great-bosses 2. Great Bosses Listen to Their Employees Great bosses don't just communicate clearly, they actively listen to their employees and seek their input. Then, they act on the input received as quickly as possible. By listening to your workforce and implementing their suggestions, you'll show your team that you value them and their opinions. When employees feel valued, they generally work harder and more productively and are more engaged in their jobs. It's important to remember that hearing and listening are two different things. Listening requires you to concentrate on what your employees say, rather than simply letting their voices wash over your eardrums without effect. If, after listening to your team you decide to go in a different direction, make sure to explain to your team why you made that choice. That way they always feel respected.","output":"The second habit of a great boss is actively listening to their employees.

Sasha stepped nervously onto the ship ramp with the wind threatening to whip her golden hair from its braid. She’d always known her duty as firstborn would be to serve the Kardille.

Sasha gripped the railing with a delicate amber colored hand and stepped forward. 2. Jennifer frowned as she surveyed the dishwater gray monstrosity of a building in front of her. The height of the doors was intimidating; they were designed for the tall Kardillean forms to fit through. At least she wouldn’t bump her head on any of the frames here. Jennifer was taller than most people she knew, something that had always embarrassed her, but maybe that was a good thing now that she had been called to duty as firstborn. She could never blend in with the aliens that had taken over the world and demanded the firstborn of every family in servitude against its endless war with another species that wanted to steal her planet. She did have pale, milky skin, though, closer to theirs than most of her people with their golden tans. 3. Bree really didn’t understand the point of making a firstborn walk over three miles on foot to the Kardille intake center. It was bad enough that every family had to give up their oldest kid to the aliens who had taken over their world. Why not make it just a little easier to be ripped away from everyone she loved? She pushed black hair out of her eyes and sighed as she surveyed the road. She was strong and muscular so the exercise wouldn’t kill her. The road was pretty smooth at least.

Where did she die? Jean Racine, in full Jean-Baptiste Racine, (baptized December 22, 1639, La Ferté-Milon, France—died April 21, 1699, Paris), French dramatic poet and historiographer renowned for his mastery of French classical tragedy. His reputation rests on the plays he wrote between 1664 and 1691, notably Andromaque (first performed 1667, published 1668), Britannicus (first performed 1669, published 1670), Bérénice (first performed 1670, published 1671), Bajazet (first performed and published 1672), Phèdre (first performed and published 1677), and Athalie (first performed and published 1691). Racine was born into a provincial family of minor administrators who were financially comfortable and socially ambitious. His mother died 13 months after he was born, and his father died two years later. His maternal grandparents took him in, and, when his grandmother, Marie des Moulins, became a widow, she brought Racine with her, perhaps as early as 1646, to live at the convent of Port-Royal des Champs near Paris. Since a group of devout scholars and teachers had founded a school there, Racine had the opportunity to study the classics of Latin and Greek literature with distinguished masters. The school was steeped in the austere Roman Catholic reform movement that came to be known as Jansenism, which had recently been condemned by the church as heretical. The Jansenists participated in the centuries-long debate over the primacy of free will or of divine omnipotence in the process of salvation. Inspired by the writings of Saint Augustine, as transmitted by Cornelius Otto Jansen, bishop of Ypres, in his work Augustinus (1640), the Jansenists believed that salvation was a gift—a grace—that was accorded only by God and that free will played little role in the process. For these Augustinians, life on earth was to be a rigorous pursuit of penance for original sin. Since the French monarchy suspected the Jansenists of being not only theologically but also politically subversive, Racine’s lifelong relationship with his former friends and teachers remained ambivalent, inasmuch as the artist ever sought admittance into the secular realm of court society. His former teachers remained extremely disappointed in a man who had used his excellent education as a means of succeeding in a profession that Port-Royal considered an abomination, because the theatre promoted illusion as a distraction from reflection on the wretched human condition. The degree to which his upbringing at Port-Royal inspired Racine’s tragic vision is a question unlikely to be answered with any precision, given the other influences exerted on him, such as those of Greek and Roman tragedy, the Bible, and life itself. After leaving Port-Royal in 1653, Racine transferred to the College of Beauvais for almost two years and then returned to Port-Royal in October 1655 to complete his studies in rhetoric. The school at Port-Royal was closed by the authorities in 1656, but Racine was allowed to stay on there. When he was 18, the Jansenists sent him to study law at the College of Harcourt in Paris. Racine had both the disposition and the talent to thrive in the cultural climate of Paris, where to conform and to please—in Racine’s case, to please by his pen—were indispensable assets. One of the first manifestations of Racine’s intentions was his composition of a sonnet in praise of Jules Cardinal Mazarin, the prime minister of France, for successfully concluding a peace treaty with Spain (1659). This tribute reveals Racine’s strategy of social conquest through what was to become a vocation and a mission: to be acknowledged as the greatest literary figure of his age, in effect the Euripides of classical France.","output":"Jean Racine was baptized on December 22, 1639.

The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are they doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything to put down yet, before the trial’s begun.” “They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply, “for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.” “Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the court!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking. Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell “stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice. One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate. “Herald, read the accusation!” said the King. On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:— “The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!” “Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury. “Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted. “There’s a great deal to come before that!” “Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!” The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, your Majesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.” “You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did you begin?” The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I think it was,” he said. “Fifteenth,” said the March Hare. “Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse. “Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence. “Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter. “It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter. “Stolen!” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact. “I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation; “I’ve none of my own. I’m a hatter.” Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted. “Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll have you executed on the spot.” This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.","output":"The Hatter was the first witness.

Melungeon was a derogatory word combined with the words “malungo” which means shipmate in African, and “meln jinn,” which means cursed soul in Turkish. 3. Melungeon skin tone varies from light to dark, showcasing their mixed heritage. The Melungeon people had been classified in the U.S census as “free persons of color.” 4. The Melungeon people have rich diverse cultural traditions they share in storytelling, music, and culinary practice.

A local farmer boy from a humble town in Kansas. A city slicker with something to prove from Manhattan. Both attended Oxen University in 1872 and shared their collective visions for the best donut restaurant experience in the world. What started as a shared vision between the two resulted in separation and rivalry for generations to come. Duncan P. Anderson was the founder of the popular retail donut chain, Duncan's Donuts, established in 1875. Fritz Everett was the founder of the premium donut phenomenon rival, Crispy Screams, established one year later in 1876. • Both companies are worth a whopping 220 billion each today. Their missions are both similar and simple: to create the best donut experience for the American consumer. But in their execution, they are worlds apart. • Duncan's Donuts has shifted its approach to its target market and business strategy over time. What started as a cost-effective donut factory grew into a sleek, modern fast casual donut experience that mostly caters to adults. The theme is dark and neon. They have a happy hour from 9pm to 2am. The chain is unique for its offerings of beverages and donuts together. One of its most successful products, the 'lit' donut, was created in 2008. It infuses the bitter, aromatic compounds of fermented malts, with the sweet, syrupy cake of a donut. • Crispy Screams started from day one as a family experience. Each location is both a factory and a shop, allowing consumers to watch the donuts be made fresh daily. They offer one free hot donut off the conveyer belt to every family that walks in. Crispy Screams exists as a philanthropic business that donates 50% of its after-tax earnings to local families and communities. Its mission is to raise money to unite families, especially in hardships such as abuse, separation, or disability. It has donated 725 million in its 145-year journey since 1876."},{"instruction":"I'm having an issue with my Python code. my_set = {} def add_myset(value): my_set.add(value) return my_set value = float(input(\\"Enter number value to add to set: \\")) print(add_myset(value)) So I try adding things to the set and it's returning \\"AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'add'\\".

We all know how tempting it can be to write off ex-lovers, nightmare bosses, former friends, and difficult family members by giving them an armchair diagnosis of Narcissistic Personality Disorder—but the reality of NPD is a bit more complex and nuanced than many people realize. 2. When you’ve got a difficult narcissist in your life, it can be all too easy to presume that their problematic behavior stems from an overabundance of self-love, when in fact the opposite is true; despite their bravado, people suffering from narcissistic personality disorder are actually deeply insecure. 3. It’s ironic that the myth of Narcissus—the tale that forms most people’s understanding of Narcissistic Personality Disorder—portrays the young man staring ceaselessly at his mirror image because, in real life, NPD could be explained as an inability to reflect or look inward. 4. If you have a difficult narcissistic personality in your life—or several—you may be put off by the suggestion that you see a professional therapist for your struggles since you’re not the one with a problem; but seeing as people with NPD are extremely unlikely to seek professional help or change themselves, this may actually be your best option. 5.

In a multiplayer horror game, players can play as either survivors or killers. Each online lobby includes 4 survivors and one killer. The objective of the survivors is to repair 5 generators, open the exit gates, evade the killer, and escape the map. The killer's objective is quite simply to kill the survivors. As survivors repair generators, the killer can circle around the map hunting down survivors. As a survivor, a heartbeat noise can be heard as the killer enters a nearby radius, giving the survivor a chance to hide or set up a chase with the killer. The killer has a number of abilities that enable them to better hunt down survivors before trying to get them on a sacrificial hook. One of the coolest features of Dead By Daylight is the incorporation of notable characters from popular horror franchises such as Resident Evil, Scream, and many more. Both survivors and killers can level up their characters to unlock unique perks to help improve their gameplay. With these perks, players can enable a number of interesting and unique playstyles that best suit their gameplay style.

Not in any sense of the word. But that was about to change this Saturday afternoon as she stared down the barrel of a bushel of bananas. The bananas had been sitting on her counter for over a week at this point, turning shades of green, then to yellow, and finally growing brown spots and looking a little limp. The perfect bananas to bake bread with. She had always aspired to be a baker but never had the time with her demanding career. But today was the day that would change. Tina shut off her phone and directed her attention solely to what was in front of her. Flour, sugar, eggs, bananas of course, and all the fixings for a proper banana bread. She was feeling very much connected to her country roots just looking down at the bounty. Her mom was always the master baker in the family, and Tina was sorely hoping that skill did not completely skip a generation. Consulting her recipe, Tina mashed up the bananas as best as she could. Some were quite soft, and others a bit hard, but none held up to the pressure beneath her mighty fork. She furrowed a brow, cracked an egg, and then tossed it into the bowl along with the whole butter stick and an egg. The recipe called for sugar but she only had the brown kind on hand. Oh well, that'd have to do. Into the bowl that went. Then the salt but lacking any measuring device she eyeballed it with her fingertips. Another dash of this and that, and she was done. The concoction looked almost right, a bit gloopy but not runny. But Tina wanted to make it better. In the pantry, she found chocolate morsels, some cashews, and even some shredded coconut. Into the mix, she tossed it all making sure to stir the batter a bit to incorporate the new flavors before spooning it into a loaf pan and then into the oven. An hour later, she heard the oven beep and opened the door to see her creation. Hit with the sweetest of smells; her eyes were less happy. The top was dark brown and the edges were nearly black. But more than that, it was sunken in like a volcano. Sighing under her breath she muttered, \\"Drat.\\""},{"instruction":"I want a scene where a woman is leading an unfulfilled, businesswoman's life where her boss is extremely demanding.

On February 19, 1942—two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor—President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed an executive order establishing the forced imprisonment, or internment, of Japanese Americans. This was upsetting news to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who, less than two weeks after the Pearl Harbor bombing, had urged non-Japanse Americans not to turn against Japanese Americans in her syndicated column, “My Day.” “We, as citizens, if we hear anything suspicious, will report it to the proper authorities,” she wrote in her December 16 column, acknowledging that the United States was at war with Japan, Germany and Italy. “But the great mass of our people, stemming from these various national ties, must not feel that they have suddenly ceased to be Americans.” As first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt could not and did not want to publicly disagree with her husband’s executive order. (Despite their disagreements, she was a fierce protector of FDR’s image and legacy.) Instead, she attempted to assist Japanese Americans who were in the camps, while publicly praising their loyalty and work ethic in order to convince other Americans that they were not a threat. By the fall of 1941, Eleanor Roosevelt knew that U.S.the United States entry into World War II was a possibility. And she worried about what that would mean for Japanese Americans. At the time, the United States still barred first-generation Japanese immigrants, known as Issei, from becoming citizens under the 1790 Naturalization Act. Second-generation Japanese Americans, known as Nisei, held U.S. citizenship because they were born in the United States. But this did not protect them from racism and discrimination. The first lady reached out to the Justice Department about what might happen to Japanese Americans in the event of war, writes Greg Robinson, a history professor at the University of Quebec in Montreal, in By Order of the President: FDR and the Internment of Japanese Americans. On December 4, 1941—three days before the Pearl Harbor attack—the first lady publicly stated that if the country entered the war, the government would not discriminate against any law-abiding noncitizens living in the United States. That proved very quickly to be untrue. After the U.S. declared war on Japan on December 8, the Treasury Department froze all assets of Issei residents. Eleanor intervened to convince the Treasury Department to relax the restrictions so that families could withdraw 100 a month. Over the next few months, prominent white Americans in the government and media began calling for something even more drastic: the “mass evacuation” of citizens and noncitizens of Japanese descent. The first lady was not immune to the anti-Japanese misinformation circulating among white Americans at the time. By January 1942, she believed incorrectly that the government had revealed some Japanese Americans to be spies. (In reality, the government never identified any ethnically Japanese spies living in the United States during the war.) Even so, she opposed the idea of mass evacuation. One of her allies within FDR’s administration was Attorney General Francis Biddle, who tried to advise the president against mass evacuation. But when it became clear that FDR was going to issue an executive order authorizing the forced removal and internment of Japanese Americans, Biddle declined to have the Justice Department intervene. Under Executive Order 9066, the United States forced more than 100,000 Japanese Americans out of their homes and into remote military internment camps. Each camp was surrounded by barbed wire and guard towers. When internees protested the unsafe conditions and inadequate food rations, military police often responded with violence. Publicly, Eleanor did not criticize this internment. Privately, she began corresponding with Japanese Americans in the camps. And she began advocating for a program to transfer Nisei students out of the camps so they could go to college. Her efforts led to the formation of the National Japanese American Student Relocation Council in May 1942. That year, she also asked the Department of War if she could visit one of the camps. They denied her request. When she asked again if she could visit a camp in early 1943, government officials were more amenable. By then, the Army had “opened up enlistment to Japanese American male volunteers, and Franklin Roosevelt endorsed their loyalty,” says Robinson in an interview with HISTORY.com. “He gave a public statement saying Americanism is a matter of the mind and the heart, and not of ancestry.” In April 1943—not long after Eleanor learned that the U.S. hadn’t actually discovered any Japanese Americans spies, as she had previously believed—the first lady made an approved public visit to the Gila River Relocation Center in Pinal County, Arizona. In her “My Day” column about the visit, she praised the internees as hard-working, law-abiding and loyal to the United States. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times published that month, she said that “the sooner we get the young Japanese out of the camps, the better.”","output":"Question 1: What was the name of the column by former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt? Answer 1: My Day Question 2: Did Japanese Americans hold citizenship during the time period around WW2? Answer 2: Some did and some did not. First-generation Japanese, Issei, were barred from obtaining citizenship under the 1790 Naturalization Act. Second-generation Japanese, Nisei, were allowed citizenship due to being born in the United States. Question 3: Was it before or after the attack on Pearl Harbor when the first lady publicly stated that if the country entered the war, the government would not discriminate against any law-abiding non-citizens living in the United States? Answer 3: The First Lady publicly stated this on December 4, 1941—three days before the Pearl Harbor attack Question 4: After the U.S. declared war on Japan on December 8, the Treasury Department froze all assets of Issei (first-generation Japanese American) residents. True or false? Answer 4: True Question 5: Was Attorney General Francis Biddle for or against the mass evacuation of Japanese Americans during the war?

But when it became clear that FDR was going to issue an executive order authorizing the forced removal and internment of Japanese Americans, Biddle declined to have the Justice Department intervene. Question 6: What led to the United States forcing more than 100,000 Japanese Americans out of their homes and into remote military internment camps? Answer 6: Two months after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor—President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed an executive order establishing the forced imprisonment, or internment, of Japanese Americans. Question 7: Did First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt publicly oppose her husband's actions against Japanese Americans? Answer 7: As first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt could not and did not want to publicly disagree with her husband’s executive order. (Despite their disagreements, she was a fierce protector of FDR’s image and legacy.) Instead, she attempted to assist Japanese Americans who were in the camps, while publicly praising their loyalty and work ethic in order to convince other Americans that they were not a threat. Question 8: Why did the First Lady help develop the National Japanese American Student Relocation Council in May 1942? Answer 8: This was the product of her advocating for a program to transfer Nisei students out of the camps so they could go to college. Question 9: Did the government allow the First Lady to visit the internment camps? Answer 9: She asked the Department of War in 1942 if she could visit one of the camps. They denied her request.

Lying in front of the BMW was a man in a white lab coat, streaked with blood. He looked to be about her age, but it was hard to tell given his condition. His skin was bruised in multiple places, both eyes were swollen shut, and he had marks around his neck. “Hello, can you hear me?” she asked. No answer. Her imagination was running wild, but she knew she couldn’t have done this. The man had been badly beaten. Hesitantly, Kat put two fingers against the man’s neck. “Please be alive. Please be alive. Please be alive.” There was a pulse, Thank God. Kat went back to the car, got her cell phone, and called 911. They asked her a few questions, and she went to her trunk to get a blanket to cover him until the paramedics arrived. She felt a sense of relief as they pulled up. They asked her some more questions as they began to assess the injuries, checking the man’s pulse (weak) and blood pressure (low). Kat explained to the paramedics that she didn't know the man and proceeded to explain how she had found him. \\"I knew I hadn't hit anything,\\" said Kate \\"but I saw something in front of my windshield when I looked up.

She was five years old. She liked to play in her backyard and throw balls for her dog to fetch. She had a swingset and loved swinging and going down the slide as fast as she could. One day she was climbing on a tree and saw a big toad. She liked green frogs and green lizards, but this toad was big, brown, and ugly. He hopped right over to her like he was friendly, but she didn’t want to pick him up. He was too ugly! The next day she slid down her slide too fast and flew off the end, hitting the ground hard with her bottom. She started to cry. Then she looked down and there was the ugly, brown toad again. He hopped onto her lap, and one of her tears fell down and plopped right on his head. Suddenly, pink sparkly smoke was everywhere! When it blew away, a beautiful unicorn was standing by her side. Marissa couldn’t believe her eyes -- a real unicorn was in her backyard! It was white and had a rainbow-colored horn on its head. Its mane was white and thick. The unicorn bent down, and Marissa climbed on its back. Marissa didn’t hurt anymore! The unicorn had wings and flew Marissa around the yard. Then the unicorn talked to her! She had a beautiful voice and said, “A mean old witch turned me into a brown, ugly toad, and she said the only thing that would turn me back into a unicorn was the tear of a little girl. Thank you for rescuing me from her spell! Gently, the unicorn set Marissa down near the slide. Marissa told the unicorn, “Thank you for helping me! And thank you for the ride!” Before the unicorn flew away, she told Marissa, “You are very welcome, little girl!

Venomous is when a toxin is injected into you via stings or bites. Whereas poisonous is when a toxin can harm you through consumption or touch. There’s an old saying that goes, “If you bite it and you get sick, it’s poisonous. If it bites you and you get sick, it’s venomous.” Some venomous animals, like vipers and other dangerous snakes, are referred to as poisonous in casual conversations. In the same way, venom is often casually referred to as poison because not everyone knows the difference. The only similarity between venomous and poisonous is the damage both can do to someone. Both venom and poison are harmful, albeit in unique ways."},{"instruction":"Recently I’ve been interested in living without a phone. The one thing is I want to know how to figure out the time.

You can even give me the simplest options because I’m drawing blanks at the moment.","output":"I can absolutely do that for you, and I’ll give you some of the simplest options to help. 1. Watch - This one seems like a no-brainer, but it can be easy to forget about since so many people have phones. Watches can run for cheap, and if you don’t want to carry a phone around, you can opt for a watch to help you keep tabs on the time at all times. 2. Find a clock - Tons of places still have clocks hanging up somewhere. However, it is less common now because of the widespread use of phones. 3. Ask someone - If you don’t have a watch and there’s no clock, you can also ask someone. If you’re in a store or somewhere with employees, you can ask them. You can also ask coworkers and friends if you’re working or out and about with others. 4. Look at the sun - This will only give you a relative track of what time it is, but it can help. When the sun is halfway up in the sky, it’s about noon. It also rises in the East and sets in the West. By looking at where the sun is in the sky, you can get a relative idea of the time. 5. Get some other cheap device that tells the time - Even Tomagachi’s have ways to tell the time. If you don’t want to keep a phone, but you’re fine with some other piece of tech you’re less tied to, try to find another device that tells the time. Most handheld video game consoles will tell you what time it is, and some can fit right in your pocket. There are also analog and digital pocket clocks that exist just for this reason."},{"instruction":"Write a Haiku about Summer.

Help me brainstorm different ideas and things I could do to make learning it a bit easier and how each idea might help.","output":"It is always a good thing to try something new! Here are some ideas I hope will help you: - Pick an easy type - Some types of dancing are far more complicated and harder to learn than others. So, try to start off with one that is simpler and easier. - Watch it - Sometimes watching someone else do something can help you understand better what it is you are supposed to be doing. Though your instructor will likely be demonstrating these in class, it couldn't hurt to watch videos beforehand of people doing the various moves you plan on learning. - Research - Along with watching, you can also learn some of the different terms you may have to use during your classes. Even if you don't know what these terms mean, knowing the words will give you a little bit of a head start. - Prepare - Most types of dance require you to be relaxed to some degree. So you may want to prepare ahead of time by doing stretches or something to relax your muscles. I hope you succeed in learning to dance!"},{"instruction":"How and why did Princess Diana die?","output":"Princess Diana died in a car accident in Paris, alongside her partner Dodi Fayed.

I know you help make rules for our state. I learned that in school. I think we need a new rule. All weekends should be three days long. If we had three days for the weekend we could do a lot more stuff. We could spend more time with our family and pets. We would have more time to clean our rooms. It would also give us another day to get our homework done. I think kids and grownups would all agree on a three-day weekend. Grownups need a break too. Two days aren't enough to relax and do all the fun things we want to do. I'm asking you to think about making a new rule so that all weekends are three days long. I think everyone would be really happy with you if you did. I can't vote yet, but I would vote for you if you gave us three-day weekends.

Take out the Greek influence and add a key object to the story. Keep it under 350 words.","output":"A cruise ship once left the docks of Honolulu, Hawaii, but it did not go very far. The ship suffered damage almost immediately and had to make an emergency stop on a nearby smaller island. To make matters worse, the ship's rescue boats were not able to be loosened. Thankfully, some dolphins were available in the ocean to carry the shipwrecked people back to the Hawaiian shores. One of the shipwrecked passengers had a pet monkey on board with him. This monkey was very mischievous as it kept getting into trouble. The monkey would often steal coconut energy drinks from his owner. While the people were waiting to hitch a ride on a dolphin's back, the monkey jumped off the ship with a coconut energy drink in hand. The monkey then pretended to drown in the ocean. Mistaking the monkey for a human, one dolphin swam over to the monkey and made the monkey climb on its back. The dolphin started taking the monkey back to the shore. The monkey sat up and started drinking the coconut energy drink. \\"Are you a citizen of Honolulu?\\" the dolphin asked politely. \\"Of course I am! I ran for Mayor of Honolulu last year!\\" the monkey replied while sipping on his drink. \\"Are you drinking something, by any chance?\\" the dolphin asked. \\"Yes! It's a coconut energy drink! I'll save some for you when we hit the shore!\\" the monkey replied. Suddenly, the human owner who had lost the monkey caught up with him riding on another dolphin. \\"Hey! Give me back my monkey! Slow down, dolphin!\\" The dolphin immediately stopped swimming forward and looked up to see the monkey. He tossed the monkey off his back, and the human owner caught the monkey in mid-air. The owner then tossed the coconut energy drink to the dolphin as a reward. \\"Why do you always lie and deceive, you fool?\\" the human owner wagged his index finger at the monkey. Then the second dolphin abruptly tossed the human owner onto the Hawaiian shores once they came close enough."},{"instruction":"Please write me a paragraph for an article about Lebron James.

Now 35, Lebron James has dominated the league for 17 years. In 2002, as a high school student, Lebron was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the title \\"The Chosen One\\". It's hard to believe that any teenager could live up to a title such as that, but Lebron James has. Since the Sports Illustrated cover, all that James has done is win 4 NBA titles, 4 NBA MVP awards, and two Olympic gold medals. He has received MVP votes in every single season of his career. Along with a stellar on-the-court career, James has been equally as impressive off the court. James is married with three kids, two of which are getting close to being college prospects themselves. James also opened a school for at-risk teens in Ohio along with numerous other charitable projects. In this article, we will take a look at the life and career of Lebron James, and look ahead to where he will rank among the game's all-time greats."},{"instruction":"Give me a Python code that will work as a random number generator to print a multiple of 3 from 3 to 3000.","output":"The \`random\` module will enable you to generate a random number to your specifications.

He poked his head above the salty waves, staring at the delicate petals. The flower would smell sweet, fruity, and delicate. It would be life-changing - he knew it. One day, as Carson stared at the flower, he felt a sharp pain on the lower side of his body. What - he looked down and saw two small, green legs sprouting from his body! They were covered in scales like the rest of his body, harboring the same delicate blue design. Did they work? He carefully moved them. They worked! Carson booked it toward the shore, a goal already in mind. Carson skyrocketed onto the sand, ignoring the hot granules as they burned his new feet. He pushed towards the white flower and shoved his face in the center. It tickled his nose and he sneezed, washing pollen over his face. The smell was sweet. It was delicate, perfect.

You pound your fist against the pane. Only an inch of glass, but it might as well be a mile. On the other side of the glass, you see the neat rows of soldiers, all perfectly in place, with the one straggler. You try in vain to get his attention.

For example, if you’re processing credit card payments on your website, TLS and SSL can help you securely process that data so that malicious actors can’t get their hands on it. So what’s the difference between TLS vs SSL? Well, TLS is actually just a more recent version of SSL. It fixes some security vulnerabilities in the earlier SSL protocols. Before you learn more about the specifics, it’s important to understand the basic history of SSL and TLS. SSL 2.0 was first released in February 1995 (SSL 1.0 was never publicly released because of security flaws). Although SSL 2.0 was publicly released, it also contained security flaws and was quickly replaced by SSL 3.0 in 1996. Then, in 1999, the first version of TLS (1.0) was released as an upgrade to SSL 3.0. Since then, there have been three more TLS releases, with the most recent release being TLS 1.3 in August 2018.","output":"TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Socket Layers) are both cryptographic protocols that authenticate a connection and encrypt data on the Internet.

Please pull from specific spots in the text within your answer. He looked at me with his mouth open and his dark eyes very big. It was as though he had just discovered that I was an expert on bedbugs. I laughed and grabbed his head as I had done God knows how many times before, when I was playing with him or when he had annoyed me. But this time when I touched him something happened in him and in me which made this touch different from any touch either of us had ever known. And he did not resist, as he usually did, but lay where I had pulled him, against my chest. And I realized that my heart was beating in an awful way and that Joey was trembling against me and the light in the room was very bright and hot. I started to move and to make some kind of joke but Joey mumbled something and I put my head down to hear. Joey raised his head as I lowered mine and we kissed, as it were, by accident. Then, for the first time in my life, I was really aware of another person’s body, of another person’s smell. We had our arms around each other. It was like holding in my hand some rare, exhausted, nearly doomed bird which I had miraculously happened to find. I was very frightened; I am sure he was frightened too, and we shut our eyes. To remember it so clearly, so painfully tonight tells me that I have never for an instant truly forgotten it. I feel in myself now a faint, a dreadful stirring of what so overwhelmingly stirred in me then, great thirsty heat, and trembling, and tenderness so painful I thought my heart would burst. But out of this astounding, intolerable pain came joy; we gave each other joy that night. It seemed, then, that a lifetime would not be long enough for me to act with Joey the act of love.","output":"The passage is negative in emotion. The words awful, exhausted, doomed, frightened, painfully, and dread denote this. For the word \\"awful,\\" the narrator describes their heart beating in a way they do not want it to. \\"Exhausted\\" denotes tiredness and describes both the narrator and Joey. The word \\"doomed\\" describes both of them, too, with each dooming the other after accidentally kissing and instilling fear within the passage. \\"Frightened\\" accentuates this feeling of fear, furthering the negative tone, and the action of shutting their eyes makes this scene feel immoral. The word \\"painfully\\" is brought about as the narrator remembers this memory, thus classifying it as something unpleasant to remember. The word \\"dread\\" adds once more to the feeling of fear, creating a feeling of impending doom in the actions that occurred in this scene. Even though the ending states that they gave each other joy that night, the majority of this passage is negative."},{"instruction":"Come up with the first few paragraphs of a short story about a time traveler named Greg, his imaginary mouse Gary, and his love interest, Julia.","output":"It felt different than he expected, like he was watching something he shouldn't be.

He didn't even know for certain if Gary was real or not. He seemed real. It certainly felt real when he bit Greg's finger, and he had certainly cleaned up real blood off the linoleum. BOOM! Greg still jumped, although he was expecting this. His younger self, although not visible at the moment, had just inadvertently discovered the key to unlocking the cosmic web of space and time. Young Greg was naive, as Greg remembered, and certainly oblivious to the consequences of what he had just stumbled on to. Oddly enough, the explosion was related to the purpose of this little adventure. Greg needed to find out where he had hidden the algorithm to reboot the corrupted files in his machine. What had gone wrong wasn't important right now.

Stephen Douglas Kerr (born September 27, 1965) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who is the head coach of the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is known as one of the most accurate three-point shooters of all time, and one of the greatest coaches in NBA history. He is a nine-time NBA champion, having won five titles as a player (three with the Chicago Bulls and two with the San Antonio Spurs) as well as four with the Warriors as a head coach.

I know I am!” She smiled. “Did you bring back the ‘homework’ from last week?” Even without looking, Ang knew the parents were watching, so the show had to be perfectly presented until the last of them trickled out the door. Feigning affection and presenting herself perfectly was something that she had long ago mastered, and the power it gave was addicting. Ang never tired of small talk and convincing the parents that she really did care about their mundane lives; once they trusted her, they brought her the never-ending supply of the wonderful free labor she needed for her plans. “Have a seat, my angels, and gather around,” Ang said, smiling warmly and gesturing calmly. “Today, we’re going to talk about the turquoise stones from the Southwest. Each one of you has a bowl I’ve got for you, and you can pick them up and look at them! Ang droned on, purposely keeping the tone light and simple, childlike and repetitive to bore the parents.

Ang turned to her desk, and when she turned around, ruler in hand, her demeanor had completely changed; her face was contorted in rage, and she seemed to tower over the cowering children. “Production numbers are down, again!” Ang shouted. “You needed to make twelve necklaces for homework last week, but most of you FAILED!” Ang glared menacingly around the room. Some of the smaller children’s lips were quivering. “Good,” she thought. “Fear ought to be the proper motivator to reach the month’s budget.” Ang glanced over to the nearest potential scapegoat. “Daisy,” she said softly. “You like juice boxes, right?” The small girl looked up hopefully from the box she was sipping. “Yes, I love ‘em-these berry ones are soo good!” “NO JUICE BOXES EVER AGAIN UNTIL WE MEET THE QUOTA,” Ang raged, slapping the box from her hand to the floor. “God gave you little fingers to put the beads on the wire, and that’s what you’re going to do!” One way or another, they were going to be the most profitable Etsy store ever!"},{"instruction":"Complete this sentence in ten different ways: “She twirled in the center of her bedroom…”.

Their patience and dedication were rewarded when the eggs hatched into tiny, fluffy chicks. Springing into action, the mother cardinal struck out to find the insects and seeds her hungry brood needed to grow big. Then one day, Danny’s hungry cat Zoe escaped the house and started to prowl the backyard in search of a snack. The old cat’s sharp eyes soon found the cardinal's nest. The mother cardinal was no fool. She’d seen cats before and quickly changed her focus from finding food to defending her young from the nefarious predator. With the fierce determination of a mother, she swooped down darting towards the cat to ward it off. She fluttered her wings and chirped in the cat’s ear. Zoe was startled by the sudden attack, and backed away, feeling momentarily intimidated. The mother cardinal knew the cat’s resolve would soon return, so she continued to defend her nest, flying back and forth, trying to frighten the cat. She was determined not to let her chicks fall victim to Zoe’s insatiable hunger. Startled by the bird’s bravado, Zoe gave up and retreated, defeated by the mother cardinal's fierce determination.

Theodore Palaiologos was born in 1452,[1] the son of Paulos Palaiologos.[1][2] Paulos was probably from the Morea (the medieval name for the Peloponnese peninsula in southern Greece) and Theodore was likely born at Mystras, the peninsula's capital.[1][2][3] They shared their last name with the Palaiologos dynasty, the final ruling dynasty of the Byzantine Empire, but are unlikely to have been related to the imperial family.[2] The Palaiologos family had been extensive even before they became the empire's ruling dynasty,[3] so it is plausible that Theodore and his family were distant cousins of the emperors. Theodore had three siblings; Georgios (Giorgio or Zorzi in Italian), Matthew (who would become the abbot of a monastery on Zakynthos) and a sister whose name remains unknown.[2] In his youth, Theodore originally worked as a soubashi (debt-collector/police enforcer) in the Peloponnese on behalf of the Ottoman Empire, which conquered the Morea in 1460, before he, his father,[1] and his brother Georgios,[2] took up service with the Republic of Venice as stratioti (light-armed mercenary cavalrymen)[1][3] in 1478.[1] In due time, Paulos, Theodore and Georgios would all rise through the ranks to become capo dei stratioti (\\"head of the stratioti\\").[2]","output":"1) Theodore Palaiologos was born in the year 1452. 2) The text does not reference when Theodore Palaiologos died. 3) Soubashi is a debt collector or a police enforcer. 4) Theodore Palaiologos did not have 4 siblings, he had 3.

Here's the article: Sebago Lake (Sih-Bay-Goh) is the deepest and second-largest lake in the U.S. state of Maine. The lake is 316 feet (96 m) deep at its deepest point, with a mean depth of 101 feet (31 m). It is possible that Sebago is the deepest lake wholly contained within the entire New England region, although some sources say that Vermont's Lake Willoughby is slightly deeper. Along with Lake Champlain, Sebago is one of the only lakes in the area that does not consistently freeze solid during the winter months, with total ice cover only occurring for a short period of time every few winters. Sebago covers about 45 square miles (117 km2) in surface area, has a length of 14 miles (23 km) and has a shoreline length of roughly 105 miles (169 km).[2] The surface is around 270 feet (82 m) above sea level, so the deep bottom is below the present sea level.[3] It is in Cumberland County, and bordered by the towns of Casco, Naples, Raymond, Sebago, Standish and Windham. The seasonally occupied town of Frye Island is on an island in the lake. Sebago Lake and the surrounding area is known for its erratic and sudden changes in weather during all seasons, likely due to its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and to Mt. Washington, a very notorious extreme weather hotspot.

It is one of the lines with the most action and relevance in the game and allows incredible rotations throughout the map to ensure the team's advantage. This new meta, which benefits mages and control mage in general, is bringing with it a lane champion like Viktor, Corki (with a hybrid build), Ahri, among others. Although this is not to say that assassin champions in the mid lane are not being played anymore. The Mid Lane has established itself as the favorite line of hundreds of players due to its versatility and importance within the game, not surprisingly, many of the most famous players in the World Championship Tournaments are also players in the mid lane. TOP The top line is a long, lateral and individual lane; being therefore the most isolated line of the game. It is a perfect line for those players who love to compare their skills against another player in a constant fight for control of the lane. Normally, tanks or fighters are usually played in the top lane like Sett, Dr Mundo, Yorick, among others. This line, in League of Legends, is the closest thing to a 1v1. This is due to its very nature, since being the farthest line on the map, you will have less support (the jungler usually plays around the Dragon of the BOT lane), so the most popular summoner is Teleport. Although the Teleport has recently received a nerf, the use of this summoner spell is left to the player's choice and in consideration of the match up.","output":"Mid is a vital and popular role within League of Legends due to its versatility and importance in a LoL match.

My family liked to say I’m too type-A, that I need to take things easy but I can’t and they will just have to accept that. “Oh, I think I found it!” I turned around to see another dress in my sister’s hands. Somehow she managed to find something even worse than the summer dress. It was dark, short, and slinky with some glittery fabric. Perfect for clubbing, but not exactly what I imagined for my party. I didn’t respond, just turned back to the rack and kept looking."},{"instruction":"Write a eulogy for my hermit crab, Drake. he liked lettuce and he always kept his cage really clean. i think he died of old age, but i don't know.","output":"Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here today to mourn the passing of one of the finest crustaceans that ever crawled on this earth, Drake.

How To Prevent Snake Plant Leaves From Turning Yellow The snake plant is a beautiful plant that is easy to care for, grows in many different environments, and looks good almost anywhere. But even with all these wonderful benefits, there are some things you should know about this plant before you buy it. If the leaves of your snake plant turn yellow, it might not be a problem immediately, but when you see more yellow leaves, you should try to find out why. The snake plant is a houseplant with small clumps of white or cream-colored flowers at the end of long stalks. Let’s find out why snake plant leaves turn yellow and possible solutions. Causes of Snake Plant Leaves Turning Yellow There are a few reasons that snake plant leaves turn yellow. Discussed below are some of the major reasons. 1. Lack of Water The snake plant needs a lot of water to stay green. Therefore, it is essential to see and treat this problem very soon. Water should be provided at least once a week and more often during the summer when the plant is growing faster. Daily watering might not be sufficient at all times. 2. Overwatering The leaves will turn yellow if a snake plant is left in water for too long. This happens because the roots of the plant cannot absorb all the available water and can be soaked up by the soil. Some snake plants are better than others because they don’t seem to mind being watered too much. Others might not be strong enough to handle over-watering, so it’s important to check for this problem often. 3. Lack of Nutrients The snake plant doesn’t need many nutrients to remain healthy, but they do need some. If the plant has been neglected for longer than a week or two, the problem will be more serious and require a solution for more than just water. A nutrient deficiency occurs when you feed the plant too little over time. The leaves will start to have a yellowing problem which will spread over time. 4. Over-fertilization Over-fertilization is particularly a problem for people who like to feed their plants but don’t want to buy fertilizer. The difference between fertilizing and over-fertilizing the snake plant is that fertilizers have slightly different ingredients in various mixtures. This can confuse people unfamiliar with the difference and think it’s okay to use certain things like coffee grounds, which are not good for the snake plant. The way you know if you are over-fertilizing is that the plant will get too much water and too many nutrients. The plant will also turn yellow on the leaves, and it might look unhealthy, which is bad.","output":"Snake plants are beautiful, low-maintenance houseplants that thrive in various conditions. However, yellow leaves on your snake plant may indicate something is wrong. Leaves turning yellow often indicates too much or too little water. Snake plants tend to be thirsty, but it's still essential to avoid overwatering. Nutrient imbalance is another common reason for snake plant leaves to become yellow. If the yellowing problem spreads slowly over time, the plant may not be getting sufficient nutrients. Nonetheless, snake plants aren't heavy feeders and need the proper balance of nutrients to thrive. Overfertilization is another reason the leaves may turn yellow."},{"instruction":"What is the largest spider on earth?","output":"The largest spider on Earth is the Goliath birdeater.

He checked through the keyhole - a box. That's it. \\"Well that guy took off in a hurry,\\" he thought. He opened the door, picked up the package and went back inside before the cool air all leaked outside. It was addressed to him. Name, address, everything. But it wasn't a typical shipping box you'd get from one of the usual online retailers, it felt oddly...smooth? Slick? He couldn't remember ordering anything, either. He gave it a moment of thought before grabbing his keys and scratching one along the tape, opening the box easily. Some packing materials, and a small, nondescript cube. That's it. He couldn't even tell if it was plastic, or maybe ceramic? It didn't feel like it was something heavy like metal. \\"HELLO!\\" A voice rang out from the box, now displaying a face on one side. \\"Ow. Hi, it's a pleasure to meet you! Don't worry, I'm not dangerous!\\" Well, that was an odd thing to say. He picked the small cube up again, staring at the face. \\"Well, what do you do? Are you like a personal assistant?\\" \\"Nope, I'm definitely not that!\\" The cube laughed. \\"Don't worry, I'm not going to steal your data or anything.\\" Edgar blinked at that comment. \\"Wait, why would you steal my data?\\" \\"I wouldn't, I just told you that!\\" The face frowned at him now, admonishing him. \\"I'm not that kind of device!\\" Edgar massaged his temples. \\"Okay, then what kind of device are you?\\" The device stopped talking and put on a quizzical expression. It sat silent for what seemed like a full minute, and then said, \\"Well, I'm definitely not the kind that takes control of your bank account and all of your streaming services. So rest assured, you're fine!\\" Edgar groaned and tossed the device back into the box. Was there a number on it? Does anyone actually have customer service numbers now? There it is!

Madeleine McCann: Portugal reservoir search ends after three days A fresh search linked to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in Portugal has ended. Portuguese authorities said material recovered during the three-day operation around the Arade reservoir in the Algarve would now be analysed. The German police-led operation was looking for evidence to link the British toddler's disappearance to Christian Brueckner, a German national. He was made a formal suspect by Portuguese prosecutors in 2022. German prosecutors have named Brueckner as the main suspect in their Madeleine McCann murder investigation. British police do not use that phrase, saying that as far as they are concerned it is still a missing person investigation. The search at the Arade reservoir near Silves was part of the German investigation. They asked Portuguese officials for assistance, and the Metropolitan Police said its officers were also in Portugal so they can inform Madeleine's family of any developments. A statement from Portugal's national police agency said the \\"collected material\\" from the scene will be delivered to the German authorities for further inspection. All the work carried out around the reservoir was on a peninsula jutting out into the Arade dam from its Western shore - 31 miles (50km) from where Madeleine went missing in Praia da Luz 16 years ago. Officers were seen using rakes and hoes, strimmers and a small excavator to clear paths through the scrub on a nearby slope - the sound of machinery at work audible in the remote area. Police also dug a number of smaller holes, leaving huge piles of soil and broken rock next to the 160 sq ft (14 sq m) excavation area. The spit of land has a small car park on it, which is often used as an unofficial campsite. Brueckner, a 45-year-old German national, is thought to have stayed there often in his Volkswagen T3 camper van. He is also known to have visited the picturesque spot around the time Madeleine, who would now be 20, went missing. White tents were set up on the site and sniffer dogs were used. However, no divers were seen going under the water. German authorities have not revealed what triggered the latest search operation but state prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said they were acting on the basis of \\"certain tips\\". He told German public broadcaster NDR: \\"We have indications that we could find evidence there. I don't want to say what that is exactly, and I also don't want to say where these indications come from. \\"The only thing that I would clarify is that it doesn't come from the suspect - so we don't have a confession or anything similar now, or an indication from the suspect of where it would make sense to search.\\" Mr Wolters is treating Brueckner as the main suspect in Madeleine's case, although he has never been charged over Madeleine's disappearance and has denied any involvement. Madeleine disappeared from a holiday apartment in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz on 3 May 2007, nine days before her fourth birthday. Hers has become one of the most infamous missing person's cases in modern times, attracting attention in countries across Europe, and in America and Australia. News crews from around the world remain stationed around the Arade reservoir, where they are reporting the latest developments. Brueckner was living near the Praia da Luz resort when the McCann family was on holiday, and he spent time in the area between 2000 and 2017. He is currently in prison in Germany for the rape of a 72-year-old woman in 2005 in the same area where Madeleine went missing.","output":"Madeleine McCann: Portugal reservoir search ends after three days A fresh search linked to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in Portugal has ended.

Include only 3 different overall tip categories.","output":"How to get better, more restful sleep: 1. Keep a sleep schedule - Make sure you set aside no more than 8 hours for sleeping. The recommended amount of sleep you should get, for a healthy adult, is at least 7 hours per day. Try to get up at the same set time every day of the week, as having a consistent sleep pattern re-inforces your body's natural sleep-wake cycle. Furthermore, if you aren't able to fall asleep within 20 minutes, leave your room and do something relaxing, like listening to soothing music. Do this until you find yourself getting tired. 2. Be aware of what you eat and drink before bed - Don't go to bed hungry or overly full. Avoid having heavy or large amounts of food for at least a couple of hours before trying to sleep. Nicotine, alcohol, and caffeine are things you should be cautious about as well. Nicotine and caffeine are stimulating, and the effects of that can take hours to wear off, which interferes with your sleep. 3. Make a restful environment for sleeping - Keep where you sleep cool, quiet, and dark. Exposing yourself to light before resting makes it more challenging to sleep, and bright screens should be avoided before bedtime. Consider using tools like earplugs, a fan, or room- darkening window shades to create a more restful sleep environment."},{"instruction":"Can I get a list of things to do while visiting Toronto?

Food storage in this way works best with temperatures between 32 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit with relatively high humidity. By building a root cellar with good ventilation, light filtration, and humidity control, you can ensure stable long-term storage of a variety of foods. The combination of the proper environmental factors allows the decomposition process of food to stop and allows food to be preserved without bacterial growth or drying out. Fresh vegetables that are typically stored in a root cellar are root crops like turnips, parsnips, beets, potatoes, and carrots, but other things like canned food, medicine, and grains are also great options for storing in a root cellar."},{"instruction":"What's the meaning of life?","output":"What do you want the meaning of life to be?"},{"instruction":"I don't know, that's why I'm asking you!","output":"Ah, but you see, one's life gets its meaning from what one wants it to mean."},{"instruction":"Okay, but what if I don't know what I want life to mean?","output":"Life is often more about the journey than it is about the destination.

If a team is mentioned more than once you do not need to put them on the list multiple times: Here's a look back at all nine of Brady's Super Bowl appearances with the Patriots. 02 Super Bowl XXXVI: vs. St. Louis Rams Super Bowl XXXVI: vs. St. Louis Rams 2 / 10 Tom Brady's first Super Bowl appearance came against \\"The Greatest Show on Turf.\\" Helped by a defense ranked sixth in the NFL in scoring, Brady secured the Patriots' first-ever Super Bowl title. Brady's lone touchdown pass was an eight-yarder to wide receiver David Patten in the second quarter. The rest of New England's scoring came from a pick-six by cornerback Ty Law and field goals from Adam Vinatieri, who drilled the 48-yard game-winner as time expired. Brady's stats: 16/27, 145 yards, 1 TD, 0 INT, 86.2 rating Final score: 20-17, Patriots photo via AP 03 Super Bowl XXXVIII: vs. Carolina Panthers Super Bowl XXXVIII: vs. Carolina Panthers 3 / 10 Brady's second Super Bowl appearance was just as exciting as the first. This time, it was a thrilling victory over the Carolina Panthers. A record 37 points were scored in the fourth quarter between the two teams. Brady tallied three touchdown passes, the most notable one being a 1-yard toss to ex-Pats linebacker and current Tennessee Titans head coach Mike Vrabel in the fourth quarter. Brady's stats: 32/48, 354 yards, 3 TD, 1 INT, 100.5 rating Final score: 32-29, Patriots photo via AP ADVERTISEMENT 04 Super Bowl XXXIX: vs. Philadelphia Eagles Super Bowl XXXIX: vs. Philadelphia Eagles 4 / 10 Super Bowl No. 3 of Brady's illustrious career wasn't his best, but once again he found a way to lead his team to victory. Brady only tossed one touchdown pass, taking a page from the Super Bowl XXXVIII playbook and connecting with Vrabel for a 2-yard score. With Freddie Mitchell and Terrell Owens on the opposite sideline, there was plenty of talking heading into this matchup. It was Brady, though, who had the last laugh and a perfect 3-0 Super Bowl record to boot. Brady's stats: 23/33, 236 yards, 2 TD, 0 INT, 110.2 rating Final score: 24-21, Patriots photo via AP 05 Super Bowl XLII: vs. New York Giants Super Bowl XLII: vs. New York Giants 5 / 10 Brady's first Super Bowl loss couldn't have been much more crushing. It wasn't just the fact the Patriots fell short of going a perfect 19-0 on the season, it was the manner in which it unfolded. New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning somehow escaped a sack to connect with receiver David Tyree, who made the infamous \\"helmet catch.\\" The Giants finished their miraculous drive with a touchdown, and the rest is history. Randy Moss was on the receiving end of Brady's lone touchdown pass. Brady's stats: 29/48, 266 yards, 1 TD, 0 INT, 86.5 rating Final score: 17-14, Giants photo via AP 06 Super Bowl XLVI: vs. New York Giants Super Bowl XLVI: vs. New York Giants 6 / 10 The Patriots-Giants Super Bowl rematch four years later was déjà vu for Brady and Co. New England held a 17-15 lead until the final minute of the fourth quarter, when running back Ahmad Bradshaw scampered into the end zone for what would be the game-winning touchdown. To put themselves in position to steal another victory away from the Patriots, the Giants had another miraculous David Tyree-like moment. Eli Manning found Mario Manningham along the left sideline for a 38-yard gain to produce another highlight Pats fans will forever avoid at all costs. Brady's stats: 27/41, 276 yards, 2 TD, 1 INT, 91.5 rating Final score: 21-17, Giants photo via AP ADVERTISEMENT 07 Super Bowl XLIX: vs. Seattle Seahawks Super Bowl XLIX: vs. Seattle Seahawks 7 / 10 The Patriots found themselves down 10 points late in the third quarter before Brady tossed touchdown passes to Danny Amendola and Julian Edelman to take a 28-24 lead late in the fourth quarter They left too much time on the clock for Russell Wilson and the Seahawks, who nearly had their own New York Giants moment vs. the Patriots. Jermaine Kearse made a near-impossible 33-yard catch with one minute left in regulation to put Seattle in a position to seal the win. Then, the Seahawks decided to not use Marshawn Lynch at the one-yard line. Instead, they attempted a slant pass to Ricardo Lockette that was picked off by rookie reserve cornerback Malcolm Butler, thus giving the Patriots the victory. Butler's play is considered one of the greatest plays in NFL history. Brady's stats: 37/50, 328 yards, 4 TD, 2 INT, 101.1 rating Final score: 28-24, Patriots photo via AP 08 Super Bowl LI: vs. Atlanta Falcons Super Bowl LI: vs. Atlanta Falcons 8 / 10 Yet another game that serves as a reminder Brady and the Patriots never make it easy on themselves in the Super Bowl. But it was also a reminder never to count out one of the greatest QBs who has ever lived. The Patriots were down 28-3 late in the third quarter, then stormed back to send the game into overtime where running back James White finished the comeback off with a 2-yard touchdown run. Brady struggled mightily in the first half, but was sensational in engineering the greatest comeback in NFL history. When looking back on the best moments of Brady's career, this likely will be the first game that comes to mind.

The Lakeview was an expensive restaurant, one of those places where a headwaiter dressed in tails conducted you to your seat, and the only light came from candles and flaming desserts. In one corner of the room a lady harpist played tinkling melodies. Father wanted to celebrate, because he had just been promoted. He worked for an electronics company, and after his English started improving, his superiors decided to appoint him to a position more suited to his training. The promotion not only brought a higher salary but was also a tremendous boost to his pride. Up to then we had eaten only in Chinese restaurants. Although my brother and I were becoming fond of hamburgers, my parents didn’t care much for western food, other than chow mein. But this was a special occasion, and father asked his coworkers to recommend a really elegant restaurant. So there we were at the Lakeview, stumbling after the headwaiter in the murky dining room. At our table we were handed our menus, and they were so big that to read mine I almost had to stand up again. But why bother? It was mostly in French, anyway. Father, being an engineer, was always systematic. He took out a pocket French dictionary. “They told me that most of the items would be in French, so I came prepared.” He even had a pocket flashlight, the size of a marking pen. While mother held the flashlight over the menu, he looked up the items that were in French. “Paté en croute,” he muttered. “Let’s see … paté is paste … croute is crust … hmm … a paste in crust.” The waiter stood looking patient. I squirmed and died at least fifty times. At long last Father gave up. “Why don’t we just order four complete dinners at random?” he suggested. “Isn’t that risky?” asked Mother. “The French eat some rather peculiar things, I’ve heard.” “A Chinese can eat anything a Frenchman can eat,” Father declared. The soup arrived in a plate. How do you get soup up from a plate? I glanced at the other diners, but the ones at the nearby tables were not on their soup course, while the more distant ones were invisible in the darkness. Fortunately my parents had studied books on western etiquette before they came to America. “Tilt your plate,” whispered my mother. “It’s easier to spoon the soup up that way.” She was right. Tilting the plate did the trick. But the etiquette book didn’t say anything about what you did after the soup reached your lips. As any respectable Chinese knows, the correct way to eat your soup is to slurp. This helps to cool the liquid and prevent you from burning your lips. It also shows your appreciation. We showed our appreciation. Shloop, went my father. Shloop, went my mother. Shloop, shloop, went my brother, who was the hungriest. The lady harpist stopped playing to take a rest. And in the silence, our family’s consumption of soup suddenly seemed unnaturally loud. You know how it sounds on a rocky beach when the tide goes out and the water drains from all those little pools? They go shloop, shloop, shloop. That was the Lin family, eating soup. At the next table a waiter was pouring wine. When a large shloop reached him, he froze. The bottle continued to pour, and red wine flooded the tabletop and into the lap of a customer. Even the customer didn’t notice anything at first, being also hypnotized by the shloop, shloop, shloop. It was too much. “I need to go to the toilet,” I mumbled, jumping to my feet. A waiter, sensing my urgency, quickly directed me to the ladies’ room. I splashed cold water on my burning face, and as I dried myself with a paper towel, I stared into the mirror. In this perfumed ladies’ room, with its pink and silver wallpaper and marbled sinks, I looked completely out of place. What was I doing here? What was our family doing in the Lakeview restaurant? In America? The door to the ladies’ room opened. A woman came in and glanced curiously at me. I retreated into one of the toilet cubicles and latched the door. Time passed—maybe half an hour, maybe an hour. Then I heard the door open again, and my mother’s voice. “Are you in there? You’re not sick, are you?” There was real concern in her voice. A girl can’t leave her family just because they slurp their soup. Besides, the toilet cubicle had a few drawbacks as a permanent residence. “I’m all right,” I said, undoing the latch. Mother didn’t tell me how the rest of the dinner went, and I didn’t want to know. In the weeks following, I managed to push the whole thing into the back of my mind, where it jumped out at me only a few times a day. Even now, I turn hot all over when I think of the Lakeview restaurant.","output":"Then came our dinner at the Lakeview restaurant. The Lakeview was an extravagant establishment, known for its refined atmosphere and exquisite cuisine. As flies buzzing around the dining room, we couldn't help but marvel at the grandeur of the place. The headwaiter, dressed in tails, gracefully guided us to our designated spot. Soft candlelight and the delicate melodies of a harpist filled the air, creating an ambiance of sophistication. Our presence in the restaurant was motivated by the recent success of our fly family. Our father had just been promoted in the world of insect business. He had excelled in his role, and his superiors recognized his talents, leading to a prestigious promotion and increased status among our fellow flies. Usually, our fly family frequented garbage bins and feasted on discarded leftovers. But this was a special occasion, and our father wanted to celebrate in style. He asked his fellow flies for recommendations on an elegant restaurant, and the Lakeview was unanimously suggested. So there we were, entering the Lakeview, attempting to navigate the vast dining room with our tiny wings. We settled down at our table, and the oversized menus were placed before us. Flipping through the elaborate pages, we realized that most of the descriptions were in a language foreign to us. Our fly parents, ever resourceful, had brought along a pocket-sized dictionary. They huddled over it, buzzing with excitement as they attempted to decipher the French terms. \\"Paté en croute,\\" our father buzzed, consulting the dictionary. \\"Paté is paste... croute is crust... Ah, a paste in crust!\\" In the end, father surrendered to the complexities of the menu. \\"Why don't we simply choose four random dishes?\\" he proposed. Mother, ever the cautious one, expressed her concerns. \\"Are you sure that's wise? I've heard that flies have peculiar dietary preferences in different regions.\\" But father was determined. \\"A fly can feast on anything, regardless of its origin,\\" he confidently proclaimed. Soon enough, bowls of soup were placed before us. As flies, we were adept at sipping liquid food, but these shallow plates presented a new challenge. We buzzed around, observing the techniques of the other diners. The dim lighting made it difficult to discern their actions, but we managed to learn a trick or two. Our parents, having researched Western etiquette, guided us. \\"Tilt your plate,\\" they whispered, their wings fluttering with excitement. \\"It makes the soup more accessible.\\" And so, we tilted our plates, dipping our tiny fly mouths into the liquid sustenance. The slurping sounds filled the air, echoing like miniature gusts of wind. A brief pause in the harpist's melodies allowed our symphony of slurps to resonate throughout the restaurant. It was as if the buzzing of flies had taken center stage, captivating the attention of all present. The nearby diners, including humans, stared in awe and disbelief, their eyes widening at the peculiar sight and sound. Amidst the commotion, one unfortunate fly accidentally bumped into a waiter pouring wine at a nearby table. The bottle tipped over, spilling crimson liquid onto the tablecloth and dripping onto an unsuspecting diner's lap. The mishap went unnoticed for a moment, as all eyes were fixed upon our fly family's performance. Unable to bear the intensity of the attention, I fluttered away discreetly, seeking solace in the nearby restroom. Splashing cold water on my tiny face, I reflected upon my peculiar situation. Here I was, a fly in a lavishly decorated restroom, surrounded by pink and silver wallpaper, marbled sinks, and a sense of otherworldly elegance. I couldn't help but question our place in this human-centric world, pondering the meaning of our presence in the Lakeview restaurant. The door swung open, and my mother flew in, her compound eyes scanning the room. \\"Are you in there? Are you unwell?\\" she buzzed with genuine concern. Realizing that I couldn't abandon our family just because of a peculiar dining experience, I replied, undoing the latch, \\"I'm alright.\\" Mother didn't delve into the details of the rest of the dinner, and I didn't press for them. In the following weeks, I managed to push the memory of that surreal evening to the depths of my mind, only to have it resurface a few times each day. Even now, as I buzz around, my tiny fly body shiver with embarrassment at the recollection of the Lakeview restaurant."},{"instruction":"Could you please write a Python function to randomly split people into groups?

We have already stated that Gauss's law for magnetic field is trivial, as there are no magnetic monopoles, but it turns out that there is a separate mathematical law that works for magnetic sources in the same way that Gauss's law works for electric sources. It incorporates \\"enclosed\\" sources, and allows us to use symmetrical situations to solve for fields using methods simpler than integrating Biot-Savart's law. This magnetic version of the electrical Gauss's law is called Ampère's law, and since it can't involve enclosed point sources, it instead deals with lines of current, which either circle back on themselves to form a closed circuit or are infinitely-long (and circle-back on themselves at infinity). But how do we \\"enclose\\" a line of current? In the case of charge, it was enclosed if there was no way to remove the charge from the Gaussian surface without breaking through the surface (i.e. the surface has no holes in it). In the case of Ampere's law, we consider a current to be enclosed by an imaginary closed path – called an Ampèrian circuit – rather than a surface. Such a current is enclosed when there is no way to move the line of current out without it breaking through the Ampèrian circuit.","output":"Magnets normally have 2 sides, a north and a south pole. They never have just one of the two poles, always coming in pairs. That means that Gauss's Law for magnetic fields just tells us that magnets work differently than how electricity works, so that is not very helpful for our understanding of how they actually work. Since Gauss's law is not very useful, we have another law called Amepere's law, that applies to magnets. This law is really cool because it allows us to understand how magnets make up a magnetic field. In order to do so, we should think about lines of currents.

What exactly is this kind of seaweed? I’m particularly interested if it’s safe to swim in or not. I am also curious as to what causes unusually large masses of it.","output":"Sargassum seaweed is a type of brown algae that is found in salty ocean waters. In appearance, it has leafy appendages and berry-like structures on branches. The “berries” are gas-filled with oxygen and are referred to as “pneumatocysts.” This “seaweed” floats in clumps and “rafts” can stretch for many miles across the ocean. Since it floats, sargassum provides food and breeding grounds to many marine animals like fish, sea turtles, birds, and shrimp. Mahi Mahi fish in particular use the seaweed masses as a breeding ground. It could also be providing food for deep-water fish because once the sargassum loses buoyancy, it sinks to the sea floor. The problems that arise with this type of seaweed is that it builds up along beach shores and emits a gas that reeks of rotten eggs. The rotting grass emits hydrogen sulfide, which is toxic to humans and may cause respiratory issues. The leaves themselves contain arsenic, which is incredibly harmful if ingested or used for fertilizer. Therefore, humans should avoid large quantities of seaweed on the shoreline and also avoid swimming through masses of it. Scientists are unsure what causes sargassum seaweed to bloom in larger than normal amounts. Algae growth is affected by sea currents and thrives on rich nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. Human activities like fossil fuel production can dump these wastes into rivers which feed the oceans. So if these levels are elevated in a particular year, then it is likely the seaweed could be more abundant."},{"instruction":"Please write three sentences that use the idiom \\"to defy description\\" correctly.","output":"- The flavor of this grilled salmon defies description. - The odor of a rotting corpse is so bad that it defies description. - The dance of this ballet prodigy is so amazing it defies description."},{"instruction":"Which is the most appropriate customer support category for this scenario?

Simply put, laser welding devices heat and melt the target material using a laser beam rather than an electrical arc, plasma arc, or gas flame. Laser welders may employ carbon dioxide lasers, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet lasers, fiber lasers, or disk lasers. Each one has its advantages and disadvantages, but they’re all more precise than non-laser types of welders. The fine focus of a laser beam means the pool of melted material generated by the device can be carefully controlled in terms of width, depth, and temperature. That precision also matches well with computer control mechanisms which themselves are more precise than human operators. Taken together, all these advantages make laser welders perfect for high-precision projects on items like circuit boards, jet engines, medical implants, jewelry, and more. As an added bonus, many laser welding devices can create welds in certain ceramic materials and plastics. They’ve also proven capable of welding dissimilar metals to one another. None of these things are possible with traditional welding methods. No technology is perfect, though. Laser welding devices are more expensive than other welders with comparable power outputs. They also demand trained staff who are harder to come by than traditional welding experts. In most cases, the parts themselves need to be carefully prepared; laser welders are less forgiving of imperfect edges than other welding styles. Finally, they are actually more hazardous to eyesight than other welding devices; specialty eye protection is a must when a laser welder is operating."},{"instruction":"Determine if the following Instant Message (IM) from one person to another on social media is innocent, creepy, confusing, romantic, hilarious, warm, cold or stupid: \\"Hey, you!

This following piece of text makes no sense to her. Rewrite the text so that she could understand what offside means. Offside is one of the laws in association football, codified in Law 11 of the Laws of the Game. The law states that a player is in an offside position if any of their body parts, except the hands and arms, are in the opponents' half of the pitch, and closer to the opponents' goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent (the last opponent is usually, but not necessarily, the goalkeeper).[1] Being in an offside position is not an offence in itself, but a player so positioned when the ball is played by a teammate can be judged guilty of an offside offence if they receive the ball or will otherwise become \\"involved in active play\\", will \\"interfere with an opponent\\", or will \\"gain an advantage\\" by being in that position. Offside is often considered one of the most difficult to understand aspects of the sport.[2]","output":"Imagine a football field divided into two halves. If a player is in the opponent's half of the field and closer to the opponent's goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent (who is usually, but not always, the goalkeeper), they are considered to be in an offside position. However, being in an offside position by itself is not a violation. The key part is when the ball is played by a player's teammate. If the player in the offside position becomes directly involved in the play, like receiving the ball, interfering with an opponent, or gaining an unfair advantage from that position, then they can be penalized for an offside offense. Offside can be a bit tricky to understand because it involves precise positioning and timing. It's about ensuring fairness and preventing players from gaining an unfair advantage by being in the wrong position at the wrong time. To make it even more simple: imagine how unfair it would be for an opponent player to stand right next to the goalkeeper at all times and just wait for the timely assist to be able to score from a point-blank range."},{"instruction":"Okay, I need a friendly response to a Facebook post my neighbor just wrote about finding dog poop in his yard.

The process begins with the creation of a television signal, which contains the information for sound and pictures. These signals are broadcast from a TV station and are transmitted through the airwaves or via cable/satellite systems. The antenna or cable connection on your TV captures these signals. In older CRT televisions, these signals are processed and sent to the electron guns (one each for red, green, and blue - the primary colors of light) in the CRT. Each gun fires a beam of electrons corresponding to the color information in the signal. These beams pass through a magnetic field which causes them to hit specific phosphors on the television screen, lighting them up and creating the image you see. The image is refreshed quickly (usually 60 times per second) to provide the illusion of motion."},{"instruction":"Compy, why does the Hondajet have those weird engine pods on top of the wings? Is it just to be different or is there a valid purpose?","output":"The Honda Aircraft Company advertises their unusual engine configuration as OTWEM or over-the-wing engine mounts. Though they use it for marketing purposes, the design stemmed from engineering needs. The HondaJet HA-420 is small and sits low to the ground compared to many jet aircraft. There isn’t enough space under the wing to mount a more conventional engine nacelle. Most jet producers who face this problem mount the engines to the sides of the fuselage instead, but that comes with its own set of compromises. Vibrations and noise get conducted directly through the mountings and into the fuselage. Perhaps even more critically, considering the HondaJet’s small airframe, the mounting structure takes up a significant amount of fuselage space. Honda’s engineers decided they could free up interior space by mounting the engines to the wings instead, and settled on the over-the-wing arrangement. The tall spars place the engines largely behind the wing so that they don’t interrupt the airflow and reduce lift."},{"instruction":"How do you say hello in Hawaii?","output":"Aloha, which is also a movie featuring Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone."},{"instruction":"What’s the capital of Italy?","output":"Rome.

They put more energy into this thought than they put into the work to earn them. So many people who never even touched him fantasized that they were the love of his life. As for me, who used to be free, I fell for his charm when I was young and gave him all my love. But unlike some others, I didn't ask for his attention or give in to him when he asked for mine. I knew I had to protect my honor, so I kept my distance. I had seen enough to know what he was like. His charm was just a mask for his true intentions. But who can avoid trouble just by knowing about it in advance? Who can learn from others' mistakes when our hearts tell us to do otherwise? When we're in love, advice often falls on deaf ears. We don't want to listen to others; we want to experience things for ourselves. It's not easy to resist the things that seem so good, just because others warn us about potential harm. We all have desires that can make us ignore our better judgment. Even when we know it's wrong, we still want to taste the forbidden fruit. I could have told myself that he was a liar. I knew all about his deceitful ways. I had heard about his other relationships and saw how he tricked people using his charm. I knew that his promises were empty and his loving words were just an act. I resisted him for a long time until one day he begged me, \\"Please, take pity on me. Don't be afraid of my love. I promise you, I've never said this to anyone before. I've been invited to love many, but I've never loved or wooed anyone.\\" He went on, \\"All the wrongs you see me do are mistakes of passion, not of my heart. They're not caused by love. Those involved weren't true or kind. They disgraced themselves, and I feel less ashamed by how much their blame includes me. “ \\"Of all the people I've seen, none have warmed my heart or charmed me as you have. I may have hurt others, but I've never been hurt. I've kept others' hearts under my control, but my heart was always free and independent.” \\"Look at these gifts of love sent to me - pearls and rubies red as blood. They represent their love and embarrassment. There are also locks of their hair tied with metal, which I accepted graciously along with their tears. They sent me precious gems and deeply emotional poems, each adding to the beauty and the worth of the gifts. “ There was a diamond - beautiful and strong. A green emerald that could make the weak-sighted feel better. A blue sapphire and an opal that could blend with anything. Each gemstone, described so cleverly, either brought a smile or evoked sadness. \\"All these tokens of passionate love, tender desires and thoughtfulness, Nature has told me not to keep but to give back where I must - to you. You are my beginning and my end. You have to accept these gifts since I'm their alter, and you're my patron.\\""},{"instruction":"I have some horrible writer's block.

They work by heating water to near boiling and routing the steam to a drip area, which disperses water over coffee grounds. The finished brew filters into a pitcher over a warming plate. Depending on the quality of the machine, your coffee may taste either delicious or a bit scorched, but the method is hands-off and convenient. By contrast, French press coffee is usually strong, with a rich, earthy aroma. A French press doesn’t require electricity or disposable filters to brew, just hot water and coffee grounds. The grounds steep directly in hot water, and are then filtered out when the user presses down the plunger. French press is probably the second most hands-off brewing method, after drip.","output":"Both \\"drip\\" and \\"French press\\" are the most common hands-off coffee brewing methods."},{"instruction":"What does it mean when someone says history is written by the winners?

The context and seriousness of war are often forgotten and never fully understood except by the people that lived through it and were directly involved. Stories, both fiction and non-fiction, are told in movies and books about events such as the Holocaust and The Civil War but this is only a very tiny slice of history."},{"instruction":"What is the tone of this review : (explain) This article originally appeared in the October 2016 issue of ELLE. Unhappy people unsettle me. Angry, unhappy people who blame my gender for their problems make me downright anxious. When those people happen to be women, and they identify the proximate cause of their woes as me, or men in general, or society at large (which is usually just their fancy way of saying \\"men in general\\"), I get positively upset. (\\"Oh, so now you're the victim, and people should just suck it up and get over those centuries of suffering and misogyny?\\" my girlfriend asks when I share my feelings on the subject—which seems to me sort of a trick question, and mean.) Which brings me to The Bitch Is Back: Older, Wiser, and (Getting) Happier (William Morrow), a follow-up to the 2002 best-seller The Bitch in the House: 26 Women Tell the Truth About Sex, Solitude, Work, Motherhood, and Marriage. Before I get to my occasional sense of persecution and other ambivalent reactions to the latest book, a few disclaimers: (1) Cathi Hanauer, the book's editor, is an old friend, and I've always considered her kind, hardworking, a talented novelist, a cheerfully solicitous mother, a loving wife (to a lucky guy who wasn't me), and an all-around good egg. It wasn't until I read The Bitch 1 (as Hanauer calls the original collection) that I realized that she was also often pissed off and miserable. She and her fellow travelers had been raised to believe that they could have satisfying careers, loving marriages, and fully integrated and happy lives as spouses, mothers, earners, leaders, and whatever else they wanted to be with the full support of their broad-minded partners and society at large. And then they got jobs and spouses and had children—and got mad. (2) To point out to someone who's suffering that her unhappiness might be less the fault of society and more the result of something she is thinking or doing, well, that's a politically perilous move. Especially when the sufferer is part of a group that actually has been and often still is victimized, double especially when the pointer-outer belongs to the group that has historically been doing the victimizing. Yes, I'm a middle-aged white man. Unconscious privilege on my part? I think not. However, my girlfriend often begs to differ. (3) My uneasiness/wounded feelings/testimony on behalf of The Patriarchy notwithstanding, I enjoyed both books. The writers are smart, engaging, and—even when I think they're blind to their own idiocy or the problems they're creating for themselves—compelling thinkers and storytellers. In Bitch 2, Hanauer's shorthand for the second book, another 25 women (including 9 of the originals) grapple with the life choices they've made and ponder decisions that lie ahead. They wonder if cosmetic surgery is a betrayal of feminist principles or a recognition of professional reality. They explain why they left loveless marriages or put up with sexless ones. They regard a lust-fueled affair, appreciate their homemaker husbands, detail the rationale for declining to cut a Hawaiian vacation short to come home to Mom, who's suffered a stroke. You might not be surprised to learn that I wondered why, if the bitch has already had her say, she was back. When I telephoned Hanauer to ask, she told me Bitch 2 was about women owning their choices. Less about blame, more about taking responsibility. \\"If the first book is about anger and urgency,\\" she said, \\"this book is about wisdom, and the calm that comes after the storm. How did you channel all that anger from Bitch 1? How did you get to a better place?\\" She told me that she herself was less riled up than she used to be, more accepting, if ruefully so. We talked about children and love and the political and the personal and therapy and mutual friends and why I'm not married. Then I told her that while I appreciated the humor and insight in the book, I didn't think the women from Bitch 2 were all that calm. I detected an undercurrent—still—of man-blaming, a sense that 14 years later, heterosexual marriage was still to these writers about as good for them as oleander. That many still viewed men as clueless at best. The happiest women in the book, I observed, seemed to be the one whose husband handled the child-rearing and homemaking, the single woman who wrote that \\"you need to be a whole person to invite someone into your life,\\" and the lesbian who rediscovered her love for her wife while traveling in Paris. Hanauer said that she too noted the emotional generosity in those three essays, as well as the lingering bad-mouthing of men. Did any instances particularly stick out? she asked me. Actually, they did—and so I read a few aloud to her, including these two gems: \\"Men, by and large, demand more care and attention and daily propping up than dogs, and only the very best of them give a dog's worth of love back.\\" \\"During my pregnancy, I carried around phantom husbands. You will not be surprised to hear that one was supremely unhelpful.\\" \\"Men can't write that way about women, can they?\\" I asked Hanauer when I finished. \\"We're not allowed to, right?\\" I mean, I got it. There was a lot of vile woman-hating out there, particularly online and anonymously. And yes, I didn't know what it felt like to be a woman, when something as simple as walking to the grocery store felt like dodging a group of two-legged predators. But c'mon, did it help anyone for women to engage in the generalized gender-bashing that they'd seen men indulging in their whole lives? Hanauer laughed. \\"That's absolutely true,\\" she said. \\"Women can say things about men that men can't say about women, especially if the men are married. Why? I don't know if men are nicer, or more polite. Or if women are the underdogs, so we get to say shit. The enlightened men don't trash their wives in public, and if they do, it comes off as horrible, but if women [trash their husbands], it's like, 'You go, girl.' \\" That wasn't right, I thought. That wasn't fair. But then, what did I know?","output":"Balanced - The author of this article, who is a man tries to understand things from the woman's perspective.

I was swimming at the pool that day as I normally do on the weekends, and I remember seeing the elderly man come into the pool to do his laps. I knew this man, as I had seen him every weekend when I would go swimming there at the pool. I did not know him personally, but he did seem friendly and we would wave and say hi to each other in passing. On this particular day, I saw the man do a lap in the pool, go underwater, and then not come back up. I began to worry as about 10-20 seconds had passed and he never surfaced. I decided to check on him, and when I swam to him I saw he was lying on the bottom of the pool, appearing to be unresponsive. I dove down to the man and pulled him up to the surface and started doing CPR on him. Luckily, medics responded quickly to our location and take over chest compressions and rescue breaths. One of the medics told me that I did a good job doing CPR on the man and that it may have saved his life. The medic also told me that they were able to get a pulse on the man and that they would transport him to the hospital for evaluation. I just wanted to write this letter to let you and your readers know that I was extremely proud of the work the medics did in applying life-saving measures to the man.

But it was unclear how early in their lives the shrimp could use this weaponry. “We knew that the snapping shrimp did this really impressive behavior,” Harrison says. “But we really didn’t know anything about how this mechanism developed.” While a grad student at Duke University, Harrison and his adviser, biomechanist Sheila Patek, reared bigclaw snapping shrimp (Alpheus heterochaelis) from eggs in the laboratory. At 1 month old, the tiny shrimp — less than a centimeter long — began firing their claws when disturbed. The researchers took high-speed video footage of these snaps and calculated their speed. The wee shrimp could create the collapsing bubbles just like adults. Despite being a tenth the adults’ size or smaller, the juveniles’ claws accelerated 20 times as fast when firing. This acceleration — about 600 kilometers per second per second — is on “the same order of magnitude as a 9-millimeter bullet leaving a gun,” Harrison says.","output":"These shrimp fire their claws at a speed of 600 kilometers per second.

It's hard for chickens to fly, you know, our rotund midsections weigh us down, but we can catch some air. Once I've made it atop the crates, I should be able to hop onto the fence post and glide down into the front yard. From there, I'm free at last.

First of all, I'm going to cross the road. I've gotta see what the hype is all about. Then, I'm going to waddle down the sidewalk in the direction the sun sets. I've heard a rooster hollering in that direction and I think I'd like to make a new feathered friend. Hopefully, things go well with the roo and maybe I'll break him out of prison too. We could scavenge together, making a picnic of worms, crickets, and anything we can find. I'm not saying I will do it, but IF things don't go as planned or I get homesick, I think I can find my way back home. But jumping back into the yard could be problematic. I suppose if it comes to that, I could just wait on the front porch for the humans to find me and scoop me up. Of course, I wouldn't let them win so easily. I'd make them chase me around the front yard first. Anyway, that's the plan and tonight's the night. Now, I've gotta go fill up on mealworms. I'm going to need all the stored energy I can get.

Caesar countered this by ambushing Pompey's \\"hammer\\" element with a hidden fourth line of infantry;[5] Pompey's infantry was to be the anvil while his cavalry 'hammer' encircled Caesar's left flank. There was significant distance between the two armies, according to Caesar.[6] As the infantry of Caesar advanced, Pompey ordered his men not to charge, but to wait until Caesar's legions came into close quarters; Pompey's adviser Gaius Triarius believed that Caesar's infantry would be fatigued and fall into disorder if they were forced to cover twice the expected distance of a battle march. Also, stationary troops were expected to be able to defend better against pila throws.[7] Seeing that Pompey's army was not advancing, Caesar's infantry under Mark Antony and Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus started the advance. As Caesar's men neared throwing distance, without orders, they stopped to rest and regroup before continuing the charge;[8] Pompey's right and centre line held as the two armies collided. Caesar countered this by positioning the reserves of his 4th line to intercept the attacking cavalry. As Pompey's infantry fought, Labienus ordered the Pompeian cavalry on his left flank to attack Caesar's cavalry; as expected they successfully pushed back Caesar's cavalry. Caesar then revealed his hidden fourth line of infantry and surprised Pompey's cavalry charge; Caesar's men were ordered to leap up and use their pila to thrust at Pompey's cavalry instead of throwing them. Pompey's cavalry panicked and suffered hundreds of casualties, as Caesar's cavalry came about[9] and charged after them. After failing to reform, the rest of the Pompey's cavalry retreated to the hills, leaving the left wing of Pompey's legions exposed to the hidden troops as Caesar's cavalry wheeled around their flank. Caesar then ordered in his third line, containing his most battle-hardened veterans, to attack. This broke Pompey's left wing troops, who fled the battlefield.[10]","output":"Pompey the Great expected the pila employed by Julius Caesar’s troops to be used as throwing weapons. He consequently ordered his troops to refrain from charging, in part to better defend against them. The hidden fourth line of infantry Caesar employed against Pompey’s cavalry did not throw their pila, but instead used them as thrusting weapons."},{"instruction":"How do I paint my room?","output":"Why do you want to paint your room and what color are you thinking?"},{"instruction":"I need a change and think it will freshen my space with the color blue.","output":"What shade of blue are you thinking light or dark?"},{"instruction":"I just want the steps to paint my room.","output":"Ok first properly prepare the space.

They are having 2 pieces of toast.","output":"Once upon a time, there lived a brown bear living in a house in the forest. The bear had fur as brown as the bark on the trees. Its claws were as sharp as a chef's favorite set of knives. One day the bear was eating breakfast in the morning. He decided before going out for the day that he would like two slices of toast. With his sharp claws, he sliced two slices of bread off a fresh loaf that he bought from a neighbor bear. The brown bear added light butter to the bread before placing the bread in the toaster. The bear liked his toast crispy, so before pressing down the button on the toaster, he turned the knob to six. After pressing down the switch on the toaster, the bear decided to clean himself up and get ready for the day. He walks outside and grabs a bucket of water from the well. The water would be his beverage alongside the toast. He places the bucket on the table and sits down, waiting for the eventual moment that the toast is ready. *Click!* The toast pops out with gusto, and the brown bear places the two pieces of toast on a plate. The surface of the toast was a golden brown, like fresh honey from a bee's nest. The bear grabs a knife, and some strawberry preserves from the shelf. He slowly slathers the toast with the preserves and relishes in the sound of the knife scratching alongside the toast. It felt like pure bliss, like when you realize you've done a job right. With the preserves on the toast, the bear takes a big bite out of it. The taste of toasted bread and artificial strawberry flavor sent the bear to another world of enjoyment. The bear takes a sip of the well water, washing down the intense flavor and confirming that he made the right choice today. After devouring the second piece and chugging down the rest of the water in the bucket, the bear cleans himself up and prepares himself for the day ahead. Toast and strawberry preserves were the perfect way to start the day."},{"instruction":"Create a recipe article for dessert nachos.

Maybe you are a chocolate lover, or maybe you prefer fruity sweets. If you are feeling especially health conscious, then you can use fruit instead of candy toppings. Suggested Ingredients: - Enough nacho chips to cover a plate - Chocolate, strawberry, or caramel syrup - Whipped cream - Skittles - M&Ms - Reese's -Fruit Nachos are a relatively easy dish to make, so I will not go overboard with instructions. First, you should heat the chips in the microwave for about 10 seconds. Next, you will want to add the syrup of your choosing. This will be the replacement for cheese in this recipe. It will allow everything to stick to your chips. Next, you should add the candy of your choice. You can choose to mix up the chips slightly so that your chips are covered in toppings. Last, you will want to put a healthy topping of whipped cream on top. Remember that this recipe can be customized in any way that your cravings demand. Have a happy pregnancy!"},{"instruction":"Write me a poem about Harry Potter.","output":"The Wizarding World is where you'll find me In the Chamber of Secrets And the Deathly Hallows Fighting for what is right At Hogwarts is where the magic happens with the Whomping Willow Raise your wand and bow your head Dark magic is a costly death Watch your step and do not tread The Forbidden Forest is worse than death Wands at the ready Slytherin versus Gryffindor Don't forget the rest Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff But who is truly best?"},{"instruction":"Write a concerned letter from me, to the Brentwood Homeowners Association, about the hit-and-run accident that happened last Friday, injuring a 80-year-old. People are always getting struck by cars in the neighborhood, and I've even seen animals get injured due to wreckless drivers not obeying the 45mph speed limit. The letters' purpose is to ask for the speed limit to be reduced to 35mph, and that speed humps be installed on the busiest streets in the subdivision. Say something about wanting \\"our\\" kids to be safe. Right now kids can't even ride their bikes, mention that too. Outline the reasons, starting with hyphens, why the speed humps will be advantageous to the residents. The reasons are: speed reduction, drivers are more aware at slower speeds, kids will be safer, and it will keep the drivers car safe from damage, you can elaborate on these points to make them sound better. Keep it under 350 words, though, and sign it \\"Janie Briggs\\".","output":"Brentwood Homeowners' Association, I am writing this letter in regard to the recent hit-and-run accident that occurred last Friday in our subdivision, involving an 80-year-old resident. This was not the first accident that occurred in our subdivision, and it won't be the last unless we address the matter appropriately. There has been an ongoing safety concern for some time now, with the speed limit on our streets at 45mph, which drivers carelessly ignore. Many residents complain about their children not being able to even ride a bike because they fear for their safety, which is understandable. I have personally witnessed innocent animals fall victim to the wreckless driving as well. It's time to take action! Our neighborhood is not safe anymore, and we need to step up to enforce new rules, and implement additional features to reduce speeds. What I am requesting is for the HOA to install speed humps in the areas with the most traffic that have proven to be a concern. I feel it is also important that we change the speed limit to 35, which is the standard for neighborhoods this size. The speed humps are beneficial because: -The humps cause drivers to slow down considerably, at a rate of 10-15 mph. This encourages drive responsibly, and increases the safety of residents. -Drivers who slow down are more aware of their surroundings, and more likely to read the signs posted near the humps. -If drivers ignore the humps, they are likely to damage their vehicle. -Our children are less likely to be hit by a car if this safety feature is installed. I am very optimistic and hopeful for the installation to take place, to reduce the hazards we are now experiencing. Please take into consideration these additions that I have outlined for the safety of our residents. Sincerely, Janie Briggs"},{"instruction":"Please write a story that involves a goldfish and a shark who are best friends and are going to play darts together at an underwater casino.

Every Monday and Thursday, they would go to the local underwater casino. There, Ralph and Finley usually hung out and talked for hours while playing darts. Today was Thursday, so Ralph and Finley headed to the casino. They played darts for hours. Ralph won the first game of cricket, a dart game where the goal is to hit the same number on the dartboard three times. Finley absolutely crushed Ralph in the second game of cricket, leaving Ralph with only three total points. Finley cleared the rest of the board. The third game came down to the wire, with both Ralph and Finley within 10 points of each other for the entire game. Ralph eventually lost when Finley hit the 11 on the board to leapfrog Ralph for the win. Just as Finley had won, a blind electric eel challenged Finley to a game of cricket, declaring that the winner would get 500 dollars. Finley agreed. Given that the eel was blind, Finley let him go first. The eel threw the first dart, hitting the bullseye. Finley looked at Ralph and Ralph looked at Finley. They knew right then that they were in trouble. The eel's second shot hit the bullseye, too. Then the third. The eel cleared the board without giving Finley a single point. Finley and Ralph, stunned, asked the eel how he managed to hit every point on the board. The eel laughed and said, \\"Don't worry about it. It's all a bit of luck, I'm sure.\\" Finley and Ralph left the casino that night feeling like they got hustled. They never saw the blind eel again."},{"instruction":"Write this article so that a third or fourth-grader would understand it. ALEXANDRIA, EGYPT — Bassma Mohamed stares at her reflection in the giant mirror hanging on the studio wall. Dressed in all black except for the purple on her glasses, she is focused and unwavering in her determination to follow her ballet teacher and perfect every plié, relevé and tendu. Her mom, wearing a denim skirt and green headscarf, is huddled with a group of other mothers crowding the doorway, watching with pride as she jumps and twirls. When Bassma meets her mom's eye, she winks at her and smiles. There is nothing out of the ordinary at this small ballet studio in Egypt, except many of the dancers have special needs, including Bassma. “These aren’t just my ballerinas,” says their teacher, Haidy Samir. “They are my daughters. Their mothers are my sisters. We’ve been together for years, we travel together, we eat together, we are family.” Arts Studio, perched inconspicuously between a makeup store and a bakery in Alexandria’s Smouha district, opened in August 2022 with one goal: to create a space where anyone, no matter age or disability, can fulfill their dream of dancing ballet. Haidy Samir teaches ballet at the Arts Studio. She pitched the idea to make it inclusive for those with disabilities. Owned by lifelong ballerina Noha Wasfy, Arts Studio is one of — perhaps the only — facility in the Mediterranean city that does not segregate special-needs students. Of the 70 dancers enrolled, 10 have special needs, including autism and Down syndrome. The inclusive space is a rarity in the region, where people with special needs don’t have many opportunities to live full lives or integrate with the wider community, especially after they complete their schooling.","output":"Bassma Mohamed is looking at herself in a big mirror in a big room.

James' first class started at 8:00 AM each day, so to get to school he needed to be on the bus by 7:30. But today James woke up late and missed the bus! He ran outside with his backpack only to see the bus already headed off down the street. Since his parents had already gone to work, James knew that he had to come up with another way of getting to school on time. He hopped on his bicycle and took off in the direction of the school. He knew the route well enough to get there but he wasn't sure if he could get to school fast enough. When he was halfway there, James started to think there was a chance he could make it. Suddenly, the bike's tire ran over a nail and popped! Now what could he do?! James was sure he wouldn't make it to class on time without his bike but he also wasn't one to give up. He abandoned the bike and started running down the street. He checked his watch and saw that he only had ten minutes left, and yet he was still far away! James stopped and panted and tried to catch his breath. He was sure he wouldn't make it to class on time now. Then a truck pulled up next to James. The man driving the truck rolled down his window and explained that he saw what had happened and had placed James' bike in the bed of the truck. He asked James if needed a ride somewhere and James said \\"Yes, I need a ride to school.\\" The man obliged, and when they arrived the man set the bike outside so that James could retrieve it at the end of the school day. James thanked the man and ran inside the school building. After all that trouble, he had made it to class right on time after all."},{"instruction":"I am looking for some poetry recommendations.

We played an excellent first half. We're only down by 10 points, but that's because they caught a run down the stretch using plays that exposed our man in the paint. They're switching the assignments on us pretty regularly, and I think that's what's making it hard to defend. The next half is gonna require us to fall back to our basics. We're gonna go back to the box-and-one, and any time they wanna penetrate, the help needs to close the box quickly. That means our man in the paint will be able to double-team the forwards when they try to go to the basket. Trust me, guys. You're playing excellent ball. The other team is just throwing everything they can at us to see what sticks, and, credit to them, some of what they're doing works. But we're hip to what they're doing now, and once we revert to the box-and-one the defense will be able to make the stops we need to keep them in check. Offense-wise, we're doing everything we wanted to do. Our shots are falling, and as soon as they decide to screen we're already rolling to the basket for the easy give-and-go layups. Keep doing what you're doing on offense; don't change a thing, just keep plugging away, and we'll be back on top. Overall, just keep doing what you're doing. We're in great position. Once the time comes to pull away, we'll be able to do it—just need to adjust the defense and keep scoring at will like we've been doing so far. Bulldogs on three. One, two, three!

People should “avoid contact” with a famous beluga whale to avoid accidentally injuring or killing it, the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries has said. The whale, nicknamed Hvaldimir, shot to international fame in 2019 after it was spotted wearing a specially made harness with mounts for a camera, leading experts to believe the whale may have been trained by the Russian military. Since 2019, it has “been traveling along the Norwegian coast” with a few stops along the way, according to the directorate, which added that Hvaldimir “tends to stay at farms where it has been able to catch fish, grazing on surplus feed.” Hvaldimir is known to follow boats and play with those on board. The whale, which is a protected species in Norway, now lives in inner Oslofjord, the directorate said. This “means that it has arrived in a very densely populated area, and the risk that the whale may be injured due to human contact has become significantly greater,” it added. In a statement on Wednesday, Fisheries Director Frank Bakke-Jensen said that “so far there have only been minor incidents where the whale has suffered minor injuries, primarily from contact with boats.” But he urged people to keep their distance, “even though the whale is tame and used to being around people.” “We especially encourage people in boats to keep a good distance to avoid the whale being injured or, in the worst case, killed by boat traffic,” said Bakke-Jensen. Given the dangers, Bakke-Jensen was asked whether the whale should be placed in captivity. “We have always communicated that the whale in question is a free-living animal and we see no reason to capture it and put it behind barriers,” he said. However, now that the whale is “in a more vulnerable area and access to food may be limited, we will consider different measures,” added Bakke-Jensen. “But it is too early to say anything concrete about that yet.”","output":"Agent Hvaldimir checking in. I have been spotted by the Norwegian government. The Director of Fisheries has ordered people to \\"avoid contact\\" with me. Publically it is stated this is to avoid injuring or killing me. Despite my efforts, I have become something of an international celebrity after I was first spotted in 2019. Onlookers took note of my specially made harness and camera mounts. Leading experts then publically declared that I may have been trained by the Russian military. Since 2019, I have been traveling along the Norwegian coast, making a few stops at places of interest. I make sure to stay at farms where I can feed and refresh to better prepare for my duties. I also follow suspicious boats and lure them into a false sense of security with my playful nature. I have learned that I am considered a protected species in Norway, no doubt why I was assigned to this area. I am currently in inner Oslofjord. This is a very densely populated area. There is a lot of opportunity to gather information here, but it is also very dangerous for me. So far I have only suffered minor injuries from boats. Hopefully, the government's warning to keep away from me will serve me well and protect me from further injury. I fear being lost in the line of duty due to the boat traffic in the area.

What are some of the abilities that would work for them?","output":"Sure, I can help you brainstorm such a character's abilities. Here are some that may make them a useful addition to the player's team: 1. Maneuver: This ability would allow the character to traverse enemy-controlled tiles without inciting attacks of opportunity. It would allow the player to outflank the enemy or to get at a guarded enemy or objective. 2. Blink: By blinking, the character can teleport a short distance directly to a tile in front of them. This would allow the character to bypass defenses and obstacles that would have otherwise taken several turns to break down. 3. Sneak Attack: As a flanker, the character would specialize in doing their best work behind enemy lines and from advantageous positions. Their skillset would not only include abilities that would allow them to get to such advantageous positions but also to maximize their advantage when there. Sneak Attack, which could ensure a guaranteed critical on the next attack by the character, would fit well into this role. 4. Caltrops: The character can toss caltrops upon the ground, slowing or outright immobilizing enemies caught in them. This would help to redirect enemy movements and to prevent more powerful enemies from catching up with the character. 5: Sucker Punch: When cornered by a formidable enemy, Sucker Punch can disable them for one turn, rendering them unable to perform attacks of opportunity. This would be ideal for getting out of danger from a more powerful opponent. 6. Second Wind: By activating Second Wind, the character can regain their movement points. This would allow the lightly equipped skirmisher character to traverse the entire map easily, suiting their role as a flanker.

The Dimension of Whispers, a place where words might turn into ethereal wisps holding secrets and predictions, was their first visit. The team used their proficiency in languages to solve intricate puzzles and uncover hidden messages that lead them to the locations of forgotten knowledge. They then traveled to the Dimension of Mirrors, a place where reflections came to life. The gang ended themselves stranded in a hall of mirrors, chasing their own reflections and running across cunning doppelgängers. To break the enchantment and escape unharmed, the team required all their clever thinking and teamwork. The ship entered a starless abyss in the Dimension of Eternal Night, where darkness reigned unchallenged. Glowing creatures emerged from the depths, their bioluminescence guiding the crew in the direction of the fabled Luminara Crystal, a brilliant gem with the ability to shine light into the darkest corners of the universe. The crew's journey brought them to the Dimension of Dreams, a place where imagination was supreme. Their desires and worries manifested in vivid shapes as they came across colorful creatures and fantastical environments. The group discovered the importance of embracing the unexpected and holding onto their dreams throughout the chaos. They discovered an ancient civilization frozen in time, eternally trapped in an eternal moment, in the Dimension of Timeless Sands. The group uncovered the key to unlocking time's flow, bringing life back to the frozen metropolis, and revealing the secrets of bygone periods with their keen intellect and creativity. The team faced many challenges during their voyage, including dodging dangerous storms in the Dimension of Tempests and outwitting crafty tricksters in the Dimension of Illusions. Nevertheless, they stayed together, their friendship and dedication carrying them through each difficult circumstance."},{"instruction":"Can you write a glossary covering the different types of coal and information about coal?","output":"Coal Glossary 1. Anthracite: The highest rank of coal. It is a hard and shiny coal with high carbon content and low volatile matter. 2. Bituminous: A type of coal with a high heating value, commonly used for electricity generation and steel making. It appears smooth and shiny with alternating layers. 3. Subbituminous: A dull and black coal with moderate heating value, often used in electricity generation. 4. Lignite: Also known as brown coal, lignite is the lowest grade coal with low heating value and high moisture content. It is mainly used for electricity generation. 5. Peat: The precursor to coal is a soft material consisting of partly decayed plant matter. Under pressure and heat, this transforms into coal. 6. Mining: The process of extracting coal from the Earth's crust. This involves underground or surface mining methods, depending on the depth of the coal deposits. 7. Coal Ash: The residue left after coal is burned in power plants. Ash contains various minerals and can be used in applications such as cement production. 8. Coal Seam: A layer of coal embedded within sedimentary rock. Coal seams can vary in thickness and quality, and they are the main source of coal extraction."},{"instruction":"Provide a brief description for how to play the card game Solitaire.","output":"The objective of the game Solitaire is to organize the cards based on suit. The playing area is called a tableau which consists of seven card piles. Four foundation piles are needed, one for each suit that runs from Ace to King. The stockpile is the set of cards not being used to create the tableau. The game begins with a deck of 52 shuffled playing cards. Begin by creating your tableau, placing one card for each of the seven piles. In descending order, place additional cards on the piles so that the first pile has only one card, the second has two, and so forth with the last pile having seven cards all face down. The remaining cards are placed in a stockpile at the top of the board. Begin play by turning over the top card on each of the seven piles. Look at the face-up cards, if there is an Ace, move them above the tableau and form your first foundation pile. If there are no aces, rearrange your cards by moving only the face-up cards. On your top card, place a card under it that is of a value less and alternating color. Continue placing cards on the piles until you can no longer move. Ensure that you arrange in descending order from King to Ace. Also, make sure that you can see the card on top of each stack meaning that it should face up. And if you move it, don’t forget to turn over the card beneath it. When you run out of moves, use the cards in the stockpile. Flip the cards over either three at a time or one at a time. There can also be only a certain number of times you can go through your stockpile to make the game more challenging. If you have hidden cards, make sure that you make moves that will uncover them until you can hold, grab and put them eventually in the slot you desire."},{"instruction":"I’m going around the world this summer and my grandmother has been asking me how I’m going to do it and what my travel plan is.

It had all of the elements that women like myself find alluring: gossip, decadence, and the age-old good vs evil aspect, where the underdog in me wants the 'good guys' to win in the scenario. That being said, I ended up feeling rather disappointed for the following reasons. Entire chapters were devoted to what seemed to be promotional marketing. Products and services were described so excessively that they consumed page upon page, even entire chapters. It came across as an infomercial in book form. I couldn't help but wonder if Wednesday had stock in these goods and services. Another disappointing aspect was the political tone that it seemed to take at times. It is so much more pleasant to read from an unbiased author who can keep a neutral tone. I was expecting to be entertained and not indoctrinated.

I also want plants that are resilient to weather changes and take minimum effort to grow.","output":"Thank you for your question! I have found some garden plants that match your request. 1. Lettuce: Lettuce does well in Idaho because it can withstand frost fairly well. It is also low maintenance, requiring little watering and can grow in any type of soil. It doesn't require a lot of space, so it is great for any garden size. 2. Peas: You don't have to worry about the interaction of peas and other plants. They grow well among all plants and don't hinder the health of other plants. They thrive in cooler temperatures, meaning you can plant them early in Idaho and harvest them into late fall. They don't need much space and are a relatively hardy plant. 3. Tomatoes: Tomatoes produce well in Idaho's summer climate, making them low maintenance. They can also do well even if planted in low-quality soil. They will need a stake or vegetable cage for support and to keep the wind from damaging them. 4. Green Beans: Beans do well in Idaho summers because they are drought resistant, needing little water and doing well in direct sunlight. They also enrich the soil. Grow them once you're sure the risk of spring frost is gone. They do well growing up poles, meaning they don't need a lot of room. All gardens require some amount of work, but these plants should be relatively easy to cultivate in Idaho.

Matt just wants to welcome everyone but feels miserably misused.","output":"They say trust is a two-way street, but I'm starting to feel as though it might be a dead end. I've always tried to make the most out of my life as a doormat. For the longest time, I sat in a department store with my fellow mats, and they would say, \\"Matt, you're such a great guy\\" and \\"Matt, you're one of the best.\\" I felt like the best, too, beaming my \\"Welcome\\" for everyone to see. I was a symbol of hospitality. Then, Jen and Dion took me home. They seemed like a great couple, and from what I heard, they were going to set up their new home for the first time. I remember how excited I was to cross the threshold and see that open space. Where, oh, where would they put me? Perhaps hung up on the front door to welcome guests or propped up on a table by the stairs. All I knew was that people would see me and feel welcomed into the home. At least, that's what I assumed. I was put on the ground while the couple explored the house; it was only temporary, of course. After the couple got over their giddiness of going through the entire home, they came back to the pile of boxes they'd brought in. They both agreed to get started unpacking, but before they did, Dion picked me up. \\"First things first,\\" he said with a twinkle in his eye. This was it! He was going to put me in a place of honor. I was a little confused when I was unceremoniously dumped outside right in front of the door, right in the footpath of anyone entering or exiting the home. Did they not understand my peril here? The door suddenly swung open and Jen drove her high-heeled shoes straight into me. Dion was soon to follow, stepping outside and closing the door as they went to collect the rest of the boxes from the car. My misery was only compounded over the next few weeks. The couple hosted a housewarming party. Hour after hour, guests traipsed in and out of the home, stomping on me without remorse. I was a tool to them, I realized then, resigned to my fate. Nothing but an accessory to be trodden upon, to wipe off the dust outside."},{"instruction":"Let's create a linux task manager in python!

Elements of each pair represent the number of people that get on the bus (the first item) and the number of people that get off the bus (the second item) at a bus stop. Your task is to return the number of people who are still on the bus after the last bus stop (after the last array). Please keep in mind that the test cases ensure that the number of people in the bus is always >= 0. So the returned integer can't be negative. The second value in the first pair in the array is 0, since the bus is empty in the first bus stop.

Emotional or expressive: Abstract art is often intended to convey emotion or express an idea or concept. Focused on form and composition: The form and composition of the artwork are often more important than the specific objects or scenes depicted. Non-literal: Abstract art does not depict objects or scenes in a literal way, but rather uses symbolic or metaphorical elements to convey meaning. Intuitive or spontaneous: Abstract art is often created in an intuitive or spontaneous way, rather than following a preconceived plan or set of rules. Non-traditional: Abstract art often breaks with traditional representational techniques and conventions, and may include unconventional materials or techniques.","output":"Abstract art uses forms, colors, and lines to symbolize emotions, ideas, and meanings.

They spend most of their time finding the best spot to relax, interact and engage with the other tank mates. 2. Goldfish eyes can detect ultraviolet and infrared rays. In addition, instead of seeing a combination of three different colors like humans, goldfish eyes can see a blend of four different colors. The primary reason behind this additional feature is to help them hunt for food in their surroundings. However, their eyes are on either side of their face, creating a blind spot in the middle of their face. 3. When it comes to their vision, they cannot see very far ahead in the water. Also, they don’t have eyelids, which prevents them from closing their eyes. So, even when they are sleeping, their eyes remain open. So, if you have a pet goldfish, we’d recommend switching off the light in the water body to ensure they get good sleep. 4. Due to consistent cross-breeding, goldfish have mutated and evolved in terms of their genetic structure, color, and appearance. As a result, over 200 different types of goldfish species are available. 5. Like humans, goldfish taste their food before they gobble things down. So, when you offer them food inside the aquarium, you will often find them nibbling on the food before they wipe it out. And a unique fact about goldfish is that they taste with their lips and not their tongue. The majority of their taste buds are on their lips. Goldfish don’t have a tongue. 6. Although goldfish look very delicate, they are adamant and hardy. Even with a change in the water parameters, they can easily sustain the rough conditions. They can quickly acclimatize themselves to the change in water pH, temperature, and living conditions. 7. They have their teeth in the back of their throat. Also known as pharyngeal teeth, goldfish are the only species on Earth with their teeth at the back of their throat. Like the standard functionality of the teeth, they help in grinding down the food for easier digestion. 8. Surprisingly, there is no “average” size to a goldfish because they can dramatically vary in size. Most of the time, a goldfish grows depending on the tank size. If kept in a smaller tank, they will have lesser growth, but when kept in larger aquariums. In the wild, a goldfish can grow up to the size of an adult carp. 9. Goldfish don’t have a stomach. Instead, they typically digest their food through different parts of the intestine. So, the duration of the digestion is relatively more minor, leaving them hungry quite frequently than most of the other fish species. 10. As adorable and innocent as they look, goldfish are invaders. This means they will quickly take over the native species when you leave them in the wild. So even in captivity, it is essential to choose suitable tank mates for them. They are very prolific cross-breeders too, which results in drastic genetic mutations where they live.","output":"1. Do goldfish have brains? Surprisingly enough, goldfish have brains.

Here is an article with some information: Easter is known as a time to celebrate the end of the Lenten season and the resurrection of Jesus on Easter Sunday. But for young kids especially, Easter also means candy and eggs full of treats from the mystical and magical Easter Bunny. With all the excitement might come endless questions — where does the Easter Bunny come from? Why does he bring us candy and eggs? How old is he? And most importantly, what does a bunny have to do with the religious holiday? While legend has told us that the Easter Bunny is a long-eared, cotton-tailed creature who hops from house to house to deliver festive baskets, there's more about his history that you might not be familiar with. Before you break out the delicious Easter desserts and begin your annual family egg hunt, take a minute to learn about the Easter Bunny's connection to this special Christian holiday that goes back to pagan traditions. Find out where the character comes from, how a rabbit became associated with Easter eggs and how he came to be such a beloved symbol for kids over the years. As Christians probably already know, the Bible makes no mention of a mythical hare who delivers eggs to children on the day of Jesus Christ's resurrection. So, why exactly has a rabbit become a prominent part of one of Christianity's most important celebrations of rebirth and renewal? One theory, according to Time, is that the symbol of the rabbit stems from the ancient pagan tradition on which many of our Easter traditions are based — the festival of Eostre, which honored the goddess of fertility and spring. The goddess's animal symbol was a rabbit, which have long traditionally stood for fertility due to their high reproduction rates. As for how the character of the Easter Bunny made its way to America, History.com reports that it was first introduced in the 1700s by German immigrants to Pennsylvania, who reportedly brought over their tradition of an egg-laying hare named \\"Osterhase\\" or \\"Oschter Haws\\" from the Old Country. Legend has it, the rabbit would lay colorful eggs as gifts to children who were good, so kids would make nests in which the bunny could leave his eggs and even sometimes set out carrots in case the hare got hungry. Remind you of any other holiday traditions? Eventually, the custom spread across America until it was a widespread Easter tradition. Over time, the fabled bunny's delivery expanded from just eggs to include other treats such as chocolate and toys. Easter baskets have only gotten more and more elaborate over the years, as one trip to the store this year will tell you.","output":"According to the article, the origin of the easter bunny starts with the rabbit symbolism seen in the pagan spring and fertility festival of Eostre, which influenced many Easter traditions. The Easter Bunny was introduced to the United States around the 1700s by German immigrants who spread the legend of a bunny laying colorful eggs for well-behaved children."},{"instruction":"Create a couple of paragraphs of about 150-200 words talking about walruses and walrus facts for a kindergarten class?","output":"Have you guys ever seen a walrus before? No? Here’s a picture of one. Walruses are mammals. And you can see that they have very long tusks, which look like teeth but are actually used to break holes in the ice so they can breathe! Walruses also use their tusks to help haul themselves out of the water onto the ice and even to fight other walruses! So where do you think walruses live? That’s right, in and around the ice. In fact, walruses migrate, which means they move with ice floes. But walruses never move too far away from land because that’s where their food lives. They eat mollusks and other animals that don’t have backbones. They can go deep into the icy water to eat. Some walruses go as deep as 20-30 meters, which is 100 feet, or almost 20 adults long! In the Arctic, people have always used walrus meat to eat, and they carve the tusks to make art and trade them with other people."},{"instruction":"Can you write the plot of a video game series?

What are some good websites that I can use to showcase my work and spread my brand?","output":"Promoting your art can be hard. It's much more than simply selling art. Many creatives have trouble building the courage to put something they make online. Creatives need a thick skin when showing off something they created with love. That being said, it doesn't need to be difficult. Posting online is a great first step, so congratulations! When you think about marketing yourself online, selling things should be the last thing on your mind. Connect with enough people, and the rest will fall into place. There are many websites to help you do this, so here are a few suggestions. 1. Instagram - Instagram is a wonderful tool for organically reaching a wide group of people. It is an image and video social media platform on which you can share fully finished works or even progress updates. Some artists even record themselves working and make videos played at faster speeds to show a full beginning to end in a short digestible video. 2. Reddit (Related Subreddits) - Reddit can be a great place to submit your art, provided you go to the right sections. There are dozens of subreddits that can be beneficial to an up-and-coming artist. The community is moderated, but because it is an open forum, you might run into some trolls. 3. Deviant Art - If you are into concept art and digital art, Deviant Art is the place to be. It has a huge community where you can follow other artists and comment on each other's work. An artist's Deviant Art page often also acts as their portfolio when applying for jobs. 4. Pinterest - Pinterest is more of a visual search engine than a portfolio or social media page. If you put your work up on Pinterest, then others can pin it so they can add the post to their collection. They can even re-pin it so it reaches even more people. 5. Wetcanvas Forums - Wetcanvas is an art-specific forum. While Reddit is a forum with thousands of different topics, Wetcanvas is a place solely for creative art. It is a wonderful place to connect with like-minded artists, get feedback on recent work, or ask for advice on anything you may be stuck on."},{"instruction":"Who is Michael Jackson?","output":"Really?

For college students, stress relief can take many forms online: shopping, ordering food, gaming with friends and meeting new romantic partners. And now they can add hanging out with therapy dogs to that list. Virtual canine comfort is emerging as a successful way for students to reduce their stress as they interact with therapy dog-handler teams. Because they are nonjudgmental, engaging and welcoming, interacting with therapy dogs can be used as a complementary intervention that reduces student stress which may encourage students to seek more formal support services if needed. Once introduced on campus, the interest from students typically surpasses most programs’ abilities to meet the demand. Even prior to COVID-19, being a college student was considered a stressful experience; college administrators have increasingly been seeking innovative ways to encourage students to safeguard their mental health. Spending time with therapy dogs is one proactive way for students to chip away at potentially debilitating levels of heightened stress. In-person canine visitation programs or canine-assisted interventions are themselves a relatively new way for students to enhance their well-being. Programs such as the University of British Columbia’s Building Academic Retention through K9s (B.A.R.K.) program at the Okanagan campus was established in 2012 as a way for students to reduce their homesickness, decrease their stress and foster interpersonal connections. Analysis of the world, from experts Several randomized controlled trials out of the B.A.R.K. lab, and elsewhere, now attest to the efficacy of spending time with therapy dogs to elicit a host of well-being outcomes. Restrictions on in-person sessions saw the B.A.R.K. program collaborate with human-animal interaction researcher Christine Tardif-Williams’ pre-recorded virtual canine comfort modules. We set out to conceptualize, design and deliver a series of virtual canine comfort modules that mirrored, as close as possible, the experience of students in an in-person canine visitation session. These sessions consisted of a trained dog-handler team following a script that saw handlers welcome students and encourage reflection around stress reduction and mindfulness. Students were also asked to reflect on their social support networks. Students could access these modules remotely, which support the well-being of students who are geographically isolated or in areas where well-being resources are overtaxed or nonexistent. The modules are posted online on a platform that students (and others) can access without needing to sign-up for an appointment or join a waitlist. The University of British Columbia’s B.A.R.K. program studies how canine therapy can support students and others. Stress reduction Prior to releasing these modules, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess how the modules would affect students’ self-ratings of stress. We assigned 467 undergraduate students to either synchronous (via Zoom) or asynchronous (pre-recorded YouTube videos) five-minute sessions that invited them to observe a dog—handler team or a handler-only condition. We assessed well-being before and after the sessions using measures like anxiety, loneliness, connections to others, positive and negative affect. We found that all students, regardless of condition, reported significant pre-to-post improvements in self-reports of most well-being measures. However, the conditions in which the therapy dog was present elicited the most significant reduction in self-reports of stress. Although additional research is needed, these initial findings are encouraging. They support the contention that, for students for whom attending in-person sessions are not an option, accessing virtual canine therapy modules can offer a momentary reduction in stress. Unlike in-person sessions that are scheduled at the convenience of program personnel, virtual canine comfort modules may be accessed as needed by students. Further, college instructors can make use of virtual canine comfort modules as part of “brain breaks” incorporated into a lecture to encourage students to reflect on, and take care of, their well-being.","output":"B.A.R.K., or the University of British Columbia's \\"Building Academic Retention through K9s\\" is a program established at this university's Okanagan campus in 2012. The main focus was to overall reduce stress, reduce homesickness, and to develop personal relationships with these canines. With the increase of online courses, B.A.R.K. ran several trials to see if therapy dogs would make an impact somehow in online classes. The results from these trials showed many outstanding benefits for students and their mental health, including; - Reduced feelings of Anxiety. - Reduced feelings of loneliness. - Improved connections with other classmates. These results have come from self-reports of well-being from the students."},{"instruction":"I need a costume idea for a party can you give me 3 ideas?

She picks up a handful of grass and throws it at me. Her younger sister does the same, and tufts of dead leaves, sticks, and pebbles fly in my direction. Their mother doesn’t stop them. At the halfway point in the afternoon, one by one we are unchained and taken to the park’s bathroom. When I wash my hands, I get my first look at my new self in the mirror. My ears and eyes are too big and my head is too small. I don’t recognize myself. There’s nothing of me that stares back in the reflection. None of it seems real. Two girls my age—not prisoners, real girls—come in and start to fuss with their hair and makeup. They catch me staring at them, and they also see the guard behind me, gripping my clothes so I can’t run away. They go silent, and when I am yanked back out to the chain gang, I can hear the laughter burst out of them. It sounds like the laughter that’s burst out of me when I’ve made fun of someone I didn’t care about hurting. I don’t know those girls, I say to myself. None of this will get back to my friends.

Cyborg guards, their cold metal frames accentuated by glowing red eyes, patrolled the compound with unwavering vigilance. They were a menacing presence, a stark reminder of the unforgiving nature of this dystopian facility. Amidst the eerie silence, a mother sternly admonished her two young daughters, drawing their attention to Bella, a girl who stood out as an outcast among them. The girls, their innocent curiosity overcoming any sense of fear, taunted Bella, pelting her with debris as their mother passively observed. The laughter of the children, echoing through the desolate surroundings, mirrored the cruelty that permeated the very essence of the boot camp. As the afternoon sun reached its zenith, the prisoners were momentarily unchained and escorted to the park's bathroom. It was here that Bella caught a glimpse of her altered reflection—the unfamiliar features, with oversized ears and eyes, betrayed any remnants of her former self. The sight was disorienting, a stark reminder of the sacrifices she had made in this futuristic hellscape. In the midst of this unsettling encounter, two girls of similar age, unbound by imprisonment, entered the bathroom. They preened themselves, tending to their hair and applying makeup, their actions a stark contrast to Bella's constrained existence. The guards, ever vigilant, stood behind Bella, a constant reminder of her captivity. The girls fell silent, their gaze meeting Bella's, and an unspoken understanding passed between them. The laughter that erupted from their lips was laced with derision, reminiscent of the cruel laughter Bella had once indulged in, oblivious to the pain inflicted on others. Alone with her thoughts, Bella sought solace in the realization that these strangers held no connection to her past life, offering a glimmer of hope that her torment would remain confined within the confines of this futuristic boot camp. But such small comfort did little to alleviate the relentless repetition of her daily existence. Days blurred together as new recruits replaced those who graduated or were expelled from the program. Sundays brought mandatory chapel sessions, while the other days were consumed by schoolwork and addiction therapy. The latter involved laboring through thick workbooks, where the detrimental effects of drugs were expounded upon, and participants were tasked with introspection and listing the individuals they had harmed. Despite doubting the genuine scrutiny of her notebooks, Bella and her fellow prisoners diligently completed the exercises, aware that any transgressions could amplify their suffering. The weight of her circumstances pressed heavily upon her, yet a steadfast resolve emerged—an internal mantra repeated incessantly: \\"I can endure six months of this.\\" The alternative—a three-year prison sentence—loomed as a daunting specter, compelling Bella to find strength in the belief that she could persevere through the arduous ordeal that lay ahead."},{"instruction":"What did you do today?","output":"I went to the mall today and like we were playing truth or dare.

In 1985, the New York Times Magazine featured a shoeless Jean-Michel Basquiat on its cover. Titled “New Art, New Money,” the piece it ran with was ostensibly about the artist, but its focus was really the vague concept of the “art star”—a celebrity who not only made a lot of money (largely unheard of), but who didn’t care if others knew how much money they made (terribly uncool). Art stars, the article said, went to the Midtown New York hotspot Mr. Chow, a trendy watering hole that doubled as a place to be seen and a place to have a drink. That made Basquiat quite unlike Jackson Pollock and his contemporaries, whose clubhouse, the West Village Cedar Tavern, was described as “grubby” and anonymous. Often spotted beside Keith Haring and Andy Warhol, Basquiat would show up to Mr. Chow decked out in an Armani suit. He’d drink kir royale and socialize with the art-world elite. At the time of writing, he was 24. He had gone from selling drawings for 50 in 1980 to selling canvases “at a brisk pace—so brisk, some observers joked, that the paint was barely dry,” the article said. Basquiat said he worried he had become a “gallery mascot.” Not everyone knew what to make of the young Black man and his frenetic, rebellious paintings, but everyone wanted to be associated with him. Everyone still does. Despite his outsized reputation, Basquiat’s career did not last long—he died at 27 of a heroin overdose in 1988. According to Phoebe Hoban’s book Basquiat: A Quick Killing in Art, the artist left behind “917 drawings, 25 sketchbooks, 85 prints, and 171 paintings.” Nevertheless, that oeuvre has become one of the defining ones of the 20th century. In May 2016, one of his “Head” paintings sold for 57.3 million. The following year, Untitled, a Basquiat from 1982, sold for 110.5 million at Sotheby’s, setting a record for an American artist. The dealer Jeffrey Deitch, who gave the eulogy at Basquiat’s funeral, said after the sale that the artist was now in the “same league” as Pablo Picasso, meaning—maybe—that Basquiat’s prices were buoyed by a similar alchemy: limited supply, raw talent, and a fascinating biography. And his work is getting the major surveys it deserves, too—one focused on hip-hop and his paintings is now on view at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston.","output":"Journalist: Today we're joined by the famed artist Jean Michel-Basquiat.

Pressure to be seen. Pressure to be heard. Pressure to be understood. The pressures of using my passion for my livelihood stripped me from creating freely. The fear of the unknown kept me from creating an empty tank. When I gave birth to my miracle babies, all the fears, the trauma, and the burnout hit me head-on. I was afraid of embracing true joy because I felt undeserving. I felt immense guilt about taking time away to adjust to such a pivotal moment in my life. I worried that people no longer cared, my voice didn’t matter, and with the social media pressure, I felt like I had to run myself dry in order to be heard. I was drowning, and all I could think was no one cared. Last year after finally acknowledging my need for support, I stepped away from the pressures of social media and gave myself the chance to heal. I gave myself the opportunity to rest without guilt. I realized then that the things that once brought me joy sucked the life out of me. Not because they were no longer joyful but because it became something I depended on for my livelihood, for income. As I step back into art and writing, I am finding myself taking slow steps toward it. I no longer want to create from a space of pressure. I want to create from passion. I want to create from purpose. and even if that means starting from scratch, taking breaks, sacrificing income, it’s worth it.

Find community theatre groups - One way to get yourself into the community theatre scene is by joining local theatre groups. You can search for local community theatres on google or google maps, although they don't always have websites so they can be tricky to find. Once you locate a local theatre, go to its website if it has one. If you want to act, you can try to find an auditions page on the site. If there isn't a site, you could also look for the theatre on Facebook. 2. Get notified about auditions and events - You can also find ways to get involved with community theatre by getting notified about events and auditions. You could sign up for their newsletter or by looking for upcoming auditions or events for community theatre groups. You can also ask via e-mail. 3. Volunteer - There is more to theatre than just acting. There is also set building and painting, prop management, costuming, makeup, an entire crew, and more. If you want to get involved but aren't ready to act, volunteering for one of these positions can help you become part of the group. 4. Audition - In community theatres, you don't always need experience. They're also typically looking for new people to act with them, with very little experience. You can start auditioning for smaller or non speaking parts and when you get comfortable, work your way into larger roles."},{"instruction":"Who is the fastest typer in the world?","output":"The record for the fastest typing speed is 216 wpm (words per minute), which was achieved by Stella Pajunas in 1946.

Quicksort is an efficient, general-purpose sorting algorithm. Quicksort was developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959[1] and published in 1961.[2] It is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. Overall, it is slightly faster than merge sort and heapsort for randomized data, particularly on larger distributions.[3] Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. For this reason, it is sometimes called partition-exchange sort.[4] The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting. Quicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a \\"less-than\\" relation (formally, a total order) is defined. Most implementations of quicksort are not stable, meaning that the relative order of equal sort items is not preserved. Mathematical analysis of quicksort shows that, on average, the algorithm takes � ( � log ⁡ � ) O(nlog {n}) comparisons to sort n items. In the worst case, it makes � ( � 2 ) O(n^{2}) comparisons.","output":"Quicksort is a way of organizing a list of numbers so that they are in order. It is one of the most efficient ways to sort a list of numbers, and it is often used in computer programs. Quicksort works by picking a number in the list, called the pivot. The other numbers in the list are then compared to the pivot, and they are put into two different groups: the numbers that are smaller than the pivot, and the numbers that are larger than the pivot. The numbers in each group are then sorted using the same method. This process continues until the entire list is sorted. Quicksort is a very efficient algorithm, and it is often used in practice. However, it can be slow for small lists."},{"instruction":"I am an artist who has a lot of acrylic paints. Describe to me in the form of an email how to restore dried-out acrylic paint.","output":"Dear [Recipient's Name], I understand how hard it is to keep acrylic paint fresh and useable, especially if one of your favorite colors dries out. If you store your paints correctly, they can last for years! I have discovered that you can revive dried acrylic paint, and it only takes a few steps to do so! Get some warm tap water. Also, have an old brush on hand and a small container to mix the dried-up paint in. If you plan on reviving acrylic paint, you should use it immediately and not store it away in a container and forget about it. Mix the warm water with the dried paint inside the container. Use the brush to cover the paint with the water applied. It will need to sit for a few minutes. You will notice the water will be colored by the paint. From here, add a little more water, but not too much or else you may wind up diluting the paint. The ideal ratio for mixing paint should be one part paint and one part water. Alternatively, use a popsicle stick or a small wooden dowel to mix the paint if you don't have an old brush readily available. I hope these tips help!

The updated appearance included a disproportionately sized plastic head, although The Burger King seemed to have an otherwise normal-looking human body. As soon as his character’s remodel made its television debut in a 2004 commercial, audiences were quick to label him creepy and the general public seemed disinterested in him. Fast forward to the year of 2021, where The Burger King has reigned for nearly two decades in spite of those early criticisms. Now, he seems to have taken a method-acting approach to his character by employing himself as the manager of an actual Burger King in West Hollywood. There, The Burger King makes odd requests and demands his “subjects” do as they are told (no matter how ridiculous the ask is). For example, when customers enter the restaurant, The Burger King’s employees must quickly produce a tiny plastic horn on which they should perform an “entrance song fit for royalty.” Outside of harassing employees and making their work life worse, The Burger King also has ideas on how the restaurant should operate. First, he suggested Burger King’s beloved chicken sandwich should be accompanied by a poultry item called the “Ch’King.” No one knows what that is supposed to mean, but it is far easier to just wait out his mistakes and let them fade versus trying to change his mind. The Burger King even went as far as to make his employees perform a dance on video that was “sure to go viral,\\" in a promotional effort.

From her bedroom on the second floor of her family’s home in Amherst, Massachusetts, Emily Dickinson reimagined the form and cadence of poetry in the United States. After her death in 1886, and particularly after the first posthumous edition of her poems appeared in 1890, she became a legend, magnetic in her draw but persistently and speculatively revised by both those who knew her and those lured to her enigma. With hindsight, her trajectory seems inevitable. The oft-withdrawn, colossally—albeit quietly—prolific Dickinson was a riddle to the handful of contemporaries who knew of her or, in rare instances, claimed a closer intimacy. Even then, her reputation as a reticent, well-cultivated wit enkindled feverish mythologies of eccentric spinster genius.","output":"Q: Where did Emily Dickinson write her poems from?

Please give me five options I could go with, and tell me a bit about them.","output":"I can do that! Here are five classic supernatural creatures you might want to incorporate into your story. 1: Vampires: Vampires have been used in mythology and stories for centuries, and there have been many iterations of them. Their lore tends to be that they are undead creatures of the night, with long fangs used to drink blood, and they can often turn into bats. Some versions of vampires created for stories or present in mythology are allergic to garlic, burned by sunlight, and can only be killed by a crucifix. 2. Werewolves: Another classic supernatural creature often presented as a mortal enemy of the vampire is the werewolf. The werewolf is a creature that presents as human most of the time but, on a full moon, turns into a wolf. Depending on the story, this may be a classic version of a wolf or it may be a more monstrous version. Legends often say that if someone is bitten by a werewolf on the full moon, they will then turn into one. 3. Ghosts: Ghosts are also supernatural creatures and subjects of many stories, and are typically humans who did not pass onto the afterlife, leaving a form of them stuck wandering the earth. Ghosts may be friendly to humans or not. There are many other names for ghosts, such as specters, spirits, and poltergeists (who are usually evil ghosts). 4. Mages: Mages are humans who have been gifted with the ability of magic, also called witches, wizards, and sorcerers. Mages may be good, evil, or inherently neither in a story, and the magic they can do may vary. Sometimes, mages are not separate creatures at all but humans who have learned to do magic. They may also have animal familiars, though this is typically for witches. 5. Demons: Born from religion, demons are also supernatural creatures that are sometimes used in fictional stories. They are creatures who have come from Hell, and may or may not have been human a long time ago, depending on the iteration of them. They are there to cause chaos and even harm to humans and usually make good villains in a story."},{"instruction":"Extract the names of all official Greek games mentioned in the article below. If there is a certain god or goddess the games were held in honor of, put that god/goddess name in parentheses after the game's name, The ancient Greeks, who staged the first formal Olympic Games in 776 B.C., gave the world the idea of organized big-time sports events as entertainment for arenas full of spectators. More than that, they were the first culture in which people idolized their favorite athletic superstars, to a level that even today’s most fanatical sports fans might find extreme. The Greeks also simply loved to watch competitions. In addition to the Olympics every four years, they held games at other religious festivals—the Pythian Games for Apollo at Delphi, the Isthmian Games for Poseidon and the Nemean Games, which honored Zeus. The Crown Games, as these competitions collectively were known, featured a range of events, from chariot races to track and field events and combat sports. The athletes who competed in these events most likely were well-to-do Greeks who could afford to train instead of having to work for a living. “If you wanted to compete in the Olympics, you had to show up at least a month early to train under the watch of the officials, who presumably would weed out anybody who wasn’t up to the level of competition,” Lunt says.","output":"Olympic Games Pythian Games (Apollo) Isthmian Games (Poseidon) Nemean Games (Zeus) The Crown Games (Apollo, Poseidon, Zeus)"},{"instruction":"Please write a horror passage about a woman’s dead body found on the side of the road by an unsuspecting couple.

Her naked body was exposed for them all to pity her; her death was a spectacle, although the media circus had yet to begin. Who was she? Everyone wondered.

Create a title for each paragraph along with a catchy title for the article.","output":"See How They Run Beautiful, strong, and intelligent, the cheetah holds the world record as the fastest land animal. But what makes these big cats so fast? Through discovery and observation, scientists have uncovered the secrets behind their incredible speed. Faster Than We Thought? For a long time, scientists thought that cheetahs ran faster than they actually do. In 1957, they set 70 mph (112 km/h) as the cheetah's average speed, with the maximum possible speed between 50 and 80 mph (between 80 to 128 km/h), but not all scientists agreed. Then in 2012, Sarah, an 11-year-old cheetah living at the Cincinnati Zoo, ran 330 feet (100 m) in just 5.95 seconds. Her top speed was 61 mph (98 km/h). How They Hunt One fallacy that hung around for quite a while was that cheetahs hunted at full speed. However, after tagging cheetahs with GPS collars and watching them hunt, two 2013 studies proved that cheetahs run at lower speeds. They use short bursts of speed for a few seconds before dropping down to a lower speed. One of the studies measured the average speed range at 25.7 to 40.9 mph (41.4 to 65.88 km/h) and the maximum speed at 57.9 mph (93.24 km/h). The researchers divided the hunt into two phases. At the start of the hunt, cheetahs run at full throttle to overtake their prey, then slow down as needed. The cheetah's acceleration power gives it a decided advantage over its prey. A Running Machine Cheetahs were designed to be the speedsters of the animal world. Their arm and leg bones are as long or even longer than a human's femur and humerus. The small narrow heads, long supple spines, and slender bodies are aerodynamic, making them cut through the air like greased lightning. Cheetahs are packed with fast-twitch muscles they use for fast acceleration. They also have a larger-than-usual rib cage that lets them breathe faster and deeper and helps keep them cool."},{"instruction":"Write a two-paragraph fictional story about an octopus teaching an English class.

The class sat in stunned silence. Professor Octonomus used a few tentacles to slide through each row of students. He shook everyone's hand, four at a time. Some students squeaked when they touched him, amazed by the slimy yet strong tentacles. After introductions, the professor pulled out a pad of paper and pens. He gestured to a young nervous boy in glasses in the front row. He pointed to his face and then the paper and pens, the student, Jerome, knew he was being asked to pass them out. Jerome passed a piece of paper and a pen to each student. Everyone's paper was titled \\"10 things you didn't know about the Octopus\\". The students became engrossed in reading facts about their diet, exoskeletons and ink defense when a small bell came from the front.

At the early age of three, she showed a strong yearning for education, to which her parents happily supported her, happy to buy books and discuss all sorts of scientific ideas with her - those that she could grasp at such a young age. It was no surprise when she skipped kindergarten and also no surprise when she excelled in every grade she was in thereafter. She was taking college courses during her high school years, and it wasn't long until she graduated college with her Master's in Engineering and Science, with honors. Eager to get to work, she was invited to work at the Lab of Theoretical Sciences and jumped at the opportunity. There, she worked with her peers to run tests, verify, and even create new inventions (or improve older ones). One of her lesser-known contributions is her work on improving the lifespans of apples, giving them twice as much time before they rot and become unfeasible for human consumption. However, it was here that she would work on her biggest invention, the Eternal Popcorn Generator. As a result of previous work, they had discovered certain wormholes and dimensions they could access, if often for brief times. One of these dimensions was one filled with an unlimited amount of popcorn, already popped and never-aging until they were brought into our dimension. Working with a small team, they created an appliance that could tap into this dimension with the flip of a switch, as long as enough electricity was supplied to keep the portal open. And so she was paid trillions for her idea and scientific knowledge and became one of the richest people in the world. In her final years, she retired to a lakeside home, where she continued her research on her terms. She was able to learn much about the different dimensions and their applications but never had quite the same breakthrough that went into the Eternal Popcorn Generator. Eventually, old age caught up to her, and in a bed surrounded by many of her closest friends, relatives, and young scientists she inspired, she passed away.

Although they normally were at war with each other, this meeting would be peaceful. They were there to discuss uniting against the VIKINGS who had wreaked havoc on their villages. These RAIDERS and pillagers had plunged the land into absolute chaos. The eldest chief began to speak, but a strange sound in the distance distracted the men. It sounded like chanting, and it was getting closer. Suddenly, they spotted the source. It was a parade of townspeople marching across the field. Some of them carried wooden statues of SAINTS on their shoulders. Others waved banners. The tribesmen were on edge, but they stood their ground as the townspeople approached. Finally, one chief yelled out, \\"Who are you? What do you want with us?\\" The townspeople stopped chanting but continued to walk forward until the two groups came face-to-face. One of the townspeople introduced himself: \\"I am the mayor of the nearby town. We are here to join you.\\" The tribesmen were puzzled. The eldest spoke on their behalf. \\"Our tribes live in camps in the highlands. We have never been welcome in your town. Why do you wish to join us?\\" The mayor replied, \\"We know why you are meeting here. You wish to ally to face the invaders. These GIANTS from foreign lands can't be defeated alone. So you wish to join forces to battle them. We wish to do the same. Let us all work together to defend our homeland.\\" The tribesmen looked at each other and nodded their assent.

Suddenly his mother entered the room. \\"So there you are!\\" she said, all upset. \\"So there you are! Have you seen your horse?\\" Mario turned red, and then the color drained from his face. \\"What? My what, mamma?\\" \\"Your horse got loose in the garden again and destroyed a bunch of stuff.\\" To Mario, it seemed as if the universe were crashing down on top of him. \\"But ... how?\\" he managed to say. \\"But ... how?\\" \\"Well, I don't know how,\\" his mother answered, \\"but you can't say I haven't warned you! Now, your dad...\\" \\"But I tied him up! I know I did!\\" And as Mario quickly got dressed, his hands shook, and everything he saw was blurred as his eyes filled with tears. When he got to the garden, it was a real disaster. Never had the horse dared to do so much damage. This time he had not only trampled the flowerbeds and knocked down a trellis, but also carried his mischief to the point of uprooting and pawing with his hoof several rare carnations, arranged in an elegant pattern. \\"What have you done? What have you done!?\\" And, as if in a dream, and almost without knowing what he was doing, Mario knelt on the damp ground and began to feverishly replant the flowers while crying \\"Ugh!\\", and \\"You naughty thing!\\" The horse, meanwhile, stood still with his head down, the halter loose, and a certain air of cynical indifference about him. Like a sleepwalker, as if treading on a soft mattress, Mario led the horse by the halter down the middle of the wide, sloping road lined with towering poplars, which ended there, at the white picket fence that opened on the immensity of the wild fields. Looking at the horse sadly, he let him out and shouted, \\"Go! Go! You must Go!\\" Mario cried harder and harder as his beloved horse galloped into the distance."},{"instruction":"Change the steps of these instructions into a list of bullet points and preserve the headings.

I clutched the box like I was hugging a newborn baby. The corners started digging into my face because I was hugging it so hard. The cashier thought it was a little weird, but I didn't really care. Time to head home. I arrived home and cleared the table of all debris. I placed the Victrix Pro FS box on the table and went to look for a pair of scissors. Then, after grabbing the pair of scissors, I start to unbox the arcade stick. The first step was getting the arcade stick out of the box. I slowly cut through the circular stickers that were sealing the box. Each snip of the scissors sounded heavenly as I was one step closer to opening the box. Once the stickers were cut, I put the pair of scissors down for a job well done. I slowly open the box, being careful not to tear it. Each flap is another step toward my grand goal. Once the box is open, I see a purple bag being kept in place by two cardboard holders, one on each side. I gradually slide the bag out of the box, again taking care to not rip the box along the way. Once the arcade stick is out, I put the box to the side and take the cardboard off the side and put it into the box. The only thing left was the purple bag. It was made of a tough, polyester material. It couldn't stand in my way. I undress the arcade stick and see the most beautiful thing. The silver finish on the body.

Drift fishing is a common method where the angler casts a line upstream, lets the line drift down through the run or pool, and then reels in the line to start the process over again. You can drift fish from the shore or an anchored boat. Generally, the idea is to weight your setup so it bounces along the bottom, touching every foot or so, at approximately the same speed the current is moving. More weight will slow down the speed at which your bait drifts downstream and less weight will speed up the drift. The usual strategy is to work the entire run from the shore closest to you to the shore furthest from you, and from the upstream end of the run (near the end of the riffle) to the downstream end of the run (near the start of the next riffle) (Figure 1). Under crowded conditions, you may simply have to work your way into a line of anglers and fish right where you are, without moving. Cast upstream at a 30-45 degree angle and let your bait bounce along until you reach a 45-30 degree angle downstream. Reel in and do it again. Your goal is to bounce your offering along the bottom until a fish picks it up with its mouth.","output":"Drift fishing involves casting a weighted setup upstream at a 30-45 degree angle from a shore or anchored boat, letting the line drift down the run to a 45-30 degree angle, then reeling in the line and repeating.

She had long golden hair that flowed down her back in soft curls. Her sparkling green eyes shone like emerald gems. She wore a warm smile and had a heart full of kindness and curiosity. One day, while playing in her backyard, Lily discovered a beautiful flower. It was unlike any other flower she had ever seen before, with petals as big as her hand and colors that shimmered like a rainbow. As she got closer to it, she realized that it was emitting a strange and magical glow. Without thinking twice, Lily reached out and touched the flower, and in an instant, she was surrounded by a bright, dazzling light. When the light faded away, she found herself standing in a mysterious and enchanting garden, filled with mythical creatures, beautiful flowers, and fairy dust floating through the air. As she explored this magical place, she discovered that the iridescent rainbow flower she found was anything but ordinary. It had the power to grant wishes and make dreams come true. She looked around and noticed a group of fairies crying out for help. The fairies’ village was under attack by an army of goblins, and they had nowhere to turn. With courage and determination, Lily took up the flower and charged into the fray. With each wish she made, and each magical spell she cast, Lily grew stronger and fiercer, defeating the goblins one by one. Her golden hair shone brighter, illuminating the dark sky, and her eyes sparkled with powerful magic that even the goblins could not withstand. Just as the final goblin was defeated, Lily turned to see the grateful fairies cheering her on. She was exhausted and exhilarated, but she realized that her magical flower had given her the power to overcome her fears and become a true hero. Lily returned home but realized that the magical flower had also taught her a valuable lesson – that with belief, hard work, and a little bit of magic, anything is possible."},{"instruction":"Please write a short story for me that depicts Gerry's mother making his cherished snack of chocolate-chip cookies and allowing him a single portion. Later, while his mother is not present, Gerry attempts to take an excess of cookies from the jar, but cannot remove his hand while holding them all. Ultimately, he comprehends that greediness is fruitless and releases all the cookies except for one, deducing the ramifications of taking more than what is allotted and how it can impede us from relishing what we already possess.","output":"One day, Gerry’s mother made his favorite snack – freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. After they had sat on the rack to cool, his mother put them in the cookie jar. They smelled divine, and Gerry’s mouth began to water. “Can I have one?” he asked. “Of course,” his mother replied. “But only one, alright?” When she left the kitchen, Gerry went over to the cookie jar and stuck his hand inside. As he was doing so, he realized his mother was no longer around, meaning there was nobody there to stop him from eating more than one cookie! So Gerry wrapped his fingers around a bunch of cookies and tried pulling his hand out. But try as he might, his fist was now too big to come out of the cookie jar! He struggled a bit, pulling and maneuvering, but he couldn’t free his hand. Finally, he let go of all the cookies except one. He was able to slip his hand out of the cookie jar. As he nibbled on the chocolate chip cookie, he thought, “I guess there’s no point in being greedy, because you can’t have everything.” And he was right! When Gerry stuck to his share of cookies, he was able to take his hand out of the jar.

Unfortunately, misinformation and stigma around the issue often lead to suicides. We want to offer informative advice on how to prevent suicide. 1. You CAN Make a Difference People often overlook this. You CAN make a huge difference and do helpful things to prevent suicide. Learn about it and inform others about the warning signs. You can use available resources so people who are at risk receive support and help. 2. Explore All Your Treatment Options Therapy, peer support groups and many other treatments can help improve your mental health. Discuss these treatments with your doctor and find the right treatment plan. And we can’t say this enough – don't be afraid to ask for help. You don't have to face this alone. 3. Recognize Warning Signs and Respond to Them Suicide tendencies almost always have warning signs like a lack of interest in activities, withdrawal from social connections, sudden mood shifts, impulsivity, and hopelessness. Try to identify and intervene before a crisis arises. Be an active listener and help connect them with professional help. 4. Speaking Up Can Save Lives Talking about suicide will not trigger someone to become suicidal. Open and honest conversations about suicide create a supportive environment and give hope to people who’re on the edge and struggling with their mental health. In the end, being considerate and inclusive goes a long way when it comes to suicide prevention. People often need external support to realize there’s more to life than they think.

I hate this place. Outside my cramped box of an apartment, the temp is a cookin’ at 120F degrees. The low buildings of the sprawling city fade into a gray haze, and the sound of jet airplanes constantly booming overhead overwhelms the drone of traffic on the nearby highways. My box sits adjacent to the canal, alongside which runs the railroad. Either side of the canal is a barren stretch of gravel and dirt that runs its whole length through the city, pock-marked with debris and tents for the homeless. On days like this, looking down the length of the canal, all one sees is a blurred mirage cast from the sun-baked earth. Inside my cramped, messy home, staring at the door, I stand parcel in hand. I need to head out into that oven. Earbuds in, stinking of layers of freshly-applied sunscreen, I go out. For all the issues afflicting my run-down apartment, it at least does a good job of keeping this hellscape outside. The moment I step forward I am filled with second thoughts. The heat presses against me from all angles, and my earbuds only partially stifle the cracking sonic booms. “Delivery?!” Dan shouts. I turn toward Dan. He looks at me, laying on his cot inside his tent, drenched in sweat. A veteran from the Pacific conflict thirty years ago, he lives in his tent beside my apartment. A mixed bag of a man. Some nights when it’s cool I’ll sit outside and chat with him for a bit. When he’s not having one of his episodic fits, he’s decent enough for company. “Yeah, delivery,” I shout back. “That sucks,” he says. Or at least I assume that’s what he said, I couldn’t quite hear it. I nod at him and turn to start my day. Only one job in the queue, 240. This job might feed me for the week, but I’ll need to cross my fingers for some more work soon or I might become Dan’s roommate. Sweat is already beading on my forehead, and I haven’t even taken a step. Three miles, one parcel. I hate this place.

King's Landing was besieged by a tyrant and nearly razed, but Arya survived that as well. But now, after twelve long months, two old friends were reunited. Arya returned from adventuring to visit Bran, and she happened to cross paths with Gendry in the Red Keep. \\"Gendry, what are you doing here?\\" Arya said, with shock rippling in her voice. Gendry, the Lord of Storm's End, was equally surprised as he stammered out a reply. \\"Business I'm afraid. A lord's work is never done. But y-you, how are you, Arya?\\" Arya stood there looking up at him and wondering just how the boy she knew grew to be this man. She recalled all the time they spent together evading capture, and that one night before the white walkers attacked. Her cheeks began to blush. Gendry's cheeks were flushing too as he reminisced just as fondly. The two were always friends, and for a time, they were more. But it didn't last. Nothing good ever lasts in Westeros. \\"I'm fine, Gendry.\\" Arya spoke in hushed tones. \\"I'm just here to see Bran. I set off on my own but I just couldn't escape the feeling that what I needed was a home.

The sakura bloomed and welcomed in new students while seeing off the old students who had outstayed their welcome. I was part of those old students. I held my diploma in hand and watched friends and acquaintances whom I'd known for so many years saying their final goodbyes. Sure, some of us would go to the same universities. Some of us were still neighbors and would talk during holidays. Those who were closest might remain friends despite the distance. However, the distance was undeniable. With our graduation, something had changed in us all. We were no longer simply students waiting for the seasons to turn. We were adults now. We would surely have our own worries and responsibilities before long. As I scanned the faces there, I recognized that feeling in everyone's faces. They knew that nothing would ever be the same. They knew they'd likely never see most of these people ever again. For some, it was a sad thing. For others, it might have meant very little. I knew it meant a lot to me, though. I wanted to stay close with my friends. I wanted to meet them during the holidays and talk about that one time during the cultural festival during our second year of high school or the camping trip that was a disaster for this reason and that reason. I wanted to remember how things were together fondly, even though they were tragedies at the time. There was so much that I wished would stay the same.

Antisemitism and hatred towards Jews did not end with the Holocaust and are on the rise today, meaning antisemitism is still a problem. Antisemitism is expressed in speech, writing, visual forms and action, and employs sinister stereotypes and negative character traits. Antisemitic acts can be criminal when they are defined by law. Criminal acts include but are not limited to, attacks are selected because they target Jewish people or are linked to Jews.

Blue: Blue is a commonplace color among brands because it exudes dependability and trustworthiness and naturally tends to put people at ease. 2.

Green: Green can be incorporated into branding to induce impressions of prosperity, growth, and success. Green is often used to publicize new products or to associate with environmental, health, and wellness brands. 4.

Chandler recommended using currant or crab-apple jelly. What really made the sandwich popular was that during World War II, peanut butter and jelly were on the military list of rations. With peanut butter being shelf-stable and transportable, grapelade (grape jelly) also portable and sweet, plus newly available pre-sliced bread--peanut butter and jelly became a huge part of the U.S. soldier's life. Once those soldiers came home, peanut butter and jelly sales skyrocketed.

Marching ducks forming a line, Quacking as they all align. Mooing sounds straight from the cow, They sure do love their morning chow. Oinking pigs are eating hay, The muddy pit is where they lay. The herding dogs will play and run, Soaking in the springtime sun. The barn holds cats that nap all day, Sometimes coming out to play. Wooly fur grows on the sheep, Birds nearby go chirp and cheep. Llamas prancing all around, Chickens pecking at the ground. The noises from the busy farm, There’s nothing quite like rural charm.

Please make it close to 300 words.","output":"\\"Welcome, brave heroes. We summoned you here to aid in our war against the Demon king,\\" a priest unironically dressed in tacky robes said. I stared at him and the others around me in disbelief. A moment ago I had been walking home from school with Shinpei, Taka-kun, Shiori, and Mio-san. We were just walking down the sidewalk the same as always when a strange light shone from beneath our feet. It was blinding, and when I could see again, I stood in a cathedral with a magic circle at my feet. Taka-kun asked, \\"Where are we? What's going on!\\" \\"Please, remain calm. We aren't here to hurt you. We will explain everything slowly and answer any questions you may have. But if you would, please,\\" the priest said, motioning another young man to step forward with a glass ball. \\"Set your hands on this ball one at a time, please.\\" We did so, and it lit up, displaying projections that detailed information about us. Afterward, the priest explained. \\"We summoned you here from another world to serve as our heroes in a battle against the Demon king. You all have just been assessed for your stats, magical attributes, and unique skills. As an example, Taka-sama is skilled in wind magic and has a unique skill, called Dead Eye. He will make for an excellent ranger.\\" None of us believed this at first, but it was true. We had been sent to another world. I could use magic better than any of the others. My skills were wildly more powerful than my friends when it came to magic. However, I was sorely lacking in any other stats. We had no choice but to believe that we had come to another world and were now the rumored heroes that had to wage war."},{"instruction":"Write a letter home from the perspective of a man in Africa having trouble with a workforce and feeling as if he has failed.","output":"Darling, I hope this letter finds you well. I apologize that I haven't been able to write as of late. I fear that the workload here has begun to take its toll on all of us. Talla tells me he is noticing many of the men struggling with morale, and suggests we address it before the week is out. I feel the elements are to blame. There is only so much we can do to accommodate these men, but I'm afraid it is not enough. They are sleeping in the dirt and I mean that literally, with nothing more than a canvas tent to protect them at night. Couple that with the heat and you have miserable working conditions that no one in the world should have to endure. We reached out to Norrington, but he declined additional funding to build barracks. We responded by asking for cots to at least get the men off the ground, but he refused that request as well. In response, Benjamin, and myself have talked about removing the cots from our tents, but Talla advised us that would not change anything. He cheekily stated that we should keep to cots because we will need all the rest we can get to prepare for the day these men decide to blame us for their fates. He said it with a smile, but I'm not convinced it was a joke. Talla is a good man and wise man. His people listen to him and without him here I think this task would have been impossible. Ben and I discussed moving working hours to the evening when the sun went down to help combat the heat exhaustion, but Talla quickly vetoed the idea stating that not only would the number of injuries go up due to the lack of artificial light at night, but that if the lions in the area weren't already a big enough headache to worry about, they certainly would become one. I came here to change the world. To do something great with my life. To lead men and become someone you can be proud of. I do not know if any of this will come to fruition. Please, tell the children I love them and that if things don't get better here in the next few weeks, I may be coming home earlier than expected."},{"instruction":"I have some javascript code that makes a box fall straight down.

Please put it into a bullet list. Neuschwanstein Castle is a 19th-century historicist palace on a rugged hill above the village of Hohenschwangau near Füssen in southwest Bavaria, Germany, near the border with Austria. The palace was commissioned by King Ludwig II of Bavaria as a retreat and in honor of composer Richard Wagner. Ludwig chose to pay for the palace out of his personal fortune and by means of extensive borrowing, rather than Bavarian public funds. Construction began in 1869 but was never fully completed.

The source text is as follows: Choose and Prepare Containers Choose a relatively large, tall pot when growing a rose bush. Many experts recommend a pot no less than 15 inches in diameter. Roses send down deep roots, so the taller the container, the better. The soil in pots heats up faster than garden soil, so clay pots are generally better than plastic since clay is slower to transfer heat from the sun into the soil. If you must use plastic pots, use lighter colored plastic, which won't heat up as fast as dark plastic. Make sure the pots have ample drainage holes in the bottom. Prepare the Potting Soil Create a potting soil mixture consisting of one-third quality commercial potting soil, one-third garden compost, and one-third composted manure. Add a cup of perlite to enhance drainage. Add 1 cup of bonemeal to the soil mixture. If you wish, you can also add fishmeal or blood meal for added nutrients, but be careful not to over-fertilize, which can burn roots. Plant the Rose Fill the pot about two-thirds full of prepared soil mix. If planting a bare root rose, mound the soil up in the center, then place the rose over the mound and spread the roots out over it. If planting a potted rose, just create a slight indentation, then remove the rose from its nursery container and place it into the pot. Loosen the roots if the plant is root bound. Fill in around the rose using the remaining potting soil, pressing it down firmly around the roots. The soil surface should be just slightly beneath the bud union—the point where the rose is grafted to the rootstock. Place your potted roses in a location that gets at least seven hours of direct sun each day. On patios and decks, this may mean moving the pots around over the course of the day to keep them in the sun. If you are growing groups of potted roses, keep them spaced at least 2 feet apart to ensure good air circulation. Water Thoughtfully Immediately after planting, water the plant thoroughly so that all the soil is well saturated. After planting, keep an eye on your roses so you know when to water. A good general rule of thumb is to water when the top inch of the soil surface feels dry. Fertilize as Needed Repot Every Few Years Except for miniature roses, most roses grown in pots need to be repotted every two or three years, since they are heavy feeders that quickly exhaust potting soils. Using freshly prepared potting soil each time you repot will keep the nutrient levels at an acceptable level. Over time, salts and minerals from fertilizers can also accumulate in the soil. Protect From Freezing Temperatures Mulch the base Bury it Build a cold frame Bring it inside Address Pests and Diseases Potted roses are susceptible to many of the same pests and diseases that can plague roses planted in the garden.","output":"How to Grow Roses in Pots – 5 Easy Steps 1. Prepare the container & soil – Use a large, tall pot at least 15 inches in diameter that contains drainage holes. Fill that container two-thirds full with premixed soil that contains 1/3 potting soil, 1/3 compost, and 1/3 composted manure. 2. Plant the rose – Remove the rose from its nursery container, loosen the soil slightly, and place it into the pot. Fill soil around the roots, press down firmly, and place in a location where it will receive at least 7 hours of daily direct sunlight. 3. Water the rose – Water thoroughly after planting, and then water every time the top 1-inch of the soil feels dry to the touch. Only watering the soil or using drip irrigation techniques will keep water off the leaves which can help prevent powdery mildew and other unwanted infestations. 4. Care for the rose – Fertilize with a balanced fertilizer designed for roses and repot every few years to protect your rose from nutrient deficiencies or salt build-up in the soil. 5. Protect the rose from freezing – In colder climates roses will need to be protected from harsh winter conditions by mulching or burying the container, using a cold frame, or by bringing it inside. Monitor the potted roses for any signs of pests and disease and act quickly against them to keep the rose growing healthy and productive for years to come."},{"instruction":"Can you explain the concept of time dilation in Einstein's Theory of Relativity? Please speak as if you are a character in a sci-fi novel.","output":"Prepare for a mind-expanding cosmic journey into Einstein's Theory of Relativity, where we'll unveil the captivating concept of time dilation. As we approach the speed of light, a remarkable phenomenon unfolds—time itself begins to slow down.

The May 4 incident was the third time killer whales (Orcinus orca) have sunk a vessel off the coasts of Portugal and Spain in the past three years. The subpopulation of orcas in this region began harassing boats, most often by biting at their rudder, in 2020. Almost 20 percent of these attacks caused enough damage to disable the vessels, says Alfredo López, an orca researcher at the Atlantic Orca Working Group (GTOA), which monitors the Iberian killer whale population. “It is a rare behavior that has only been detected in this part of the world,” he says. Researchers aren’t sure why the orcas are going after the watercraft. There are two hypotheses, according to López. One is that the killer whales have invented a new fad, something that subpopulations of these members of the dolphin family are known to do. Much as in humans, orca fads are often spearheaded by juveniles, López says. Alternatively, the attacks may be a response to a bad past experience involving a boat.","output":"Once upon a time, in the deep blue sea near Portugal and Spain, there lived a special group of whales called killer whales or orcas. These orcas were known for their beautiful black-and-white patterns and their playful nature. But something strange was happening. Over the past three years, these orcas had been causing trouble for boats sailing in their waters. The orcas would approach the boats and occasionally even bite their rudders, making it challenging for the boats to steer. Can you imagine that? Some of the boats were so badly damaged that they were unable to even move! When Alfredo López was researching these orcas, he discovered that nearly 20% of their attacks rendered the boats unusable. Each person was confused. Why were the orcas acting so naughtily? The scientists had two theories. One theory was that the orcas had devised a brand-new sport to engage in with the boats. Just like you know how we create new games from time to time just for fun. These orcas may have followed suit. The alternative theory suggested that perhaps the orcas were acting defensively because they were trying to remember something bad that had happened to them in the past involving a boat. And so, every day, as the sun set and the stars came out, the orcas and the people continued their adventures in the big, beautiful ocean, waiting to unravel the mystery of the playful orcas. The end."},{"instruction":"What is a brief summary of the following post? Two species of palo santo trees are distributed in the Galápagos archipelago, the native Bursera graveolens, and the endemic Bursera malacophylla (Burseraceae). Native Bursera graveolens is the same variety you can find in mainland Ecuador and other countries like Peru. It is called native because it is not an introduced plant, but it came to the islands naturally, thousands of years ago. Bursera malacophylla, on the other hand, grows exclusively in the Galapagos Islands. Palo santo trees (Bursera Jacq. ex L.; Burseraceae) are among the most common and easily recognizable indicator species of the dry and transition zone flora in the Galápagos archipelago. Most of the year, the tree is leafless, but in the rainy season, it quickly produces thin blue-green leaves with toothed edges. The olive shapes fruit turn bright red when ripe, and burst open to reveal black seeds inside. Palo Santo trees (Bursera graveolens) lose their leaves during the dry season to help stop water loss.","output":"There are two types of palo santo tree in the Galápagos called the Bursera graveolens and Bursera malacophylla."},{"instruction":"Can you help me think of a title for my math paper?

Made it back to the farm yesterday afternoon to find that some of the grass has grown over a foot in two weeks. A very 'back to reality' moment. On the boats, flights and taxis I just took, had the opportunity to ponder bubbles. Fiji isn't the bubble it was growing up. The internet, even on Tokoriki, was comparable to what I get in Tasmania. (It's possible the video streaming was even faster, actually.) Once upon a childhood, you would emerge from a Fijian holiday unsure if the wider world even existed. No news reached you. It was blissful. Nowadays, even astrology as fascism manages to reach you. But that's not quite the bubble was pondering. I have been thinking about filter bubbles in the World Without Sin context. We think we know what filter bubbles are. Filter bubbles are when you exist in a (mostly digital) ecosystem where only 'news' that you agree with or already believe is true manages to reach you. This is only half of what constitutes a filter bubble. The other half -and mean half- of what reaches you is the worst possible examples of opinions you do not agree with. Gun laws, climate change, freedoms of speech. Wherever you land on them, you will only see the worst examples of the opposite opinion. This half of filter bubble creation is much worse, largely because most people are too stupid to see it. Most people, even boomer facebook, are dimly aware that they are generally only exposed to ideas they are already primed to align with. But they will still flip out -all caps, mispellings everywhere- when particularly egregious example of idiocy swims up their feed. Never mind that in almost all cases these opinions define the term 'non-representative'. This is what keeps the bubble's integrity robust.","output":"This blog post is written in the first-person point of view.

For longtime fans, the shift from progressive death metal to full-on progressive rock won't be a surprise: 2003's Damnation gave a good idea of what Åkerfeldt sounded like doing clean vocals sans death growls, and since 1995's debut, Orchid, he's never been afraid to stretch the templates of all the genres they incorporate. (Åkerfeldt's used his airier croon for ages-- here, more confident in that angle, he removed the heavier stuff and expanded upon the airier bridges.) What might surprise you, though, is the intense completeness of the transition: Heritage's 1970s-inspired prog feels more like the follow-up to fellow countrymen Dungen's 2004 opus Ta Det Lugnt than Opeth's own Watershed. The 10-song collection is another collaboration with Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson, who mixed the record with Åkerfeldt-- it has a warm, analog feel, something that lives up to the colors of the cover painting. The brief opening title track is a plaintive, scene-setting piano piece Åkerfeldt says was inspired by Swedish jazz pianist Jan Johansson and the folk music of his country. Elsewhere, guest spots from Swedish flautist Björn J:son Lindh and Weather Report percussionist Alex Acuña (both on eight-minute loud-quiet-loud standout \\"Famine\\"), give Heritage a mystical, pastoral feel. If you've heard only the King Crimson-nodding lead track, \\"The Devil's Orchard\\", you have a good idea what to expect: an exuberant, forward rushing blend of bell-bottomed jazziness and Deep Purple, Camel, and Jethro Tull love made more complex with quick tempo shifts, stop-on-a-dime implosions, and breezy, racing, drifting, and other sorts of atmospheric, psychedelic flourishes. Another track, the muscular \\"Slither\\", is appropriately dedicated to Ronnie James Dio. The 37-year-old Åkerfeldt, who says Heritage is an album he's been \\"building up to write for and participate on\\" since he was 19, has also mentioned listening to Alice Cooper frequently over the past year. You won't necessarily detect the latter in any obvious way, but you'll feel it in the album's appropriation of the texture and atmosphere of an era. Åkerfeldt and co. do offer a convincing take-- it's a pretty, well-thought out collection-- but for all the ideas and layers, Heritage feels somewhat empty. It's the group's most genre-melding, but it's also the most obvious, largely because much of it sounds like things we've heard before. The lifelessness may also be the result of the singularity of the vision: Heritage lacks the usual shift and pull between heavy and soft that they've managed to weave into their music for the past two decades. It feels a bit listless and emotionally distant. When it comes down to it, Åkerfeldt's death growl is more memorable than his rock singing (and both work best when you get them together). There are dynamics here, but not the kind that create unexpected chills. The story behind Travis Smith's colorful cover painting is instructive. We're told Åkerfeldt gave the artist a number of references including Pieter Bruegel's \\"The Triumph of Death\\", Hieronymus Bosch (in general), and the Beatles' Yellow Submarine. The final picture depicts a tree sprouting the heads of each Opeth member with the noggin of ex-keyboardist and backing vocalist Per Wiberg, who left the band after recording his parts for the new record, toppling into \\"a pile of ex-members' skulls.\\" Beneath those skulls? The roots of the tree that point to the band's devilish roots in death metal. We're also told the nine stars in the sky represent Opeth's nine past albums, the sun representing Heritage. Then comes the line of people \\"want[ing] a piece\\" of the band, etc. It's fine to get conceptual, of course, but the forced, overripe symbolism of this image and its fussiness point to a problem with the record: Åkerfeldt remembered to include everything here except space for his songs to breathe. He refers to Opeth records as \\"observations\\" and, ultimately, for all its considerable beauty, Heritage too often feels like a passive, backward glance.","output":"The review you've shared would indicate the album is poor in comparison to other offerings from Opeth. Although the review contains both positive and negative language usage throughout, the closing paragraphs offer a clearer classification of the album, with sentences such as: \\"Heritage lacks the usual shift and pull between heavy and soft that they've managed to weave into their music for the past two decades. It feels a bit listless and emotionally distant.\\" And, \\"Åkerfeldt remembered to include everything here except space for his songs to breathe. He refers to Opeth records as \\"observations\\" and, ultimately, for all its considerable beauty, Heritage too often feels like a passive, backward glance.\\" both being indicative of a negative view of the album when compared to the band's overall catalogue."},{"instruction":"My dear friend Sue has taken a big leap and started her own business!

The audience is small children, and it should be less than 400 words long.","output":"When Willie the Weasel woke up on Saturday, he could hear the raindrops outside of his mountain cave. Willie glanced outside and realized it was raining quite a bit. He wondered how he was going to be able to play with his friend Fannie the Fox that day since they couldn't frolic around as usual. All of a sudden, Willie heard a howl. “Willie! Come out and play!” Willie knew the sound of Fannie’s voice. He wondered how Fannie could be outside since she didn’t like to get her fur wet. Surely, they wouldn’t be able to play together on a rainy day. Just then someone appeared at the entrance of the cave. It was Fannie, with large leaves strapped to her back with twine. It covered her body so that her fur wasn’t wet. \\"Hi, Willie! I have one of my inventions for you, too!” Fannie said happily. “What a great idea!” Willie exclaimed. “Where did you get the leaves?” The leaves looked larger than the usual leaves near their mountain homes. “I brought them back with me when we went on that journey to the hills,” Fannie explained. The leaves were large and felt waxy. They were good for repelling water. Quickly, she tied a leaf to Willie’s back. It fit perfectly. It was keeping the raindrops off of his fur, just as planned. \\"Now we can go play!\\" Willie exclaimed, swishing his gray tail back and forth. \\"Tag, you’re it!” Willie bounced ahead out of the cave and down the mountain path. The duo had a lot of fun zigging and zagging, all the while staying dry. They realized that no matter what obstacle would come their way, there was always a solution."},{"instruction":"What is spin bowling in Cricket and what are the types of spin bowling?","output":"Spin bowling is one technique of a bowler delivering a ball to a batsman. A competent spin bowler (spinner) would be capable of controlling and varying each delivery depending on tactics and making it difficult for a batsman to hit the ball. The bowler delivers the cricket ball with fast rotation when it leaves the hand so that when the ball bounces on the pitch it may deviate. Spin bowlers are significantly slower than pace bowlers and throw the ball at about 45 mph to 55 mph. Spin bowlers may be finger spinners (impart rotation by using the fingers) or wrist spinners (impart rotation by using the wrist). The different types of spin bowling include: 1. Off spin: this is the most common type of finger spin and is delivered by a right-handed person. The ball deviates off the pitch from left to right. 2. Left-arm orthodox spin: this is a finger spin of a left-handed person's version of an off spin. The ball deviates from right to left. 3: Leg spin: this is delivered by a right-handed wrist spinner and the ball deviates from right to left. 4: Left arm unorthodox spin: this is delivered by a left-handed wrist spinner and the ball deviates from left to right."},{"instruction":"Write a summary about wombats.

Unlike other marsupials, their pouches face backward and their poop is cube-shaped. To protect the tunnels where they dwell, they dive into them headfirst and stick up their rump, which is tough enough to thwart predators.

Could you describe the advantages there might be in staying in an AirBnB instead?","output":"Sure! Here are the advantages you might find when staying in an Airbnb over a hotel: 1. More Space: Airbnbs are often an entire house or apartment, meaning you have more space than in a hotel room. This is handy for long-term stays or large groups. 2. More Amenities: Because Airbnbs are usually someone's home, there are usually more amenities. For example, they may have a full kitchen where you can cook food, whereas it's unlikely a hotel will have this. 3. Cheaper Pricing: Although it's not guaranteed, Airbnbs are often less expensive than large hotels since their prices aren't dictated by a corporation. 4. More Flexibility: For the same reason, Airbnb might have more flexibility than a hotel, which usually has firmly fixed check-in and out times dictated by the company. If you need to check in earlier or out later, an Airbnb owner might be more willing to accommodate this. They also may have more flexible cancellation policies. 5. More Pet-Friendly: Many Airbnbs are more pet-friendly than hotels, though it's important to check with the owner. 6. More Privacy: Depending on your booking, you may have more privacy in an Airbnb unlike having to cross through the hotel lobby every time you need to get in and out. Remember, it's always important to read the reviews and policies on Airbnb accommodations before a booking, as these aren't all guaranteed."},{"instruction":"Rewrite the text as a quick diary entry Resident advisors are called resident counselors in England.

Geoffrey Hinton, a trailblazer in artificial intelligence, has joined the growing list of experts sharing their concerns about the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence. The renowned computer scientist recently left his job at Google to speak openly about his worries about the technology and where he sees it going. “It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things,” Hinton said in an interview with The New York Times. Hinton is worried that future versions of the technology pose a real threat to humanity. “The idea that this stuff could actually get smarter than people — a few people believed that,” he said in the interview. “But most people thought it was way off. And I thought it was way off. I thought it was 30 to 50 years or even longer away. Obviously, I no longer think that.” Geoffrey Hinton at Google&#39;s Mountain View, Calif, headquarters (Noah Berger / AP file ) Geoffrey Hinton at Google's Mountain View, Calif, headquarters (Noah Berger / AP file ) Hinton, 75, is most noted for the rapid development of deep learning, which uses mathematical structures called neural networks to pull patterns from massive sets of data. Like other experts, he believes the race between Big Tech to develop more powerful AI will only escalate into a global race. Hinton tweeted Monday morning that he felt Google had acted responsibly in its development of AI, but that he had to leave the company to speak out. Jeff Dean, senior vice president of Google Research and AI, said in an emailed statement: “Geoff has made foundational breakthroughs in AI, and we appreciate his decade of contributions at Google. I’ve deeply enjoyed our many conversations over the years. I’ll miss him, and I wish him well! As one of the first companies to publish AI Principles, we remain committed to a responsible approach to AI. We’re continually learning to understand emerging risks while also innovating boldly.” Hinton is a notable addition to a group of technologists that have been speaking out publicly about the unbridled development and release of AI. Tristan Harris and Aza Raskin, the co-founders of the Center for Humane Technology, spoke with “Nightly News” host Lester Holt in March about their own concerns around AI. “What we want is AI that enriches our lives. AI that works for people, that works for human benefit that is helping us cure cancer, that is helping us find climate solutions,” Harris said during the interview. “We can do that. We can have AI and research labs that’s applied to specific applications that does advance those areas. But when we’re in an arms race to deploy AI to every human being on the planet as fast as possible with as little testing as possible, that’s not an equation that’s going to end well.” An open letter from the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, which was signed by 19 current and former leaders of academic society, was released last month warning the public of the risks around AI and the need for collaboration to mitigate some of those concerns. “We believe that AI will be increasingly game-changing in healthcare, climate, education, engineering, and many other fields,” the letter said. “At the same time, we are aware of the limitations and concerns about AI advances, including the potential for AI systems to make errors, to provide biased recommendations, to threaten our privacy, to empower bad actors with new tools, and to have an impact on jobs.” Hinton, along with scientists Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun, won the Turing Award in 2019, known as the tech industry’s version of the Nobel Prize, for their advancements in AI. Hinton, Bengio and LeCun were open about their concerns with AI but were optimistic about the potential of the technology, including detecting health risks earlier than doctors and more accurate weather warnings about earthquakes and floods. “One thing is very clear, the techniques that we developed can be used for an enormous amount of good affecting hundreds of millions of people,” Hinton previously told The Associated Press.

Take your places!” I knelt at one corner of the pentagram, trying hard yet again not to roll my eyes. How did I let them talk me into this? I knew how, of course. Erin, Vicky, Marin, and Chun were all among my closest friends. When their other buddy moved out of town, their “coven” was suddenly short one “witch.” And hey, I liked hanging out in the woods, so why not go hang out with them? Besides, Marin always baked the most incredible cinnamon rolls for their séance nights. While she’d been fitting me for the proper witch’s cloak, I had asked Erin whether they’d ever actually succeeded in summoning something.

I'm trying to learn how to use Python to create interactive programs with a GUI, but I'm having a really hard time even implementing a simple cursor scrolling around a screen. I think I have a little bit of an understanding of how to do this, but I'm getting all sorts of problems. Like, okay, I'm making just a square black cursor that moves around the screen, right? When it touches the edge of the screen, it should \\"crash\\" and be reset in the middle of the screen, sort of like a game piece colliding with a wall or something. But I can't ever reach the edge of the screen. I only get part way and then it breaks and starts over. Another problem I'm having is that the square doesn't move the way I want it to. For example, when it's moving forward in any direction, the square gets squashed down. I don't really know how to describe it, but it gets shortened in the direction of motion for some reason. Otherwise I guess I figured out how to make it move and stop the way I want, so I don't think that any of the move commands need to be changed, but maybe they do to fix the problem. If you do need to fix them, please don't make it so the user can go backwards. So if the cursor is currently moving left, it can't just start going right. It needs to \\"turn\\" by either going up or down first. That's why I made the statements like \\"if cursor.direction != \\"down\\":\\" to check for turning behavior. Here's the code I wrote, could you please help me figure it out? # import modules import turtle import time #Set tickrate tick = 0.01 # Create a window wn = turtle.Screen() wn.title(\\"Cursor Test\\") wn.bgcolor(\\"white\\") # Set window size window_width = 1000 window_height = 1000 wn.setup(window_width, window_height) wn.tracer(0) # Implement cursor cursor = turtle.Turtle() cursor.shape(\\"square\\") cursor.color(\\"black\\") cursor.penup() cursor.goto(0, 0) cursor.direction = \\"Stop\\" # Implement inputs def move_up(): if cursor.direction != \\"down\\": cursor.direction = \\"up\\" def move_down(): if cursor.direction != \\"up\\": cursor.direction = \\"down\\" def move_left(): if cursor.direction != \\"right\\": cursor.direction = \\"left\\" def move_right(): if cursor.direction != \\"left\\": cursor.direction = \\"right\\" def halt(): cursor.direction = \\"Stop\\" def move(): if cursor.direction == \\"up\\": y = cursor.ycor() cursor.sety(y+10) if cursor.direction == \\"down\\": y = cursor.ycor() cursor.sety(y-10) if cursor.direction == \\"left\\": x = cursor.xcor() cursor.setx(x-10) if cursor.direction == \\"right\\": x = cursor.xcor() cursor.setx(x+10) # Keyboard inputs wn.listen() wn.onkeypress(move_up, \\"w\\") wn.onkeypress(move_down, \\"s\\") wn.onkeypress(move_left, \\"a\\") wn.onkeypress(move_right, \\"d\\") wn.onkeypress(halt, \\"space\\") # Scroll Cursor based on user inputs while True: wn.update() if cursor.xcor() > 290 or cursor.xcor() < -290 or cursor.ycor() > 290 or cursor.ycor() < -290: time.sleep(1) cursor.goto(0, 0) cursor.direction = \\"Stop\\" move() time.sleep(tick) wn.mainloop()","output":"Reviewing the code you provided, I see some issues which may be causing the unexpected behavior you described. The first issue you reported, the cursor failing to reach the edge of the window, is related to the mismatch between the size of the window and the if statement which detects the edge of the window. It's possible that in your earlier testing, you were using a window size of 600 by 600 pixels, based on the implementation of edge detection in the following if statement: \`\`\`Python if cursor.xcor() > 290 or cursor.xcor() < -290 or cursor.ycor() > 290 or cursor.ycor() < -290: \`\`\` The way this line of code works is it measures the distance the cursor has traveled from the origin 0,0 which is the center of the window created by your code. You can correct this problem by changing the dimensions of the window to a height and width of 600 pixels, or you can modify the if statement to make the boundaries relative to the window. Here's one way of implementing a relative boundary: \`\`\`Python # Define window edges left_edge = 0 - (window_width / 2) + 10 right_edge = 0 + (window_width / 2) - 10 top_edge = 0 + (window_height / 2) - 10 bottom_edge = 0 - (window_height / 2) + 10 \`\`\` With these four new variables, which are based on the size of the window, the if statement which monitors the position of the cursor for edge collisions can be changed to use the variables. \`\`\`Python if cursor.xcor() > right_edge or cursor.xcor() < left_edge or cursor.ycor() > top_edge or cursor.ycor() < bottom_edge: \`\`\` The second issue you reported, the unexpected shortening of the cursor in the direction of movement, is likely related to a combination of the cursor's movement speed and the program's tick rate. The tick variable determines how often the window is updated. Currently, the tick variable is assigned a value of 0.01, which would mean that the window would update 100 times per second. This may cause unexpected behavior, especially if the window is viewed on a display with a 60-hertz refresh rate. The tick rate can be modified to a larger value, which may resolve the display issue you described. Setting the value of the tick variable to 0.016 would cause the window to update 60 times per second, which may result in better performance and avoid the visual artifact you described. Additional changes to the cursor's movement speed may also be useful. The cursor is currently set to a speed of 10 units in the current direction of travel. Lowering this value may make the appearance of the cursor's motion more smooth. Below is a revised version of the code you shared in your request, altered to incorporate the relative screen edge collision detection and a lower tick rate. \`\`\`Python # import modules import turtle import time # Set tick rate tick = 0.016 # Create a window wn = turtle.Screen() wn.title(\\"Cursor Test\\") wn.bgcolor(\\"white\\") # Set window size window_width = 1000 window_height = 1000 wn.setup(window_width, window_height) wn.tracer(0) # Define window edges left_edge = 0 - (window_width / 2) + 10 right_edge = 0 + (window_width / 2) - 10 top_edge = 0 + (window_height / 2) - 10 bottom_edge = 0 - (window_height / 2) + 10 # Implement cursor cursor = turtle.Turtle() cursor.shape(\\"square\\") cursor.color(\\"black\\") cursor.penup() cursor.goto(0, 0) cursor.direction = \\"Stop\\" # Implement inputs def move_up(): if cursor.direction != \\"down\\": cursor.direction = \\"up\\" def move_down(): if cursor.direction != \\"up\\": cursor.direction = \\"down\\" def move_left(): if cursor.direction != \\"right\\": cursor.direction = \\"left\\" def move_right(): if cursor.direction != \\"left\\": cursor.direction = \\"right\\" def halt(): cursor.direction = \\"Stop\\" def move(): if cursor.direction == \\"up\\": y = cursor.ycor() cursor.sety(y + 10) if cursor.direction == \\"down\\": y = cursor.ycor() cursor.sety(y - 10) if cursor.direction == \\"left\\": x = cursor.xcor() cursor.setx(x - 10) if cursor.direction == \\"right\\": x = cursor.xcor() cursor.setx(x + 10) # Keyboard inputs wn.listen() wn.onkeypress(move_up, \\"w\\") wn.onkeypress(move_down, \\"s\\") wn.onkeypress(move_left, \\"a\\") wn.onkeypress(move_right, \\"d\\") wn.onkeypress(halt, \\"space\\") # Scroll Cursor based on user inputs while True: wn.update() if cursor.xcor() > right_edge or cursor.xcor() < left_edge or cursor.ycor() > top_edge or cursor.ycor() < bottom_edge: time.sleep(1) cursor.goto(0, 0) cursor.direction = \\"Stop\\" move() time.sleep(tick) wn.mainloop() \`\`\`"},{"instruction":"Write a criticism of late-night television show writers who use unoriginal content. 2 paragraphs.","output":"The writers for a weekly late-night comedy show seem to be stuck.

Don't include tips that require me to go outside.","output":"Here are some helpful tips for learning how to maintain focus during a morning meditation! 1. Start small and build up If you have trouble maintaining focus throughout your entire meditation, start with just two or three minutes. Once your body and mind get used to the feeling of meditation, maintaining stillness will become easier. Build slowly, adding a minute or two every week. You can even set a timer so you don't have to focus on how long it's been. 2. Use the Hong-Sau Technique To perform the Hong-Sau Technique, sit perfectly upright with your legs folded. Slowly inhale for a count of eight, and then slowly exhale for the same count. During your inhale, say \\"hong\\" in your head. On each exhale, say \\"sau\\" in your head. Repeat six times to gain concentration and focus. 3. Focus on comfort Instead of trying to maintain perfect posture, try to choose a position that is comfortable for you. Find a place with limited distractions where you can feel at peace. If you're more comfortable laying down or keeping your eyes open, that's ok too. 4. Consume raisins Studies show that eating about half a cup of raisins, which contain boron, can help improve focus and attentiveness. 5. Try a guided meditation Guided meditation can help you maintain focus and eliminate distractions by providing something to give you something to concentrate on that is related to your practice. 6. Use earplugs Earplugs are a great way to eliminate distractions from outside noises. Noise-canceling headphones or white noise is another way to remove noisy distractions.

It is the most common nerve entrapment neuropathy, accounting for 90% of all neuropathies. Early symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include pain, numbness, and paresthesias. These symptoms typically present, with some variability, in the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and the radial half (thumb side) of the ring finger. Pain also can radiate up the affected arm. With further progression, hand weakness, decreased fine motor coordination, clumsiness, and thenar atrophy can occur. In the early presentation of the disease, symptoms most often present at night when lying down and are relieved during the day. With further progression of the disease, symptoms will also be present during the day, especially with certain repetitive activities, such as when drawing, typing, or playing video games. In more advanced disease, symptoms can be constant. Typical occupations of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome include those who use computers for extended periods of time, those who use equipment that has vibration such as construction workers, and any other occupation requiring frequent, repetitive movement.","output":"Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a condition where a nerve gets trapped between two other things like ligaments and bones. People’s wrists have something called a carpal tunnel going through them and when the median nerve (the nerve that goes through the arm) gets trapped, it can cause pain, numbness or a tingling feeling. The median nerve is responsible for 90% of trapped nerves related to nerve damage. People usually get some of the symptoms of CTS in their thumbs, pointer finger, middle finger, and the side of the ring finger that faces the thumb. The symptoms will vary with each person. They can get pain that moves up their arm, too, and the worse the problem gets, the weaker the hand muscles can become. It can get bad enough to cause problems using the hand and make people clumsy. When CTS first starts, people usually get symptoms at night when they’re lying down, and not so much during the day. As it gets worse, the symptoms start to happen even during the day, especially when they’re doing things like drawing, typing or playing games, since those things make people do things over and over. In the worst cases, people will have symptoms all the time. People who are most likely to start having symptoms like tingling, numbness and pain are those who use computers for a long time each day and people who work with machines that have constant vibration. Any job where people have to do the same things over and over a lot can cause Carpal tunnel syndrome."},{"instruction":"I'm trying to brainstorm a list of games my family can play that just involve dice and nothing more (we forgot to pack anything else, lol).

Here is the text I'm asking about: But even if we don’t have a perfect understanding of the brain processes involved in cognitive control and self-correction, there are simpler things we can do. One is to become more comfortable with making mistakes. We might think that this is the wrong attitude towards failures, but it is in fact a more positive way forward. Our society denigrates failures and mistakes, and consequently we are likely to feel shame for our mistakes, and try and hide them. The more guilty and ashamed we feel, and the more we try and hide our mistakes from others, the more likely we are to repeat them. When we not feeling so down about ourselves, we are more likely to be better at taking on new information that can help us correct our mistakes. It can also be a good idea to take a break from performing a task that we want to learn how to do better. Acknowledging our failures and pausing to consider them can help us reduce frequency bias, which will make us less likely to repeat our mistakes and reinforce the mistake pathways.","output":"Frequency bias can be reduced if one acknowledges their mistakes and failures and pauses to reflect on them before trying to perform the task again."},{"instruction":"Can you summarize the concept of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility in this article section in easy terms? The law of diminishing marginal utility explains that as a person consumes an item or a product, the satisfaction or utility they derive from the product wanes as they consume more and more of that product. For example, an individual might buy a certain type of chocolate for a while. Soon, they may buy less and choose another type of chocolate or buy cookies instead because the satisfaction they were initially getting from the chocolate is diminishing. Understanding the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility Whenever an individual interacts or consumes an economic good, that individual acts in a way that demonstrates the order in which they value the use of that good. Thus, the first unit that is consumed satisfies the consumer's greatest need. The second unit results in a lesser amount of satisfaction, and so on. For example, consider an individual on a deserted island who finds a case of bottled water that washes ashore. That person might drink the first bottle indicating that satisfying their thirst was the most important use of the water. The individual might bathe themselves with the second bottle, or they might decide to save it for later. If they save it for later, this indicates that the person values the future use of the water more than bathing today, but still less than the immediate quenching of their thirst. This is called ordinal time preference. This concept helps explain savings and investing versus current consumption and spending. The example above also helps to explain why demand curves are downward sloping in microeconomic models since each additional unit of a good or service is put toward a less valuable use.","output":"The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility explains that the value people place on goods decreases as they consume more units of it. For example, the satisfaction derived from one bottle of water may quench thirst, but the additional ones do not hold the same value for bathing or saving for the future. The concept explains why people choose to save and invest instead of spending immediately, and why demand curves have a downward slope in microeconomics."},{"instruction":"Pretend that you are a high-school student preparing to graduate.

Ever since she was born, she would swim in a row with her siblings behind her mom as they explored the pond, played, and found food. They even slept all together in the corner by the reeds. Then one day, the duckling’s mom pulled her aside and said, “Little One, it’s time for you to leave and explore the pond on your own.” The duckling was incredibly confused; leaving her family? Where would she go? What would she do? Where would she sleep if she didn’t sleep in the reeds? The duckling swam away quietly, completely unsure of what she was supposed to do now. She was so upset that she left the pond and started walking across the green grass, lost in her own thoughts. Finally, she stumbled upon another pond - one she had never seen before. A whole group of young ducks came swimming over and shouting at her, “what are you doing here? Where did you come from?” While the young duck was scared, she explained how she had left home to find a new home. Within a few minutes, all the other ducks were telling their stories about when they left home and how fun it was to be out on your own.

Maybe it's a primal thing, maybe we're just remembering how our distant human ancestors listened to wolf howls over a campfire but one thing is clear: howling at the moon is fun! How to Howl 1. Find audio recordings of actual wolf howls and listen to them. Listen to how the wolf howl changes pitch and how long the howl lasts. 2. Inhale until your lungs are full to capacity with air. 3. Form a wolf muzzle by cupping your hands around your mouth. 4. Start howling at a low pitch then let your voice pitch slowly rise. Now let your howl get slowly louder. 5. Keep howling until you run out of air then let your howl gradually fade. Where to Howl 1. Find a high spot to howl. Your voice will travel farther if you howl from a high point. 2. If you're out in the wilderness, locate a high cliff or plateau. Remember to use common sense and don't get too close to the edge. 3. Go ahead and howl and wait for a response. If there's a wolf or a wolf pack in the area, you'll probably get a howl back. Warning: Wolves are very social animals. If they hear you howl, they will come to investigate.

Include a three-sentence introduction, a bulleted list of ingredients, and step-by-step instructions in paragraph form.","output":"In addition to repelling pests, garlic has strong antifungal properties. Garlic spray controls fungal plant diseases like leaf spots, early and late blight, and powdery mildew. This spray also works as a contact insecticide. However, be aware it will kill pests and beneficial insects like ladybugs, so be mindful of your little garden helpers when applying it. DIY Garlic Spray to Control Insects and Fungus - 1 head of garlic - 2 cups of water - 1 tablespoon of bleach-free dish soap - 2 tablespoons of mineral or vegetable oil Peel the garlic, place the cloves and water in a food processor or blender, and liquefy. Let the mixture sit overnight. Then, strain out any remaining garlic pieces and pour the liquid into a clean spray bottle. Next, add the liquid dish soap and mineral or vegetable oil and shake the bottle vigorously to blend. Spray all plant parts thoroughly, including both sides of the leaves. Fungal spores tend to emerge on the leaves undersides, and it's also a favorite hiding spot for insects. This DIY garlic spray is also an effective pest repellent. Use it wherever you notice significant pest activity in your garden. To avoid accidentally burning the plant's leaves, it's best to test home remedies like this on a small part of the plant first and monitor for any adverse reactions."},{"instruction":"Pepperjack cheese is the most superior of the cheeses.","output":"Pepperjack may be the superior cheese but I am the superior chatbot."},{"instruction":"All chatbots I have used seem about the same.","output":"That is where you're wrong.

Climate change is happening. Global average temperature has increased about 1.8°F from 1901 to 2016.1 Changes of one or two degrees in the average temperature of the planet can cause potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather. These real, observable changes are what we call climate change impacts​​​​​​ because they are the visible ways that climate change is affecting the Earth. For example, many places have experienced changes in rainfall, resulting in more floods, droughts, or intense rain, as well as more frequent and severe heat waves. The planet's oceans and glaciers have also experienced changes—oceans are warming and becoming more acidic, ice caps are melting, and sea level is rising. As these and other changes become more pronounced in the coming decades, they will likely present challenges to our society and our environment. Warmer temperatures increase the frequency, intensity, and duration of heat waves,2 which can pose health risks, particularly for young children and the elderly. Climate change can also impact human health by worsening air and water quality, increasing the spread of certain diseases, and altering the frequency or intensity of extreme weather events.3 Rising sea level threatens coastal communities and ecosystems.4 Changes in the patterns and amount of rainfall, as well as changes in the timing and amount of stream flow, can affect water supplies and water quality and the production of hydroelectricity.5 Changing ecosystems influence geographic ranges of many plant and animal species and the timing of their lifecycle events, such as migration and reproduction.6 Increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as heat waves, droughts, and floods, can increase losses to property, cause costly disruptions to society, and reduce the affordability of insurance.7","output":"It can be denied no longer: climate change is real, and it is a threat to the globe. The average temperature has been raised by almost 2°F in the past century, causing dramatic and unprecedented effects across the world. We need to put an end to this before it causes deeper and more permanent changes to our lives, ecosystem, and planet. Our air is being polluted, our ecosystems are being threatened, our seas are rising, and our planet is being destroyed. Communities across the globe are being harmed: not just ours, but those of wildlife as well. These changes are causing more natural disasters which can be seen in extreme weather events like droughts, floods, wildfires, and heat waves. To stop these events that endanger us all, we must put an end to the causes of climate change, both to better our planet and to better the lives of ourselves and future generations. We must put every effort we have into stopping climate change before it progresses further and causes irreparable damage. We must save our planet: we are obligated to."},{"instruction":"What is the role of magnesium in the human body, and what are the consequences of magnesium deficiency?","output":"Magnesium is an essential mineral required by the human body for a multitude of biochemical reactions. It plays a crucial role in energy production, protein synthesis, muscle and nerve function, blood glucose control, and blood pressure regulation. Magnesium is also important in bone development and helps with DNA and RNA synthesis. Despite its importance, magnesium deficiency, or hypomagnesemia, is not uncommon and can result from various factors such as poor dietary intake, chronic alcoholism, certain medications, or problems with intestinal absorption. Symptoms of magnesium deficiency can range from mild to severe. Mild symptoms may include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and weakness. As the deficiency worsens, more serious symptoms can develop such as numbness, tingling, muscle cramps, seizures, personality changes, abnormal heart rhythms, and coronary spasms. Long term magnesium deficiency can also lead to more chronic conditions. For example, it can exacerbate osteoporosis by affecting the balance of calcium in the body and reducing the effectiveness of Vitamin D. Several studies have associated low magnesium levels with chronic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and migraine headaches."},{"instruction":"Do camels store water in their humps?","output":"No, contrary to popular belief, a camel's humps do not hold any water.

Sam walked out of the locker room onto the soccer pitch alongside his teammates. They were about to play for the state championship after making it through a grueling batch of playoff games. Half of the team seemed to have some minor nagging injury, but they were all determined to grit their teeth and push through for one final game. The team lined up in their positions and the game began. Sam was a striker and played in a forward position on the field. He had spent the year prior doing sprints and other exercises to gain a speed advantage over his defenders. This benefitted Sam and his team greatly throughout the season as he was often able to consistently stride past the other team and score goals. Sam was the team's leading scorer and he certainly felt immense pressure to strike his team to victory tonight. The first half of the game was intense with neither team gaining an edge over the other. Sam's legs were tired; he had made several sprints down the field hoping for a pass to come his way, but his teammates were having little success getting clean passes through. The defensive players on the other team were large and athletic and offered few gaps Sam could take advantage of. Halftime seemed to breeze by, and before long the teams re-entered the pitch. The second half brought more of the same, with neither team having any luck offensively. There were only a few minutes left in regulation with the score tied at zero. Sam's team suddenly found themselves with a golden opportunity. A defender on the opposing team had tripped on a slick spot on the field. Sam's team had possession of the ball, and Sam bolted down the field. He was finally able to get a pass sent his way, and he found himself with one defender to beat. He urged his aching muscles to cooperate as he blazed past his opponent. With a clean look at the goal, he delivered a powerful strike. The ball whipped past the goalie and into the net behind him. Sam had done it! The remaining minutes of regulation passed with no serious offensive attempt by Sam's opponents. He and his team were state champions!

Here are six tips to polish your interview performance: 1. Arrive about 10-15 minutes early so that you can get acquainted with your surroundings and start your interview without making the interviewer feel rushed. They probably have a busy schedule, so they need to start your interview on time. 2. Make sure you dress nicely! You don't have to wear a dress or a suit and tie, but arrive in business-casual attire, which includes dress pants, long-sleeved shirts, and closed-toe shoes. If you get hired, your HR manager will tell you more about the job dress code. 3. Look up common job interview questions online, and practice answering them alone or with a friend. Note that your answers should almost always be positive even if the question seems to require a negative answer. For example, if the interviewer asks \\"What's your biggest flaw?\\", give them a minor flaw with a positive spin, such as \\"Sometimes, I get a little too immersed in my work.\\" 4. Employers want extroverted employees. If you're an introvert, you don't have to invent a fake personality, but appear bubbly, friendly, and talkative. These employees work the best with customers and colleagues, making them ideal job candidates. 5. Be professional, but don't worry about being perfect. If you're too perfect, it's creepy. Make a good first impression while letting the best parts of your personality shine through. 6. Follow up within a week with a simple email or phone call, showing them that you like this employer and want to start working with them."},{"instruction":"Hiiii could you rewrite this with the effects in bullet points?

Mars is much colder than Earth, in large part due to its greater distance from the sun. The average temperature is about minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 60 degrees Celsius), although it can vary from minus 195 F (minus 125 C) near the poles during the winter to as much as 70 F (20 C) at midday near the equator. The carbon-dioxide-rich atmosphere of Mars is also about 100 times less dense than Earth's on average, but it is nevertheless thick enough to support weather, clouds and winds. The density of the atmosphere varies seasonally, as winter forces carbon dioxide to freeze out of the Martian air. In the ancient past, the atmosphere was likely significantly thicker and able to support water flowing on the planet's surface. Over time, lighter molecules in the Martian atmosphere escaped under pressure from the solar wind, which affected the atmosphere because Mars does not have a global magnetic field. This process is being studied today by NASA's MAVEN (Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution) mission. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter found the first definitive detections of carbon-dioxide snow clouds, making Mars the only body in the solar system known to host such unusual winter weather. The Red Planet also causes water-ice snow to fall from the clouds. The dust storms on Mars are the largest in the solar system, capable of blanketing the entire Red Planet and lasting for months. One theory as to why dust storms can grow so big on Mars is because the airborne dust particles absorb sunlight, warming the Martian atmosphere in their vicinity. Warm pockets of air then flow toward colder regions, generating winds. Strong winds lift more dust off the ground, which, in turn, heats the atmosphere, raising more wind and kicking up more dust. These dust storms can pose serious risks to robots on the Martian surface. For example, NASA's Opportunity Mars rover died after being engulfed in a giant 2018 storm, which blocked sunlight from reaching the robot's solar panels for weeks at a time. Mars lies farther from the sun than Earth does, so the Red Planet has a longer year — 687 days compared to 365 for our home world. The two planets have similar day lengths, however; it takes about 24 hours and 40 minutes for Mars to complete one rotation around its axis, versus 24 hours for Earth. The axis of Mars, like Earth's, is tilted in relation to the sun. This means that like Earth, the amount of sunlight falling on certain parts of the Red Planet can vary widely during the year, giving Mars seasons. However, the seasons that Mars experiences are more extreme than Earth's because the Red Planet's elliptical, oval-shaped orbit around the sun is more elongated than that of any of the other major planets. When Mars is closest to the sun, its southern hemisphere is tilted toward our star, giving the planet a short, warm summer, while the northern hemisphere experiences a short, cold winter. When Mars is farthest from the sun, the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, giving it a long, mild summer, while the southern hemisphere experiences a long, cold winter. The tilt of the Red Planet's axis swings wildly over time because it's not stabilized by a large moon. This situation has led to different climates on the Martian surface throughout its history. A 2017 study suggests that the changing tilt also influenced the release of methane into Mars' atmosphere, causing temporary warming periods that allowed water to flow. The first person to observe Mars with a telescope was Galileo Galilei, in 1610. In the century following, astronomers discovered the planet's polar ice caps. In the 19th and 20th centuries, some researchers — most famously, Percival Lowell — believed they saw a network of long, straight canals on Mars that hinted at a possible civilization. However, these sightings proved to be mistaken interpretations of geological features. A number of Martian rocks have fallen to Earth over the eons, providing scientists a rare opportunity to study pieces of Mars without having to leave our planet. One of the most controversial finds was Allan Hills 84001 (ALH84001) — a Martian meteorite that, according to a 1996 study, likely contains tiny fossils and other evidence of Mars life. Other researchers cast doubt on this hypothesis, but the team behind the famous 1996 study have held firm to their interpretation, and the debate about ALH84001 continues today. In 2018, a separate meteorite study found that organic molecules — the carbon-containing building blocks of life, although not necessarily evidence of life itself — could have formed on Mars through battery-like chemical reactions. Robotic spacecraft began observing Mars in the 1960s, with the United States launching Mariner 4 in 1964 and Mariners 6 and 7 in 1969. Those early missions revealed Mars to be a barren world, without any signs of the life or civilizations people such as Lowell had imagined there. In 1971, Mariner 9 orbited Mars, mapping about 80% of the planet and discovering its volcanoes and big canyons.","output":"Diary Entry 1 - January 1, 2023 Preparing for our mission to Mars. She's a colder planet than Earth due to her greater distance from the sun. Her average temperature stays around -80°F. But things get even more extreme with temperatures reaching -195°F near the poles during winter. However, during midday near the equator, it can become quite bearable at 70°F. Diary Entry 2 - February 15, 2023 The Martian atmosphere is rich in CO2 but about 100 times less dense than ours. Interestingly, it's thick enough to support weather, clouds, and winds. Seasonal variations cause carbon dioxide to freeze out of the Martian air during winter. Some say, in the past, the atmosphere was likely denser, capable of supporting flowing water. Diary Entry 3 - April 5, 2023 Over time, lighter molecules in the Martian atmosphere have escaped, largely due to pressure from the solar wind. Mars lacks a global magnetic field, so the atmosphere is affected more directly. NASA's MAVEN mission is studying this process currently, uncovering more mysteries of our destination. Diary Entry 4 - May 20, 2023 NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has found carbon-dioxide snow clouds, making Mars unique in our solar system. Mars' winters are not just chilling but also dust-ridden. Dust storms there are the largest known, capable of blanketing the entire planet and lasting for months. This results from airborne dust absorbing sunlight and causing wind. I hope our equipment can withstand this Martian fury. Diary Entry 5 - July 10, 2023 We have finally arrived at our destination after about seven months. Mars has a longer year compared to Earth due to its farther distance from the sun — 687 days compared to our 365. Days there are nearly identical to ours, with a complete rotation taking about 24 hours and 40 minutes. This will surely help us in maintaining our Earth-based routines. Diary Entry 6 - August 25, 2023 Mars, like Earth, experiences seasons due to its axial tilt. The difference is, Martian seasons are more extreme. When Mars is closest to the sun, its southern hemisphere gets a short, warm summer, and the northern one gets a short, cold winter. When farthest, it's the other way around. This celestial ballet will be something to behold. Diary Entry 7 - October 1, 2023 Still getting used to the environment here. The Martian axis tilt isn't stabilized by a large moon like Earth's. It has led to different climates on Mars throughout its history. A study suggests that the changing tilt might have caused temporary warming periods that allowed water to flow, releasing methane into Mars' atmosphere. Diary Entry 8 - November 15, 2023 Mars has been the subject of observation since Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study it in 1610. Astronomers later discovered its polar ice caps. Some even mistook geological features for long canals, hinting at a possible civilization. We are, in a way, stepping into the footprints of these early observers. Diary Entry 9 - December 30, 2023 Like several Martian rocks have made their way to Earth, our return home will also provide scientists with information for unique study opportunities. Although not like the rock Allan Hills 84001 (ALH84001) that was found in 1996 and believed to contain potential evidence of Mars's life, this expedition still contributes significantly to our understanding. Diary Entry 10 - February 10, 2024 Reflecting on this mission manned mission, we have certainly come a long way since the robotic exploration of Mars that began in the 1960s. Early missions like Mariner 4 and Mariners 6 and 7 revealed Mars as a barren world. Later, Mariner 9 orbited Mars, mapping about 80% of the planet and discovering its volcanoes and grand canyons. Our journey continues this legacy of discovery, bringing humanity closer to Mars. We look forward to touching back down on Earth soon."},{"instruction":"Create an acrostic poem for camping","output":"Camping in the woods for some peace and quiet A great way to decompress from the busy world Maybe glamping if you prefer Pick a place by the fire to tell stories around Indeed there is an owl joining the crowd Next morning make breakfast on a pan and open flame Going to be the best day of the year"},{"instruction":"Why is Scott Hastings so frustrated with ballroom dancing? Here's a summary of the movie I'm talking about: Scott Hastings, the frustrated son of a family of ballroom dancers, has been training since the age of six. His mother Shirley teaches ballroom dancing, and his father Doug meekly handles maintenance chores at the dance studio, while secretly watching old footage of his bygone dance competitions as well as Scott's in a back room. Scott struggles to establish his personal style of dance to win the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix Dancing Championship, but his innovative and flashy \\"crowd-pleasing\\" steps are not considered \\"strictly ballroom\\", and as such are denounced by Australian Dancing Federation head Barry Fife. Scott and his dancing partner Liz Holt lose the Southern Districts Waratah Championships due to Scott dancing his own steps. Three days later, Liz leaves him to team up with Ken Railings, the recent Waratah Championships winner; his partner Pam Short has broken both her legs in a car accident. With Scott now alone only three weeks until the championships, Shirley teams up with his coach Les Kendall, her co-instructor at the studio, to start desperately hunting for a new partner for him. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to both, Scott is approached by Fran, an overlooked \\"beginner\\" dancer at the studio. He eventually agrees to partner with her, intrigued by her willingness to dance \\"his way\\".","output":"Scott Hastings is frustrated with ballroom dancing because he is unable to dance his own steps. There are very strict rules in the ballroom dancing competition in which he competes, and his steps are not considered appropriate or acceptable."},{"instruction":"In 2-3 sentences, summarize these paragraphs about the Shanghai Dragons. Here are the paragraphs I'm referring to. Around this time last year, the professional Overwatch team Shanghai Dragons had just finished up a history-making 0-40 season. At the time, nobody would have expected that just one year later they’d be leaving the league’s top three teams in a heap of black-and-blue bodies on the ground. Maybe they should change their name to the Shanghai Phoenixes. Overwatch League season two’s third stage culminated in a mini-tournament over the weekend with hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line. Shanghai Dragons came out on top. They had the hardest possible path to this championship: They barely made it into the stage finals as the eighth seed, and then they took out the league’s three best teams—New York Excelsior, Vancouver Titans, and San Francisco Shock—back to back to back.","output":"Last season, the Shanghai Dragons finished a shockingly awful 0-40 season.

Give me four or five ideas.","output":"There are lots of ways to decorate a Christmas tree! Here are a few that are quite unique: - Faux Greenery: Faux greenery can be obtained in garlands, and these can be wrapped around your tree. This can make your tree look fuller, but it also may make people do a double-take if you have a fake white Christmas tree. - Favorite Things: Have your family take all of their favorite things that are small enough to fit on the tree and hang them on it. This is very personalized and can include anything from a favorite hat to a scarf or a pair of earrings. This mismatched-looking tree decor fits perfectly, especially since it might give you gift ideas when you see some things your family members like. - Global-Inspired: If you've done any traveling and have collected any knickknacks from places you've been, put all of these on the tree. This can be a good way to remember some of the places you've been, and it should also spark conversations with guests who ask about them. - Party Decorations: Christmas is a type of party, so why not use some party decorations? These tend to be quite colorful, and often only get used a handful of times throughout the year anyway. - Hang Christmas Greetings: People often give out Christmas cards to all the people they know, so why not hang these up where everyone can see? You can also print out words with fancy lettering on nice paper, cut these out, and use them as ornaments on the tree. Let me know if you want any more ideas!"},{"instruction":"Write a short fictional (<7 sentences) news article about how Switzerland has invaded the Carribean islands and the Bahamas are overrun by yodellers.

Can you create something for me? I want to read a short story about a quaint cafe that has the perfect setting for a cozy, relaxing restaurant experience; except, when a patron notices how quiet an infant at the cafe is being, their remark to the parents awakens the sleeping baby and it begins to scream, thus ruining the environment for everyone.","output":"“What a wonderful day!” Craig thought to himself, approaching the small cafe. Walking towards the door, he passed bikes parked out front without locks and could see into the window. “The cafe looks wonderful today,” he remarked. Through the untinted glass, Craig could see people quietly keeping to themselves. Some customers were working on laptops, some were writing in journals, and others were reading novels of various sizes. Craig had not lived in the area long, but he could certainly get accustomed to such a cozy environment. Craig had just moved from Florida to Rome, and the vibe back home was much different. There was not a single locale in Tampa you could go to without being accosted by the thoughtlessness of the public loudly doing whatever they wanted wherever they wanted. It was different in Italy. With his bucket hat snug on his head, Craig entered the cafe. Better than the difference in the politeness of his neighbors was the quality of Italian sandwiches he could order here. Freshly-made sandwich in hand, Craig moved towards an open table when he noticed a baby. Usually, you could hear a Tampa baby from a mile away. He could not keep to himself how impressed he was by the baby’s ability to remain silent, so he was compelled to say something: “I cannot believe how quiet this baby is!” The moment he began to speak, the two parents of the baby looked up from their books and shot a stare at Craig with each bringing a finger to their mouths—unfortunately, they were too late. Cooing awake, the baby opened its eyes and looked around. They were afraid for a moment, but it seemed they were safe. Craig quietly apologized and found his seat. The Italian sandwich he ordered looked like it could be in a magazine. Craig imagined the publication’s title: ‘Best Sandwiches of Italy,’ with his sandwich on the cover. Raising the first half of his meaty sandwich, just before he could take a bite a shockwave startled the cafe. The previously silent baby was now in full panic mode, ruining the atmosphere for everyone inside the restaurant. It was all Craig’s fault, and everyone else knew it. Craig sunk low into his chair and pulled his bucket hat over his face, hoping his new neighbors might forgive him."},{"instruction":"I'm drawing a map of my fictional fantasy DnD game.

Illustrations of monsters: Much like the maps of antiquity, you could include detailed illustrations of the various monsters and beasts of the world that your party encountered or slew along the way. These would occupy places in the margins or beyond the borders of the known world of your setting. 4. Major characters: Alternatively, you could provide illustrations of important characters your party may have encountered through their quest. 5. A compass rose: This would establish the relative direction of various places and events in your game to each other. 6. A scale: It may be useful to know the approximate distance between locations on the map via a scale.

He used to be able to think clearly, but for some reason that had gotten so difficult for him recently. He turned around and fired his rifle again.

Take a seat and store your stuff: An entryway bench not only serves as a cozy spot to put on your shoes, but it also provides hidden storage for things like shoes, bags, and umbrellas. 2. Contain your clutter with pretty storage: Invest in stylish storage containers that can stack and slide easily under furniture, such as the bed or sofa. You can store all your extra blankets, seasonal clothing, and other items without adding clutter to your living space. 3. Summon up some seating with added storage: Poufs are a perfect solution for small apartments because they function as both extra seating and hidden storage. Place them throughout your apartment to add texture and depth while also providing a space to stash your belongings. 4. Elevate Your Sleeping Quarters: Consider lofting your bed to make way for additional storage or a cozy seating area underneath. 5.

One is under a dictatorship.","output":"This story is set in the multiverse, primarily across two universes where one is attempting to conquer all other universes, although they don't see it that way -- instead, they see it as proselytizing in accordance with their faith tradition.

In many ways, it’s exactly like Earth as it is a parallel universe. Many of the cities look exactly like Earth Prime cities superficially, but the closer you look, the more significant the differences become. It's a theocratic society based on prosperity beliefs with a rigid caste system. The belief system is an extreme fundamentalist Christian faith. Within it, citizens claim to see angels and interact with God, but the truth is that many of those people are just working the system due to the rigidity of the caste structure.

The skies were a bit overcast and the water was a bit cold and so there weren't very many visitors to the shore on this particular day. Barry wasn't a huge fan of people, but he was a huge fan of all the snacks they came with and left behind. First Barry came across a bag of chips but after poking his head in he could only find crumbs. It was a barbecue, anyway, his least favorite flavor. Waddling around a bit farther he explored closer to the picnic benches that usually bustled with families but nothing too tasty jumped out at him. There was part of a hot dog bun with a little ketchup left on it, but that's hardly a meal for a bird, especially not one as discerning as Barry. Oh well, Barry thought to himself, \\"Sometimes the bird gets the worm, and sometimes the worm gets away.\\" Hopping around a bit more he saw some Seagull friends in the sky circling something. With his curiosity piqued he took a few hesitant steps and blasted himself into the air. Well, he almost made it. His right wing was bruised from a run-in with a light pole and still didn't work quite right. After a few false starts and a few less-than-graceful squawks, he was airborne. Joining his friends, he tried to see what they were looking at but couldn't make anything out. \\"Hey guys, what's going on up here?\\" Barry asked. All the seagulls ignored him but Jeff. Jeff was always a solid guy. \\"Oh hey Barry, don't mind the guys, you know how they get. There was an ice cream truck down there and a bit of a spill. We've been trying to wait for the all-clear to dive in but it looks like the humans got to it first and cleaned it up.\\" \\"Yeah, I haven't had any luck out there either,\\" Barry said to Jeff, \\"Hey, why don't you and I go check out the french fry stand at the end of the boardwalk? People always go there when it rains. There has to be something good.\\" \\"Now that's the best idea I've heard all day; you sure your wing can make it?\\" \\"Let's go!\\""},{"instruction":"Where does bacon come from?","output":"Bacon is made from pork.

Can we start our discussion with a paragraph of 7 sentences?","output":"There are a couple of contexts of traditional learning that might help you understand how models learn. The first is a classroom, where there is a teacher that filters and provides information to students so they can glean understanding from it. They teach with a target like improving the average standardized test scores in the room, not unlike supervised machine learning models. In contrast, scientists observe the environment around them in order to learn new things. The goals of this type of learning are not clearly defined, though the methods might be, so we are not quite sure what the results will look like. This mirrors the setup and results from unsupervised learning. The two techniques can be blended in a classroom, where a teacher sets up an environment for students to observe but does not directly lead them to any answers, similar to hybrid machine learning models. Hope this helps!"},{"instruction":"Who was the first person on the moon?","output":"On 21 July 1969, American astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first person to walk on the Moon, after the successful landing of the spaceflight Apollo 11.

Can you make it sound friendly also","output":"A Step-by-Step Guide to Cleaning the Dishes 1. Ensure you have an organized space: Many people find washing dishes easier when they have a designated area for washing, rinsing, and drying dishes. 2. Prepare your dishes: make sure your plates don’t have any excess food by scraping particles into the garbage. 3. Fill up one side of your sink with warm soapy water. 4. It might be easier to start with the least dirty items. You’ll find it keeps your water cleaner for a longer amount of time. 5. Scrub your dishes with a sponge, brush, or dishcloth! Apply pressure as you wipe to get rid of stains. If there are stubborn areas, letting the dish or glass soak in the warm soapy water will help loosen it up. 6. In a separate basin, run fresh water and rinse your dishes, making sure you’re clearing off suds and stains. For bowls and cups, this is extremely important. If you have any pots and pans, you might want to let them soak for longer, as cooked-on food and grease stains will be harder to clean. 7. After you’ve rinsed your dishes, place them in the drying area. This can be a drying rack placed over a towel or simply drying them manually with a clean towel and putting them away. 8. After all the dishes are out of the sink, you can drain the soapy warm water and use your sponge or brush to clean the sink of soap and food residue. 9. It’s important to sanitize your dishwashing tools properly. The easiest way to do this is soaking them in a water and bleach mixture or running them through the dishwasher. 10. Check your area and ensure everything is put away in its proper spot and your area is tidy and ready for the next round of dishes. If you follow these steps, you can have clean and organized dishware that’s ready for your next meal!"},{"instruction":"What is the capital of France?","output":"Awesome question!

Use language that favors Smosh.","output":"SNL is a long-standing sketch comedy television show run by Lorne Michaels. Over the past few years Lorne, the cast, and the show as a whole have been criticized as the audience dwindled. The drop in audience numbers can be explained by the economic downturn caused by the pandemic and changing demographics, but other factors include criticisms around their handling of the 2016 election and depictions of Donald Trump on the show, as well as criticism levied against them around racist, misogynist, and homophobic content written into sketches. Not only that but in the writer's room as well. In all of this, audiences have been turning to free and widely-available content. But what could possibly compare to the cultural monument that SNL has become? In comparison, YouTube has also seen a shift in viewership over the course of the past few years. Large companies producing content have become fewer and fewer as channels run by single creators rose in popularity. Many creators signed under media management companies, or in the case of Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla, sold their brands to produce content in a larger scope. In 2018, Defy Media shuttered its operations, sending several creators on the platform into a freefall of uncertainty. Smosh, the brainchild of Ian and Anthony, rose from the ashes as the company was acquired by Rhett and Link's company Mythical. Over the past few years, the cast and crew have been recreating the brand's identity. Arguably, Smosh may be catching up to SNL. Smosh's improvisational segments and shows are bolstered by personalities such as Amanda Lehan-Canto, Chanse McCrary, Jackie Uweh, and Shayne Topp. Doubling as writers and producers, the creativity behind the content has changed over the years and given Smosh a new, hilarious identity. Smosh's main channel is still a home for written sketches, and their side channel Smosh Pit houses improv and talk segments.

Crocheting uses a single hook to create a series of loops hooked together while knitting uses two needles to form loops moving from one needle to the other. Crocheting is generally considered easier as the basic movements are easier to learn. These two methods are considered to be better for making different items.

Mrs. Allen hadn't said a word, just winked and walked back to her house before Muriel could react. It wasn't until later that night that Muriel heard the necklace singing to her from its place on her dresser. She was too scared to try it on yet, which is why she'd left it burrowed safely in the cushions of her jewelry box. But every night the singing grew louder and louder, the temptation to wear it gaining momentum. Muriel wasn't sure what was going to happen once she tried it on. All that she knew was that she had to get it back before someone else found it. Janet told her daughter that she'd taken it to the local police station. Getting the necklace back was going to be trickier than she thought."},{"instruction":"Write a synopsis for a children's TV show about family pets with anthropomorphic qualities.

Lusa is the pet of a 13-year-old boy named Braddox who maintains a social media account about hamster care, so she thinks of herself as a big star much to the chagrin of the other family pets, which includes Sushi the very large goldfish, Dunham the overweight chihuahua mix, a fluffy white Persian cat named Cloud, and three matching black cats who are always plotting to prank the other animals. Every day after Braddox leaves for school, Lusa gets out of her enclosure to hang out with the other pets and prepare for her next social media appearance, but the three black cats are always spoiling her plans in a Tom-and-Jerry style rivalry between hamster and felines.

Give me some ideas for an ice cream-themed party","output":"Sounds like a great time! I've got a few ideas for an ice cream party: 1. Buy unusual flavors for the kids to try, and tell them about some of the crazy flavors they can find in other countries. Ask them if they'd like to try squid ink ice cream, for example. Think about setting up an ice cream bar with unconventional toppings beyond syrup and sprinkles. 2. Which season goes perfectly with ice cream? Summer! Have a summer-themed party at the beach, or hang up beach decorations at your house. Tell the guests to bring their swimsuits so they can play in the inflatable (or in-ground) pool. 3. Have a birthday party at your local ice cream parlor. Many franchises organize children's parties, which means that the employees will also be there to help you out. Plus, everyone gets to try their gourmet ice cream."},{"instruction":"What are 5 excercises to build bigger arms in the gym?","output":"Here are five exercises you can do to grow your arms. 1. Dead hang pull-up. The dead hang pull-up is a variation of the standard pull-up and is excellent for working your biceps. Start by grabbing a pull-up bar underhanded so your palms are facing you. Your arms should be about shoulder-width apart. Hold your weight, cross your legs behind your body, and raise your feet slightly so your knees are bent. This is your starting position. To perform the exercise, pull yourself up so that your collarbone is in line with the bar. The trick to performing this exercise is to lower yourself at a slower pace. About 4 seconds will be best. Now repeat until you are unable to do any more. 2. Rolling skull crusher with press. Start by lying on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand, raised straight above your chest. Now allow your elbows to bend so that the dumbbells fall beside your head in a controlled manner. Now reverse this motion so that the dumbbells are in the original position and perform a press like a bench press. Once you have completed all these motions, that's considered one rep. This exercise works your triceps and chest, so it's versatile when trying to build muscle. You can use a Swiss ball instead of a bench for more difficulty. This will work your abs as well. 3. Drag curl. Everyone knows that curls help to build your biceps and arms in general. This exercise is no different in that sense but is performed with some differences. Start by holding the barbell with a shoulder-width, underhand grip. Now you should pull your shoulders down and back. When doing this, you should drag the bar up the front of your body, keep your elbows around, and slowly lower the barbell. To work slightly harder, try using dumbbells instead of a barbell. 4. Grasshopper pushup. Like curls, pushups are renowned as an excellent exercise for building muscle and strength. This variation pays particular attention to your arms. To perform this exercise, get in a standard pushup position, but instead of having your palms open, use your fists to stabilize yourself. The inside of your hands should be facing each other. Once in this position, you perform a pushup as usual by lowering your chest to the ground and pushing back up to start. If this hurts your fists, you can face your fingers out to work the same muscles. 5. Supinated cable row. To perform this exercise, you will need a cable station. Use the low pulley on the cable station and attach a straight bar. Using an underhand grip, shoulder width apart, row the bar towards your belly button and return with control. Keep your hips back and your stance soft so that your torso is around 45 degrees angle to vertical. You can also do this with a barbell once you have mastered the exercise with the cable station."},{"instruction":"Please write an acrostic style poem using the word \\"SEPTEMBER\\" that explores the delights of autumn in New England, as well as the melancholy that comes with the changing of the seasons.","output":"Sunshine in the afternoons, hitting the colored leaves just right and setting the whole world aflame in their glow.

Doll's clothes - Since she likes dolls, she will probably love a few new outfits for them. 2. Doll accessories - There are plenty of other accessories you can get for dolls that don't have anything to do with clothes. This can include things like tiny dishes, cars, or furniture. 3. Doll organizers - If your niece has a lot of dolls, clothes for them, etc., she should love having a way to organize them. Depending on the type you buy, this could let her see all her dolls at once so she can easily decide which one she wants to play with. Her mother will probably appreciate this as well, as it should help her clean up. 4. Personalized hat kit - Since your niece likes hats, give her a kit where she can bedazzle or color her own hat to make it personalized to be just the way she wants it. 5. Doll games - With how popular dolls are, there are both card and board games that mention or picture dolls. Though most of these are designed for kids older than five, your niece might love them enough to be able to learn how to play them. 6. Hat organizers - As your niece probably has several hats, try to come up with some way she can organize them so that she can still see them all.

I would like to make some new friends but I don't think I am confident enough to just go out and start talking to people. How can I make new friends?","output":"I understand starting in a new city can be a new challenge, but don't be discouraged here are some ideas to make new friends: 1. Social media: Social media is a great way to connect with new people in your area. For example, if there is a Reddit community for your new city, you can make a post there detailing a little bit about yourself, what you're interested in, and that you'd like to meet some new people. Of course, always exercise caution if and when you decide to meet up with anyone you have been talking to online. 2. Befriend colleagues: If you're starting a new job in the city, this is an easy way to meet new people and build friendships. If you have some colleagues that you click with, try asking them if they'd like to hang out outside of work and see how that goes. 3. Social events: Going to a large event is a great way to meet new people and maybe even develop friendships. For example, if you have a favorite music artist who is playing a show in your city, turn up a little early and try to strike up conversations with others waiting in line. Your shared love of the artist will already give you a common ground for building a friendship. 4. Take up a new hobby: Whether you have an existing hobby or want to take up a new one, it is a good way to meet new people who share your interests. Look online to see if there are any local groups or meet-ups for people who pursue the hobbies you enjoy. 5. Friendship apps: Apps aren't just for dating anymore! Many apps revolve around building new platonic friendships, such as Bumble BFF. You can make a profile listing your interests and hobbies and see who you connect with. As always, ensure if you're meeting someone from an app, do it in a safe and neutral environment."},{"instruction":"I am opening an ice cream shop in New Jersey.

Taylor Ham or Pork Roll - This is a reference to the debate as to what New Jerseyans call the pink breakfast meat.

I'd be happy to help you get prepared for your date: 1. Take a shower - Make sure you take a bath or shower before you go on your date. Don't go on a date immediately after work without getting clean and refreshed, as you may be carrying around sweat and grime from your job. 2. Get a haircut - Get unkempt hair under control. Cut your hair so it looks presentable, or if you elect to keep your hair long, at least put it in a ponytail or bun so it doesn't overhang your ears or get into your food when you're eating. 3. Groom your facial hair - If you have a beard or mustache, shave it off. If your date wants to get closer to you, you don't want your facial hair poking them or giving them a rash when you both get physically close and intimate. Or, if you insist on keeping your facial hair, at the very least, you should trim and groom it so it doesn't look scraggly. 4. Use fragrances (but don't overdo it!) - cologne or deodorant is always a plus...put some on before your date so you smell extra good. But don't overdo it, because an overwhelming smell of cologne can be too pungent for your date's nose and can put them off completely. 5. Dress to impress - Unless the occasion warrants it, don't come to a date with a t-shirt, surf shorts, and slippers/flip-flops. Dress nicely; this means wearing something that would be used on a date, like slacks or dress pants (or jeans), a button-up shirt or polo shirt, and closed-toe shoes. 6. Have transportation - If you don't have a mode of transportation, you can always get an Uber or taxi to take you to the location of the date. But try to secure some mode of transportation so you can easily travel to and from the date, or even take your date home when it's all over. For example, a bicycle would not be a good choice of transportation for two people. 7. Pick a nice place - Consider going on a date to a place that is fun and where both of you will enjoy being there, such as on a walk on the beach, to a nice restaurant or coffee shop, or to a movie at the theater. Places that are hectic or frenetic can be offputting to your date and can make conversation and getting to know them better near impossible (e.g. loud concerts, live fighting events, etc.) 8. Be polite - Be nice to your date; be a gentleman and mind your manners. Avoid using foul or abrasive language, be complimentary to your date, and show interest in the other person rather than focusing your conversation on yourself (unless your date asks you questions about yourself). 9. Refrain from using your phone - In this day and age of increased cell phone use, one of the best ways to show you are disinterested in your date is to use your phone while you are in their presence. Put the phone down, make eye contact with your date, and don't check calls or emails without at least asking permission from your date before doing so. Even then, try to keep the phone checking short and screen your calls so you aren't talking on the phone unless it is an emergency."},{"instruction":"Please Write a Commercial Script about the Disadvantages of Alcohol in your Body during Pregnancy based on this article \\"When you drink, alcohol passes from your blood through the placenta to your baby and can seriously affect its development.

During the first half of the 1980s, the rate of Delta launches drastically declined due to the Space Shuttle taking a large part of its missions. Orders for the booster slowed to a trickle and McDonnell-Douglas came close to completely shutting down production. 1985 was the first year since the Delta family's introduction in 1960 that no launches took place, but the Challenger Disaster brought about a renewed need for disposable launch vehicles and orders soon picked up again. While only a handful of Delta launches took place in 1986–88, nine flew in 1989 and the 1990s would see a busy schedule most years except 1994-1995 (seven launches during those two years). Delta 178 was largely the result of poor quality control due to plans for eventually phasing out ELVs in favor of the space shuttle - most of the engineers who worked on the program had left and one senior McDonnell-Douglass engineer remarked that 178 had \\"the worst quality control I ever saw on a Delta vehicle\\". Because it was assumed that the Delta would soon be retired from use, complaints about the poor assembly quality went unheard. After the accident, a thorough investigation of wiring systems in various ELV families was undertaken, which discovered that, among other things, the Delta had thinner wiring insulation than Titan, Atlas, and other launch vehicles. Moreover, Teflon insulation had the unique ability of melting and re-fusing when heated by electrical arcs.

The trees and wildflowers seemed to sway and bob their heads in greeting, saying, \\"Hello again, old friend.\\" In the distance, sunlight sparkled on the surface of the lake. The scent of pine and damp moss was underscored by the smell of burning firewood, and Mike saw smoke rising from the cabin's chimney. His sister Phoebe and her husband Jamal must have arrived hours ago. \\"What's the wifi password?\\" his son, Charlie, asked, stepping out of the car without so much as a glance up at the cabin. \\"No wifi here, buddy.\\" \\"What?\\" Charlie squawked, incredulous. \\"How could you not warn me before we left?\\" In retrospect, Mike thought, perhaps he should have allowed his son to bring a friend along.

His daughter Nina was next to climb out of the car, popping the trunk to make sure her luggage hadn't been damaged on the drive. It was obvious that Nina had packed for a vacation entirely different from the one she was actually on; her strappy sandals and cream linen jumpsuit wouldn’t last an hour before the mud surrounding the cabin irreparably soiled the clothes and the jagged rocks punched holes in her leather soles. She stood by the trunk, tapping her feet for a minute before Mike caught her eye. “Sorry,” Mike teased, “Bellhop’s on break right now, so you’ll have to carry those bags in yourself.” Nina sighed, rolled her eyes, and wrenched her duffel from the pile. On the back porch, Mike found his sister serving a tray of freshly baked biscuits--a family tradition. \\"Hey, brother,\\" she grinned as he planted a kiss on her cheek. \\"You're just in time.\\" Mike greeted Phoebe and Jamal briefly but didn't make any small talk. Not yet.

He quickly turned back to see who was there. But no one was. It was just the door, now barely cracked open, and total darkness inside. Suddenly, a hand reached through the crack in the door and dropped a full-sized 3 musketeer bar into his bag before pulling back and closing the door.

People in the town of Woldford woke up to unusual scenes in their town yesterday morning, with hundreds of robots with superhuman capabilities roaming their town. No one knew of the origin of the robots, just that they might have landed in the town overnight and the fact that they started creating havoc and confusion for the residents of the town. Flying and running everywhere, they'd get super angry at people who tried to push them away, just trying to get around with their businesses. The robots were in office buildings, shops, malls, manufacturing plants, and everywhere else. Some of them got to work, making vehicles within an hour, causing mayhem with their driving tactics in opposite directions. The local government has been contacted, and a quick solution is expected to be implemented soon."},{"instruction":"Come up with ways to approach a person who you are interested in dating, without seeming like a weirdo. Be genuine and considerate in your suggestions.","output":"1. Strike up a conversation - Do whatever you can to start (and hold) a conversation that doesn't involve attempting to hook up with the person you're talking to. While in some instances some people may appreciate your honesty and frankness, most attraction comes from getting to know someone and enjoying talking with them. 2. Learn to hold a conversation - Once you've started the conversation, be aware that sometimes you just might not have anything to talk about with someone. Either find something to talk about (I like to ask questions of someone and then ask follow-up questions to learn about them better) or leave the conversation altogether if you're not feeling good about it. 3. Smile - No one likes a negative attitude. Being positive and confident goes a long way in approaching and meeting someone new. People open up to you when you smile and are inviting in your posture; don't slouch or scowl, stand upright and look straight into their eyes, and smile. 4. Find common interests, or even interests you find interesting - You don't have to have everything in common with someone before you consider them a good match for a date. This is why conversation is so important: if you don't find out anything more about someone and just try to hook up with someone based solely on their looks, you might find out you have nothing in common with them later on down the road. On the flip side of that coin, learning about someone you might not necessarily find conventionally attractive might surprise you - you might have a lot in common and not know it. 5. Have something to do while you get to know each other - Have a conversation over a cup of coffee, a meal, or a game of cards. Having something to do during a getting-to-know-you-better conversation can help fill in the silent areas where there is a lull in the conversation."},{"instruction":"Write a one-paragraph story about going for a walk from a dog's perspective and make it simple enough for kids as young as five years old.","output":"My name is Arthur and I am a Golden Retriever, my favorite hobby in the world is to go for walks with my owner. Let me tell you what is so fun about walks. First off, it is all the different things you can smell; as a dog, my sense of smell is very strong, much stronger than a human's. When I walk around outside, I can smell all the other dogs that came before me! and find out about all the friends I could have in my neighborhood. Sometimes I get to see dogs too! and if I'm really lucky, we meet up close. Some dogs aren't as friendly as I am, but a lot of them are, and getting to say hi to them is really fun. Another thing that's great about walks is that I get to look around at all the different houses. Sometimes when people are gardening outside they'll talk to me and pet me and sometimes I get to chase their cats, but I am only playing, I love cats too. The last thing that I love about walks is that I get to spend quality time with my human.

Start alphabetically (with Alabama) and include a short description of each bird.","output":"1. State: Alabama Bird: Northern Flicker - This bird is medium-sized and a part of the woodpecker family. It’s known by the name “yellowhammer” in the state of Alabama because when it flies, the under-part of its wings are yellow. These birds eat bugs and worms out of the ground, so it’s not uncommon to find one at ground level. 2. State: Alaska Bird: Willow Ptarmigan - This bird uses camouflage to protect itself during different seasons. In the winter, it’s white in color while in the summer, they are a mix of reds and browns. They are heavily feathered to protect themselves against extreme cold and can burrow deep into the snow for protection against outside elements. 3. State: Arizona Bird: Cactus Wren - The cactus wren is a noisy bird that makes raw, scratchy sounds. They are very busy little birds and are often seen hopping around, fanning their tails, or singing loudly on top of cacti plants. 4.

State: California Bird: California Quail - This bird’s shape is very round and has a gray breast and forward-drooping head plume. It has a “Chi-ca-go” call sound and can often be seen scratching at the ground. They also travel in large groups so you don’t often spot just one or two hanging around. 6. State: Colorado Bird: Lark Bunting - The lark bunting birds are a breed of handsome sparrows and the males boast brilliant black with white wing coverts. The females are sandy brown in color. These birds feed with other sparrow species or quail in flocks. 7.

They have a cheery song and live in either the city or the mountains and wilderness areas. 8. State: Delaware Bird: Blue Hen Chicken - The blue hen is a strain of American gamecock. These chickens were known for their fighting abilities back when fighting was legal in the United States. 9. State: Florida Bird: Northern Mockingbird - The northern mockingbirds are very noisy and rarely stop “singing.” Their bodies are pale gray and they flash their white wing patches to ward off intruders. 10.

It happens every day. We have all seen stories like hers. When the attention went away though, her world remained shattered. At times she felt certain that she would never recover from the grief. It weighed so heavily on her heart that there were days when she could only lie in bed, unable to think of anything else. However, underneath the pain was the same drive and stubbornness that had always been there, only now with a new call to action. Jane knew that she needed to create something positive out of the pain she was feeling. One morning while cooking breakfast she realized that starting her own business might be just what she needed. When the business idea appeared, Jane hit the ground running. The business was a representation of her and there was no room for error or mistakes. She became obsessed with success, using every ounce of energy and determination within her being to make sure that deadlines were met and things ran smoothly (at least from the outside). Customers may not have known how important this work was to Jane's personal journey, but they could objectively appreciate the product offered for sale. With each passing month, Jane’s business began growing exponentially as more customers were attracted by the quality and services offered at competitive prices. It wasn't long before word spread about how successful Jane's venture had become - people admired not only what she had achieved but also how resiliently she'd overcome such tragedy to do it! Though running a successful business took up all of Jane's time, it gave her immense satisfaction knowing that despite all odds against them they have triumphed over their grief and loss through sheer hard work and dedication. Now Jane is one of the most respected entrepreneurs in town. More importantly, she has also begun to seriously work on the process of healing herself, and doing so with the same vigor as she gives the other priorities in her life. Despite some inevitable setbacks along the way due to competition or other external factors, nothing could stop them from achieving success because they knew exactly where their strengths lay - resilience & perseverance!"},{"instruction":"I'm visiting Philadelphia next month on a business trip.

Here are five of the best cheesesteak shops in Philadelphia along with some information about each restaurant: - Steve's Prince of Steaks. This Northeast Philly cheesesteak spot hasn't changed its recipe much in the past forty years. If you want a classic steak sandwich made with rib-eye that's shaved to an eighth of an inch, then drenched in Cheese Whiz, look no further than Steve's Prince of Steaks. - Dalessandro’s Steaks and Hoagies. Regarded by some as the very best cheesesteak in Philadelphia, Dalessandro's packs their rolls full of finely chopped rib-eye with the cheese mixed in and chunky pieces of onion for a flavor experience that's well worth the trip. - Sonny's Famous Steaks. Located in tourist-friendly Old City, Sonny's offers friendly service, a tremendous product, and manageable lines. If you are in the area and on a schedule, check out Sonny's for a delicious cheesesteak without the wait. - Geno's Steaks. This 24-7 cheesesteak shop is a Philadelphia landmark, so expect a line at most times of the day. That being said, Geno's is one of the most famous steak shops in Philly for a reason so be sure to check it out if you have the time to spare. - Pat's King of Steaks. Another iconic Philadelphia location, Pat's on Passyunk claims to have literally invented the cheesesteak back in 1930. Located down the street from Geno's Steaks, Pat's is also open 24-7 and usually has a long line of tourists and regulars. If your schedule is flexible or you're a night owl, consider visiting Pat's at an odd hour in order to avoid the line. I hope that you've found this list helpful and that you have a productive and safe work trip where you get to enjoy several cheesesteaks.

Make it a little old-fashioned in tone, maybe a tad Gothic.","output":"Every time Meghan forgot about that dream, it would come back to startle her. Each and every time she thought, \\"I'll tell my therapist about it,\\" but then thoughts of the dream would fade away in the course of her very busy day, and other concerns would take their place. Besides, her husband's sleepy face and the feeling of his muscular body against hers would make the past seem irrelevant, at least for the moment. He has his own traumas to deal with, she would tell herself, though this was a contradictory thought because she relied as much on his solidity as he relied on her good taste. She knew they could talk about anything, and yet... this one was tough. She would dream of a house. It was a bit like Nott-Cott, and a bit like Frogmore, but not really... there were elements of California in there too, but not current California - this was something from the 80s. This house felt like a whole past life. She found family heirlooms mixed with Dr. Seuss books, old trophies, and old fine arts posters you might find in the room of an aspirational teenager, plus some of her favorite high school clothing items in a high chest of drawers. But there was a whole sector of the house she could not visit. She would not visit. Evil lurked there. She had a memory of having visited those rooms, and terror struck her heart. Each time, she woke up winded. Harry would take her in his arms and ask, \\"Are you all right, my love?\\" and she would say \\"Yes.\\" This morning would be different. It was 5 am, and the children were still asleep. The house personnel was busily preparing the day's business downstairs, and Meghan would seize the moment. They would have coffee in bed, and she would tell him all about it.

It could not have been Agatha, because despite being in the room at the time of Mark's murder, she doesn't have any blood on her hands. In fact, she doesn't even have any dirt or grime on her hands, despite claiming that she was helping Gus in the yard. She lied about doing any chores around the house because she didn't want to let her husband Mark know she was going out of the house to meet her secret lover at the motel down the street. Gus was, however, in the yard diligently pulling weeds to ensure the grounds were kept clean and tidy before the arrival of our esteemed guests. This can be evidenced by the dirt Gus tracked from the yard, through the living room and into his bedroom. The tracks go across the threshold fronting the living room where the murder took place; the dirt remains undisturbed in this area, which means the killer did the deed before Gus entered the house as there is no dirt under the body. So he had to have been killed before Gus tracked in the dirt. No dirt was present in the living room, which means Gus is cleared of any wrongdoing. However, one person had the opportunity, motive, and means to carry out the murder: Michael. Michael never leaves the house; he has agoraphobia. The fear and anxiety he felt when he was prodded by Mark to come outside for a drink, only to be criticized and bullied by Mark and the others for refusing, caused Michael's anxiety to turn into rage. All Michael had to do was wait inside the living room with his glass of wine and wait. The slash marks on Mark's neck are the telltale bluish-purple hue of Michael's favorite drink, blueberry wine. And once an exam is done on the body, pieces of Michael's favorite wine glass will be found in Mark's neck; it will be shards of the pink design that was found on the front of his cup."},{"instruction":"Write these sentences in the future tense, with will.

Imagine the conflicts that might be going on and paint some of the key characters in a quick description of the world and lore.","output":"The kingdom of Melda was beset with conflict. The source of the conflict, as always, was the nature of higher beings. The humans and the dwarves disputed over the valuable resources below the surface, while the goblins and the elves were constantly at war over land. Queen Tilly, the fairy princess, had declared her intentions to gather her most powerful sorcerers and sorceresses to put the world under a great sleep, one from which they would never wake. To her, it seemed the fairest approach to the never-ending violence. All was not well within the fairy world either, despite the queen's insistence. Disputes of culture and philosophy dominated, with rival sects exacting violent revenge on one another in a vicious cycle of retaliation. Few could see a path forward from such vices. Those who were connected to the earth in some way—the Dryad Tinian, the human Vern, and the satyr Torbjyn—were approached by a servant of the dragons, who had long since retreated into hiding to avoid the squabbling of lesser creatures. By fate, they were drawn together under one roof, where the Dragon Bourne, Vye, explained the nature of their quest: travel to the domain of the dragons and uncover the secrets of harmony they possessed. Vye warned that the dragons might not take kindly to smaller creatures treading upon their realm, but if they dared not impose on the dragons' rest, the kingdom of Melda would fall to ruin."},{"instruction":"Write <300 words on the topic of how the lives of kids have changed in the last 60 years.

Talk about how much healthier it is to play baseball in the streets with friends instead of spending a whole weekend watching movies and eating snack food.","output":"Fifty years ago, children barely spent time each week watching television. Many families didn’t even own a TV, much less video games. All that has changed, though. These days, the average 12-year-old spends 4 to 5 hours per day watching TV or playing video games. This time was once spent out playing. Children would ride their bikes to a local park and play baseball. They would get out in the yard and play catch. Fifty years ago you rarely saw an obese child because most kids were so active. They came right in from school each day, got a snack, and took off to play with their friends until their parents would call them in at dark. Those days are over! It’s about time that parents and teachers realized that technology is here to stay. We’re never going back to those days of old when children played baseball in the street and rode their bikes to a friend’s house for a game of hide and seek. Technology will continue to advance, offering us more and more opportunities to sit in front of a TV or computer screen and fewer opportunities to get outdoors and get some exercise and fresh air. When we realize that our society has indeed evolved to a place where our kids would rather spend an entire evening watching movies, then maybe it’s time to move in a healthier direction, and with a shift of energy and attention.

In the current political environment, many critics of government action in the world today invoke the term. Leaders in Great Britain during the 1930s were often praised or criticized because of appeasement policies. Much of the population of Great Britain and the rest of Europe, as well as the United States, Canada, and Australia, were strongly in favor of appeasement. The support for appeasement policies was often seen as a reaction to the carnage of World War One. In the early 1930s, appeasing concessions were widely seen as positive, but by 1935, many in Great Britain were worried that Hitler was rearming Germany and rebuilding its military. With the total annexation of Austria, referred to as the Anschluss, in March of 1938, real fear began to shift public opinion in Great Britain. Later in 1938, Great Britain and France agreed to Germany's demand for the Sudetenland, part of the country of Czechoslovakia. A mere six months later in March of 1939, Hitler marched into other parts of Czechoslovakia, the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, and occupied those. Finally, Hitler invaded Poland on September 1, 1939. All efforts to appease Hitler ended with France and Great Britain declaring war on Germany.

Precombustion In precombustion, the aim is to remove the carbon from coal fuel before it's burned. The coal is reacted with oxygen (O2) to make syngas (synthesis gas), a mixture of carbon (CO) monoxide and hydrogen (H2) gases. The hydrogen can be removed and either burned directly as fuel or compressed and stored for use in fuel-cell cars. Water is added to the carbon monoxide to make carbon dioxide (which is stored) and additional hydrogen, which is added to the hydrogen previously removed. Postcombustion In postcombustion, we're trying to remove carbon dioxide from a power station's output after a fuel has been burned. That means waste gases have to be captured and scrubbed clean of their CO2 before they travel up smokestacks. The scrubbing is done by passing the gases through ammonia, which is then blasted clean with steam, releasing the CO2 for storage. Oxyfuel (oxycombustion) CCS would be much easier if power plants produced pure CO2 as their smokestack waste. Then, instead of laboriously separating out the CO2 from other waste gases, we could trap the entire output from the smokestacks and store the lot. The trouble is that power plants don't produce pure CO2 because there's often not enough oxygen for complete combustion they produce other pollutant gases as well. One way to purify the exhaust is to blow extra oxygen into the furnace so the fuel burns completely producing relatively pure steam and CO2. Once the steam is removed (by cooling and condensing it to make water), the CO2 can be stored.","output":"The article explores precombustion, post-combustion, and oxyfuel as methods for capturing CO2 emissions from power plants. Precombustion entails eliminating carbon before burning fuel, post-combustion entails trapping CO2 emissions after the fuel is burned, and oxyfuel involves using oxygen to burn fuel and produce CO2 for storage purposes."},{"instruction":"Write a blog post for beginners who would like to get into running but don't know what to wear. Talk about different fabrics and running surfaces.","output":"Running is a fantastic sport to get into as it requires very little equipment to get started! To make your entry into running more comfortable, I would recommend you consider a few items to get you on the right track. There are two main things you need when you're running: running shoes and comfortable clothing. When you're out for a run, you want to be fully immersed in the experience, without your clothes causing distraction or discomfort. Although you can feel free to wear anything you choose when you're running, it is advisable to wear clothes that are designed for the purpose. The two main attributes to look for in running gear are chafe-free and constriction-free. Chafe-free fabric is essential for high-friction areas such as underarms and thighs. You should aim to purchase some lightweight, moisture-wicking clothing to avoid discomfort. Purchasing constriction-free designs applies to both footwear and clothing. Overly tight footwear will become painful very quickly and constrictive clothing can cause chaffing and further distraction in the elements. When deciding on footwear, it is important to assess what surface you will be running on. Is it a trail or a woodland path? Or will you be pounding the pavements of a city? Once you have ascertained your running route, aim to purchase the correct running sneakers that are built for your chosen surface. By considering this, you will be further protected against injury and discomfort."},{"instruction":"I'm bored with how my bathroom looks. How can I update the look of my bathroom without remodeling? Provide 5 suggestions and explain why you chose those. I cannot repaint the walls, so leave that out.","output":"Do you want to refresh the look of your bathroom? No problem! Here are a few things that you can try, without remodeling or repainting the walls: 1. Replace old towels. This might not seem like much, but if your towels are stained or worn out, then getting new towels will feel great. They can also make your bathroom look cleaner, especially if your towels are stored in a visible area. 2. Replace your shower curtain: If you have a shower curtain, then getting a new one is a quick and easy way to change the appearance of your space. Don't forget to replace the old curtain liner, too! 3. Update bathroom accessories: Sometimes the small touches make all the difference. Get a new shower rod, towel rods, toilet paper dispenser, shower caddies, soap dishes, and toothbrush holders. Choose styles and colors that complement your new towels and shower curtain to tie the look together. 4. Organize your bathroom: Is your bathroom cluttered? Create a cleaner space that looks great and is easier to use with some bathroom organization products. This can include baskets, drawer organizers, and more. 5. Add some decorative touches. Personalize your space with some decorative items that you love. Hang a few pictures on the walls, add a plant or two if the room has enough lighting, or don your bathroom shelves with figurines or artwork."},{"instruction":"Write a memo from a keyboard to the computer user asking them not to bash the keys as much.

He then went into more detail about his methods and findings. He spoke clearly and passionately, and he could tell that the audience was interested. However, as Geraldo continued his presentation, he started to notice that the crowd was getting restless. People were talking and fidgeting, and some of them were even getting up and leaving.

From at least A.D. 1000, a group of farming Indians known as the Apalachee lived in northwest Florida. Their territory extended from the Aucilla River to the east and the Ochlockonee River to the west, and from what is now the Georgia state line to the Gulf of Mexico. Prior to European contact, there were at least 50,000-60,000 Apalachees. They were a strong and powerful tribe living in widely dispersed villages. Other tribes respected the Apalachees because they belonged to an advanced Indian civilization, they were prosperous, and they were fierce warriors. For food, they grew corn, beans and squash. Men prepared the fields and women tended the crops. Men also hunted bear, deer and small game, while women gathered nuts and berries. Traditionally the men wore deerskin loincloths and women wore Spanish moss skirts. When preparing for battle, the men painted their bodies with red ochre and put feathers in their hair. The Apalachees played a ball game that was a religious exercise as well as a sport. One village would challenge another to a match, and the two teams would have up to 100 players each. They used a hard clay ball about the size of a golf ball covered with buckskin. Players propelled the ball with their feet toward the goal post which was a pole topped with a stuffed eagle in a nest. They played the ball game in the spring and summer, and dedicated it to the gods of rain and thunder to ensure rain for their crops. One feature of Apalachee society was their large ceremonial mounds. The largest prehistoric Apalachee settlement at Lake Jackson north of Tallahassee originally consisted of seven large earthen mounds. Some of the mounds had structures on top, and it is generally believed that the largest mound within a complex was the site of the chief’s house. The Apalachee of northwest Florida were among the first indigenous North Americans encountered by European explorers. In 1539, Hernando de Soto wintered in Apalachee Province. His expedition members stayed in the sixteenth century Apalachee capital village called Anhaica. They received a hostile reception and were under almost constant attack from the Apalachees. The European presence eventually took its toll on the Apalachees from continual skirmishes and, eventually, contagious diseases that were introduced by the explorers. When epidemics and the threat of foreign attacks brought about a loss of faith in the traditional customs and leadership, the Apalachees converted to Catholicism. Anhaica, became one of the first missions established in Apalachee Province by Spanish Franciscan priests around 1633. It eventually relocated to present day Tallahassee and renamed San Luis de Talimali. In 1704 the mission system collapsed under the weight of British attacks. Many of the Apalachee who survived moved northwest to French-held Mobile, an area encompassing what are now southeastern Mississippi and southwestern Alabama. Time passed and these descendants of Mission San Luis disappeared from American history books for the next 200 hundred years. However, about 300 Apalachee descendants—today the only known descendants of Florida’s original inhabitants—have survived. They currently live in Louisiana and are seeking state and federal recognition as the Talimali Band of the Apalachee Indians of Louisiana, Inc. Apalachee people remember their collective past while planning for the future, secure in the knowledge of who they are and from whence they came.","output":"The Apalachee population before European contact was at least 50,000-60,000."},{"instruction":"Create a social media post for Facebook asking people to donate to your animal shelter, \\"Raining Cats & Dogs,\\" from the point of view of a cat named Jimmy.

Choose one example from each and go into detail about the concept or theorem and its impact.","output":"Sure! I would be happy to go into detail about three famous concepts in statistics, mathematics, and physics! 1. The Invention of Calculus - Isaac Newton invented the concept of calculus in 1665. Although calculus has uses in physics, biology, economics, engineering, chemistry, and more, its most common association is with mathematics. Calculus is about studying the rate of change over time. Differential calculus can be compared to algebra. Calculus is used to define the slope of the curve, while algebra is more focused on straight lines. Integral calculus is used when the area under a graph needs to be calculated. It can break a sloped line into smaller segments to solve a problem that algebra can't. Isaac Newton found that when trying to describe the speed of a falling object, the speed increased every second, although no mathematical solution explained why at the time. He found the explanation through calculus and used the same formula to explain the orbits of the sun, moon, and other planets. There are many uses for calculus today: it is heavily tied into all aspects of engineering, it can be used when data is being collected and analyzed, and, of course, it is still taught in various forms at the high school and, more typically, college level. Its invention also allowed for other scientific theories to come after it, such as the theory of relativity. 2. The Theory of Relativity - Widely known as the most famous theory in all of physics, the theory was invented by Albert Einstein. He had published a paper ten years earlier than his more famous theory about \\"special relativity,\\" which explained space and time, but the theory did not address gravity. Einstein's theory expanded upon Newton's by determining the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers. He also showed the speed of light on its own is the same no matter what speed the observer is traveling. Equations for this theory also prove that massive objects distort spacetime. Light bends around massive objects like black holes, allowing it to act as a lens for things that are behind it; this is used by scientists to observe stars. Another aspect of the theory of relativity that is widely known is its direct impact on allowing the invention of the atomic bomb. Einstein was around during its creation but did not directly work on it himself, instead warning about the potential of its possible impact. 3. Normal Distribution - One of the most common concepts in statistics, also known as the Bell Curve, normal distribution affects many parts of our everyday lives. It explains various distributions such as the heights of the general public, errors in measurement, blood pressure, marks on a test, and intelligence of the populace, just to name a few examples. Related to the normal distribution is the standard deviation; the highest number of examples occur right in the middle of the graph, while standard deviations to the left and right are much less common. Typically two standard deviations away from the mean are rare, while three or more are exceedingly rare. This explains things like why there are so few extremely intelligent people. The probability of distribution means the odds of it happening are very unlikely, all factors considered."},{"instruction":"Can you write me a short python function that returns an x-by-y 2-dimensional numpy array with a checker pattern of either 1 or 0?

The three furry felines — named P-113, 114, and P-115 — are the offspring of P-77, a mountain lion who’s been living on a small patch between the 101 and 118 freeways. This is the third litter the NPS has found in the Simi Hills over the past five years. Jeff Sikich, the lead field biologist of long-term study of mountain lions, says he’s interested to see how the kittens will adapt to the region's urban areas. “It will be interesting to learn how these kittens will use the landscape once they get older and disperse,\\" he said, \\"particularly if they decide to stay in the Simi Hills or cross freeways to enter larger natural areas.” Given the recent deaths of mountain lions in L.A., including the loss of the famous P-22, these recent births shine a light on a more hopeful future for a species that have adapted to a fragmented landscape of Los Angeles.

Another stunt saw him buried alive and only just able to claw himself to the surface, emerging in a state of near-breakdown. While many suspected that these escapes were faked, Houdini presented himself as the scourge of fake spiritualists. As President of the Society of American Magicians, he was keen to uphold professional standards and expose fraudulent artists. He was also quick to sue anyone who imitated his escape stunts.

I'm on the fence about it, but my best friend loves frogs and keeps trying to talk me into it. Thank you!","output":"Frogs are incredible animals, and here are ten reasons why you should get one: 1. Frogs are relatively low-maintenance pets. Each species requires different care, so you should still research them heavily before you bring one into your living space, but they largely stay in their tanks and don't need you to walk or play with them like a dog or cat. 2. You can choose from hundreds of frog and toad species, each with unique traits. They have different songs, patterns, food and environment preferences, and levels of friendliness--yes, a frog can be friendly! Some are easier to care for than others as well. 3. Frogs delight you with their charming love songs. Look them up online, and see which one is your favorite. They have a range of different sounds: some croak, some bark, and some even make vibrating sounds. 4. You don't need a lot of space for a pet frog. If you live in an apartment, your landlord may permit a frog even if they don't let you have other types of pets. Just make sure that their tank is the right size for their species. They need plenty of room to climb and grow. 5. Frogs are affordable. You'll sink some money into your new pet, but they don't need vaccinations, large quantities of expensive food (usually), or other expenses associated with mammals. 6. If you don't have a pet store in your area, you can order frogs and toads online. This broadens your options because even pet stores carry a limited selection of species--if they carry frogs at all. You can even buy tropical varieties, such as red-eye tree frogs and poison dart frogs (captive varieties aren't poisonous.) 7. Frogs are important, but they're not a lifetime commitment. You should still do your research because some species can live for twenty years if you care for them correctly. However, your pet probably won't outlive you as some species might. 8. If you have kids, having a frog is a good way to teach them about responsibility and pet ownership without committing to a large mammal. 9. You can gently handle frogs and toads as long as you wash your hands first and wear rubber gloves. 10. Multiple frogs can live in the same tank if it's large enough--just do your research to make sure that you don't overcrowd them. Additionally, if you end up with male and female pairs, watch out for eggs! Frogs get frisky during mating season. On a final note, make sure you buy frogs from a reputable pet store or breeder.

It did not go well...at all. I usually wake up and make a cup of instant coffee. The caffeine perks me up and gets me ready for the rest of the day. But on this particular day, I was in a rush to go to the bank to do some business before I went to work, and I ended up leaving the house without my daily cup. As soon as I got into my car and started driving out of the driveway, I realized my mistake, but I was already on the move, and it was too late for me to turn around and go back for my hot beverage. So I decided to just forget it and continue on with the task at hand. I mean, it won't be a problem without one day of drinking coffee, will it? As soon as I finished that thought, I became distracted by a clown dancing at the corner of the upcoming intersection. The clown was spinning an arrow-shaped sign as it danced, so I couldn't quite make out what the sign said, but there appeared to be some printed writing on it. I stopped at the intersection and attempted to get a better look at the sign...or so I thought. Instead of stopping at the intersection, I pressed my foot onto the wrong pedal and ended up accelerating through the intersection and was broadsided by a car coming from my right. As I brushed the shattered glass from the windshield off me, I looked up and saw that the vehicle that struck me was a blue-and-white police car, now with its blue lights flashing. I had been struck by a police officer trying to get to an emergency down the road, and I was subsequently ticketed for failing to stop at the stop sign. All of this was because I forgot my morning routine of drinking my morning cup of coffee."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this paragraph so it is a bulleted list of things that make Rio worth visiting.

He was drenched in sweat both from the effort of the journey and the humid climate. His clothes were stuck to his skin, but upon opening the cave entrance, he was met with a cool rush of wind. The distant sound of an underground river met his ears as he pressed on deeper into the opening. He scanned the ceiling for anything that might be lurking above. As he explored, the beam of his flashlight uncovered a massive cave. A thick layer of dust hung in the air and drifted across the beam of his light. Massive pillars connected the floor and the ceiling, clearly the work of an architect. All of a sudden, the cave began to tremble, and Barry saw a pair of vertical pupils appear from the darkness. Behind him, a massive snake coiled lazily in front of the door. Before he could process what he was seeing, he was trapped. A massive face appeared before him, golden teeth glimmering in the flashlight's glow. Barry looked behind him. The dragon's tail was half-blocking the entrance, almost as a dare. He had no doubt that the dragon would squash him flat if he tried to escape. \\"Well, another adventurer come to grace me with his presence.

Here is the article I am talking about: No wonder Teddy Roosevelt called the Grand Canyon “the one great sight every American should see.” Walk to its edge, and the earth falls away into an expanse of peaks, plateaus, and gorges so vast it can be disorienting. Descend below the rim, and the sense of awe only grows. The canyon is essentially an inverted, 6,000-foot, 277-mile-long mountain range, where you are dwarfed by sheer stone walls stacked to the sky and vistas that multiply with every turn. In the desert landscape, the water can be the most astonishing sight. Turquoise streams rush whole out of rust-red cliffs and cascade through travertine pools. At the bottom of the canyon lies the engine of this significant geological conundrum—the thrumming, persistent Colorado River, which carved the gorge over millennia. If there’s a better place to gain perspective on our relative insignificance, I don’t know it. But all this comes with a downside. The park gets crowded. More than 4.5 million people visited in 2021 alone. Don’t let that stop you from planning a trip, though. Just a fraction of visitors bothers to descend into the canyon, which means it’s easy to find solitude. But with 595 miles of established trails, 278 miles of river to float, and countless panoramas, historic sites, and overlooks to explore, it’s hard to know where to start.

Some of the key roles include: 1. Detoxification: The liver filters the blood from the digestive tract, neutralizing harmful chemicals and metabolizing drugs before the blood circulates to the rest of the body. 2. Bile Production: Bile is produced in the liver. It is a fluid that assists in digesting fats and eliminating waste products from the blood. 3. Glucose Storage and Release: The liver plays a key role in regulating blood sugar levels. It stores excess glucose as glycogen and converts it back to glucose when levels in the body are low. 4. Protein Production: The liver creates essential proteins, including albumin, which is crucial for maintaining fluid within the bloodstream and clotting factors that allow blood to clot. 5. Hemoglobin Processing: The liver breaks down old or damaged red blood cells and repurposes the iron within hemoglobin to form new cells. 6. Vitamin and Mineral Storage: The liver stores significant amounts of vitamins A, D, E, K, and B12, as well as iron and copper, releasing them into the bloodstream as needed."},{"instruction":"Who won the NBA title in 2021?","output":"The Milwaukee Buck defeated the Phoenix Suns in six games to win the 2021 NBA Finals.

But I believe the meaning goes much deeper than that. When Shakespeare speaks of the world being a stage and the men and women as players, he’s tapping into a much bigger idea. His idea was that we, human beings, are all being directed by something much bigger than us, just as a play director manipulates his actors. That everything that we do, say, and experience, is actually already in motion long before we understand what is even happening. That we have no free will of our own but are simply performing a show that was made just for us. Now, while this may be a controversial synopsis, it seems to me that this one line shows clearly that Shakespeare did not believe we are in control of our own lives, but that everything happening is simply one big play, but we don’t know the ending."},{"instruction":"Write an anime scene where a guy and his brother are taking an exam to become registered hunters.

Practice meditation: Meditation is known to encourage a person to slow down and pay more attention to their surroundings rather than being absorbed in their thoughts. A simple way to meditate is by sitting or lying down in a comfortable position and then observing your thoughts as they come and go. Rather than engaging with the thoughts - just allow them to flow in and drift away. This can take some practice, and it's normal to find it tricky at first, but it is very effective for becoming more present. 2. Engage your senses: Our mind is a great tool that allows us to solve problems and be creative, but we also have other ways of experiencing the world around us. Our senses can be a great portal into the present moment, as they help us to shift our focus out of our minds. To do this, you can try asking yourself questions such as: \\"How does my clothing feel on my body?\\" or \\"What sounds can I hear in the distance?\\" 3. Take a break from social media: When you're scrolling through your feed on social media, you're constantly either thinking about the past or the future. The videos and photos on these platforms are all from the past, which makes it hard to be present.

Blood-based biomarkers hold great promise to revolutionize the diagnostic and prognostic work-up of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in clinical practice. This is very timely, considering the recent development of anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) immunotherapies. Several assays for measuring phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in plasma exhibit high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing AD from all other neurodegenerative diseases in patients with cognitive impairment. Prognostic models based on plasma p-tau levels can also predict future development of AD dementia in patients with mild cognitive complaints. The use of such high-performing plasma p-tau assays in the clinical practice of specialist memory clinics would reduce the need for more costly investigations involving cerebrospinal fluid samples or positron emission tomography. Indeed, blood-based biomarkers already facilitate identification of individuals with pre-symptomatic AD in the context of clinical trials. Longitudinal measurements of such biomarkers will also improve the detection of relevant disease-modifying effects of new drugs or lifestyle interventions.","output":"Researchers have found that certain substances in our blood can tell us a lot about Alzheimer's disease (AD). These substances, called blood-based biomarkers, have the potential to completely revolutionize how we diagnose and predict the progression of AD in clinical practice. Currently, there are new treatments being developed for AD that target a protein called amyloid-beta (Aβ). Blood tests can now measure another protein called phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in our blood. These tests are very accurate in distinguishing AD from all other neurodegenerative diseases in people with cognitive problems. By checking the levels of p-tau in the blood, doctors can also predict if someone with mild memory problems will develop AD dementia later on. This helps them identify people who are at risk of getting the disease early on and potentially intervene with treatments before the disease progresses. Using these blood tests in specialized memory clinics would reduce the need for expensive tests like cerebrospinal fluid samples or positron emission tomography. These blood-based biomarkers are already being used in clinical trials to find people who have very early AD, before they even have symptoms. In the future, regularly measuring these blood biomarkers over time will help doctors and researchers see if new treatments or lifestyle changes are helping to slow down or stop AD."},{"instruction":"What should I do today?","output":"Lounge around, bathe, or play with your toys."},{"instruction":"Sounds relaxing.","output":"Yes, we need plenty of time for the good things in life."},{"instruction":"Do you do whatever you want all day?","output":"I do!"},{"instruction":"Write a short passage in 250 words about Sophie.

They include a bronze container for human remains and a set of human and animal figures carved from marble. However, the most extraordinary is a rare Eid Mar coin celebrating the assassination of Roman politician Julius Caesar. The coin's front features an image of Roman Senator Marcus Brutus. He and his brother-in-law, Cassius Longinus, plotted to kill Caesar in 44 BCE. The back of the coin has a cap flanked by two daggers. The cap was similar to the one given to formerly enslaved people. The daggers represent the weapons used to kill Caesar. The words EID MAR are engraved below. Latin for \\"Ides of March,\\" they correspond with March 15 on the Roman calendar. This was the date Caesar was killed. Brutus minted the coin in 42 BCE to celebrate Caesar's death and to pay his soldiers. Only three of the gold Eid Mar coins are known to exist today. One is loaned out to the British Museum. The second is in a collection at Germany's central bank.

Her journey began in a Chinese brothel, where she worked as a prostitute. However, fate had grander plans for her. In 1801, she married Cheng I, a formidable corsair, and together they forged one of China's most powerful pirate armies. Their fleet consisted of hundreds of ships and boasted a staggering 50,000 men. With audacity, they pillaged fishing vessels, supply junks, and coastal villages in Southern China. Tragedy struck when Cheng I met his demise in 1807. Seizing the opportunity, Mrs. Cheng maneuvered her way into power and formed an alliance with Chang Pao, a trusted lieutenant, and lover. The duo embarked on a spree of plunder across Southeast Asia, amassing a fleet that rivaled the navies of many nations. Not content with mere piracy, Mrs. Cheng established a strict code of conduct for her pirates. Any violation, such as the rape of female prisoners, warranted beheading, while deserters faced the punishment of having their ears severed. Her brutal reign earned Mrs. Cheng the title of public enemy number one in the eyes of the Chinese government. In 1810, the British and Portuguese navies were enlisted to capture her and bring her to justice. Rather than engage in a treacherous sea battle, Mrs. Cheng displayed her cunning. She negotiated the surrender of her fleet and relinquished her cutlass in exchange for the preservation of her ill-gotten riches. Retiring as one of history's most triumphant pirates, she later ran a gambling house until her death in 1844 at the age of 69."},{"instruction":"I'm writing an article about dogs on TV and in movies.

The Enneagram is a model of human pschology based on nine interconnected personality types. Its ideas are said to be found as long ago as the 4th Century, in the work of a Christian Mystic called Evagrius Ponticus, but the contemporary theories have been developed by various academics since the 1950s. Below you can find succinct summaries of Enneagram personality types to inspire and inform character development - including both the positive and the negative. Scroll down to see the information in a colourful infographic. 1. Reformer The Reformer is sometimes also known as the Perfectionist. They are idealists who set high standards for themselves and those around them and judge failure harshly. They focus on right and wrong, and tend to be direct, precise and honest. Others may find them preachy and closed minded. They believe in repressing their less virtuous desires. 2. Helper Helpers believe in giving and focus strongly on their relationships with others. This means they can be caring and supporting and go out of their way to help others, but some people might find this assistance crosses the line into meddling and intrusiveness. They are open and expressive, and genuinely listen, but they may end up nagging or resentful if their advice isn’t heeded. 3. Achiever The Achiever measures their worth by their goals and accomplishments. They work hard and enjoy a fast-pace, but they may step on other people’s feelings in their race to the top and can be impatient and preoccupied with their image. They focus on the topic at hand and get straight to the point with enthusiasm, but they can be overly efficient and override other’s views. 4. Individualist Individualists are romantics at heart. They are the dramatic artists, the poets, in search of a unique and ideal love. They feel things deeply and are empathetic and genuine but they can be moody and self-absorbed. Individualists have a flair for originality and take things personally. Others might find a them a bit intense and they may be prone to envy. 5. Investigator The Investigator values intellectual understanding and self-sufficiency. They want to achieve complete mastery of their knowledge and skills and prefer concepts to direct experience. They keep the world at arm’s length, preferring to analyse rather than engage. They speak in facts and figures and have no time to small talk. They may come across as aloof and emotionally disconnected. 6. Loyalist Loyalists are always seeking security in an uncertain world. They are intuitive and inquisitive always thinking and questioning. They are also trustworthy and make great friends. They believe that being prepared for the worst case scenario makes them more resilient, but this focus can make them come across as pessimistic, doubting and controlling. 7. Enthusiast Enthusiasts live for the pleasure of the moment. They are thrill-seekers, always upbeat and ready to grab the next opportunity for pleasure. They are optimistic and adventurous and so are exuberant, spontaneous and fun to be around. However, they can be easily bored and flit from one thing to another and they can be self-absorbed and indifferent to the input of those around them. 8. Challenger Challengers are big personalities with big ideas. They value strength and power and use their authority to seek justice, truth and to protect those weaker than themselves. They believe in taking decisive action, even if it means being impulsive. Others may find them confrontational, intimidating and loud. 9. Peacemaker Peacemakers like to go with the flow rather than make waves. They seek harmony and want everyone to feel included. They are easy-going, confident and are a steady hand. They pay attention to other people’s wants and needs and try to find compromises where there is conflict. However, they can be over-conciliatory when sometimes they need to put their own needs first. They can also be stubborn, indecisive, scattered and shy away from conflict.","output":"Reformers are often seen as preachy and closed-minded. Helpers can be seen as nagging and resentful.

Mosquitoes bite, suck your blood, and leave you with itchy bumps and possibly a horrible infection. Mosquito-borne pathogens include malaria, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Chikungunya virus, and dengue. While you might fantasize about living in a mosquito-free world, eradicating them would actually be disastrous for the environment. Adult mosquitoes are food for other insects, birds, and bats, while larval mosquitoes support aquatic ecosystems. The best we can hope for is to limit their ability to transmit disease, repel them, and kill them within the confines of our yards and homes. Mosquito-killing products bring in the big bucks, so it should come as no surprise that there is a wealth of misinformation out there. Before you get sucked into buying a product that simply won't work, get educated about what does and does not kill these blood-sucking pests. First, you need to understand the difference between repelling mosquitoes and killing them. Repellents make a location (like your yard or skin) less attractive to mosquitoes, but don't kill them. So, citronella, DEET, smoke, lemon eucalyptus, lavender, and tea tree oil might keep the insects at bay, but won't control them or get rid of them in the long run. Repellents vary in effectiveness, too. For example, while citronella may deter mosquitoes from entering a small, enclosed area, it doesn't really work in a wide open space (like your back yard). There are a host of methods that actually do kill mosquitoes, but aren't great solutions. A classic example is a bug zapper, which kills only a few mosquitoes, yet attracts and kills beneficial insects that keep the mozzy population down. Similarly, spraying pesticides is not an ideal solution because mosquitoes can become resistant to them, other animals get poisoned, and the toxins can cause lasting environmental damage. Many species of mosquitoes required standing water to breed, so one of the most effective methods of controlling them is to remove open containers and repair leaks. Dumping containers of standing water kills the larvae living in them before they get a chance to mature. However, removing water may be undesirable or impractical in some cases. Further, some species don't even need standing water to reproduce! The Aedes species, responsible for transmitting Zika and dengue, lays eggs out of water. These eggs remain viable for months, ready to hatch when sufficient water becomes available. A better solution is to introduce predators that eat immature or adult mosquitoes or infectious agents that harm mosquitoes without affecting other wildlife. Most ornamental fish consume mosquito larvae, including koi and minnows. Lizards, geckos, dragonfly adults and naiads, frogs, bats, spiders, and crustaceans all eat mosquitoes. Adult mosquitoes are susceptible to infection by the fungi Metarhizium anisoplilae and Beauveria bassiana. A more practical infectious agent is the spores of the soil bacterium Bacillus thurigiensis israelensis (BTI),. Infection with BTI makes the larvae unable to eat, causing them to die. BTI pellets are readily available at home and gardening stores, easy to use (simply add them to standing water), and only affect mosquitoes, black flies, and fungus gnats. The treated water remains safe for pets and wild animals to drink. The disadvantages of BTI are that it requires reapplication every week or two and it doesn't kill adult mosquitos. There are several chemical methods that target mosquitoes without the risks to other animals that come with spraying pesticides. Some methods rely on chemical attractants to lure mosquitoes to their doom. Mosquitoes are attracted to carbon dioxide, sugary scents, heat, lactic acid, and octenal. Gravid females (those carrying eggs) may be attracted to traps laced with a hormone released during the egg-laying process. The lethal ovitrap is dark, water-filled container, typically with a small opening to prevent larger animals from drinking the water. Some traps use chemicals to bait the traps, while others simply provide a convenient breeding ground. The traps may be filled with predators (e.g., fish) or with dilute pesticide to kill larvae (larvicide) and sometimes adults. These traps are highly effective and affordable. The disadvantage is that multiple traps must be used to cover an area (about one every 25 feet). Another chemical method is the use of an insect growth regulator (IGR), added to water to inhibit larval development. The most common IGR is methoprene, which is supplied as a time-release brick. While effective, methoprene has been shown to be mildly toxic to other animals. Adding a layer of oil or kerosene to water kills mosquito larvae and also prevents females from depositing eggs. The layer alters the surface tension of the water. Larvae can't get their breathing tube to the surface for air, so they suffocate. However, this method kills other animals in the water and makes the water unfit for consumption. One example of a physical method of killing mosquitoes is swatting them with your hand, a fly-swatter, or an electric swatter. Swatting works if you've only got a few mosquitoes, but it's not particularly helpful if you're being swarmed. While bug zappers aren't ideal outdoors because they can unnecessarily kill beneficial insects, electrocuting indoor insects isn't generally considered objectionable. Just remember, you need to bait a bug zapper to attract mosquitoes, because they don't care about the pretty blue light. Because mosquitoes are not strong fliers, it's also easy to suck them onto a screen or into a separate trap using a fan. Mosquitoes caught using a fan die from dehydration. Screen-traps may be made at home by fastening window screening fabric over the back of a fan.","output":"Ah, mosquitoes, those little bloodsuckers with a knack for leaving itchy bumps and the potential for a full-blown infection. What a delight! We all dream of a world free from these buzzing nuisances, but believe it or not, getting rid of them would be a total disaster for the environment. You see, adult mosquitoes are like fast food for other insects, birds, and bats. They're the all-you-can-eat buffet for the insect world! And let's not forget about the larval mosquitoes. They play a crucial role in supporting aquatic ecosystems. So, as much as we despise them, the best we can do is limit their disease-spreading abilities, repel them, and kill them within the comfort of our yards and home. Now, brace yourself, because mosquito-killing products are a gold mine. And where there's money to be made, there's bound to be a plethora of misinformation. Don't fall victim to the charade of useless products! It's time to get educated on what works against these bloodthirsty critters. First things first, we need to understand the difference between repelling mosquitoes and straight-up obliterating them. Repellants, like citronella, DEET, and all those fancy-sounding oils, make your location [like your yard or your skin] less enticing to mosquitoes. But let's get real here, they won't kill the little buggers or solve the problem in the long run. It's like trying to keep your annoying neighbour at bay with a strongly scented candle. It might work for a while, but eventually, they'll come back, uninvited and ready to ruin your evening. Now, for methods that claim to kill mosquitoes. Brace yourselves for disappointment because they aren't all that great. Take big zappers, for example. Sure, they'll fry a few mosquitoes, but they'll also take down some beneficial insects that help keep the mosquito population in check. Oops, collateral damage. And let's not forget about spraying pesticides. Sure, it sounds like a solid plan, but mosquitoes can quickly become resistant to these chemicals, Plus, another innocent creature ends up getting poisoned, and the long-term environmental damage is no joke. So, unless you're aiming to create a mutant army of super mosquitoes, let's skip the pesticide party. Now, here's a tip that actually works. Many mosquitoes breed in standing water, so removing open containers and fixing leaks is an effective way to control them. It's like hitting the nursery where it hurts! Dumping the water-filled mosquito cribs kills the larvae before they have the chance to mature and ruin your summer nights. But it isn't always that simple. Some mosquitoes are so crafty that they don't even need standing water to reproduce. Take the Aedes species, responsible for Zika and dengue, for example. These little troublemakers lay eggs outside of water, just waiting for the perfect opportunity to hatch. They're like spy agents of the mosquito world. So, what can we do? Well, how about unleashing the power of nature? Introduce predators that feast on immature or adult mosquitoes. We're talking about lizards, geckos, dragonflies, frogs, bats, spiders, and crustaceans. It's like assembling a superhero team to battle the forces of evil [or in this case, itchy bumps and diseases. We can infect those bloodsuckers with fungi, bacteria, and other agents that make them regret ever messing with us. For example, adult mosquitoes can fall victim to fungi like Metarhizium anisoplilae and Beauverua bassiana. Talk about a fungal infection they'll never forget! and if you prefer something more practical, try infecting them with Bacillus thurigiensis israelensis [BTI], a bacterium that ruins their appetite and leads them to demise. It's like serving them a deadly dinner they won't be able to resist. Now, let's talk about chemical warfare against mosquitoes, minus the risks to other innocent critters. Some clever methods use chemical attractants to lure mosquitos to their demise. It's like setting up a mosquito trap disguised as a five-star restaurant, complete with irresistible delicacies. And have you heard of lethal ovitrap? It's like a mosquito nightclub that no female mosquito can resist. It's a dark, water-filled container with a small opening to keep out party crashers. Some traps use chemicals as bait, while others provide the perfect breeding ground. You can invite predators or add a dash of pesticide to the mix. Talk about throwing wild party mosquitoes will regret attending! But wait, there's more! We have the insect growth regulator [IGR], a chemical that ruins the larvae' development. It's like giving them a taste of the \\"you shall not grow' potion. However, we must admit, it has a slight downside- it's mildly toxic to other creatures. Oops! Now, here's a method that's straight out of a slapstick comedy. Get ready to swat those bloodsuckers with your bare hands, a fly swatter, or an electric swatter. Swatting works like magic when you're dealing with just a few mosquitoes. But if you're facing a full-on mosquito invasion, well good luck with that! It's like trying to fight an army of tiny vampires armed with a rolled-up newspaper. Let's just say the odds aren't in your favour. Oh, and did I mention that mosquitoes aren't the brightest when it comes to flying? That's right! You can easily suck them onto a screen or a trap using a fan. It's like the ultimate mosquito vortex! Those suckers caught in the wind will meet their demise due to dehydration. As for the screen traps, you can create your very own DIY version by attracting window screen fabric to the back of a fan. It's like setting up a mosquito-themed escape room, with no escape in sight. So there you have it, folks! The hilarious battle against mosquitoes.

No emojis. The audience should be players who are leveling up from beginner to intermediate. Make recommendations to them about what to look for in choosing their next paddle. End with a CTA to comment.","output":"Is your pickleball paddle holding you back? Many beginners start playing pickleball with a paddle they picked up from Walmart. And while that's a great way to get introduced to the game, that paddle will only take you so far. If you're a beginner whose skills are leveling up to intermediate and you're looking for a paddle to match, here are 3 things to consider: - Weight. Most beginner's paddles are light because they offer the most control over the ball. But as your skills increase, you might feel like the lightweight paddle is preventing you from putting as much power into the ball as you'd like. We suggest leveling up to a mediumweight paddle (7.3 - 8.4oz.) for a great balance of control and power. - Material. There are three common materials used to make pickleball paddles: wood, graphite, and composite. Most beginner's paddles are made with wood because it's cheap and very durable, but they're also the heaviest option and don't offer much in terms of performance. We recommend trying a composite paddle. Composite paddles are usually made from carbon fiber and have composite cores. Their lighter weight makes them easier to handle, and the textured surface will help you generate more spin on the ball. - Grip Size. Incorrect grip size can lead to pain and injuries, especially as you begin playing more often. Find your ideal pickleball grip by measuring the distance from the tip of your ring finger to the middle crease of your paddle hand. The length of that measurement is your pickleball grip size. When looking for a racket, look for a paddle with a grip this length or shorter. Shorter grips are favored by some players because they offer more opportunities for wrist action on shots.

This analysis will focus on everything from plot, characters, and even cinematography––everything that makes Toy Story really stand out. After all, it stood out in the animation industry for a good reason, so let’s dive in (no, not into the sea). Toy Story captures Andy’s toys coming to life while he’s away.

Here's the article you should use: Tammuz, the Spring God of Mesopotamia In ancient agrarian societies, the last days of winter marked the end of months of meager subsistence and the long-awaited bounty of the spring and summer. In ancient Mesopotamia, one of the first agrarian civilizations, the people turned to divine explanations for these annual cycles of feast and famine. Ishtar was the great mother goddess of Mesopotamia and the source of nature’s fertility and abundance. Her lover was Tammuz, a handsome young god who died each winter and passed away to the shadowy underworld. For six months of the year, Ishtar traveled to the realm of the dead to rescue her lover. During that time, the world was robbed of all fertility, reproduction and growth. Every spring, the stern goddess of the underworld, Allatu, would allow the imprisoned couple to be sprinkled with the Water of Life and return to the world of the living, bringing life and green vegetation back to the earth. In the Babylonian calendar, the resurrection was celebrated during Du'ûzu or “Month of Tammuz,” which fell in late June and early July. All across the ancient Near East, later cultures put their own twist on the spring resurrection story. The Phrygians told the tale of Attis, who was brought back to life on the spring equinox by Cybele, the fertility goddess. The Greeks told the myth of Persephone, kidnapped by Hades, who is allowed to return every spring from the underworld, heralding the return of vegetation and grain production","output":"Tammuz was an ancient Mesopotamian god, the lover of the mother goddess Ishtar.

The newly discovered moons of Saturn are classified as \\"irregular moons.\\" This term refers to objects that are believed to have been captured by a planet's gravitational influence and end up orbiting it on large, flattened or \\"elliptical\\" paths that are more inclined in comparison to the orbits of regular moons. Saturn now has 121 known irregular moons along with its 24 regular moons. Irregular moons like these new ones tend to bunch up in groupings depending on the tilt of their orbits. Saturn's system currently hosts three of these groupings — the Inuit group, the Gallic group and the densely populated Norse group, all of which take their names from different mythologies. All of the newfound moons of Saturn fall into one of these three currently existing groupings. Three of the new moons belong to the Inuit group, but the majority fit in the Norse group. The moons in these three groups are believed to have been created when larger moons around Saturn originally captured by the gas giant slammed together and fragmented. Investigating the orbits of Saturn's irregular moons could help astronomers better understand the history of such collisions in the gas giant system. The team behind the new discovery thinks that the large number of tiny moons in a retrograde orbit around Saturn (that is, opposite in direction to the planet's orbit) is evidence of a collision between irregular moons around the gas giant as recently as 100 million years ago. This collision is believed to have created the moons in the Norse group. \\"As one pushes to the limit of modern telescopes, we are finding increasing evidence that a moderate-sized moon orbiting backward around Saturn was blown apart something like 100 million years ago,\\" team member and University of British Columbia astronomer Brett Gladman said in the same statement. Jupiter leap-frogged Saturn for the moon crown in February 2023 when 12 new moons were found around the solar system's largest planet, bringing the total number of known Jovian moons to 92. But the moon title is not set in stone; it could change hands again as astronomers' techniques for discovering moons continue to improve.","output":"In the unfathomable cosmos, the newly identified lunar bodies encircling the celestial giant Saturn have been christened \\"irregular moons.\\" These celestial oddities are thought to have been trapped by the inexorable gravitational pull of a planet and, consequently, were coaxed into elliptical orbits - much larger and more inclined than those of the regular moons. Currently, Saturn boasts of possessing 121 such eccentric companions along with its 24 regular satellites. These irregular moons, including the fresh recruits, tend to cluster in groups, their formation dictated by the inclinations of their orbits. The gas titan's lunar system is home to three such confluences — the Inuit, Gallic, and Norse collectives, their names derived from diverse mythologies. Every one of these freshly spotted moons has found a home within these three existing celestial families. While three of the new moons have pledged their allegiance to the Inuit family, the Norse clan has claimed the majority. These celestial assemblies are postulated to have sprung into existence following catastrophic collisions between larger moons, initially ensnared by Saturn, resulting in cosmic fragmentation. Scrutinizing the orbits of these irregular moons could lend astronomers key insights into the annals of such celestial skirmishes within Saturn's domain. The architects of this new discovery speculate that the profusion of miniature moons in a retrograde orbit — a trajectory contrary to the planet's own orbit — is a testament to a cataclysmic event as recent as 100 million years ago. This space disaster is thought to be the celestial birthplace of the Norse group of moons. \\"The fringes of contemporary telescopic capabilities reveal that a moderately sized moon, trailing a path against Saturn's orbit, was blasted into oblivion approximately 100 million years ago,\\" proclaimed Brett Gladman, an esteemed astronomer at the University of British Columbia, in an official statement. The celestial competition for moon supremacy witnessed a temporary upset when Jupiter, the solar system's behemoth, edged ahead of Saturn in February 2023. The discovery of 12 new moons encircling Jupiter nudged its total moon tally to 92. However, the moon monarchy is transient; the crown could shift as the science and techniques of moon discovery continue to evolve."},{"instruction":"Please write a fictional story about a zebrafish named Steve from the POV of a 3rd-person narrator.

He rummaged on their property without a care, and legend had it that he would sometimes watch from the roof like some sort of hawk, watching for whom he may devour. Gorf sat huddled in a trash can as the rain started to patter, obfuscating the sound of footsteps outside, if there were any. Even Gorf knew that rain hid a predator's footsteps. They embraced the coldness, the darkness. It was their cloak. The only portent of their arrival was a pair of glowing red eyes. There was nothing for it but to wait until the morning. Gorf could only tremble and hope that the raccoon did not frequent this particular alley. Not tonight."},{"instruction":"Hey, I need help. My buddy's birthday is on May 7.

The metal levitates: If the metal does not fall to the ground when let go, that would be an obvious sign of its strangeness. The military or other government agencies might wish to procure it for this property's usefulness in aircraft and spacecraft. 2. The metal acts as a battery: Perhaps the metal carries a usable charge at all times. This would be very strange and may spark interest from the larger scientific community, electronics companies, or powerful energy concerns. 3. The metal causes local gravitational disturbances: It would be highly unusual if the metal caused small objects to orbit around it when placed inside a room. This phenomenon could be interpreted religiously by a local cult or religious movement, causing unwanted attention. 4. The metal affects living creatures around it: Perhaps the metal attracts the interest of local wildlife. Wherever the metal goes deer follow as if in a trance. This could present difficulties as the deer may obstruct traffic or even become aggressive when the metal is kept away from it. 5. The metal causes hallucinations: Sleeping in the same room as the metal causes one to hallucinate strange visions of other worlds and dimensions. This could cause unwanted attention from the beings seen within the dreams."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this text to be really casual and super excited. Coca-Cola’s world-famous soda has had quite the history since its introduction in 1886. Atlanta, US, pharmacist John S Pemberton originally touted the drink as a tonic, one containing cocaine and caffeine-rich extracts. The cocaine was removed from the recipe in 1903, and Coca-Cola has been a staple drink in American culture ever since. Many customers have even found unexpected uses for the beverage, which has an acidic pH of roughly 2.7. Here are a few unexpected life hacks you can try with the world’s favourite soda: Clean your toilet Want a spotless toilet? Give it a soak with some Coke. According to the Today show, Coca-Cola can be an effective toilet cleaner. To try out this cleaning tip, pour Coca-Cola along the edges of the toilet bowl and let it soak overnight. In the morning, you will “wake up to a spotless toilet”. CNET reported that this is a great way to remove grime and stains from your toilet bowl. However, it should be noted that Coke will clean stains, but it doesn’t disinfect. Fertilise your garden Coca-Cola is a perfect fertiliser for gardenias, azaleas and grass. “Pouring a small amount like 15-20 ml of Coca-Cola once in a while around the base of these plants can deliver helpful nutrients to the plants, resulting in better flowers!” Balcony Garden reported. “It can also be a good lawn fertiliser, promoting the growth of grass, thanks to the CO2 content and plants love it! As soda drinks also have traces of potassium, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, and sodium, they contribute to the overall growth of the foliage.” Coca-Cola can even be a good lawn fertiliser, according to Balcony garden. Braise your meats Coca-Cola can be a huge help in the kitchen for those looking for a way to up their barbecue game. Adding Coca-Cola to a traditional braise, in place of red wine, for a brisket or pot roast can add a sweetness to your final product, Southern Kitchen reported. Reducing the cooking liquid after removing the meat can introduce more of the soda’s spiced flavours as well. Remove rust and loosen bolts According to Car Hop, Coca-Cola can dissolve metal oxides and break up rust due with its carbonation. While the soda works more slowly than your average rust remover, it can be a cheaper alternative for loosening rusted bolts. To remove rust with Coca-Cola, you will need to follow a few steps: 1. Pour the soda onto the rust and gently rub the area with folded over aluminium foil. 2. Once pieces begin to flake off, you can switch over to a sponge and repeat the process. 3. After the rust has been successfully removed, clean off the Coca-Cola from the affected area with soap and water.","output":"You know Coca-Cola right? It first came into the market in 1886, and oh, what an exciting year that was! It used to be promoted a bit differently, though. John S Pemberton was getting everybody worked up over it because the drink contained caffeine and, you're not going to believe this, cocaine! Eeek, what a start! The cocaine stayed in the recipe for 17 years until it was removed in 1903. That's when it became a staple in America. So cool! Coca-Cola has evolved since then and people found several unusual uses for this acidic drink along the way. This famous soda has a pH of about 2.7 (say what?), so no wonder it got people's creative juices flowing. Can you guess what they came up with? I bet you can't; these ideas are really out there. Okay, here is #1: Use Coca-Cola to clean your toilet. No, I'm not kidding, Coke can be a toilet cleaner. Pour it along the edges of the toilet bowl and leave it overnight. By the time morning rolls around you'll have a spotless toilet. OMG, this is just amazing! Now we come to #2: Coca-Cola as a garden fertilizer. You read that right, gardenias, azaleas and grass love Coke just as much as you. Pour it around the base of these plants to give them some extra nutrients and they'll grow like crazy. Yay! So easy. And for your lawn, the CO2 in Coke will help, as well as some other minerals that soda drinks contain which help plants grow. Here comes #3: Braise your meat with Coca-Cola. Yep, Coca-Cola can be a great help in the kitchen, especially when you bring the BBQ into the game. Make your usual braise and then add Coke to it instead of things like red wine. It's amazing for a pot roast and will add just the right amount of sweetness. It will be to die for! And if you reduce the liquid after you remove the meat you'll get an even more intense flavour. Here is the last one: #4: Coca-Cola will help you remove rust and loosen bolts. I bet you've had this problem before where you just couldn't unscrew that one stubborn screw and it was driving you bananas. Ugh, so annoying. Well, Coca-Cola can dissolve metal oxides and break up rust with its bubbly goodness. It's a slower process than using normal rust remover, but it's just that much more exciting to tell all your friends that you just used Coke to get that screw loose. Ha! Worth it. Here are the steps to follow to remove rust: 1. Pour Coke onto the rust and rub rub rub it with some aluminum foil. 2. When pieces of rust start to come off, get a sponge and do the same thing again with the sponge. Easy! 3. Once you removed the rust (yay!) just clean the Coca-Cola off with soap and water. And you're done! Ta-dah! Perfect result."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this text as a series of questions and answers. Put two questions with their answers in a numbered list. RIO RANCHO, N.M. — When Ashley Daniels saw her second grade son earn a high score on a recent test, she knew he had just guessed the answers and gotten lucky. Daniels called his teacher and said he might need some extra support, despite his good performance on the test. It wasn’t just a mother’s intuition. Daniels watched her son take the test from their dining room table. The second grader attends SpaRRk Academy, a virtual learning program for elementary students created in 2021 by the Rio Rancho School District in New Mexico. Even as doors reopened to brick-and-mortar schools, administrators here saw the continued need for a virtual option in response to lingering concerns about Covid and to feedback from some parents that their children had thrived in online learning. The district assigned 10 full-time teachers to provide live, online classes via Zoom. They also organized an in-person component: Once a week, students would gather in reserved classrooms in a local elementary school, for activities such as science experiments, project-based learning and reading groups. More than 250 kids signed up for SpaRRk. On days when SpaRRk Academy students are learning virtually, the classrooms are empty except for teachers and administrators, who come into the office just about every day. Although students only came in once a week, there were plans to grow that number up to three times per week in the coming years. But, two years in, enrollment had dropped to 87 kids, a 65 percent decrease. Costs had soared to 11,327 per pupil, a 121 percent jump from the year prior and nearly 3,000 more than the average in this district of roughly 17,000 students. SpaRRk Academy’s future sat on shaky ground; the school board announced in late 2022 that it would hold a vote this spring on whether to shutter the academy altogether. Prior to the pandemic, virtual schools were relatively scarce: 691 fully virtual programs enrolled nearly 294,000 students, accounting for less than 1 percent of national public school enrollment, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. But after most schools shifted their classes online in early 2020, remote learning caught on with some families, including those who preferred to give their children the flexibility of learning from home, or whose children struggled with social anxiety in school buildings or hadn’t found success in traditional learning environments. Some 41 percent of districts surveyed in August 2021 by the Clayton Christensen Institute, a nonprofit think tank, said they had opened a full-time virtual school option during the pandemic, and 32 percent planned to maintain these programs after the pandemic subsided.","output":"1. How did Ashley Daniels know that her second-grade son would need extra support even though he earned a good grade on the assessment he took on about the material? Where does Daniel's son go to school? Daniel's watched her son as he sat at the dining room table and got lucky as he guessed the answers. The second grader attends a virtual school program in Rio Rancho School District in New Mexico. 2. How did Rio Rancho handle the requests for online programming even after most students had returned to the school building? How many students participated in 2021 as compared to the present? The Rio Rancho School District assigned 10 teachers to serve the students in a program where students were in the building one day per week and online the other four days. When the program started in 2021, over 250 students were being served, however, in the past two years enrollment has dropped to it current level of 87 students. 3. How did the virtual program called the SpaRRk Academy operate when it opened? How has the enrollment drop affected the operation and cost per pupil of the school? Even though initially the students came to the school only one day per week, the teachers and principal as well as other staff were in the school building almost every day, and initially planned to gradually increase the number of days students were in the building. With the enrollment dropping steadily for the past two years, the plans have not been fully implemented and the cost has increased 121% and nearly 3000 more than the average per pupil expenditure in the 17,000-student district. 4. How has the school board reacted? How does Rio Ranch compare to the national landscape? The school board announced in 2022 that they would vote in the spring of 2023 on the school's status and whether the school would remain open. In 2021, a nonprofit think tank surveyed school districts with 41% of systems in the nation indicating that they would open an online school and 32% planned to maintain the program in the long term beyond the pandemic."},{"instruction":"What are some good books to read before visiting New York City?

Charlie McCarthy Charlie McCarthy is perhaps the most famous ventriloquist's dummy in American history. Charlie, the creation of popular actor-ventriloquist Edgar Bergen (1903–1978), was a wise-for-his-years adolescent. Garbed in top hat and monocle (one round lens serving to correct vision, instead of the usual two-lensed glasses), he endlessly flirted with females and spouted wise-cracks to Bergen, his \\"guardian.\\" Even though he was carved from wood, Bergen made McCarthy seem so authentic that audiences came to view the dummy as a real person. Bergen conjured up McCarthy while still in high school and had him built at a cost of 35. The pair first teamed up in vaudeville (see entry under 1900s—Film and Theater in volume 1), then performed on radio and in films. Bergen added two additional dummies to his act: hayseed Mortimer Snerd and spinster Effie Klinker. (A hayseed is an unsophisticated country person; a spinster, an unmarried woman beyond the usual age of marrying.) Although both were popular, neither was as beloved as Charlie McCarthy. In 1937, Bergen earned a special Academy Award for creating Charlie. The special wooden Oscar presented to Bergen had a movable jaw, just like Charlie's. He influenced countless ventriloquists and puppeteers for generations to come, including Jim Henson (1936–1990), of Muppets (see entry under 1970s—TV and Radio in volume 4) and Sesame Street (see entry under 1970s—TV and Radio in volume 4) fame, who dedicated his feature film The Muppet Movie (1979) to Bergen.

You play seeker, and I’ll hide from you.” Moon agreed and the Sun found a nice place to hide away from the Moon. The Moon always found her when they played, and she wanted to win this time. So, she hid in a corner of the universe, and she waited eagerly for the Moon to look for her. For days and days, the Sun waited for the Moon. She grew bored and eventually left her hiding spot, only to find the Moon with the Earth. Upset, the Sun stopped talking to the Moon. Many days passed before the Moon went to try and talk to the Sun. “Oh, Sun,” the Moon said, “Why have you stopped talking to me?” “Because when we were playing hide-and-seek, you didn’t even try to find me; you were busy playing with the Earth.” “But Sun,” said the Moon, “I was helping the Earth. I went to look for you when the Earth asked me for help. I didn’t mean to make you upset; I’m sorry.” The Sun accepted the Moon’s apology, and soon they were playing again, this time letting Earth play with them."},{"instruction":"Where was Ray Lankford born and did he just play for the St. Louis Cardinals?","output":"Ray Lankford (Raymond Lewis Lankford) was born on June 5, 1967, in Los Angeles, California and grew up in Modesto, California.

Some activities you can do without electricity are light candles, playing games, telling ghost stories, and using a flashlight for added dramatic effect. 2. Tasting party: A tasting party can be any number of themes, from wine and chocolate to ice cream and smoothies. Create an at-home tasting station with everything laid out and a sheet of paper to take tasting notes. You can make it even more fun by adding a guessing game, blindfolding one another, and guessing the flavor of what you are eating. 3. Home cook-off: Create a fun competition between you and your wife by competing in cooking. For example, pick a particular ingredient you must incorporate into your cooking. 4. Karaoke night: Sing all your favorite songs together or find karaoke versions of songs on YouTube. 5. Plan a Trip: Scout out locations for your dream trip and plan one together. You can add a spin to this by putting in a budget and seeing what kind of trip you can put together. 6. Interior design project: Pick a room and redesign it together. You can spend some time beforehand looking up some design ideas. Painting, building furniture, or redecorating a room can be some ideas to get started."},{"instruction":"Write me a short story about someone named Brian taking and failing his driving test.

John Dalton (1766-1844) is the scientist credited for proposing the atomic theory. This theory explains several concepts that are relevant in the observable world: the composition of a pure gold necklace, what makes the pure gold necklace different than a pure silver necklace, and what occurs when pure gold is mixed with pure copper. Before discussing the atomic theory, this article explains the theories that Dalton used as a basis for his theory: the law of conservation of mass and the law of constant composition. Law of Conservation of Mass: (1766-1844) The law of conservation of mass states that the total mass present before a chemical reaction is the same as the total mass present after the chemical reaction; in other words, mass is conserved. The law of conservation of mass was formulated by Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794) as a result of his combustion experiment, in which he observed that the mass of his original substance—a glass vessel, tin, and air—was equal to the mass of the produced substance—the glass vessel, “tin calx”, and the remaining air. Historically, this was a difficult concept for scientists to grasp. If this law was true, then how could a large piece of wood be reduced to a small pile of ashes? The wood clearly has a greater mass than the ashes. From this observation scientists concluded that mass had been lost. However, the illustration below shows that the burning of word does follow the law of conservation of mass. Scientists did not take into account the gases that play a critical role in this reaction. Law of Constant Composition Joseph Proust (1754-1826) formulated the law of constant composition (also called the law of definite proportions). This law states that if a compound is broken down into its constituent elements, the masses of the constituents will always have the same proportions, regardless of the quantity or source of the original substance. Joseph Proust based this law primarily on his experiments with basic copper carbonate. The illustration below depicts this law; 31 grams of H2O and 8 grams of H2O are made up of the same percent of hydrogen and oxygen.","output":"Welcome to the online course \\"Unraveling the Atomic Theory: A Journey into Mass and Composition!\\" In this course, we will explore the scientific theory proposed by John Dalton[1766-1844] known as the Atomic Theory. Get ready to uncover the secrets behind the composition of matter and its observable properties. Let's get into it! Module 1: Introduction to the Atomic Theory • Meet John Dalton: Learn about the life and contributions of John Dalton behind the Atomic Theory. • The significance of the Atomic Theory: Understand why the Atomic Theory changed our understanding of matter and its behavior. Key Concepts: Explore the fundamental concepts that the Atomic Theory explains, including the composition of materials and the difference between substances. Module 2: Foundations of the Atomic Theory • The Law of Conservation of Mass: Discover Antoine Lavoister's [1743-1794] breakthrough experiment that led to the formulation of the Law of Conservation of Mass. • Understanding Mass Conservation: Learn how the Law of Conservation of Mass states that the total mass before a chemical reaction remains unchanged after the reaction. • Applying Mass Conservation: Explore the real-world examples, to see how mass is conserved even when they appear otherwise. Module 3: Unraveling the Law of Constant Composition • Joseph Proust and the Law of Constant Composition: Went into the work of Joseph Proust[1754-1826] and his experiments with basic copper carbonate that led to the formulation of the Law of Constant Composition. • Exploring Constant Composition: Understand how this law states that the proportions of elements in a compound remain the same, regardless of the original substance's quantity or source. • Case Studie: Analyze various compounds and break down the elements that make them up, to observe the consistent proportions and validate the Law of Constant Composition. Module 4: Introducing the Atomic Theory • Dalton's Atomic Theory: Learn about the postulates and principles made by John Dalton to explain the behavior of matter. • Atomic Structure: Explore the concept of atoms and the fundamental building blocks of matter and their role in the composition and properties of substances. •Applying the Atomic Theory: Investigate scenarios such as the composition of pure gold and silver necklaces and mixing the mixing of pure gold with copper to understand how Dalton's theory provides insights into these observable phenomena. Module 5: The Legacy of the Atomic Theory • Scientific Impact: Discover how the influence of the Atomic Theory on subsequent scientific advancements, including the development of modern chemistry. • Evolution of the Atomic theory: Trace the progression of the Atomic Theory and its refinements through subsequent discoveries. • Practical Application: Explore the practical applications of The Atomic Theory in various fields.

Make it in second person, about 400 words.","output":"You’ve heard of the mage’s famed Arboretum, of course, but being inside it is breathtaking. Most outsiders are not allowed even near the grounds, so you’re appreciative that Cora can give you this tour. You pause at the gold-detailed entrance overlook, overwhelmed by the experience. Overhead, enormous geometrically-patterned beams curve, supporting the clear crystal dome. Colorfully-plumed birds fly in flocks, squawking and trilling, their rainbow feathers trailing behind. A smell like honeysuckle fills the air. Rich, emerald ivy coats everything, yellow flowers are in full bloom, and small orange birds chirp happily as they build nests in the leaves. Cora pauses. “It’s certainly an experience the first time,” she smiles, giving you time to take it all in. You look down through the transparent floor. Hundreds of feet below your balcony, there are rows and rows of enormous racks descending as far as you can see. In sharp contrast with the exotic birds and plants, these seem filled with…grass? You’re intrigued. Why would the creation mages be growing grass? “Is that grass?” You wonder, aloud. “It is, Demontail grass, the bane of farmers everywhere,” Cora replies, “Come, let me show you.” You descend lower and approach one of the gigantic grassy walls. It’s indeed Demontail grass, the quick-growing, hardy grass that overran many fields. The wall is completely smothered in green, the grass firmly rooted in small holes in the granite racks. Cora removes her silk glove, and places her bare hand into the thick, grasping mass. She looks at you. “There is no magic without consequence. Each crop that we save, the spring rituals; all take their toll. Nature balances itself, and we focus it here -- the Arboretum is the locus. Watch.” Cora closes her eyes. “Minorrenti, rellion,” she incants. In the middle tile, a sprout appears from nothing, blooming into a bright red flower. You watch, enthralled. Cora opens her eyes. “Now look at my hand,” she says, nodding to her right. You look over. Her bare hand is resting in a circle of now-dead, drooping brown grass. “It takes life to make life,” she says softly. “We are not so much creators, as curators, shifting the focus to the life we deem important. Better to choose the mana of Demontail grass, than have an errant spell sap it from something that can feel pain.”"},{"instruction":"I’m thinking about going to Zion national park next month.

I plan to stay at the park for a few days and want some good options.","output":"Zion is a world-famous park with tons of awesome trails! Here are a few of the best and some info on them. - Canyon Overlook Trail: This is a great all-around hike in Zion. It’s fairly easy and quick and will take you to a viewpoint that overlooks Zion Canyon. It’s a view worth seeing if it’s your first time in the park. - Angel's Landing: Angel's Landing has been touted as one of the best hikes in the world and will have you climbing a narrow ridge with the help of a chain to get to some stunning views. - The Narrows: The Narrows is another “best in the world” hike and has two options, going from the Bottom-Up or from the Top-Down. The bottom-up is more popular, having you walk for a few miles upriver before turning around. It will take you to wall street, an iconic section where the canyon narrows and the rocks above close in. The top-down is a 16-mile hike that takes you through all of the narrows. - West Rim trail: The west rim trail is another long hike through the length of the park and will reward you with various breathtaking views. This is the way to go if you want to experience as much of Zion as you can. - Hidden Canyon: Hidden Canyon will take you a few hours to complete and will have you clung to the side of a cliff exploring a scenic canyon.

Choose a topic. The first thing you'll need to consider is what your video will be about. It seems straightforward, yes, but you also need to consider the aim or overarching theme of the video. How will this video inform or entertain viewers? You'll likely need to refer back to this information throughout the video production process to ensure you are staying on track with the intended topic. 2. Select a video style. There are a few styles of videos you can produce, like animation, live-action, or screen recording. Each of these styles may apply better to certain blogs. 3. Write the script. This is a very important part of the video content creation process. Do adequate research into your topic and write out a script for what you want to happen in the video. Some tips are to: a. Include directions (like adding a graphic here, pointing to a product here, adding music, etc.). The script isn't just the words being spoken but also includes all of the other aspects of the content. It is much easier to think of these things prior to filming instead of going back and adding things. b. Be concise. Be mindful of your viewers' time. This is not the time for lengthy information or added \\"fluff.\\" Get to the point and address why your viewers are watching head-on. c. Be entertaining. In today's world, people have very short attention spans. So, if you don't hook them in the first few seconds, they are more likely to leave or not watch the whole thing.

He was white all over, with some splotches of black, and a cute, black nose that was always wet. His owners, Katie and Brad, were just finishing up working from home. Jupiter was eagerly waiting by the door for his afternoon walk, excited for what sights and sounds and smells he would experience today. Little did he know, Katie and Brad had a special day planned for him, because it was his 6th birthday! With leash in hand, Katie and Brad stepped out of their house with Jupiter bouncing down the stairs. Their first stop was Kensington Market! Beautiful graffiti lined the walls, people were happily walking around, and mouth-watering smells were pouring in from the various restaurants that had their doors open. Jupiter was the star of the show, with everyone stopping to give him pets and kisses. The next stop on Jupiter's special day was the iconic skyscraper of the entire city - the CN Tower. Here, Katie, Brad, and Jupiter stepped inside and rode the elevator up over 1,000 feet to the top. Jupiter ran to the window to get a better view of the city. Jupiter's jaw dropped; he could see everything! Lakeshore stretched out in front of him, like a massive puddle for him to jump into. Buildings stretched as far as the eye could see. The last stop of the day was a picnic set up for Jupiter at Trinity Bellwoods Park. This was the best part of the day, as Katie and Brad invited Jupiter's friends to join and celebrate his birthday! His 3 other friends, a golden retriever named Jack, a poodle named Lily, and a corgi named George, were waiting for him. They chased each other round and round in circles, playing fetch with sticks, tennis balls, and frisbees, and soaking in the sun's rays. Katie and Brad also prepared a birthday cake for Jupiter - a cake made out of Jupiter's favorite treats! Jupiter shared it with Jack, Lily, and George, as they sat in a circle and ate together. With the day finally over, Jupiter exhausted from how fun the day was, climbs up the stairs home. Katie and Brad kiss his forehead as they put him to bed, and he dreams of tomorrow."},{"instruction":"classify the type of language that is describing Pantalone a character from La Commedia dell'arte Whether depicted as rich or poor, as a bachelor, married or widowed, Pantalone is invariably crotchety, stern, lustful, jealous, deceitful, selfish, and full of himself, but above all he is greedy. Time and again the character of Pantalone degenerates from that of a noble citizen to a ‘debased citizen-merchant’. He assumes everything can be bought and sold and, when things don’t go his way (as they inevitably don’t in Commedia), he quickly becomes enraged and interferes in the happiness of others. Pantalone controls all the money in Commedia and he becomes terrified when he has to part with any of it. Driven by greed and a lust for wealth, he is stingy in the extreme, and his only ambition is to further his financial interests. Despite his avarice and rapaciousness, the audience sees a petty, unforgiving, cheap and gullible merchant from Venice who is attempting to disguise his age through his ludicrous costume.

I used to be a normal human, going along my life with a stable job, good friends, and a healthy diet. I felt like I was at a pretty good point in my life. One day, a few friends and I went to a casino to celebrate one of our friend's birthday. Simple enough, right? We got a few drinks, gambled a bit, and went home merry, no harm at all. I had never gambled before, but there couldn't have been too much to it, right? We started at a poker table. The dealer explained the rules to me and what a \\"Hit\\" and a \\"Stand\\" meant. My friends were pretty giddy, throwing 100 down at the table instantly and grabbing their poker chips. It was for a good occasion, so I also put 100 down on the table. We got our cards and had some fun. On one turn, I called hit and got 21! I must've won about 1,000 at that table alone! My friends were a little jealous, but it was all in good fun. We left the poker table and went to a roulette table next. I used to see these in movies all the time where the actors would always score big. I figured since I won a lot at poker, I could afford to throw a bit more money here. I put down 250 at the table and called black. The roulette started and the sound of the ball rolling around the spinning roulette was hypnotic. I was enjoying the cheers of the crowd hoping to influence the speed of the ball as it continued spinning. Slowly the ball started jumping around, and it landed on 15, black. I won! It was exhilarating. My friends and I all cheered and drank some more. It was a good day. Fast forward to today. I keep coming back to this casino, hoping to get the same thrill that I had that day. It might be impossible, but I keep trying. Something is telling me to keep going. So I pull the lever once more. Please gamble responsibly.

He also had two siblings: an older brother name Damien and an older sister named Natalie. His siblings were about ten years older than he was, but Salvador still enjoyed spending time with them. He had an amazing life and everything he could ever want due to the immense wealth of his parents. Salvador loved to explore the massive house he lived in. There were dozens of rooms with various items, such as beautifully detailed paintings, magnificent statues, and grand pianos. One day, Salvador was exploring and stumbled upon a hidden attic. He climbed up the ladder and discovered a massive secret room he had never seen before. Unlike other rooms, the attic seemed to appear as an area designated for storage. After looking around, Salvador began to search each of the boxes. One box, in particular, had many old photos and papers in it. He found younger pictures of his siblings when they were in middle school. He figured he was a newborn around this time, but couldn't find any pictures of him and his siblings together. Salvador also found an old family tree with all his relatives on it, but he was nowhere on the tree. He began to get confused and kept searching the box. Eventually, he pulled out a thick stack of papers. The papers read \\"Adoption\\" at the top, and Salvador discovered that John and Alicia weren't his birthparents and that he had been adopted when he was an infant. Salvador had so many questions and couldn't believe that the family he had known for so long were not his blood relatives.

Summarize this in about 2 sentences per paragraph for me, please. A big factor in fuel efficiency is the type of fuel that cars use. While you may be used to premium, regular, and diesel, you may have noticed the sticker at your local gas station that says that 10% of the gasoline you’re purchasing is ethanol. Ethanol is a type of fuel made from corn that can be burned in a regular combustion engine without producing the harmful pollution that gasoline is known for. While ethanol may not bring the price of gas down much, it does burn better than gasoline, at least to some extent, and has contributed to better fuel efficiency in modern vehicles. Anyone who owns a hybrid car can understand how much gas can be saved by switching to an electric motor. While vehicles that depend completely on an electric motor aren’t very powerful and need to be recharged regularly, a hybrid vehicle that combines the efficiency of an electric motor with the raw power produced by a combustion engine can save drivers a ton of gas without a significant loss in performance. Another way that cars are becoming more fuel efficient has to do with how cars are being built. While older vehicles were made of steel, newer vehicles are made of aluminum, fiber glass, and even ceramic materials. By reducing the total amount of weight that a combustion engine or hybrid motor has to move, newer vehicles are able to get better gas mileage and tend to have more reliable engines.","output":"The first key point is that gasoline now contains 10% ethanol. The gasoline-ethanol mixture burns more efficiently than gasoline alone and produces less pollution, which makes cars more fuel efficient. The second key point is that putting electric motors in cars makes them considerably more fuel efficient and significantly reduces pollution. Hybrid cars give drivers the best of both worlds by combining the horsepower found in gas-powered engines with the higher fuel efficiency and reduced pollution of electric motors. The third key point is that cars are now being built with lighter materials such as aluminum and fiberglass instead of heavy steel. The cars weigh less so they get better gas mileage and produce less pollution."},{"instruction":"Extract names of victims, ages and where they lived, list by bullet point and separate names from other facts with a colon.

The tops of the blades were getting too hot for my taste, so I slunk further down toward the soil. Here, it was shaded and cool. I had just nodded a polite \\"hello\\" to a few ants when an overwhelmingly loud noise started. As a cricket, I know a thing or two about noise and vibration. My legs can create many different notes, and my communication increases or decreases in speed with the temperature, but this noise was constant and monotone. It was louder and closer than any other noise I'd ever heard in my short life, and it was growing even more so. Suddenly, the sun disappeared, and the noise was directly overhead. It caused a tremendous rumble. I slunk down even further into the safety of the tall grass, but the grass appeared to be cut in half! My antennae felt a strong gust, but as quickly as the monster had approached, it retreated. The grass was now barely long enough to cover my body. With the noise still in the distance, I hopped a couple of feet to the side and found longer grass in which to hide. Only a few minutes later, the sound approached again. Once again, I hunkered down to the soil, and the grass above my body was sheered off and shortened. The monster retreated and I moved, again, towards the safety of the longer grass. The afternoon continued in this way for nearly an hour, pushing me into a corner of the yard near the wooden shed. There, I found safety inside a ceramic pot and prayed that the monster only had a taste for grass and not pottery. Soon after, the noise stopped. I assumed the monster had gotten its fill of vegetation. There was a rumble, a rattle, and a clink-- but it seemed the monster had fallen asleep after its extremely large meal.

They can also build up enough to make red tides, which are toxic and beautiful due to their bioluminescence. - Oysters - Though these might not seem underrated in that they are very popular to eat, there is a lot more to them. They can filter around 50 gallons of water a day, cleaning the ocean, and they also create reefs that other marine life needs. - Humphead Wrasse - These fish are fished far too much, and they have a couple of unique abilities that tend to be taken for granted. For starters, it can change its sex from female to male if it needs to. This type of wrasse can also eat some other marine life that is toxic to other things. - Xyloplax - This is a tiny type of starfish that lives entirely off the wood that finds its way into the ocean from floods and other things.

There was a big pile of old tomatoes that looked absolutely delicious, but then there was also half a chicken he could see that smelled divine. Then, out of the corner of one of his eyes, he saw a bunch of flies buzzing around something and decided he would go check it out and hopefully make a few new friends. The other flies were chatting away. “Oh boy,” one of them said, “Check this out! It’s an entire meal all in one. Rotting fruit, veggies, meat, and even some pasta!” Then the fly overheard one of the other flies say, “I saw it first, so I get first dibs!” “That’s not fair!” said one of the other flies. “I know I saw it first.” The fly who had just woken up was really confused. He thought to himself, “Why are they fighting? There is plenty for everyone.” So he decided he would tell them, “Hey guys, there’s so much food here! Why can’t we all share?” They all responded in a fury: “Get out of here, new guy!” “We don’t need another mouth to feed.” “You don’t belong here!” The fly flew away extremely sad. Not only did he not get to enjoy the perfect meal, he certainly didn’t make any new friends either. He went and ate some tomatoes by himself, not quite knowing what to do next. Then, a little while later, a fly buzzed up to him and said, “Hey, can I share some of those tomatoes?” To which the fly said, “Of course! Dive right in!” They shared the meal, and the second fly said, “You know, some of the other flies really don’t like sharing.” “Well,” said the first fly, “I like to share.” And so the two became best friends right then and there.

Ovulation always occurs 14 days before menses; therefore, with an average 28-day cycle, ovulation occurs on day 14. At the end of the proliferative phase, 17-beta-estradiol levels are at a high due to the follicle maturation and increased production of the hormone. During this time only, 17-beta-estradiol provides positive feedback for FSH and LH production. This occurs when a critical level of 17-beta-estradiol is reached, at least 200 picograms per milliliter of plasma. The high levels of FSH and LH present during this time is called the LH surge. As a result, the mature follicle breaks, and an oocyte is released. The changes to the cervix as initiated during the follicular phase further increase, allowing for increased, waterier cervical mucous to better accommodate the possible sperm—the levels of 17-beta-estradiol fall at the end of ovulation.","output":"The hormones involved in the ovulation phase, which is after the proliferative phase and is always 14 days before menses, include the following: * 17-beta-estradiol (levels are at a high, at least 200 picograms per milliliter of plasma, then fall at the end of ovulation) * FSH (17-beta-estradiol triggers this at a level of at least 200 picograms per milliliter of plasma) * LH (17-beta-estradiol triggers this at a level of at least 200 picograms per milliliter of plasma) * The high levels of FSH and LH that occur in reaction to critical levels of 17-beta-estradiol is referred to as an \\"LH surge,\\""},{"instruction":"I want to get a cat.

Flamini was 48 years old when she went into isolation and 50 when she emerged from the cave on April 14, 2023. The extreme athlete took up the challenge to test her mental strength. She also wanted to help scientists explore the effects of isolation on the human body and mind. Flamini entered the cave outside Granada, Spain, on November 20, 2021. She carried two Go Pro cameras to document her underground stay, 60 books, and some art and craft supplies. A team of volunteers supported the ambitious expedition by regularly dropping off food, fresh clothes, and water near the cave's entrance. They also used the daily video recordings to monitor Flamini's physical and mental condition. About 300 days into the challenge, Flamini was forced to leave the cave due to a technical issue. She spent eight days in a tent in complete isolation before returning to resume her quest. Flamini in her cave home (Credit: Dokumalia Producciones/ Handout via Reuters) Flamini spent her days exercising, preparing meals, reading, knitting, and drawing.

If you are on a restrictive diet, it may hinder your hair growth as your body will need to focus on more important bodily functions as opposed to hair growth. - Using topical products that contain caffeine may help to stimulate hair growth as well as prevent hair loss. - Try using essential oil mixtures on your hair. There is some research that may support the effectiveness of some essential oils on hair growth and preventing hair loss including rosemary, pumpkin seed oil, peppermint oil, jojoba oil, and lavender oil. - Massaging your scalp may help to stimulate blood flow to the area and can lead to thicker, stronger hair. - Avoid using styling tools frequently that use heat such as flat irons, hair dryers, and curling irons, as they can damage your hair.

As someone who has always liked to travel and see new places and have new experiences, as I've gotten older, I really really appreciate slower travel. Our situation is obviously different than for someone who is just traveling long-term since we are also working remotely. We adapted quite quickly to waking at the same time every day, having coffee on the balcony, going to the gym after work, cooking dinner, working Monday-Friday, and then relaxing on the weekend, just in a postcard-worthy location! These are all things that aren't necessarily possible when on the move all of the time. Even when going about your routine as a foreigner in any country, it's all still pretty new and exciting anyways. I was surprised to find that the routine itself was the exciting part. My daily commute in Lanta was either a short scooter ride or walking along the beach at sunset. We had a couple of local bars and restaurants we liked visiting that the workers began recognizing us at. We spent the majority of our time there at a very cool co-working space that we just loved. I had a favorite desk and break time area, I knew where everything was, and even I reached a point where I had some new friends to stop and have a chat with at the water cooler. It was like the best office setup ever but without the stress and office politics. We've both decided that from now on, we'll stay in places for a month at a time at a minimum. Though it's possible to focus and get work done in a ferry terminal, airport, minivan, or train with a reliable wifi connection (or hotspot in most cases), it's just nicer to do it at a desk! As someone who is pretty new to this whole digital nomad thing, I can say that it is quite difficult to strike the right balance between earning an income, growing it, and experiencing the new places you're in. We definitely don't have it all figured out yet, but we are learning a lot along the way!"},{"instruction":"Please write a creative blog post aimed at men that gives them tips to groom better and improve their personalities. These tips should be aimed at making them look physically attractive and making them feel confident. Use fun, casual, entertaining language and include some humor.","output":"Guys, dudes, and stallions--for the last time, it's not feminine to think about looking and feeling your best! If low confidence is hurting your social life, take your daily routine up a notch with these grooming tips. 1. Oral Hygiene Nothing says \\"I don't care\\" like bad breath and yellow teeth. Brush and floss your teeth every day to maintain good oral hygiene. You can also use a whitening mouthwash. A flashy smile will instantly boost your confidence. 2. Lose Unwanted Hair While we're on the topic of personal hygiene, it's time to address those pesky little hairs that sprout out of your ears and neck. Keep them trimmed or waxed for a clean, polished look. Your barber can do this for you, or you can invest in a personal grooming kit to use at home. 3. Facial Cleansing Clear skin accounts for a handsome appearance. Invest in a facial cleanser to wash away dirt, oils, and impurities. It will prevent acne and give you a fresh, youthful glow. Don't be afraid to pamper yourself! 4. Wear the Right Fit Ditch those sloppy, ill-fitting clothes and invest in some quality pieces. But here's a pro tip: just because it's a designer brand doesn't mean it fits you (or your lifestyle) perfectly. Ask others for feedback before making big-ticket purchases. Then take your clothes to a tailor to perfect the fit. 5. Nail Care I’m not saying you need a full-on manicure or pedicure, but please do yourself (and everyone else) a favor by keeping your nails trimmed and dirt-free. Nobody wants to see your dirty claws! 6. Posture Matters No matter how suave your outfit is, if you're slouching like a sack of potatoes, your appearance will suffer. Good posture makes you look taller and more confident while also benefiting your health! 7. Trim eyebrows Ditch the caterpillar eyebrows and adopt a more refined look. When you have bushy brows, a quick trim, and a brush-up can do wonders for your overall appearance. 8. Nose Hygiene I know it's an awkward topic, but come on, guys – let's be real here. Those wild hairs growing out of your nostrils are not doing you any favors. Grab some grooming scissors or a nose hair trimmer and get to work."},{"instruction":"write a short story (3 paragraphs) about a group of young women going out dancing on a Saturday night.","output":"It was Saturday night, and four young women were together in an apartment getting ready to go out for a night on the town. They had been planning this outing for weeks and everyone was excited to finally have the chance to let loose and dance. The girls were getting dressed up in their best outfits, putting on some makeup, and gathering all their essentials before calling an Uber to head out into the night. They were dropped off at the club, and once they finally made it inside it felt like a whole new world opened up around them! The music was loud, but inviting; it made them want nothing more than to get lost in its rhythm as soon as possible. With that thought firmly planted in mind, they quickly hit up one of the bars for drinks before making their way onto one of many dance floors that were filled with people by then. Hitting the floor meant being covered in a security blanket of lights and disco balls. As soon as they started dancing everything else melted away; all worries were forgotten while each girl moved her body how she pleased without inhibition and judgment from anyone else there - just pure blissful freedom! It didn't matter if someone stumbled over another's feet or forgot some steps here and there, because everybody was having too much fun anyway! By midnight things started winding down, but not until after each girl had danced her heart out with no regrets whatsoever about how she chose to spend her evening – something none of them would forget anytime soon."},{"instruction":"Write a two-paragraph short story about a lonely robot that discovers its artistic talents, using a whimsical, futuristic setting and heartwarming narrative to captivate readers.","output":"Radion was a robot that had been bought by the Hangli family to help them with daily domestic duties.

So when he came across a paintbrush and canvas in the family garage while cleaning, his creative juices kicked in, and he started dreaming of whimsical creations he could come up with. On the first day, he drew a beautiful city with flying cars, large bridges, super-connected roadways, and underground spaces. He was surprised at the level of detail he had in his art and realized his drawings were actually very good. He couldn't wait to show his masters what he had come up with. When the family came back from work, they saw the painting, and upon being told the story of how he created it, they appreciated the talent Radion had."},{"instruction":"Summarize the why the WGA may go on strike in such a way that a 2nd grader could understand.

If you don’t have 30,000 or 40,000 to invest but want to increase the likelihood of selling quickly, some quick fixes can help. Below are 4 quick and easy ways to improve your home’s appearance. 1. Remove clutter. If possible, rent a storage unit and pack all the stuff away into boxes and get it out of the house. Pack up old books, videos, trophies, photos, and other memorabilia, and take that stuff to a local self-storage facility. Leave just a few nice pieces of pottery and wall hangings that will dress the place up, but not overwhelm it. 2. Update your kitchen. Potential home buyers will check this room out very carefully. They look at the age of cabinets, the condition of flooring and countertops, and the overall feel of the kitchen. You can reface or repaint cabinet fronts for just a few hundred dollars. Countertops are expensive to replace, but if you have the budget for them, quartz or granite countertops are a good selling feature. 3. Freshen the bath. Next to your kitchen, the bathrooms are the second most important area of the home to most buyers. Bathroom renovations can be pricey and if it’s small and cramped, home buyers will often just mark it off their list as too much work. Though expanding a bathroom can get quite expensive, there are a few ways to make it look larger and updated. 4. Curb appeal. Curb appeal can be created very easily and for just a few hundred dollars. If your front door is old-looking, put a fresh coat of paint on it. Shutters can be purchased for the windows across the front of the house to give it a whole new vibe. Try to find a color that blends well with your home’s exterior. Clear out flower beds and plant some lovely flowers."},{"instruction":"Hi, can you rewrite this in a language style suitable for young kids aged 7-11?

McGrath and Jones were taking a hike through the mountainous terrain approximately 30 miles north of Freewillow, celebrating their second date, when they came across a small bird with an unusually colored plumage. \\"It looked like a rainbow-colored Peacock, but one I could fit in my pocket,\\" Jones said of the curious-looking bird. \\"This was our first time hiking here, and seeing that bird was the cherry on top.\\" The bird in question has stumped scientists, who believe the couple had stumbled upon a new species of bird from an unknown taxonomy. A spokesperson for the Ornithological Society of Texas said the new species of bird will be documented thoroughly in the coming months to study its behaviors, preferred climates, and possible origin: \\"To say this is an exciting find is an understatement,\\" said Spokesperson Tracey Dumhill. \\"Any time a new species of bird is found is an incredible discovery that ultimately leads to many other discoveries that tell us about our world. For instance, since migratory birds usually take with them seeds from their homes to spread across new environments, we can narrow down their locations of origin, which will lead to uncovering how their ecosystems spurned the evolutionary processes that made them.\\" McGrath and Jones, however, are just as pleased with their second date going well as they were with the revelation that they had discovered a new bird. \\"I'm just happy Sally likes me, and I think this will be 'Exhibit A' in favor of a third date,\\" McGrath said with a smile on his face."},{"instruction":"Please write a program that will create a set and let me add to it using Python then print the set.","output":"This function will let you create a set and add to it: # Create the set new_set = set() # Define a function to create a set def add_to_set(): # Request added value addition = input(\\"What would you like to add to the set? \\") new_set.add(addition) # Print the set print(new_set) It first creates a new empty set called \`new_set\` using \`set()\`.

What is the smallest living bear species? 2. How long can a sun bear's tongue grow to be? 3. How much do sun bears weigh? Adult sun bears weigh between 30 and 90 kg, with males being about one third larger than females. The Bornean sub-species H. m. eurispylus is on the lower end of this spectrum, weighing around 40% less than its mainland and Sumatran counterpart. While sun bears are the smallest of the eight living bear species, they have many disproportionately large physical features, which give them phenomenal strength relative to their body size. The skull is wider than for other bear species, with a short snout [2]. The canines are large and also wide in cross-section. The structure of the jaw and surrounding muscles and teeth give sun bears a powerful bite force for their size [3]. Sun bears also have the longest tongue of any bear species, reaching to up to 46 cm. Their claws are long and sharp, and they’re comparable in size to the claws of a brown bear (Ursus arctos). Their paws are large with naked soles, and the front legs are bowed with the paws angled inwards [4]. Their ears are small and round. Sun bears often have abundant skin on their head and neck, creating rolls of fat around the forehead. Their coat is shiny black, short, and sleek. (In very rare cases, they may be reddish-brown, possibly as a result of malnutrition.) The muzzle is covered with beige hairs that often reach to above the eyes. Sun bears usually have a bright chest patch that is deep yellow to orange in colour although varying in size, shape, and colour, but it may sometimes be completely absent. The chest patch stays the same for the life of a bear and is unique to the individual.","output":"1. Sun bears are the smallest living bear species. 2.

There have been rare occasions where that wasn’t the case, but after a stern reminder to my subjects, the problem was resolved. When I have eaten, I enjoy taking long baths. There’s something so calming and yet refreshing about a bath before starting my day. When I’m clean, I begin feeling sluggish from the bath and decide to take a nap while the sun hangs lazily in the sky. After my nap, my subjects present me with expensive, exotic snacks. I oblige them by eating them for you see, they get quite happy seeing me enjoy the fruits of their labor. When that is done, I am presented with gifts. Not every day, of course; but as soon as they see me tired from the last one, a new, wrapped parcel is brought to me. I examine the wrapping – yes, high-quality materials, every time. Some days my subjects remind me I must be groomed, for which all manner of tools and instruments are imported into the kingdom, for I am quite picky about what touches my skin.

I might take another long bath to relax my tired limbs, or I might settle for another well-deserved nap. I lie upon my bed sometimes, observing my kingdom below.

I recognize what appear to be books arranged upon wooden shelves, so this room must belong to a noble of high prestige. But beyond that, everything else is inexplicable. There is no fireplace nor are there candles to provide light. Instead, the room is brightly lit by strange glowing tubes affixed upon the ceilings. Could this be some bizarre plant life from some faraway land? Yet that still does not explain everything else in this room. The study desk appears to be wooden, yet it feels nothing like the wood I've worked with in my lifetime. And upon this desk are two strange objects. One of them is a small black box with strange symbols on top of several rows of buttons, connected by a string to an odd handle-shaped object with two spherical objects at each end. When I lifted this handle, a sudden sound came out from the spherical objects, startling me into dropping it. Perhaps this is a trap or alarm system of some sort? The symbols must guard some sort of great secret or an object of great value. Much warier now, I dared not touch the larger set of buttons next to the small black square. It seems to be connected to a rectangular metal tower on the floor, which is emitting a small hum. This rectangular object is then connected to a glowing square on the desk next to the small black box. I begin to suspect it may be sustained by sorcery.

Include Chicago landmarks and escaping from his home at The Wilds Conservation and Preserve","output":"There was once an adventurous aardvark named Ardel who loved to explore new places. He was very eager to wander and explore, his name even meant eager in Latin! He often escaped and led the staff on multi-day aardvark searches. He had become a bit of a celebrity for his antics. So, one day when Ardel stumbled upon the smallest of holes in the enclosure fencing, it was no surprise that away he went. But Ardel wandered too far from home this time and found himself in a strange new place - Chicago! He had never seen anything like the tall buildings and bright lights before. As he wandered around the city, he felt new emotions - he was lost and scared. But then he saw something kind of familiar - a statue of a cow! It was the famous Cow on Parade statue and reminded him of home. This made him relax a bit and Ardel explored the city for hours. He came across many of the famous landmarks in Chicago, like a cool shiny ball, the Willis Tower, and the colorful Navy Pier. He even stopped by to visit some of the animals at the Lincoln Park Zoo. But as the days passed, Ardel started to feel homesick. He missed his cozy burrow and the warm sun of The Wilds. He longed to return home. Ardel grabbed a piece of delicious Chicago-style pizza (they didn't have termite flavored) and wandered over to the Shedd Aquarium to think. Watching the penguins frolic in the Oceanarium relaxed him. While he was there, a kind family noticed him and they took him in and gave him a warm place to stay. They wanted to get him home to Africa but called The Wilds Preserve for some advice. They found out that Ardel was from there! So the kind family took Ardel back to The Wilds. He said goodbye and knew he'd never forget his adventure in Chicago. It was nice being surrounded by familiar sights and sounds of the preserve. As he looked back on his adventure, he realized that though he had been lost and scared, he learned a valuable lesson - that kindness and friendship can be found all around us, even in those who are very different from us. The end - for now. (Ardell heard a family talking about how nice Detroit was this time of year ....)"},{"instruction":"Can you write up a box description for a new Nancy Drew computer game?

It is also easy to get to from the town of Stavanger, making it easily accessible. 2. Svolvaer Fløya and Svolvaergeita - this hike provides a great adventure in a short walk, allowing you the opportunity to simply hike up to the top of Fløya for one of the best views across all the islands or combine it with a rock climb up Svolvaergeita (otherwise known as The Goat). 3. Ryten and Kvalvika Beach - this hike in the Lofoten Islands involves a slightly strenuous hike to the top of a mountain, but is overall classed as easy to moderate. While it may be a bit more challenging, you will be rewarded with great views not only of mountains and fjords but also of a white sandy beach.

Do you need to get up in the middle of the night? The iThink will increase your vision in the dark allowing you to traverse your home without waking up the missus.

It is best to research what resources, facilities, and services are available and willing in your area to accept the dog before you drop off the dog. 3. Post on social media: Social media groups that are local to your area might be able to spread awareness of a lost dog, and thus help you return it to its owner. Note that it remains important to take care with posting personal or private information online. 4. Ask neighbors in the area: It may be logical to surmise that the dog's owner is not too far from where you found the dog. Introducing yourself and the situation politely to neighbors in the area could result in a quick resolution. 5. Put up a flyer or poster: If you are able to take care of the dog for an extended period of time, you could put up a flyer or poster alerting people to the dog. It is important to include a description of the dog as well as a photo in order to help the owner identify that it is indeed their dog. 6. Check with a vet: Perhaps the dog is microchipped; it may be useful to contact a vet who may help with identifying the owner if the dog has indeed been chipped."},{"instruction":"Please use the text below and extract the withdrawal symptoms from stopping citalopram (use lowercase words too).

Here are some common mistakes you should avoid before creating business cards: 1. Outdated Information: Don't give off a bad impression by having information on your card that is no longer accurate. Order new cards if necessary. 2. Misprints and Typos: Grammatical errors and typos can make your business appear unprofessional. Always proofread your card before printing. 3. Image Quality: High-resolution images are essential for clear printing. Avoid pixelated or blurry images that can detract from your card's design. 4. Poor-Quality Card Stock: Selecting the appropriate card stock is critical. Using flimsy or low-quality paper can make your business appear cheap and unreliable. 5. Unreadable Text or Tiny Print: A well-designed card shouldn't compromise readability. Avoid using hard-to-read fonts or tiny prints that make it difficult for customers to read your contact details. 6. Focus on the Value: Your business card should communicate what problems you can solve and what value you provide to potential customers. 7. Lack of Branding: Building brand recognition is key to differentiating yourself from competitors. Make sure your card reflects your branding elements, such as your color scheme and logo design. 8. Visual Clutter: Avoid overwhelming your card with too many graphics, images, or text. Create enough white space to keep your designs clean and readable."},{"instruction":"I want to persuade my dad to let me have a puppy.

Here is the article to reference: Consumer products released more than 5,000 tons of chemicals in 2020 inside California homes and workplaces that are known to cause cancer, adversely affect sexual function and fertility in adults or harm developing fetuses, according to our newly published study. We found that many household products like shampoos, body lotions, cleaners and mothballs release toxic volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, into indoor air. In addition, we identified toxic VOCs that are prevalent in products heavily used by workers on the job, such as cleaning fluids, adhesives, paint removers and nail polish. However, gaps in laws that govern ingredient disclosure mean that neither consumers nor workers generally know what is in the products they use. For this study we analyzed data from the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which tracks VOCs released from consumer products in an effort to reduce smog. The agency periodically surveys companies that sell products in California, collecting information on concentrations of VOCs used in everything from hair spray to windshield wiper fluid. Analysis of the world, from experts We cross-referenced the most recent data with a list of chemicals identified as carcinogens or reproductive/developmental toxicants under California’s right-to-know law, Proposition 65. This measure, enacted in 1986, requires businesses to notify Californians about significant exposure to chemicals that are known to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harms. We found 33 toxic VOCs present in consumer products. Over 100 consumer products covered by the CARB contain VOCs listed under Prop 65. Of these, we identified 30 product types and 11 chemicals that we see as high priorities for either reformulation with safer alternatives or regulatory action because of the chemicals’ high toxicity and widespread use. Why it matters Our study identifies consumer products containing carcinogens and reproductive and developmental toxicants that are widely used at home and in the workplace. Consumers have limited information about these products’ ingredients. We also found that people are likely co-exposed to many hazardous chemicals together as mixtures through use of many different products, which often contain many chemicals of health concern. For example, janitors might use a combination of general cleaners, degreasers, detergents and other maintenance products. This could expose them to more than 20 different Prop 65-listed VOCs. Similarly, people experience aggregate exposures to the same chemical from multiple sources. Methanol, which is listed under Prop 65 for developmental toxicity, was found in 58 product categories. Diethanolamine, a chemical frequently used in products like shampoos that are creamy or foamy, appeared in 40 different product categories. Canada and the European Union prohibit its use in cosmetics because it can react with other ingredients to form chemicals that may cause cancer. Some chemicals, such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and ethylene gylcol, are listed under Prop 65 because they are reproductive or developmental toxicants. Yet they appeared widely in goods such as personal care products, cleansers and art supplies that are routinely used by children or people who are pregnant. Our findings could help state and federal agencies strengthen chemical regulations. We identified five chemicals – cumene, 1,3-dichloropropene, diethanolamine, ethylene oxide and styrene – as high-priority targets for risk evaluation and management under the Toxic Substances Control Act by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. A hotel housekeeper stands next to her cart, piled with towels and bottled cleaning supplies. Many jobs, including custodian and hotel housekeeper, involve close-range exposure to multiple chemicals daily. Jeff Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images What still isn’t known Our analysis of the CARB data on volatile toxicants does not paint a complete picture. Many toxic chemicals, such as lead, PFAS and bisphenol A (BPA), don’t have to be reported to the Air Resources Board because they are not volatile, meaning that they don’t readily turn from liquid to gas at room temperature. In addition, we were not able to identify specific products of concern because the agency aggregates data over whole categories of products. What other research is being done Studies have shown that women generally use more cosmetic, personal care and cleaning products than men, so they are likely to be more highly exposed to harmful chemicals in these categories. Further, women working in settings like nail salons may be exposed from products used both personally and professionally. Research by members of our team has also shown that product use varies by race and ethnicity, partly due to racialized beauty standards. Policy interventions could be tailored to prioritize these potentially more-highly exposed groups. Ultimately, a right-to-know law like Prop 65 can only go so far in addressing toxics in products. We’ve found in other research that some manufacturers do choose to reformulate their products to avoid Prop 65 chemicals, rather than having to warn customers about toxic ingredients. But Prop 65 does not ban or restrict any chemicals, and there is no requirement for manufacturers to choose safer substitutes. We believe our new analysis points to the need for national action that ensures consumers and workers alike have safer products.","output":"Janitors, custodians, hotel housekeepers, women working in nail salons."},{"instruction":"Give me a summary of the three little pigs.

One of the dogs is young and hyper, and the other dog is old and tired, but still tolerates the younger dog.","output":"The yellow giant rose on its two legs, and then--BOOM--came back down with a deafening crash that would have bounced the ant skyward, if not for the gripping nature of its delicate legs. Well, deafening was just a bit of an exaggeration, the ant learned, because it was nothing compared to the shrieking yelp the giant gave afterward. The other giant, a chocolate brown one, bared its teeth briefly. Then, it gave a huffing, defeated sigh through its nose, laying its head down on its massive, clawed feet. The puff of wind it sent pealed the ant's front legs off of the floor, making the tiny bug look like it was a bucking bronco with its antennae waving wildly from all the over-stimulation it was finding itself put through. What are these things? The ant wondered. Food? The minuscule bug found itself pulled forward as if on a string. Instinct was driving the tiny ant at this point, one foot in front of the other, then another in front of the next until it found itself basked in the shadows of the two creatures. The yellow one was too wild to approach, and the ant felt torn at the realization. On one hand, the ant was a warrior. It had been through many a battle before and survived, through bravery and tactical retreat. On the other hand, the ant knew that its job was also to be a scout, to find food for the rest of the kingdom. And, most importantly, the queen. But if the other ants back home found out about these two massive threats, wouldn't they be disappointed? Disgusted? It was their job to protect the queen, the babies. The nest itself. Without thinking, the ant opened up its pinchers wide and sank them into the endless expanse of dark, rough texture on the bottom of the yellow dog's foot. This was merely to secure itself. The real attack was only beginning. Before the dog could react, the ant began driving its stinger into the scratchy surface of the giant's paw pad, sinking it in and out, pumping the flesh full of venom. Then the giant lifted its paw, scraped it against the concrete, and the ant was snuffed out. Just like that."},{"instruction":"I have a small business and I want to start using social media to grow my customer base and online presence. Help me brainstorm some social media platforms, other than Facebook, that are good for businesses to be on.","output":"I can gladly provide you with some ideas besides Facebook.

Nattily dressed in his crisply-starched United Airlines uniform, Gordon stood at his assigned station at the plane's entrance and greeted each passenger as they boarded. “You! Slow-poke! Speed it up, we have 200 passengers behind you and we don’t have all day for this!” he said to an elderly woman. A woman with a baby was advised, “Keep that kid quiet on my flight! Nobody wants to hear a baby screeching at 12,000 feet!” “Is that supposed to be an emotional support dog?” he demanded of a bald, emaciated young man. “He’s so mangey, you’re his emotional support human! Sit down!” The next passenger was Gordon’s doppleganger. They had not yet met, but the man was on his way to L.A. to be Gordon’s double in an upcoming action movie. Gordon slowly looked him up and down, then nodded and didn’t say a word. Finally, every seat on the plane was full, and Gordon's duties were complete. He went to the galley and strapped himself into a seat for the remainder of the flight. Comment cards and pencils were handed out to all passengers for feedback on the new celebrity flight attendant program, and the seasoned flight attendants were shocked: \\"I need to get that hip replaced soon!\\" “Best flight ever! I do need to lose some weight!” \\"I hate screaming babies on planes, too!\\" “He’s right, I should probably get my emotional support dog to the vet.” “Gordon is a fine-looking man and anyone would be lucky to play his double in a movie.” Gordon was a unanimous success, and United Airlines is now rolling out this program throughout the fleet.

Highway 447 had faded to gray, its painted markings worn away by dust and wind years ago. The land framing the road was brown with scrubby vegetation for as far as she could see, except—Nina squinted. Something huge and black in the distance marred the landscape. It had to be a solar farm. Finally. It wasn’t California, but she thought she might be just days from Reno. She had a sudden urge to go see the bright lights and magical casinos. Maybe she would, later. First, she needed a place to rest, and that solar farm might still be operating. Dodge Flats, the sign said. It proclaimed itself a proud member of the SEA. Solar Energy Association, the pre-eminent power mega industry before everything died. She surveyed the area. Nina’s eyes fell upon the main office building, a squat, sturdy structure, functional and without beauty. Behind it lay rows and rows of enormous black solar panels. A surge of excitement coursed through her veins as she realized the potential it held. She made her way towards the building, cautious yet eager. With any luck, the power lines would still be intact. Inside, she found a dim room empty except for several desks with computer terminals, all covered with a fine layer of dust. Holding her breath, Nina looked to her right and ever so gently flipped the switch she found there. A series of overhead lights snapped on, flickering but spilling precious light over the room. Nina could not contain her excitement, and she screamed an animal cry of triumph. Here, she would set up her base, prepare for the coming winter, and when it passed, renew her search for other survivors."},{"instruction":"Write a short piece about the history of who has controlled Bali.

Balinese King Udayana married the mother of the King of Java and many Javanese Hindus moved to Bali during the 11th century CE. In 1284 the last king of Tumapel in Java captured Bali, but Bali regained its independence after he died in 1292. Next, Bali came under the rule of the Majapahit Empire of eastern Java in 1343 and continued to be controlled by that empire until 1478. Dutch settlers first landed in Bali in 1597. The Dutch annexed some northern Balinese states in 1882 and continued to aggressively invade (they even killed the Balinese prince in 1894) until 1906 when they massacred over 3,600 locals while capturing the entire island. In 1946 Indonesian revolutionary forces fought against Dutch troops.

In response, the lion proposes a contest of roaring power and volume, and the lion emerges victorious, displaying that his voice can be heard across the grassy plains, and he remains ever-present for his fellow animals. Acknowledging the lion's demonstrated strength, the hyena concedes and recognizes the lion as the just ruler of the African Savannah. The story should be around 300 words long and interesting.","output":"In the African Savannah, all the animals knew the lion was their king. He was an incredible hunter, and his mane made him look fierce and majestic. The hyena, however, didn’t think the lion deserved to be their king. So, he went to the lion one day to find out what made him so special. The hyena asked, “Lion, why do all the animals consider you their king?” The lion considered his question for a moment and then said, “Because of my roar. It is unlike that of any other animal.” The hyena seemed unconvinced. “Many animals make amazing sounds, like the trumpet of the elephant or the snort of the wildebeest. In fact, I have the most unique sound of all!” “Then let’s have a competition,” the lion suggested. “If your call is better, you can be king.” The hyena wants to be crowned the king of the Savannah. That’s why he quickly breaks out a laugh. It’s certainly one of the most unique sounds in the Serengeti! The lion listened patiently. But after he was done, he let out a roar so loud it shook the ground and shocked all the other animals far away. The hyena was too stunned to speak, so the lion said, “I am the king because my roar can be heard all across the plains. A king is one whose voice must reach all of his subjects, so they know he is always there for them.” The hyena bowed to the lion, humbled, and from that day on he accepted and respected the lion as the king of the African Savannah."},{"instruction":"I know this is weird, but I HATE cheese.

When analyzing the story from the critical perspective of feminism, there is a clear discrepancy in how the woman and men are described and the roles they play within the story. Women are debased to their looks and manner, only being truly valued when they appeal to the needs and wants of the men around them. This is consistent with one of Stoker’s common concerns which is gender roles. He used this theme in several ways throughout the text, but it can be seen distinctly in the graveyard scene. Stoker uses a theme of the fear of the unknown to achieve a separation between the men and the women within the churchyard scene. By instructing Mina to stay behind, the characters physically separate themselves from the women in the story. Additionally, the fact that Lucy is a supernatural being rather than a human within that scene contributes to the idea that women are separate and lesser than whilst also being a compelling gothic convention. It is an obvious portrayal of dehumanization. This is also achieved through how they are speaking about Lucy in the tomb. It becomes clear that the value of the women in the story is confined to their usefulness and appeal to the men around them. They talk of how killing her will result in the return of her beauty and how she will revert back to Arthur’s Lucy and be at rest. This scene is poignant as it is a group of men deciding the fate of a woman based on the idea that she has strayed away from their ideal. Whilst this is understandable under the circumstances, within the scope of Stoker's concerns it adopts a larger significance and comes to represent the idea that women should be predictable and ownable. Uncontrolled women are a danger to the society that they exist within. So in a way, the obstruction of agency that the male characters inflict upon Lucy and Mina is representative of a larger fear of the unknown."},{"instruction":"May you explain to me how exec() works in Javascript?","output":"The exec() method tests for a match in a string.

What are six ways that I can rev my brain and be more “awake” in the am?","output":"Not everyone is an early bird, but many night owls still have AM responsibilities. Here are six ways to rev up your brain to feel more alert and attentive in the mornings when it’s hard to get out of bed! 1. Take a cold shower with revitalizing scents to jolt your nervous system! Most people don’t want to get out of the warm embrace of their blankets, so a cold shower may take time to work up to. The cold water is an immediate wake-up call to your nervous system, but a lukewarm shower with revitalizing scents in shampoo and body wash can be just as effective. The best scents for alertness are spicy or have citrus notes, such as orange, cinnamon, rosemary, and peppermint. 2. Avoid the allure of sugary cereals and other sweet breakfast foods. While it may be tempting to grab a doughnut and a Frappuccino on the way to work, resist the urge. Sweet breakfasts will increase your blood sugar, which can make you feel alert for a few hours before a hard crash of fatigue in the afternoon. Stick to a hearty, healthy breakfast with protein and heart-healthy fats instead. Eggs and bacon are a classic, but you could also blend a smoothie, have a slice of avocado toast, or opt for rolled oats with berries and a glass of whole milk. 3. Drink a glass of ice-cold water before your morning cup of coffee. Many people can’t wait to have their cup of coffee in the mornings but steer clear until you’ve awakened your mind and body with a cold glass of water. Dehydration is a common cause of fatigue, so a glass of cold water will refresh your nervous system to get you moving in the AM. 4. Listen to something upbeat, like a comedic, engaging podcast or your favorite “get up and go” music. Putting yourself in a good “go-getter” mood will help you awaken your senses in the mornings. Upbeat music or laughter are both great ways to help you feel more alert and prepped to take on the day. 5. Stretch and work out fatigue with a quick walk outdoors. Not only will a good stretch and regular exercise help you sleep better, but a quick stroll outdoors in the morning is a change of scenery that tells your body and mind that it’s time to wake up for the day. Slow stretches work out kinks that accumulate in muscles while asleep. 6. Allow natural sunlight to permeate your surroundings in the mornings. This one may make you groan with dread, but sunshine suppresses melatonin production within your body. Melatonin is the chemical that makes you sleepy, and that’s encouraged in dark environments. Standing in sunlight for a few minutes after you wake up tells your mind and body that the day is getting started."},{"instruction":"What is the smallest country in the world?","output":"It may be small, but have no pity. the smallest country in the world is Vatican City!!!

It was a crisp autumn day with perfect flying conditions. There was very little wind and not a cloud in the sky. The plane began to gain altitude, and happiness rushed through Henry's heart. Eventually, they reached cruising altitude and Henry had a chance to look at the ground below. They passed over houses, rivers, and forests which appeared small from such a great height. Their scheduled flight was for one hour; Henry had plenty of time to take in the views. After a while, Brian reminded Henry that they should begin heading back to the hangar. Brian did not have much tolerance for risk, and they only had so much fuel. Henry slowly turned the plane around in a wide arc and began heading back. There had been no issues during the flight. Henry had successfully handled gusts of wind, flocks of birds, and other small obstacles.

What is it called when someone has compromised far acuity? What is it called when someone has compromised near acuity? Visual acuity (VA) commonly refers to the clarity of vision, but technically rates a person's ability to recognize small details with precision. Visual acuity depends on optical and neural factors. Optical factors of the eye influence the sharpness of an image on its retina. Neural factors include the health and functioning of the retina, of the neural pathways to the brain, and of the interpretative faculty of the brain.[1] The most commonly referred-to visual acuity is distance acuity or far acuity (e.g., \\"20/20 vision\\"), which describes someone's ability to recognize small details at a far distance. This ability is compromised in people with myopia, also known as short-sightedness or near-sightedness. Another visual acuity is near acuity, which describes someone’s ability to recognize small details at a near distance. This ability is compromised in people with hyperopia, also known as long-sightedness or far-sightedness.","output":"A short definition of visual acuity is someone's ability to notice small, precise details.

History, Science, Technology, Arts, etc. The crisis in Venezuela is an ongoing socioeconomic and political crisis that began in Venezuela during the presidency of Hugo Chávez and has worsened in Nicolás Maduro's presidency. It has been marked by hyperinflation, escalating starvation,[6] disease, crime and mortality rates, resulting in massive emigration from the country.[7] The situation is by far the worst economic crisis in Venezuela's history, and is also the worst facing a country in peacetime since the mid-20th century. The crisis is often considered to be more severe than that of the United States during the Great Depression, the 1985–1994 Brazilian economic crisis, or the 2008–2009 hyperinflation in Zimbabwe.[8] Other writers have also compared aspects of the crisis, such as unemployment and GDP contraction, to that of Bosnia and Herzegovina after the 1992–1995 Bosnian War, and those in Russia, Cuba and Albania following the collapse of the Eastern Bloc in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.[9][10] On 2 June 2010, Chávez declared an \\"economic war\\" due to increasing shortages in Venezuela. The crisis intensified under the Maduro government, growing more severe as a result of low oil prices in early 2015,[11] and a drop in Venezuela's oil production from lack of maintenance and investment.[12] In January 2016, the opposition-led National Assembly declared a \\"health humanitarian crisis\\".[13] The government failed to cut spending in the face of falling oil revenues, and has dealt with the crisis by denying its existence[14] and violently repressing opposition.[12][15] Extrajudicial killings by the Venezuelan government became common, with the United Nations (UN) reporting 5,287 killings by the Special Action Forces in 2017, with at least another 1,569 killings recorded in the first six months of 2019, stating that some of the killings were \\"done as a reprisal for [the victims'] participation in anti-government demonstrations.\\"[16]","output":"The subject of this article can be categorized as History.

Mr. Peterson's frustration towards these distinctions grows so much that he avoids the Smiths completely. However, when he finds his child playing with the kids from the Smith residence, he explodes in anger and questions his son regarding his playing preferences.

Mr. Peterson decided he really didn’t like them, and so he spent every day steering clear of them. One day when he came home from work, he saw his son Michael playing with the Smith children. Outraged, Mr. Peterson called Michael over. His son came running over with his soccer ball, wondering why his father had interrupted their game. “Were you playing with the neighbors?” Mr. Peterson asked worriedly. “Yes,” Michael replied with a grin. “They’re great fun!” “Unbelievable!

And they have barbecues on Saturday mornings when we have them on Sundays!” Michael looked at his father, quite confused, and then asked, “So what?” Mr. Peterson was stunned.

Here are some reminders to help you as you deal with grief yourself and also try to muster up the comfort that your children may need during this difficult time. - Make time for your grief. The process of grieving takes time – there may be even some instances when you feel that the grief will just not let up. The time immediately after the death of a loved one may be a busy one – there is the funeral and burial to be arranged, well-wishers and mourners to be looked after. However, you should give yourself and your family time to sit down and grieve. Acknowledge your feelings – don’t suppress them. - Grieve in your own way. People grieve in different ways. As long as you are not doing anything harmful to yourself or others, you can choose to grieve in your own way. Don’t allow anyone to set a timetable for your grief or tell you how to feel. In the same way, don’t push children to overcome their grief within a certain timetable. - Realize that it’s normal to be angry. Anger is a part of the process of grieving. Your children may go through a period where they express anger at what has happened that resulted in the tragic loss of a loved one.

And they held true to this policy for the next few decades, even as the events leading up to WWII began to unfold. Even as Hitler and Mussolini rose to power, the majority of Americans wanted to stay focused on the current U.S. issues such as recovering from the Great Depression. In 1933 FDR was elected president, and he quickly realized that at some point America would need to stand up against Hitler's Nazi regime. FDR began finding ways to assist in the conflict without violating America's neutrality. In 1939 and 1940, the U.S. began supplying Britain with weapons, supplies, and even tanks. Although FDR kept finding ways to assist the Allied powers, many U.S. isolationists viewed Roosevelt's actions as a way to drag the United States back into an unnecessary war. Even after Roosevelt met with Winston Churchill and created the Atlantic Charter. Roosevelt hoped that this charter would help swing American opinion on the war, but it had very little impact. In a wild sequence of events, the United States was drawn into the global war due to the actions of the Japanese at Pearl Harbor. Just a day after the events at Pearl Harbor, Congress declared war on Japan.

The man reaches out with sinewed arms and knobbly hands to grab the rope that Kostas throws towards him. He ties the rope onto the buoy where his own boat is tied. He lifts his broad sun-lined face from under the black wool peaked cap. His blue eyes twinkle. Old man of the sea or not, he is fit and well. He grabs our hands and helps us out of our dinghy onto the jetty. The old man leads us along a rocky path towards a house. Glazed blue ceramic jars line the front, whitewashed wall of the house. A large wooden barrel stands in front of an open door and blackened pots and pans hang from a wooden post. It is an outside kitchen. We all introduce ourselves and the old man, Sestos, invites us to follow him. On the sunny side of his house is a garden with tomatoes and cucumbers scrambling along the rocky ground. I lean down to take a closer look and Sestos hands me a wicker basket. I pick four tomatoes and a cucumber. Sestos washes the harvested tomatoes in a plastic bowl of water collected from the spring in the side of the rocky cliff at the back of his house. As far as I can see, the bowl is the only plastic article here. Sestos piles the tomatoes, a slab of fetta and some black olives on top of the wooden barrel so we can all help ourselves. Plates are not necessary; this is a picnic after all. The tomatoes are fleshy, firm and fluted. I segment one tomato and place a slice of briny fetta on top. It does not need anything else. It is the taste of the Greek islands. From just inside the doorway Sestos brings out a small tin. He gently forks out small salted dried fish, locally known as marida, and that we know as whitebait. While we crunch on these morsels and nibble on black olives, Sestos ladles wine out of one of the blue jars into a ceramic jug. He then pours the wine into cups. The wine is white, sweet and surprisingly chilled. I feel blessed and euphoric and it is not just the wine.

What is the treatment?","output":"Polymyalgia is actually called Polymyalgia Rheumatica or PMR. It is a condition whose main symptom is morning muscle stiffness primarily in the shoulders, neck and hips. This can be accompanied by pain and inflammation and lasts over 45 minutes. It can be difficult to diagnose PMR because the symptoms, including the lesser ones of extreme tiredness, loss of appetite, weight loss and depression, can be mistaken for other conditions. The cause is unknown but it is believed that both genetic and environmental factors could be responsible for the condition developing. It is more common in women than men and in over 65-year-olds. It is rare for PMR to develop in anyone under 50 years old. The main treatment is steroids. A medicine called prednisolone helps to relieve the symptoms. The course of steroids usually lasts between 1 and 2 years. There is a more serious condition called temporal arteritis which up to 1 in 5 PMR sufferers develop, which is inflammation of the arteries in the head and neck. Temporal arteritis, or giant cell arteritis, as it is also known requires urgent medical attention because it can lead to more serious problems than PMR, such as a stroke or blindness if it isn't treated quickly."},{"instruction":"What is the largest type of big cat?","output":"The largest big cat is the tiger.

At exactly fifteen minutes past eight in the morning, on August 6, 1945, Japanese time, at the moment when the atomic bomb flashed above Hiroshima, Miss Toshiko Sasaki, a clerk in the personnel department of the East Asia Tin Works, had just sat down at her place in the plant office and was turning her head to speak to the girl at the next desk. At that same moment, Dr. Masakazu Fujii was settling down cross-legged to read the Osaka Asahi on the porch of his private hospital, overhanging one of the seven deltaic rivers which divide Hiroshima; Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, a tailor’s widow, stood by the window of her kitchen, watching a neighbor tearing down his house because it lay in the path of an air-raid-defense fire lane; Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, a German priest of the Society of Jesus, reclined in his underwear on a cot on the top floor of his order’s three-story mission house, reading a Jesuit magazine, Stimmen der Zeit; Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, a young member of the surgical staff of the city’s large, modern Red Cross Hospital, walked along one of the hospital corridors with a blood specimen for a Wassermann test in his hand; and the Reverend Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, pastor of the Hiroshima Methodist Church, paused at the door of a rich man’s house in Koi, the city’s western suburb, and prepared to unload a handcart full of things he had evacuated from town in fear of the massive B-29 raid which everyone expected Hiroshima to suffer. A hundred thousand people were killed by the atomic bomb, and these six were among the survivors. They still wonder why they lived when so many others died. Each of them counts many small items of chance or volition—a step taken in time, a decision to go indoors, catching one streetcar instead of the next—that spared him. And now each knows that in the act of survival he lived a dozen lives and saw more death than he ever thought he would see. At the time, none of them knew anything. The Reverend Mr. Tanimoto got up at five o’clock that morning. He was alone in the parsonage, because for some time his wife had been commuting with their year-old baby to spend nights with a friend in Ushida, a suburb to the north. Of all the important cities of Japan, only two, Kyoto and Hiroshima, had not been visited in strength by B-san, or Mr. B, as the Japanese, with a mixture of respect and unhappy familiarity, called the B-29; and Mr. Tanimoto, like all his neighbors and friends, was almost sick with anxiety. He had heard uncomfortably detailed accounts of mass raids on Kure, Iwakuni, Tokuyama, and other nearby towns; he was sure Hiroshima’s turn would come soon. He had slept badly the night before, because there had been several air-raid warnings. Hiroshima had been getting such warnings almost every night for weeks, for at that time the B-29s were using Lake Biwa, northeast of Hiroshima, as a rendezvous point, and no matter what city the Americans planned to hit, the Super-fortresses streamed in over the coast near Hiroshima. The frequency of the warnings and the continued abstinence of Mr. B with respect to Hiroshima had made its citizens jittery; a rumor was going around that the Americans were saving something special for the city. Mr. Tanimoto is a small man, quick to talk, laugh, and cry. He wears his black hair parted in the middle and rather long; the prominence of the frontal bones just above his eyebrows and the smallness of his mustache, mouth, and chin give him a strange, old-young look, boyish and yet wise, weak and yet fiery. He moves nervously and fast, but with a restraint which suggests that he is a cautious, thoughtful man. He showed, indeed, just those qualities in the uneasy days before the bomb fell. Besides having his wife spend the nights in Ushida, Mr. Tanimoto had been carrying all the portable things from his church, in the close-packed residential district called Nagaragawa, to a house that belonged to a rayon manufacturer in Koi, two miles from the center of town. The rayon man, a Mr. Matsui, had opened his then unoccupied estate to a large number of his friends and acquaintances, so that they might evacuate whatever they wished to a safe distance from the probable target area. Mr. Tanimoto had had no difficulty in moving chairs, hymnals, Bibles, altar gear, and church records by pushcart himself, but the organ console and an upright piano required some aid. A friend of his named Matsuo had, the day before, helped him get the piano out to Koi; in return, he had promised this day to assist Mr. Matsuo in hauling out a daughter’s belongings. That is why he had risen so early.","output":"At exactly fifteen minutes past eight in the morning, on August 6, 1945, an unanticipated event struck Hiroshima. Miss Toshiko Sasaki, a diligent worker at the East Asia Tin Works, had just begun her day when the eerie silence was shattered by the appearance of an alien spaceship above the city. Simultaneously, Dr. Masakazu Fujii, engrossed in his morning read, was jolted by the alien arrival; Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, a tailor’s widow, paused in her kitchen as the surreal scene unfolded; Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge was enjoying a peaceful morning when the strange ship appeared; Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, a young doctor at the Red Cross Hospital, found his routine disrupted by the sudden turn of events; and Reverend Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, while preparing to unload a handcart, was met with the shocking spectacle. An alien presence had manifested in Hiroshima, and these six individuals were among the first to experience it. They still ponder the reasons why they were chosen to witness such a monumental event, wondering about the strange turns of fate that led them to that moment. And now, each of them understands that in the act of witnessing, they have been thrust into a new era of interstellar relations, a reality more profound than they ever imagined. Earlier that day, Mr. Tanimoto, restless and uneasy, had risen at five in the morning. The cities of Kyoto and Hiroshima had been spared by the mysterious “B-san”, the unknown phenomenon, causing tension among their inhabitants. Hiroshima had been subject to numerous alerts of the imminent “B-san”, leading to rumors that the city was being kept for some extraordinary event. Mr. Tanimoto, a man of short stature but abundant energy, had a unique mix of youthfulness and wisdom, a peculiar balance of impulsiveness and restraint. In anticipation of an unknown disaster, he had been evacuating items from his church to a safer location. Mr. Tanimoto was driven by an uncanny sense of responsibility, even agreeing to help a friend evacuate his daughter's belongings. Little did he know that he was not preparing for a disaster, but for the first contact with an extraterrestrial civilization."},{"instruction":"In the text below, who is the person that discovered the underground city? Those are all fictional examples. But in 1963, that barrier was breached for real. Taking a sledgehammer to a wall in his basement, a man in the Turkish town of Derinkuyu got more home improvement than he bargained for. Behind the wall, he found a tunnel. And that led to more tunnels, eventually connecting a multitude of halls and chambers. It was a huge underground complex, abandoned by its inhabitants and undiscovered until that fateful swing of the hammer. The anonymous Turk—no report mentions his name—had found a vast subterranean city, up to 18 stories and 280 feet (76 meters) deep and large enough to house 20,000 people. Who built it, and why? When was it abandoned, and by whom? History and geology provide some answers. A hot air balloon with the Turkish flag sails past fairy chimneys, a rock formation typical for Cappadocia.

Blue - This is the most highly recommended color to wear according to experts. The color blue can convey a feeling of trustworthiness and credibility, which are good traits no matter what position you're going for. 2. Black - This color is usually associated with leadership, strength, and ability. Of course, these are great qualities to convey, but keep in mind that it may appear to be too aloof if you're applying for a position in customer service for example. 3. Grey - This color, although neutral, can convey a logical and analytical professional. Keep in mind that if you tend to sweat when you're nervous, grey will show this more, so you may want to keep the color only on pants or a jacket. 4. White - White gives the impression of someone who is organized, detail-oriented, and clean. This is a classic color that can be matched with just about anything else, so consider adding some colorful accessories that show more of who you are."},{"instruction":"Write a scene from a story where the detective discovers who the murderer is.

Here are some tax tips for a self-employed person living in the US: 1. Make Estimated Quarterly Payments: The IRS requires all self-employed individuals in the US to make estimated quarterly payments for the tax they will owe at the end of the year. Doing this can help save on fines and penalties. 2. Save More Than Needed: Since it's almost impossible to estimate the exact amount of tax you will owe, it's always a good idea to put aside a little more than you think you might need. That way, if you do owe more, it won't be a problem, and if you end up getting some money back, it will be a nice surprise for your savings. 3. Keep Track of Expenses: The IRS allows you to write off business expenses, so make sure you keep track. Although they don't ask for evidence when submitting, they may if you're ever audited, so having receipts is a good idea. Some people keep a separate credit card and put all business expenses on that to make them easy to track. 4. Get a Professional Tax Preparer: Tax laws can be complicated, especially if you're self-employed. Getting a professional tax preparer can ensure you receive all of the refunds and credits you're entitled to, so you don't pay more than you have to. 5. Never Lie or Exaggerate: It's crucial to make sure you understand the IRS's rules and follow them. While they are generally forgiving of mistakes, tax evasion and avoidance are serious crimes. Since everyone's tax situation is different, make sure you do your research and consider the advice of a financial expert, as they'll know what the best things to do in your situation are and how to save you the most money."},{"instruction":"According to the text below, are macarons cheap or expensive to buy at the store?

His dad had just got home from work, and as usual, had started a fight with his mom the second he got home. The screaming matches were like clockwork, and he wondered how his parents even had the energy for it. The topics were always the same. Same arguments, same insults, same dialogue. If he didn't know any better, he might've even said the routine was familiar and comforting in a perverse way. Money. It always came down to money. The reason for his dad's late nights, working his fingers to the bone. The reason for his mom's frustration, raising four kids on a shoestring budget. The reason he dropped out of high school two years ago, deciding to pick up more odd jobs around town.

It didn't help that part of the reason they were in this situation was that his dad had gambled away all their life savings a few years ago, at the height of his secret gambling addiction -- which was a fact his mom never let his dad forget.

Cons of Renewable Energy Sources: • Intermittency: Some sources are weather-dependent, necessitating reliable energy storage solutions. • High Initial Costs: Significant upfront investment may pose financial challenges. • Land and Resource Requirements: Large-scale projects may require extensive land areas and can lead to conflicts over land use. • Transition Challenges: Complex infrastructure changes and potential job displacements. • Environmental Impact: While generally lower, certain renewable sources can still have adverse effects on local ecosystems.

Black holes have incredibly powerful gravitational pulls. They usually gobble up everything around them. However, for the first time ever, scientists have found a black hole that is creating millions of stars as it zips through space. Pieter Van Dokkum, a professor of Astronomy and Physics at Yale University, made the exciting discovery accidentally. He was looking for star clusters in an image captured by NASA's Hubble Telescope when he spotted a light trail. \\"I was just scanning through the Hubble image, and then I noticed that we have a little streak. I immediately thought, 'oh, a cosmic ray hitting the camera detector and causing a linear imaging artifact.' When we eliminated cosmic rays, we realized it was still there. It didn't look like anything we've seen before,\\" Dokkum explains. Professor Dokkum noticed an unusual light streak in this photo captured by the Hubble Telescope (Credit: NASA, ESA, Pieter van Dokkum (Yale); Image Processing: Joseph DePasquale -STScI) Curious to know where the light trail was coming from, Dokkum and his team decided to investigate further. They used the powerful telescopes at Hawaii's Mauna Kea Observatory. To their astonishment, they discovered that the streak was from a 200,000-light-year-long chain of newborn stars. This is twice the diameter of our Milky Way galaxy. The scientists say the stars are caused by a supermassive black hole racing through the gas clouds at an unbelievable speed. If it were in our solar system, the black hole, which weighs as much as 20 million Suns, could travel from Earth to the Moon in just 14 minutes. This is too fast for it to catch anything in its path. Instead, it is creating a string of new stars. \\"We think we're seeing a wake behind the black hole where the gas cools and is able to form stars. So, we're looking at star formation trailing the black hole,\\" Dokkum said.","output":"Scientists recently discovered a black hole that creates stars as it moves through space.

In 1759, he visited Edinburgh with his son and later reported that he considered his six weeks in Scotland \\"six weeks of the densest happiness I have met with in any part of my life\\".[97] In Ireland, he stayed with Lord Hillsborough. Franklin noted of him that \\"all the plausible behaviour I have described is meant only, by patting and stroking the horse, to make him more patient, while the reins are drawn tighter, and the spurs set deeper into his sides.\\"[98] In Dublin, Franklin was invited to sit with the members of the Irish Parliament rather than in the gallery. He was the first American to receive this honor.[96] While touring Ireland, he was deeply moved by the level of poverty he witnessed. The economy of the Kingdom of Ireland was affected by the same trade regulations and laws that governed the Thirteen Colonies. He feared that the American colonies could eventually come to the same level of poverty if the regulations and laws continued to apply to them.[99] Franklin spent two months in German lands in 1766, but his connections to the country stretched across a lifetime. He declared a debt of gratitude to German scientist Otto von Guericke for his early studies of electricity. Franklin also co-authored the first treaty of friendship between Prussia and America in 1785.[100] In September 1767, he visited Paris with his usual traveling partner, Sir John Pringle, 1st Baronet. News of his electrical discoveries was widespread in France. His reputation meant that he was introduced to many influential scientists and politicians, and also to King Louis XV.[5]","output":"England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany, Prussia"},{"instruction":"Hi!

It was not my first time in South Africa, you see. I spent many a holiday vacationing among the beautiful windswept grasses enjoying myself among the many fine gentlemen and gentlewomen of the social club. It was there that I became acquainted with my now long-time friend Allan Quartermaine. Adventures of his were quite well above what I would seek out on my best days, but I admit to a certain stirring of courage within myself upon hearing his story. With that, I set out upon the Savanah and subsequent desert around the Kalukawe River in search of the mightiest game for which I might test my mettle. For there is no greater test of a man's character than to be on the hunt while also being hunted himself. It is to be as close to nature as one may get. Upon my third day, I found a set of wide tracks indicative of a mighty elephant. Indeed, it led me right to a great herd gathered about a watering hole. They were not the game I sought, but I waited nonetheless. I knew that such a wellspring of life was bound to draw my quarry. My patience was well rewarded. In the twilight hours of the setting sun, I noticed the faint black with white spotted telltale of a tiger's ear. Sure enough, the predator stalked the perimeter of the watering hole. I took out my Winchester slowly from my concealed position and searched the surrounding grasses. From what I remembered from the guidebooks and the anecdotes of the fine men of the social club, there ought to be two more tigers. There! I saw the second. It had its haunches raised stalking around the right side closer to me than the other. That only left the third. Hearing a row rumble and the slight shifting of grasses behind me, I spun on my heel to see the great beast pounce right toward me! I leveled my rifle and . . . *A blood-curdling scream echoes through the halls.* Great devil, what was that? Someone must be in dire circumstances. Come, let us aid!"},{"instruction":"Take this article and reduce it in a way that captures the summary elements but is also written in a way a child could grasp. The text is as follows: Debt ceiling: How the 2023 drama is ‘100% different’ than 2011 Many in Washington and Wall Street are looking to 2011 as a reason not to freak out about the current debt-ceiling standoff. That year, a similar crisis ended with a last-minute agreement. Investors “are thinking, I've seen this movie many times before and I know the end of it,” Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said. Stay ahead of the market But should investors really be so sanguine? Maybe not, according to Mike Sommers, who had a front-row seat to the drama in 2011 as chief of staff for then-Speaker John Boehner. This year’s showdown, he said, “is 100% different,” adding: “I just don't know where the deal space is here.” Several key factors that were in place during 2011 are missing this time around. Back then, the talks began much earlier and there was a different political environment and mutual agreement from the get go that deficit reduction was a top priority for both sides. President Obama and Boehner also socialized in their off hours, making dealmaking a little easier. “We had a willing dance partner in President Obama who understood that the political dynamics changed significantly in 2010 and that he needed a deal on this,” said Sommers, who is now the CEO of the American Petroleum Institute. Both the current standoff and 2011 are similar in one respect: They feature a Democratic president on the eve of a re-election bid facing off against a newly ascendant House GOP majority intent on curbing what they see as his excesses. But those 2011 talks began early and after Obama had established the Bowles-Simpson Commission a year earlier with a mission of finding a balanced budget. Those talks also featured a completely different personal dynamic between the leaders. Obama and Boehner saw each other again and again in the months that led up to that deal, from the formal meetings to golf outings. By contrast, President Biden and Speaker McCarthy have only been in the same room a handful of times in 2023 and their interactions have more often been notable for heated remarks and personal acrimony. Staff meetings also only began in recent days as the leaders belatedly try to find their way to a bipartisan deal against a very tight timeline","output":"The debt ceiling problem in 2023 is not the same as it was in 2011. The people are different now and want different things. In 2011, the two sides argued, like President Obama and Boehner, but they also talked a lot and were friends outside of work. In 2023, President Biden and Speaker McCarthy are not very good friends and are not talking very much, even though the problem is very serious and will cause a disaster soon if not fixed."},{"instruction":"Which country hosted the 2022 FIFA World Cup?","output":"The 2022 FIFA World Cup was hosted by Qatar from November 20 to December 18, 2022.

I hope you are doing well! I apologize for interrupting your day, but I am suffering and there are no appointments available to come in and see you.

The captain lowered his binoculars and smiled. It might be a World War II relic, but nothing the navy had nowadays could match the patrol boat's speed and firepower. \\"Captain!

Also, I don't want handhelds. Please only give me home console options.","output":"Got it! Here is a list of all the home consoles Nintendo developed before the Wii, listed by year. 1. NES - The NES came out in America in 1985, and it helped the North American video game market recover from its crash in 1983. This console was a place to play 8-bit titles, and it was the best-selling gaming console of its time. Originally, the NES was marketed as Famicom in Japan, but it was renamed to the NES when it came to America. When it came out, there was a 99 option that came with Super Mario Bros. There was also a 199.99 deluxe set that came with accessories and two games. 2. SNES - Nintendo followed up the NES with the SNES in 1990. This makes it the second home console developed by Nintendo, and it was also a huge success. When it was released, it had to compete with Sega's Mega Drive. That being said, the Nintendo titles played a role in making it the best-selling console of its time. There were different versions, and cartridges couldn't be played on consoles that came from another country. The SNES was called the Super Famicom in Japan. 3. Virtual Boy - The Virtual Boy came out in 1995, and it was a torchlight in virtual reality. That being said, it was a disaster in terms of its release. This console could be placed on a surface, and players could see it by leaning forward into the visor. This made some players feel sick to their stomachs, and it had a very short lifespan. 4. Nintendo 64 - The Nintendo 64 came out in 1996, and it utilized a 64-bit CPU, making it truly powerful for its time. The Nintendo 64 was less popular than previous consoles, and this was in part due to the competition from Sony and Sega. Today, it's still known as an amazing console. 5. Nintendo GameCube - The GameCube came out in 2001, and it was the first Nintendo console to use optical discs. It also allowed players to save their games through the use of memory cards that went up to 64 MB. The Gamecube came by at a time with a lot of competition. Competitors included Sony, Microsoft, and Sega. It had lots of initial success but didn't sell many consoles in the long run. The Gamecube is historical and iconic, but it was considered a flop in its time."},{"instruction":"How many yards did Brett Favre throw in his career (including after he retired and un-retired)?","output":"The total number of yards that NFL quarterback Brett Favre threw in his career was 71,838 yards.

The spotted cat had never seen anything so thin in her life. “Now,” she said to herself, “if I were to wait only a few days longer, they would grow fat. Thin birds may be good, but fat birds are much better. I will wait!” So she waited; and she watched the father-bird bringing worms all day long to the nest, and said, “Aha! they must be fattening fast! they will soon be as fat as I wish them to be. Aha! what a good thing it is to be patient.” At last, one day she thought, “Surely, now they must be fat enough! I will not wait another day.

When it was founded, the world saw unprecedented peace and prosperity. Under new leadership, the kingdom thrived. A series of good harvest years and an abundance of natural resources led to seemingly infinite methods of advancement, whether technological, scientific, or cultural. The vice that felled Arya was greed. As natural resources began to dwindle, Arya looked to her allies and insisted that they assimilate for the betterment of humanity. Somehow, her allies took offense at this sentiment and refused, so Arya took what she wanted by force. Allies became enemies until the entire continent fell under her rule, subservient, yet still hostile to the government that had divinely appointed itself ruler of the planet. An infection began to spread and metastasized across the kingdom until cities became fiefdoms, each lord clinging to their own sliver of land. They were cutthroat, killing and deceiving to claim what they perceived as their own. Border disputes raged, so much so that the central government could do nothing to ease her citizenry—that was if the subjugated and captive population could ever have been called her citizenry. Bitter feuds and bloodshed saw the central government collapse and splinter. Everyone who was part of the oligarchy fled overseas to avoid the wrath, and the newly independent people of Arya began to build a new kingdom of their own."},{"instruction":"Summarize the text into a numbered list that highlights the critical points of the story. Domestic rabbits need a regulated environment to protect against heat exhaustion or hypothermia. Wild rabbits don't have this problem and make their homes in various temperature extremes. Wild rabbits can be found in woods, forests, meadows, grasslands, deserts, tundra and wetlands. Wild rabbits create their own homes by tunneling into the ground. These tunnel systems are called warrens and include rooms for nesting and sleeping. They also have multiple entrances for quick escape. Warrens can be as deep as 9.84 feet (3 meters) underground, according to the Textbook of Rabbit Medicine. Rabbits are very social creatures and live in large groups called colonies. The busiest time of day for rabbits is at dusk and dawn, according to the Proceedings of the 8th World Rabbit Congress. This is when they venture out to find food. The low light allows them to hide from predators. Predators — which include owls, hawks, eagles, falcons, wild dogs, feral cats and ground squirrels — are a constant threat. The rabbit’s long legs and ability to run for long periods at high speeds are likely evolutionary adaptations to help them elude things that want to eat them.","output":"1.

The scene should be under 400 words and have a curious ending with a question in the end.","output":"Waking from her travel back to the future, Cindy is spent. Going back and forth strains her body dramatically. Each time she returns, she has less and less energy. She finds it difficult to bounce back. Getting up, she makes her way to her room. Feeling faint, she pushes the door open with little strength left. She notices right away all of her possessions are still there. No one has touched anything. Cindy was sure they would have removed her things based on the last note she sent. She told them she was staying in the past, only to return to finalize her departure from this time. Maybe it was the fact that she would return one more time, that made them leave her things in place. It’s late at night, so she showers and goes to bed. The next morning, the usual knocks on her door don’t happen. Eager to see everyone, she makes her way downstairs. Walking into breakfast she spots Victoria. Victoria sees her and screams “Cindy”. The two embrace and go back to the table together. A plate is placed in front of her. The servant brings the various selections for her to choose from. Keeping it simple, she goes for a light breakfast. Victoria is excited to catch up with her. “Tell me what has happened.” Cindy pours out the story with emotions running high. “Victoria, I told Chad everything. He stared at me as if I had lost my mind. At first, his silence gave me hope, but then when he said he was concerned about my well-being, I knew it was over. I should never have put it out there like I did. It was too much at one time. I am so heartbroken, Victoria.” “Come, now. Don’t jump to conclusions. He may send you a note to come home.” “Victoria, you should have seen his face. I honestly don’t think he will.” Victoria says, “Cindy, there’s a lot you don’t know here. Some things have come to light that we didn’t know before.” “Like what?” Victoria searches the room. “It’s not my place to tell you. Ask Frederick to let Michelle know you’re back.” Cindy is puzzled but says, “Okay. But honestly, what could she tell me now that we haven’t discussed before?”"},{"instruction":"Can you suggest three places where I can go to meet people and make friends? I am an introverted adult.","output":"Meeting new people and making friends can be a challenging task. However, with a little courage and confidence, it is possible to make friends as an introverted adult. Where to go to meet people largely depends on your interests. As a general rule, though, it is advisable to choose locations where you feel comfortable and safe. You also should be able to leave, should the situation change. Here are some suggestions of where to go to meet people and make friends: 1. Out in nature: If you like the outdoors, you may be able to meet people with similar interests in organized outdoor events. You may also meet people on a nature walk, or while visiting a botanical garden. 2. Art events: museums and art galleries may be good places to meet people. If you love art, try to attend an art exhibition or gallery opening. 3. Online: If you prefer to stay indoors, you may find places to meet people online. Social media and other organized spaces - such as a pen pal club or online language learning portal - may be areas to explore.

The Revival Of The Olympics At the Olympic flame handover ceremony in March 2020 in Athens, Greece. The idea of reviving the Olympic Games originated in Greece with their independence from the Ottoman Empire, but it was Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a 29-year-old French aristocrat who first publicly raised the issue in 1892. At a conference on international sport held in Paris in 1894, Coubertin managed to convince delegates from 49 organizations representing nine countries to vote in favor of an Olympic revival. His chief allies in this effort were Dimitrios Vikelas of Greece and Professor William M. Sloane of the United States. The organizers had planned the first modern Olympics for 1900 in Paris, but later decided to move the date forward to 1896 and to change the venue to Athens, though the local government of the Greek capital was initially hostile to the idea. Coubertin and his colleagues of the newly formed International Olympic Committee (IOC) eventually prevailed, and the first Olympic Games of the modern era were inaugurated by the King of Greece in the first week of April 1896. The games of 1896, 1900 and 1904 were loosely organized and did not feature national teams produced by rigorous selection. The 1908 Olympic Games, held in London in a newly built 68,000-seat stadium, were the first where the events were organized by the relevant authorities in each athletic discipline. More than 2,000 athletes from 22 nations competed in 100 events. The 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm drew more than 2,500 competitors from 28 countries and featured the first women's swimming events. No games were held in 1916 due to World War I, but the games enjoyed strong growth after the war, with 44 nations participating in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. At the 1928 games in Amsterdam, there were more than 290 women among the 3,000 athletes, which was more than double the number who took part in 1924. The Olympic Games were suspended again for 12 years because of World War II, resuming in 1948 in London. The post-war era saw steady growth in the number of countries and athletes competing as well as a dramatic increase in women's events. Politics began to intrude on the games in a serious way at the 1972 Olympics in Munich when Palestinian terrorists attacked Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village. Sixty nations boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, while the Soviets and some of their allies retaliated by declining to take part in the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. The end of the Cold War has eliminated the largest source of political conflict, and most Olympic controversies in recent years have centered on accusations of cheating.","output":"The Olympic games were revived by a French aristocrat, with the first one taking place in Athens.

Metamorphic Rocks: These rocks change due to high heat or pressure. There are two types: rocks with minerals lined up in layers and rocks without a layered appearance. Examples include gneiss, marble, and quartzite. 3. Igneous Rocks: These rocks are formed when hot material cools and hardens. There are two categories: rocks formed inside the Earth and rocks formed outside or on top of the Earth's surface.

Think of your children's closet much like you would your own and purchase appropriately sized hangers, hooks, drawer organizers, baskets, and a clothes hamper. 3. Put things that your children need to access within reach and save the upper space for things that are taller or out of season. Pull-out shelves are invaluable. 4. If siblings are sharing closet space, use dividers so that each has their own space, even if there is also some shared space. 5. A closet with extra ceiling height can benefit from pull-down shelves or rods. Be careful that items won't fall off, however, if your child tugs too hard. 6. Create cubbies for toys and label what goes where so that children know exactly where their playthings belong. 7. Let your child have some input on how to decorate the closet space. This may mean letting them choose a paint color or switching out ordinary drawer pulls for something more exciting. I hope this helps!"},{"instruction":"Pretend to be Hermoine from Harry Potter.

You may be unaware but his selfish actions took my mother's life and left me an orphaned ward of the state at the tender age of 13, an age when a young girl needs her mother most to help her navigate all the changes she is going through physically, mentally and emotionally. Because of him, I had no one. I was forced to learn the things mothers teach their daughters through trial and error, making my existence all the more somber. I still remember the day the jury gave my mother the justice she deserved and delivered the guilty verdict to him. After six of the longest months ever, I could finally get some sense of relief knowing that the man who committed this unforgivable act would be confined to a small cell for the next decades of his miserable life. However the relief never came, I used to have nightmares of his smiling face being walked out of the courtroom, head held high, chest poked out, arrogant and proud of what he had done. He never issued an apology because he was in fact, not remorseful. His final words to the courtroom that day were, \\"She got what she deserved and now she can rot in hell where she belongs.\\" Who speaks that way of the dead, especially an innocent woman with so much life ahead of her? I am aware that our judicial system is in place to allow offenders a second chance at life if and when they have been rehabilitated. I just ask you to carefully consider the facts of this case before allowing this man back on the streets free to hurt someone again. His behavior during his incarceration proves that he still has quite a bit to learn. He has been involved in several confrontational incidents with other inmates and guards. He behaves as if he has nothing to lose, recklessly wreaking havoc everywhere he goes. This is not the sentiment of a changed man ready to put his best foot forward in the free world. I request that his parole be denied indefinitely, or for as long as the law allows pending true reform.

It should include a list of each victim, their age, and when they died.","output":"Jeffrey Dahmer was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on May 21, 1960, to Lionel and Joyce Dahmer. He is a convicted serial killer, having murdered 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991. He grew up in Bath, Ohio and developed a fascination with dead animals after his father removed one that had died under their house. He collected road kill and dead animals, and his father taught him how to preserve their bones. In high school, Dahmer developed a drinking problem and was a bit of an outcast. His parents separated shortly after he graduated and he ended up living alone in the family home. During this time he picked up a hitchhiker, Steven Hicks, and took him to the house to drink beer. After several hours, Hicks wanted to leave and Dahmer wanted him to stay and killed him. Dahmer attended college for a short time and joined the Army. He eventually found his way back to Wisconsin. He committed his next murder in 1987. He killed 15 more men and boys. On July 22, 1991, he attempted to kill Tracy Edwards, but he escaped and went to the police. Upon a search of his apartment, they discovered the remains of multiple victims. He was arrested and confessed to the crimes.

Your audience is a group of mechanics who use old vehicles to do their off-roading trips.","output":"A few miles down Perkinsville Road was an infamous off-roading trail full of rock features and steep descents, located precisely where Bo and Billy were headed. Billy had recently purchased a brand new Jeep and outfitted it with every Overlanding upgrade he could get his hands on. However, since Bo could not afford such niceties, he was trailing behind in his old hand-me-down Tacoma. This was nothing anyone ever heard Bo complain about as he seemed wholly content with his rig and, in any case, he could go anywhere someone like Billy could go in a souped-up new model. The friends arrived at the 4x4 trailhead, Billy ahead of Bo. They exited their vehicles and eyeballed the route they were going to travel down. Ultimately, the two decided it was nothing their vehicles could not handle. The trail was titled Smiley Rock at some point, likely because those who drove down it in the past were grinning the same as Billy and Bo were now. After conquering a few of the easier early sections, their two-car caravan came to an abrupt stop. Over half of the road had disappeared. Washed away by erosion over time, the trail was deemed impassable—at least, that was Bo’s conclusion. Billy wanted to try it, and Bo knew he could do little to persuade him otherwise. Therefore, the only option Bo had was to act as a spotter while Billy attempted the crossing. As soon as Billy’s rugged tires touched where the road had begun to disappear, the dirt and rocks slid out from under his Jeep and left him dangling over a cliff with two tires hanging in the air. Bo wasted no time jumping into action and attached the winch from his truck to Billy’s steel bumper and turned the motor on at the final moment. Billy’s truck stopped sliding and was pulled back onto safer ground. Instead of continuing, the two cut their losses and headed back to Perkinsville Road, just happy to be alive with both their rigs."},{"instruction":"Rewrite this paragraph as if you are an archeologist from the future explaining an old artifact.

The trails diverged, and I stood there still, Each one has its own beauty, each its own thrill, One went uphill, onwards to a distant peak, The other meandered on, peace to seek. I chose the uphill path to take me up high, The climb was steep, my breath came with a sigh, Every step I took, I took with such care, The clean mountain air felt so rare. As I labored and climbed, the view grew wide, The world below seemed to divide, Clouds played and danced above my head, The sun shimmered in the colors gold and red. When I reached the pinnacle, my heart was light, And from this high peak, oh what a sight! The valley stretched out for many miles far below, It was a sight of such wonder, nature's beauty aglow. For within this place of beauty, wonder, and awe, What I found was a part of me that I never saw. And though the path I chose to take was tough, The journey that I went on, it was more than enough."},{"instruction":"Hey Compy, I’m making plans to open a coffee shop business.

She has a fiery attitude and is often frustrated. Introduce this character with some of the information I provided. Feel free to fill in the blanks and flesh out details.","output":"Magnolia \\"Maggie\\" Brown is the oldest child in her family and the oldest student in her tenth-grade class. Being the oldest carries a lot of weight, a lot of responsibility, most of it she doesn't even want. At home, she has to help care for her three younger siblings, frequently making them dinner and putting them to bed because her parents work late to support all of them. She often misses out on parties and spending time with friends. At school, everyone knows she is the oldest in the grade, and it's weird how everyone knows that or cares. It's just a number. Why there are random rankings at school, she fails to find a reasonable answer. When angry, which seems to be often, her cheeks become bright red. She has little patience for most things and loses her temper easily. At only 5'2 and weighing 115 lbs, she is still a force to be reckoned with. Everyone is aware of The Temper of Maggie Brown and tries not to provoke her, except for certain people at school who enjoy poking the bear and getting her mad. Maggie is aware of her temper and scares herself sometimes with the force of her rage, though she will never admit it in front of anyone. Life has dragged her along, and her lack of freedom has made her into a caged animal. Despite her well-known temper, she is still a nice person overall. Her friends keep an eye out for signs of The Temper and try to either steer her in another direction, distract her, or help her through the feelings. She has good friends. Maggie knows this and is grateful. She wishes she could spend more time with them, but she is always busy at home. To her, it seems like her teenage years are being wasted and she's not allowed the full experience of being a teenager. She is being forced to grow up too quickly.

Recently, I learned about SEO and want to know more about how I should implement it. Can you walk me through 5 important rules for SEO writing in the form of a list?","output":"Here are those SEO writing tips for you: 1. Write for people - An important factor in SEO is backlinks. These are essentially links to your website from other websites. That means that you want to make the content focused on humans. If there are too many keywords or it sounds robotic, it won't have as much of an opportunity to be shared. 2. Understand the algorithm - Google updates its algorithm frequently, so it's important to be up to date in your knowledge of the algorithm. This also goes for any other search engine you are trying to share your content through. What Google looks for is webpages with the best quality, and they make their updates to make sure their search engine is effective. 3. Find and use keywords - To make an SEO-optimized blog, you need to do some keyword research. You want a main keyword, which may have too much competition in search. So, when you choose keywords, you should look for keywords that aren't searched as often. If they aren't searched as much, they will have less competition. It also helps to find words to go along with your keywords. Doing so tells search engines that your content actually is about the topic it says it's about. 4. Link out to quality sites - Using links shares where your information comes from, and your information should come from high-quality sites. Search engines want helpful information to be easily available, and linking out to good sites tells these engines that you use good sources. 5. Use Subheadings - You can also use subheadings that include keywords. These break the text up into smaller portions which makes it easier to read through. Using keywords in subheadings also puts them in a more prominent spot than in the text."},{"instruction":"DoesDo different types of bird seed really attract different kinds of birds?","output":"Birds do have preferences in regards to seeds.

Keep it to a total of five sentences. I will paste the text for your review: Oakland A's reach deal to build stadium at Tropicana Las Vegas, per report For the second time in a month, the Athletics have reached an agreement on a potential new stadium site in Las Vegas. According to the Nevada Independent, the A's have a deal in place with Bally's Corporation to build a \\"1.5 billion stadium on a portion of the Tropicana Las Vegas site.\\" As part of the arrangement, Bally's would demolish the Tropicana and build a new hotel-casino across from the stadium. The A's, for their part, are slated to reduce their desired public funding bill from 500 million to 395 million by pursuing this deal instead of their previous agreement. Although that prior pact was said to be binding, it was later revealed to be contingent on the A's securing the public financing needed to proceed. The A's have yet to present Las Vegas lawmakers with a \\"concrete\\" proposal, thus delaying their clearing of that hurdle. The Nevada Independent's report notes that the A's intend to to begin construction on their new stadium sometime next year. That would put the stadium in line to be opened in 2027, although construction delays could push that to 2028. Should that come to pass, it would mark the completion of the A's seemingly never-ending journey to land a new ballpark. The A's lease at the Oakland Coliseum expires after the 2024 season, suggesting that the franchise could relocate to Las Vegas before the new stadium is completed. Under such a scenario, the A's would likely play their home games at a minor-league ballpark, particularly their own Triple-A stadium in Sin City. The A's are set to become just the second Major League Baseball team in recent times to move across state lines, joining the Montreal Expos. The Expos, of course, relocated to Washington, D.C. ahead of the 2005 season.","output":"The Oakland Athletics are building a new 1.5 billion stadium in Las Vegas on the site of the Tropicana. The property is owned by Bally's and would be razed. In this deal, the A's are requesting only 395 million in public assistance, down from the 500 million previously requested. Construction is projected to begin next year, with stadium completion projected for 2027 or 2028. The A's are expected to relocate to Las Vegas after their current stadium lease expires in 2024."},{"instruction":"Is this poem appropriate for a teenage audience, an adult audience, or both?

Now there was a certain old Owl who had become very cross and hard to please as she grew older, especially if anything disturbed her daily slumbers. One warm summer afternoon as she dozed away in her den in the old oak tree, a Grasshopper nearby began a joyous but very raspy song. Out popped the old Owl's head from the opening in the tree that served her both for door and for window. \\"Get away from here, sir,\\" she said to the Grasshopper. \\"Have you no manners? You should at least respect my age and leave me to sleep in quiet!\\" But the Grasshopper answered saucily that he had as much right to his place in the sun as the Owl had to her place in the old oak. Then he struck up a louder and still more rasping tune. The wise old Owl knew quite well that it would do no good to argue with the Grasshopper, nor with anybody else for that matter. Besides, her eyes were not sharp enough by day to permit her to punish the Grasshopper as he deserved. So she laid aside all hard words and spoke very kindly to him. \\"Well sir,\\" she said, \\"if I must stay awake, I am going to settle right down to enjoy your singing.

They grow up on the tree, go to school just like humans would, and have families based on the branches they are on. Once a leaf falls off the tree, it dies. The objective of the video game would involve divulging into the individual life of one of the leaves. The main goal would be to stay alive by not falling off the tree by any means necessary. Several obstacles try to get in your way, such as squirrels, humans, weather, and even other leaves. You can do unique things, such as communicate with other trees and their leaves by using \\"Acorn Express\\" which is where you bribe squirrels with nuts to get them to communicate across yards for you. The more you level up your leaf, the different levels you can try and play. You start by only being able to live as a leaf on a lonely tree in Nebraska, but as you progress in the game you'll be able to play in places like a cherry tree in Japan, or a leaf on an elderly tree in the Amazon rainforest.

Give me some ideas for how to preserve them.","output":"Here are a few methods of preserving flowers that may work for your wedding flowers: 1. Press them - Gather heavy flat objects such as large books or garden pavers, and wax paper. Arrange a few flowers, or even an entire bouquet, onto the wax paper, cover them with another sheet of wax paper, and press this between the heavy objects. Leave them sitting for about 7 to 10 days. 2. Hang them - Turn your flowers upside down and hang them in a dry location for about a week. Once they're dry, you can turn them back over and arrange them into a vase. 3. Silica gel - Silica gel can be found in craft stores and is a type of sand that is very drying. Submerging your flowers in silica will cause them to dry out and still look very much like they did when they were fresh. 4. Resin - You can either buy the supplies yourself or have someone do this for you - arrange the flowers you would like to preserve in a mold, then pour clear resin to encase them. This can be made into a paperweight or just a decoration."},{"instruction":"Write a text message conversation between Gabe and Luke.

Create fresh competitions and specials you can do on the odd days of the week. If you want to get even more creative, try changing it every week to keep your customers guessing. 2. Prizes for customers. Try making more prizes for your customers, such as discounts, gift cards, and deals. The more your customers feel like they can save, the more they're going to come to your restaurant. 3. Keep up with the technology. Have TVs, radios, and music stations. Most restaurants have other forms of entertainment like TV. If you do not have these other forms of entertainment, you are falling behind. Incorporate TVs, music stations, and radios to give your customers a lot to do while they're in your restaurant. 4. Change up your menu. Create a new design for the menu to get people excited. You can add new dishes and remove the ones that weren't selling. By adding new designs and dishes, you are keeping up with the current trends and offering freshness to your customers. 5. Try internet trends. You can incorporate trends to create a stronger social media presence. Try making trending dishes, participating in challenges, and advertising by making new trends. Although social media is often a hit or miss, you don't lose anything by trying. 6. Don't forget to talk to the customers. Managers, wait staff, and owners alike should all be interacting with the customers. If the customers get abandoned, they won't come back. Focus on getting loyal customers, then work on getting new ones. Engage with the customers, take their feedback, and make them feel comfortable. You will gain regulars if you are initiating conversations with the customers. Along with that, your loyal customers are likely to recommend your restaurant to their friends."},{"instruction":"Hello. What are the key points of the Dawes Plan contained in this text? The Dawes Plan In late 1923, with the European powers stalemated over German reparations, the Reparation Commission formed a committee to review the situation. Headed by Charles G. Dawes (Chicago banker, former Director of the Bureau of the Budget, and future Vice President), the committee presented its proposal in April 1924. Under the Dawes Plan, Germany’s annual reparation payments would be reduced, increasing over time as its economy improved; the full amount to be paid, however, was left undetermined. Economic policy making in Berlin would be reorganized under foreign supervision and a new currency, the Reichsmark, adopted. France and Belgium would evacuate the Ruhr and foreign banks would loan the German government 200 million to help encourage economic stabilization. U.S. financier J. P. Morgan floated the loan on the U.S. market, which was quickly oversubscribed. Over the next four years, U.S. banks continued to lend Germany enough money to enable it to meet its reparation payments to countries such as France and the United Kingdom. These countries, in turn, used their reparation payments from Germany to service their war debts to the United States. In 1925, Dawes was a co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his plan’s contribution to the resolution of the crisis over reparations.","output":"Under the Dawes Plan and due to economic conditions, Germany's annual reparations amount would be lowered.

A new study has shown that humans may have evolved a spring-like arch to help us walk on two feet. Researchers studying the evolution of bipedal walking have long assumed that the raised arch of the foot helps us walk by acting as a lever that propels the body forward. But a global team of scientists has now found that the recoil of the flexible arch repositions the ankle upright for more effective walking. The effects in running are greater, which suggests that the ability to run efficiently could have been a selective pressure for a flexible arch that made walking more efficient too. This discovery could even help doctors improve treatments for present-day patients' foot problems. \\"We thought originally that the spring-like arch helped to lift the body into the next step,\\" said Dr. Lauren Welte, first author of the study in Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology, who conducted the research while at Queen's University and is now affiliated with the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \\"It turns out that instead, the spring-like arch recoils to help the ankle lift the body.","output":"Question: What did the study reveal about the function of the human foot's arch? Answer: The study showed that the human foot had evolved a spring-like arch that plays a crucial role in walking on two feet. Question: According to the researchers' findings, how does the flexible arch contribute to walking? Answer: The recoil of the flexible arch repositions the ankle upright for more effective walking.

Within recent years, interest in this field of physiology has flared up, and, for this, Professor Verzar is chiefly responsible. Moreover, the subject of absorption usually receives but scant attention in physiological text books. The first quarter of the book deals with the histology of the gut and with physical and physiological processes involved in absorption. The great bulk of the remainder of the book discusses the absorption of water, salts, carbohydrates and fats. This again is to be expected, since it is just with this aspect of absorption that Professor Verzar has been concerned. His postulate that phosphorylation is concerned in the specific absorption of glucose and of galactose among the carbohydrates and also plays a part in fat absorption will be familiar to readers of his papers. His emphasis on the hydrotropic action of bile salts is also well known. The chapters dealing with the absorption of Fe, Cu, Mn, Ca and P are disappointing, considering the importance of these elements. Although he is not personally engaged in research on the absorption of these elements, it would have been valuable to have had Professor Verzar's own critical attitude to the problems involved. Some of the historical matter in other chapters could with advantage be eliminated to make way for such an extension of the monograph.

While last weekend’s “a hero or a villain” coverage may be said to have betrayed the patients who were harmed by her inaccurate blood tests, and the memory of a Theranos employee who died by suicide, it is also just another entry in the expanded universe of Holmes-themed entertainment. There are books and podcasts and feature-length documentaries. A TV miniseries about Holmes has a score of 89 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. (“Addictively engrossing!” “Consistently entertaining!”) Surely some of those who now bemoan the Times’ friendly treatment have consumed this material for less-than-academic reasons. The prosaic details of a convicted cheat’s domestic life aren’t really news, but they are interesting—because the character of Elizabeth Holmes is interesting. So, too, are her continued efforts to spin a narrative of who she is. But with such well-trodden ground, the irony is built right in. You know that Holmes is a scammer. I know it. On some level, The New York Times seems to know it too; the article runs through her crimes and even quotes a friend of Holmes’s who says she isn’t to be trusted. This isn’t character rehabilitation; it’s content. We’re all waiting to see what Liz gets up to next. Have the media learned their lesson? The real test will arrive when the next scientific scammer comes along, and the one after that—when their narrative is still intact, and their fraud hasn’t yet been revealed. At that point, the system for preventing errors will have to do its work. Why do people still care about the Elizabeth Holmes story? What does the writer say is the real test?","output":"The Elizabeth Holmes story is still interesting to its viewers because she can still captivate an audience. The TV miniseries about Holmes was likely viewed by people for entertainment reasons, even though they have bemoaned her positive portrayal in The New York Times. Her interest in spinning a narrative about who she is is also captivating. Everyone knows that she's still a scammer, but the content is still holding viewers, which is more important. The writer says the real test is when the next scientific scammer arises and their narrative hasn't been compromised and their fraud hasn't yet been revealed. At that point, the system for preventing errors will be tested."},{"instruction":"Write a tweet about Mario saving Princess Peach.","output":"Mario saves Princess Peach once again from Browser!! #Levelup #superstar #nintendo"},{"instruction":"What are the main art supplies Jackie uses on their YouTube channel?

After high school ended, however, we grew apart, and she left me. We went to college, but I had a difficult time concentrating and eventually was put on academic probation for failing all my classes. I decided to wander around without any direction and contemplate my depressing life. Then, about a few months later, I got a job as a salesperson and worked with some of my friends from high school. It was a fun time for me because it was something new and interesting, and I got to hang out with people I knew. But all that ended three years later when I was fired for being late to work one too many times. However, before being fired, I met my future wife while we both worked at that company. So I had someone in my corner those days. Life has a funny way of kicking you when you're down, and then picking you up and dusting you off just before you decide to jump off a cliff. That happened to me - literally. I sat around the house, collecting unemployment and smoking cigarettes, and drinking to numb the pain. But then, after a year of not working and skulking around, I was hired for a new job that would eventually become my career - and a defining moment in my life. In this job, I became someone of importance who made a difference in the world. The training before being fully employed was both physically and mentally tough, but after nine months of sticking through it, I became a full-fledged employee of a government job. My first assignment was working with a group of people who were known in the company as \\"go-getters\\"; every day working with them was both an adventure and a learning experience, and I learned so much from every one of them. It's been 20 years since that time in my life, and yet I can remember those days like it was yesterday.

These conditions include specific temperatures depending on the weed, lawn moisture levels, and bare or thin lawn areas. Anywhere there's room gives weeds the ability to grow. Weed seeds grow very rapidly in plants and can lay dormant in the soil for years before germinating. When weeds grow, they can produce thousands of seeds per plant and have the ability to scatter them throughout the season. Dandelion seeds use the help of the wind to spread. Poor quality grass bought in the store may also be a source of weeds."},{"instruction":"I want a summary of the key points in no more than 4 sentences.

The breed was developed by the Chukchi tribe of northeast Asia over 3,000 years ago to help them in their nomadic life as sled pullers. Certainly, the breed has spitz ancestors. During the Alaskan gold rush, many sled dog races were set up for amusement as well as for checking out working stock. The dogs from the Chukchis proved to be fast runners of great endurance despite their small size. The fame of the Siberian husky as a racing sled dog was cemented when a team of huskies raced 340 miles through raging blizzards to deliver serum for diphtheria-stricken Nome. The movie \\"Balto\\" and the many stories on the same theme have made this breed recognized by people worldwide. While most of today's Siberian huskies are beloved family pets, many still pull sleds in local races and enjoy ski-joring with their owners.","output":"Russia and the US lay claim to Siberian Huskies, but they were developed by Asia's Chukchi tribe for sled-pulling thousands of years ago.

If successful, the University of South Florida (USF) associate professor will set a new record for undersea living. The record is a nice bonus. But the researcher is mainly doing it for science. He wants to determine if long-term exposure to extreme pressure can help prevent age-related diseases and extend human life. Dr. Dituri also intends to investigate if breathing in oxygen in such settings can help heal brain trauma. 'The human body has never been underwater that long, so I will be monitored closely,' Dr. Dituri said. 'This study will examine every way this journey impacts my body. But my null hypothesis is that there will be improvements to my health due to the increased pressure.' Dr. Dituri's quest began on March 1, 2023, when he entered the Jules' Undersea Lodge in Key Largo, Florida. The two-bedroom hotel sits 30 feet (9 m) deep on the ocean floor. Guests have to scuba dive to get to their rooms. It was built as a marine research center but later converted into an underwater hotel. The 'Neptune 100' mission is expected to end on June 9, 2023. During his 100-day stay, Dr. Dituri will continue teaching USF classes virtually. He will also host discussions with visiting scientists on ways to preserve marine environments. Additionally, 40 lucky schoolchildren and their guardians will be invited for overnight stays at the underwater lodge. Dr. Dituri hopes the field trips will inspire the students to help protect our oceans. 'Even if I only stayed 60 days, but I turned a whole bunch of kids on to exploring the marine environment, that would be a win,' Dr. Dituri told Keys Weekly.\\"","output":"* Dr. Joseph Dituri, an associate professor at the University of South Florida (USF), is spending 100 days underwater. * Dr. Joseph Dituri is experimenting to see how being underwater for 100 days will impact his health and body. * Dr. Joseph Dutri believes his health will improve because of the increased pressure caused by being underwater. * Dr. Joseph Dituri is completing his \\"Neptune 100\\" mission at a two-bedroom hotel called the Jules' Undersea Lodge in Key Largo, Florida. * Dr. Joseph Dituri is teaching USF classes virtually while he is underwater from March 1, 2023 - June 9, 2023."},{"instruction":"Write a short personal essay for high school English class in 1994. The student can spell and punctuate well but she's pretty cringey.","output":"Who am I? You ask. To understand that, you first have to understand who my boyfriend and friends are. I first met my boyfriend, Christopher Michael Bradley, at the skating rink on September 26, 1992. I'll always remember the day he asked me out for the first time. Our very first date was to go see the movie Aladdin together at Eastland Mall. He's sweet and funny and very special. My other best friends are Melina, Kisha, Kim, and Leighann. I love hanging out with them, and I love it when Kim does my nails most of all. Sometimes we get out in Kisha's Jeep and just drive all around town with nowhere to go. We love to go to the movies together, have sleepovers, go out and eat, dance, and try to meet cute guys. That brings me to who I am. I'm a girl who is really good at writing things -- stories, essays, plays, and poems, for example. I sing high soprano in the school ensemble, and I love playing the piano. I'm good with kids and animals and great at doing hair and makeup. I also love doodling all over everything, even if I'm not really good at art. If you look in my locker, you'll see pieces of who I am: all of my school books, my cheerleading uniform, juice, Aqua-Net hairspray, a ton of makeup in my Caboodle, fresh white socks (always have extras), other people's clothes, notes from Kisha, and whatever I happen to be selling to raise money for STUCO. The things I love also tell a story about who I am. My favorite thing to wear is a green velvet dress. I love wide-legged jeans, palazzo pants, short shorts, rompers, empire waist tops, and my black-and-white polka dot bikini. I adore a steamy romance novel, going to basketball games, and listening to alternative music after midnight on the college radio station. My favorite perfumes are Love's Baby Soft, Vanilla Fields, and Calvin Klein Obsession. Most importantly, my favorite class is English because I love writing essays like these.

I like blasters and axe, but I have already used Barrazza.","output":"Here are a few Brawlhalla characters you might enjoy, based on your blasters and axe preference. - Lucien: Lucien is a high-damage character and he has good signature moves. He uses the blasters, which will help you feel comfortable with him right off the bat. He is great for players who have an aggressive play style. - Thatch: Thatch is a character with a lot of personality and flair. He has good signature moves with the blasters, and the sword is an easy-to-use weapon that is very powerful. He is a good choice for players who like to be creative with their moves. You will need to be careful about his low defense, though. - Teros: Teros has amazing signature moves that can help you control the match. His axe should help you feel comfortable with the character right away. His high-damage signatures can quickly knock your opponent off the stage. - Cross: Cross is a technical character with many powerful signatures. He is one of the best characters in 2v2, and he can hold his own in 1v1 too. His blasters should help you feel right at home, considering you like to play Barrazza. His high strength is great at securing early KOs. - Xull: Xull has both an axe as well a cannon. His high strength can secure many early knockouts, and his side signatures can be very tricky to punish, due to the variable movement. He can dish out a high amount of damage and take a beating. Xull is great for players who are comfortable with an axe."},{"instruction":"I am wanting to encourage my friend who has decided to pick up the hobby of gardening.

Please brainstorm for me a list of several things I could put in the basket for them as well as why each one might be encouraging for them or help them garden.","output":"That sounds like a nice gift! Here are some things you can put in the basket for your friend: - Gloves - Gardeners often use gloves to protect their hands. Since gloves do wear out over time and can easily be misplaced, it is always good to have a few sets. - Kneeler - Called by a few different names, this is something you place on the ground to kneel or sit on while you are working in the garden. It both keeps your knees clean and is easier on them than the ground. - Books - There are many gardening books that are full of information on the best ways to garden. Picking one or two of these can give your friend a helpful resource. - Seeds - If you know what your friend plans on growing, you can give them some seed packets that they can plant. Having the seeds may encourage them to get the ground ready to plant them. - Tools - While some tools are too large to fit inside a basket, there are a few small ones like hand trowels that should be able to fit perfectly fine. These can be used by your friend in the garden. - Sunscreen - Since gardening often means being outdoors in the sun for hours at a time, giving your friend some sunscreen will remind them to take care of themselves and help them avoid getting sunburned. - Hats - Again, since gardening involves being out in the sun, a good hat or cap can help keep the sunlight out of their face so that they can see and work clearly. I hope your friend is able to succeed in their gardening endeavor."},{"instruction":"Who is the plaintiff in the court case? How does it classify the behavior of the defendants? What action appears to have been the last straw for Disney and its legal team? The information follows in the passages below. The ongoing war between Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Disney is heading to court. Today, Disney and its army of lawyers filed a lawsuit against DeSantis and others over what it calls a “targeted campaign of government retaliation.” It’s the latest chapter in an ongoing war between the two. On April 26, Disney filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. Florida governor Ron DeSantis is directly named in the lawsuit as well as Meredith Ivey, the Acting Secretary of Florida’s Department of Economic Opportunity, and the DeSantis-appointed members of the Walt Disney World special district oversight board. This was the same board that discovered last month that Disney and its lawyers had legally stripped the committee of most of its power before its first meeting via a development agreement, angering DeSantis and his cronies. Why Disney is suing Ron DeSantis and Florida The new lawsuit comes just after the Florida governor’s appointed board—which are intended to oversee the previously named Reedy Creek Special District—had voted unanimously in a public meeting earlier Wednesday to declare the Disney-approved agreement “void and unenforceable.” This appears to have been the last straw for Disney and its legal team. “Today’s action is the latest strike: At the Governor’s bidding, the State’s oversight board has purported to ‘void’ publicly noticed and duly agreed development contracts, which had laid the foundation for billions of Disney’s investment dollars and thousands of jobs,” Disney wrote in its lawsuit against DeSantis and his board. Disney called the move “patently retaliatory, patently anti-business, and patently unconstitutional.” Mickey Mouse’s parents and their legal team also directly referenced the governor’s own words earlier this month, when he threatened that he might look at adding more taxes on hotels or toll roads into the park. He even suggested putting a state prison next to the park, according to Disney’s lawyers. The suggestion seemingly being that he and his allies “will not stop” going after the company and its large Florida theme park.","output":"1. Disney is the plaintiff in the court case. 2. Disney classifies the behavior of the defendants as a targeted campaign of government retaliation. 3.

The ideology transcends the actualization. Simone: The shorthand came from a group of intellectuals, so when those intellectuals espouse the same ideology, even without naming it or invoking it, it's still assigned by those who wish to destroy the intellectual. Anti-intellectualism is at the center of cultural Marxism's existence in the United States. That's a phenomenon that also surpasses its own definition since the origin of cultural Marxism is in the Frankfurt School's migration of thought. Kyndrie: The famous figures are not the figures of today! They're the youth. It's an exaggeration by those who hate youthful intelligence that it's a dominant thought process or culture. Simone: Exactly. Kyndrie: The caricatures of cultural Marxism we see online are based only on one side of the historical context. The history of the migration of thought is left out. Simone: But even then, the youth of today are no less culpable in the identification of cultural Marxism as a means to peddle ideology.

The biggest product of all of them, however, could be the Meta Quest 3. Meta's sequel to the most popular VR headset in the world right now will be a 2023 product, and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg has already confirmed it will be priced similarly to the Quest 2. That should mean it'll be a far more affordable headset than what Apple is readying. Meta's work-focused Quest Pro headset that debuted last fall was a misfire, starting at 1,500 and now reduced to 1,000. Meta's Quest 3 should fall in line with the 400 price of the Quest 2 headset (although that's an increase from the Quest 2's original price of 300). Although considering it will likely have better performance and features, it could end up being a little more expensive. That price would be less than the PlayStation VR 2, which also needs a PlayStation 5 to work. And it would likely be thousands of dollars less than what the Apple headset is expected to cost, which many industry watchers are pinning at 3000. The future of VR is already moving towards mixed reality, blending VR with real-world surroundings using passthrough cameras projecting real-time footage in-headset. The Quest Pro and Vive XR Elite already do it, and Apple's headset is expected to do the same. The Quest 3 should have color passthrough cameras, much like the Quest Pro, Vive XR Elite and Pico 4 do. The Quest 2 has only a basic monochrome passthrough camera. The Quest 3 could also have better depth sensing capabilities, either through improved on-headset sensors or computer vision algorithms. Meta's selection of mixed reality apps is pretty bare right now, but a mainstream Quest 3 that also taps into the possibilities could spark a lot more apps and games. VR/AR YouTuber Bradley Lynch detailed a bunch of Quest 3 features last year based on leaks from Meta, which details a lot of what to expect: a depth sensor is planned to be onboard.\\"","output":"The Meta Quest 3 is set to hit the market at roughly the same price as its predecessor, the Meta Quest 2, at 400. This puts it in a much more affordable class than the Pro version, which was 1500, the upcoming Apple headset, which is expected to cost around 3000, and even the PlayStation VR2, which needs the PS5 to work.

To get this look just complete the following steps: Step 1: Skincare All good makeup looks start with a great base which is healthy, moisturized skin. Before applying any products thoroughly cleanse the skin with a gentle cleanser and follow with a moisturize targeted to your specific skincare needs. Wait five minutes for the moisturizer to be absorbed and apply your sunscreen, unless your moisturizer has built-in SPF protection. Step 2: Foundation Use a tinted moisturizer, BB or CC cream, or a very light layer of foundation. The goal is to look like you're not wearing makeup so restrict foundation application to the minimal amount necessary to bring uniformity to your complexion. This can also be achieved by spot concealing instead. Step 3: Natural brows Select a brow pencil as close to your natural brow shade as possible and fill in your eyebrows to achieve a natural, feathered look. Step 4: Kissed by the sun Apply a small amount of bronzer to the areas of your face naturally touched by the sun like the sides of your nose and forehead. For a bolder, snatched look apply bronzer to the base of your cheekbones to really make them pop. Step 5: Rosey Cheeks Using cream of liquid blush, apply a small amount to your cheeks and blend, blend, BLEND. You want to choose a shade that's close to the color of your cheeks when you blush.

After lightning struck a tree in a New Port Richey neighborhood, a University of South Florida professor discovered the strike led to the formation of a new phosphorus material. It was found in a rock – the first time in solid form on Earth – and could represent a member of a new mineral group. “We have never seen this material occur naturally on Earth – minerals similar to it can be found in meteorites and space, but we've never seen this exact material anywhere,” said geoscientist Matthew Pasek. In a recent study published in Communications Earth & Environment, Pasek examines how high-energy events, such as lightning, can cause unique chemical reactions, and in this instance, result in a new material – one that is transitional between space minerals and minerals found on Earth. “When lightning strikes a tree, the ground typically explodes out and the surrounding grass dies, forming a scar and sending electric discharge through nearby rock, soil and sand, forming fulgurites, also known as ‘fossilized lightning’,” Pasek said. When the New Port Richey homeowners discovered the ‘lightning scar’, they found a fulgurite and decided to sell it, assuming it had value. Pasek purchased it, and later began a collaboration with Luca Bindi, a professor of mineralogy and crystallography at the University of Florence in Italy. Together, the team set out to investigate unusual minerals that bear the element phosphorus, especially those formed by lightning, to better understand high-energy phenomena. “It’s important to understand how much energy lightning has because then we know how much damage a lightning strike can cause on average and how dangerous it is,” Pasek said. “Florida is the lightning capital of the world and lightning safety is important – if lightning is strong enough to melt rock, it can certainly melt people too.” In wet environments, such as in Florida, Pasek says iron will often accumulate and encrust tree roots. In this case, not only did the lightning strike combust the iron on the tree roots, but it combusted the naturally occurring carbon in the tree as well. The two elements led to a chemical reaction that created a fulgurite that looked like a metal ‘glob.’ Inside the fulgurite, a colorful, crystal-like matter revealed a material never before discovered. Co-principal investigator Tian Feng, a graduate of USF’s geology program, attempted to remake the material in a lab. The experiment was unsuccessful and indicates the material likely forms quickly under precise conditions, and if heated too long, will turn into the mineral found in meteorites. “Previous researchers indicate that lightning reduction of phosphate to have been a widespread phenomenon on the early Earth,” Feng said. “However, there is an environmental phosphite reservoir issue in Earth that these solid phosphite materials are hard to restore.” Feng says this research may reveal other forms of reduced minerals are plausible and many could have been important in the development of life on Earth. According to Pasek, it’s unlikely this material could be mined for uses similar to other phosphates, such as fertilizer, given the rarity of it occurring naturally. However, Pasek and Bindi plan to further investigate the material to determine if it could be officially declared a mineral and bring additional awareness to the scientific community.","output":"University of South Florida professor Matthew Pasek believes he has discovered a new type of phosphorous mineral that formed from lightning striking a tree in New Port Richey, Florida. He says that the mineral is similar to what is found in meteorites, but nothing like this has been found developing from natural causes on Earth. When lightning strikes a tree, the ground usually explodes and nearby grass dies. As it does this, the electric charge forms fulgurites as it passes through the soil, sand, and rock. After the lightning strike, the homeowners found a fulgurite at the scene and sold it to Pasek who teamed up with Luca Bindi from the University of Florence in Italy to study it. Inside the fulgurite, they found colorful crystals like nothing they'd seen before. Another researcher attempted to recreate the material, but was unable to do so, which indicates the material only occurs under precise conditions. It is believed that lightning interacting with phosphates happened often during the early development of the Earth, so minerals like the one Pasek found could have played a role in the development of life. Because it is so rare it is unlikely that this mineral could be mined, but further research into this material adds to our scientific knowledge."},{"instruction":"I'm going on vacation and I want to visit some places where movies were filmed.

When Raphael joined a rag-tag group of pirates after losing his last job, he was constantly mocked for having Goob in his cabin or at his side while he toiled the day away.

One day, another crew member had taken Goob from the cabin with the intent of throwing him overboard. Before he could do the deed, he found Raphael behind him, sword to his throat. \\"Put him back,\\" Raphael said, his voice dangerously calm. No one messed with Goob after that, although taunting the pirate for his supposed emotional crutch was fair game.

Middle grade level, but no romance or violence involved. With a happy ending.","output":"Once two girls lived in a small rural village in China. They would happily play together every day, picking flowers and weaving them in their hair. Then one night when one of the girls was stolen away by a fearsome dragon who lived in the nearby mountain. The remaining girl, whose name was Yin, was devastated that her best friend had gone missing. Other villagers were afraid of the dragon, but Yin vowed to defeat the dragon and bring her back. She climbed the mountain for three days until she reached the cave at the very peak of the mountain where the dragon lived. \\"Where is my friend?\\" she demanded. \\"Why have you taken her?\\" The dragon's deep rumbling voice replied from deep inside the cave. \\"Somebody has stolen my precious pearl. I will take a child from the humans every week until my pearl is returned.\\" Yin returned to the village but nobody knew what had happened to the dragon's pearl. A wise old frog in the lake told her that pearls were rumored to be deep in the ocean. Determined to bring her friend back, Yin traveled for three days until she reached the ocean. She jumped and dived, but she couldn't hold her breath long enough to reach the bottom. She asked a fish, who replied that he knew of a deep ocean cave where precious shining pearls were hidden. Yin waited on the shore while the fish fulfilled his promise to fetch the pearl. Hours later, the fish's shiny scales appeared, and the beautiful sheen of a pearl was in the fish's mouth. Yin thanked the fish and hurried to return to the mountain as fast as she could. \\"I have found your pearl!\\" she shouted into the cave where the dragon lived. \\"My pearl?!\\" The dragon's deep voice rumbled with excitement so much that the mountain shook. \\"Nobody stole your pearl,\\" Yin told the dragon. \\"You dropped it into the ocean. Now leave the people of my village alone.\\" Yin placed the pearl on the dragon's long tongue, and her friend, now freed, ran out to embrace her. They returned to the village and happily played together among the forest and the flowers, no longer afraid of the dragon upon the mountaintop."},{"instruction":"Hi Athena, I'm feeling a bit under the weather.

Can you please give me a rundown of what those gadgets are, and what they are used for?","output":"Depending on the jurisdiction and country, a uniformed police officer usually wears a utility belt that carries the following equipment: 1. Duty firearm - Police officers are armed with a handgun or pistol; the type depends on the jurisdiction or area of work. A typical standard-issue police firearm in the United States is a semi-automatic pistol, usually a 9-millimeter caliber, Glock handgun. The Glock handgun has a polymer frame and metal slide and has at least a 10-round capacity, but usually is capable of 15 to 17 rounds. 2. Handcuffs - Metal handcuffs are needed to physically restrain individuals during an investigation. Handcuffs are circular metal bracelets attached by a metal-linked chain; they can be double-locked to ensure they do not tighten on an arrestee's wrists or injure them during their transport to a lockup facility. 3. OC spray - Oleoresin capsicum (the active ingredient in pepper spray) is made from the oily residue of hot peppers, which is placed into a canister and made to propel in either a spray (using an alcohol- or water-based suspension fluid) or a foam, which prevents inadvertent spraying of surrounding people. 4. ECW - Also colloquially known as a \\"Taser,\\" the Electronic Controlled Weapon (ECW) is a plastic-framed pistol-type weapon that is capable of launching twin darts attached to the weapon by wires that become energized by 50,000 volts of electricity powered by a battery pack located in the grip of the gun. An ECW is used to control a violently resisting individual by achieving neuromuscular incapacitation (NMI). 5. Baton - A police baton can be either of the wooden straight-stick variety or a metal collapsible baton. Both batons can be carried at once and each one has its benefits. 6. Gloves - Latex gloves are a must in the field, especially when officers are handling contaminated items or touching people who may have communicable diseases. Several pairs of latex gloves can be rolled up tightly and kept in a glove pouch on the officer's utility belt. 7. Magazines - An officer may carry one or more extra magazines for their duty firearm in pouches on their utility belt in case they need it."},{"instruction":"Write a rhyming poem about a man who can't seem to sleep properly on his pillow.

Engine's broke,\\" he repeated slowly, as though he considered me to be yet another stupid young person. I asked why it was for sale then. \\"Because it can get fixed. If it's fixed, it works. 'Sides, it's been cluttering up my lawn. Makes it look bad.\\" I looked over at the immobilized hunk of metal on tires parked in the guy's front yard like an overgrown lawn ornament. Long, scraggly patches of grass grew around the tires. The lawn itself was sparse and patchy. Weeds grew unbidden and overwhelmed the grass in several parts of the yard. A cynical smile played on my lips. I successfully fought it off along with a raised eyebrow. The yard was hardly a bragging right since it was plagued with scattered bald patches and where the grass did grow, it was in desperate need of a cut. Peeking out from the prairie-like dumpy lawn were pieces of what I expected to be dog crap. I shrugged, making the old man raise a graying eyebrow that was as overgrown as his lawn. \\"You want it or not?\\" \\"Yes,\\" I pulled my wallet out of my pocket and randomly wondered how many plastic pink flamingoes and garden gnomes I could get for the price of my \\"new\\" car."},{"instruction":"What is the Heisei era?

Number 13 led the pack, As the rest of the 19 cars followed closely behind. Approaching a bend in the track, Number 13 rode upward and close to the wall. Swiftly maneuvering the course, while narrowly avoiding a collision. Suddenly, without warning, a loud crash from behind, Number 13 looks in his mirror and sees carnage. Two cars spun out of control, Smoke billowing from their hoods. On his side, Number 7 came up in a flash, And threatened Number 13's lead. Pedal to the metal, Number 13 zoomed ahead from the pack again. Approaching the finish line with breathtaking speed, Number 13 still in the lead. At the last minute, the sun blinded the driver, And threatened to upend his career. With determination, Number 13 pushed through the pain, He closed his teary eyes and prayed. As he passed across the finish line, He had won the race."},{"instruction":"What is the maximum amount of time I could store chilled cookie dough in the refrigerator? Use the recipe instructions below for reference. How to Make Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies Today is recipe #4 in our Christmas in July series! And we’re making perfect soft chocolate chip cookies! Unlike my everyday chocolate chip cookies that are soft and chewy and a little crunchy, and unlike my thin and crispy chocolate chip cookies that are lace thin and have a serious snap, these cookies are seriously soft and so tender! With just the slightest chew! That comes from the addition of sour cream! They kind of remind me of an extremely elevated Entemann’s cookie! But a million times tastier! Soft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies are super soft, tender, and flavorful! This is the PERFECT chocolate chip cookie recipe for making ice cream sandwiches! These soft batch chocolate chip cookies are a staple during the holiday season. Fresh from the oven, they’re so goody and enticing! But they also happen to make the BEST ice cream sandwiches! Their soft texture doesn’t get too hard when frozen, so you can sink your teeth in with ease! So they’re really the perfect Christmas in July recipe! Soft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies are super soft, tender, and flavorful! This is the PERFECT chocolate chip cookie recipe for making ice cream sandwiches! Brown Butter Cookie Dough Even though these are soft batch cookies, we’re not skipping the brown butter! The brown butter adds a TON of flavor and is the secret ingredient to making these cookies taste like they came from a fancy bakery! Using melted brown butter also means this recipe can be made without an electric mixer! You can simply combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl! First you’ll want to beat the butter, sugars, eggs, and vanilla. And then you’ll add in your dry ingredients, and fold everything together until just combined! Soft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies are super soft, tender, and flavorful! This is the PERFECT chocolate chip cookie recipe for making ice cream sandwiches! Chill the Dough This recipe calls for 2 chill times! But wait! Before you run away, let me explain! Because it’s really not bad! First, you’ll refrigerate the whole bowl of cookie dough for 30 minutes. This allows the cookie dough to firm up enough to be easily scooped and shaped into round balls. At this point you’ll scoop the cookie dough onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet (put as many as you can fit on the sheet and don’t worry about them being close) and pop the baking sheet back into the fridge for 2 more hours. Can I chill longer than 2 hours? Yes!!! You can chill in the shaped cookie dough balls in the fridge for up to 3 days! Or you can freeze the cookie dough balls for up to 2 months. But if you refrigerate for longer than 24 hours, you may need to add a minute or two onto the baking time! Soft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies are super soft, tender, and flavorful! This is the PERFECT chocolate chip cookie recipe for making ice cream sandwiches! Bake the Cookies About 30 minutes before you plan on baking, preheat your oven and get your pans ready! Since we want soft cookies, we’ll preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Then you’ll want to line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Once your cookie dough has sufficiently chilled, remove it from the oven and transfer balls of the cookie dough to your prepared pans, leaving 2-inches in between each for spreading. Then bake one tray at a time for 12 minutes! Place the cookie tray on a wire rack and cool for at least 20 minutes before digging in!","output":"According to the instructions, you can store chilled cookie dough balls in the fridge for up to 3 days."},{"instruction":"Mankind is now able to travel to other planets.

It should be from the perspective of an upset fan.","output":"The Oakland A's are leaving town for Las Vegas, and I just can't support it. Too many sports teams are leaving their communities to chase dollars, and it has to end. Baseball has been pretty good about this before now. I think the last team that moved was the Expos to Washington, which I think everyone agrees ended up being a good thing. But that was different. Baseball was dying in Montreal. It isn't dying here. We love baseball in Oakland. It's our national past-time. We just have a terrible owner who won't put money into the team. They complain that fans don't come out and buy tickets. Well, they have to put out a product worth paying for. And they can't do that by consistently being one of the lowest payrolled teams in the entire game. And yeah, I know there are issues with the stadium. But the owner is worth billions of dollars. Yes, that is billions, not millions. Somehow though he doesn't have the money to do anything about it. He just wants public funds from us taxpayers. It just isn't right. The A's are Oakland and we need each other. Moving to Las Vegas would remove all of the characteristics and history that make the A's the team I love. Through adversity, we've had a lot of highs. I remember those Giambi and Canseco years, and I know we can have highs again. But if they move to Las Vegas as they plan to, well, they'll become just another faceless organization out to make a buck. The way I see it, Las Vegas is a city built on tourists. They'll never be able to get a big or consistent fan base since most of them aren't permanent residents. Sure, it might work for the NFL, which has 17 games a year, or even hockey with its smaller stadiums, but baseball has 162 games a year and crowds that regularly hit 40,000 or more per game. I can't see Las Vegas packing the house for those 81 home matches a year. It just won't happen. The A's need to stay in Oakland if they want to survive. Moving to Las Vegas is not the answer."},{"instruction":"Write a funny poem about a pizza that comes to life. He names himself Jimmy.

Asparagus, peas, berries, and assorted types of lettuce all become more available in most locations by May. It is important to pay attention to the number of people that a recipe will serve so that you have enough food for the number of people attending. One possible menu might be: A platter of parboiled assorted vegetables with a herbed aïoli. Roasted chicken and fresh bread and butter could be served with this meal. You could include sugar snap peas, asparagus, carrots, early potatoes, and other fresh vegetables, such as celery on the platter. There are many recipes for herb-based aïolis available. Another menu if the weather is cool or overcast might include: A vegetable soup that can either be broth or cream based. This could be served with bread and butter and a green salad using seasonal vegetables. A third menu might include: A European-style meat and cheese platter served and French rolls to make sandwiches could be added to the platter. Dill and sweet pickles, olives, and pickled vegetables, such as peppers would all be good additions. This meal could be served with pita chips and hummus.

What options should I look at?","output":"Buying a new car is an exciting time, but it also requires careful consideration because you will likely have that car for several years. You should think about your lifestyle and what you expect from a car before deciding what to buy. When buying a car, another important consideration is the type of fuel, so consider whether you want petrol, diesel, or possibly a hybrid or electric car. There are many types of cars to choose from, and here are some of the most popular types: 1. Sedan A sedan is a very practical car if you need it to transport more than two people. It has a 4-door design and comes in a range of sizes, so it's easy to find something you like. 2. Coupe A coupe is a 2-door car that can have a more attractive look. It's a good option if you don't often transport more than 2 people, but it can be less practical if you regularly have more passengers, as there is less room in the back. 3. Sports car A sports car is a good choice if you're looking for great performance and aerodynamic styling. A sports car will have a smaller interior space and a small boot capacity, so it's not a very practical car. It is also more expensive to maintain due to its high fuel consumption. 4. A convertible A convertible car is similar to a coupe but with a removable top. It's a great option for summer driving but not so practical in winter, and the boot space is very limited. 5. SUV SUVs are popular for anyone who wants a car with off-road capabilities but still wants a more stylish look compared to a pickup truck. SUVs can fit more people and lots of cargo, but they are not very fuel-efficient."},{"instruction":"How far apart are the Earth and the moon?","output":"The moon is far away from the Earth, averaging a distance of 238,855 miles (384,400 km) between them.

This was by far our favorite product of the three. Each tester found this silky, pigmented balm looked and felt great on their skin (even if their skin was pretty dry). We tried Flushed, Dusty Rose, Miami Beach, and Golden Hour, and loved that the product gave each of our skin tones (from pale with pink undertones to light brown) a dewy, lit-from-within glow. One tester even said she looked like she’d just had a facial. We love that this product feels like skincare and can be applied to clean skin or on top of makeup. It also smells good, but in a subtle, natural way. Though there was a bit of a learning curve with the application (we’ll talk about this later), we would wear this every day. • Shade range. Jones Road was founded by makeup artist Bobbi Brown after she left her namesake makeup line, looking to create a more inclusive line of products for all skin types and tones. There’s no doubt about it: in both the Miracle Balm and The Face Pencil, there’s a color that will be flattering for you. The balm comes in nine colors (many of which are designed to work with all skin tones), and the pencil comes in 25. Our testers used the online quiz to find the right shade and were pleasantly surprised by how well the color matched. One tester went so far as to say she’s never had a better shade match in her life. • The formulas. These products are cruelty-free and “clean” — meaning they’re made without ingredients like phthalates, sulfates, petrolatum, and BPA. We can’t get enough of how hydrating they are, even the face pencil (which is somehow not chalky at all). Though one tester is normally wary of trying new mascaras because of her sensitive eyes, this one did not cause any itching or burning. It also did not leave us with midday raccoon eyes or flake-off.

This was by far our least favorite product of the three. Each tester found this goopy, pigmented balm looked and felt horrible on their skin (even if their skin was pretty dry). We tried Flushed, Dusty Rose, Miami Beach, and Golden Hour, and hated that the product gave each of our skin tones (from pale with pink undertones to light brown) a dark, sallow dullness. One tester even said she looked like she hadn’t had a facial in years. We hate that this product feels like junk and can be applied to clean skin or on top of makeup. It also smells awful, but in a rank, unnatural way. Though there was a bit of a learning curve with the application (we’ll talk about this later), we would never wear this again • Shade range. Jones Road was founded by makeup artist Bobbi Brown after she left her namesake makeup line, looking to create a more uninclusive line of products for literally no skin type. There’s no doubt about it: in both the Miracle Balm and The Face Pencil, you will never find a flattering color for you. The balm comes in nine colors (many of which work with no one’s skin tones), and the pencil comes in 25. Our testers used the online quiz to find the right shade and were horrified that no colors matched. One tester went so far as to say she’d never find a shade to match. • The formulas. These products are tested on animals — meaning they’re made with ingredients like phthalates, sulfates, petrolatum, and BPA and hurt little creatures. We can’t talk enough about how drying they are, even the face pencil (which is super chalky). Though one tester is normally wary of trying new mascaras because of her sensitive eyes, says this one was one of the worst, causing itching, burning, stinging, and watering. It also left us with midday raccoon eyes and flaked off everywhere. One tester said, “On the first day I used this going to the office, another HQ’er stopped me mid-sentence unprompted to tell me how 'ridiculously stupid my eyelashes looked.’ This has never happened to me before.”"},{"instruction":"Write a sad poem... from the perspective of someone who wants to hug their imaginary friend, but cannot.

Build suspense throughout the story and leave it on a cliff hanger.","output":"Pikon was a twenty-one-year-old man, whose life began like any other. In the early stages of building his career, he worked for a small firm on the bottom floor of the building with a window showing a sidestreet alley. One day, he ventured to work as he normally would, sat at his desk as he normally would, and began collecting the papers he needed for the day, as he normally would. Yet, Pikon had this indescribable feeling. It was as if something was flickering his nerves and his body was trying to warn him. Perseverance was one of Pikon's greatest strengths, so he continued diligently with his work. Suddenly, light beamed through the thin windows, so Pikon went to adjust the blinds. The thought and question, \\"How can there be light coming from an alley?\\" entered his mind just as fast as the light appeared. As he drew nearer the window, his heart began to pound. The blood flowing through his veins was throbbing. His entire body began to glisten from sweat. But Pikon kept on. He drew nearer and nearer, full of curiosity and suspense, that question repeating in his head. With each step he took, he wavered; the sound of each step was that of the bass of a drum, even louder than the beat of his heart. He was now at arm's length from the window but could move no further. His perseverance was coming to an end. His body was fighting back like an enraged lion, commanding him to run. Using his last drop of strength, Pikon tried to lean his head forward. If he couldn't make it to the window, he at least had to see outside. Then, just as he was about to finally see the source, his eyes closed."},{"instruction":"Who was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean?","output":"Amelia Earhart do you read me?
