It is found by Alpheus Spring Packard in 1874 and is described in North America . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","output":"While these sentences appear to convey similar information, they possess slight structural and semantic differences. I will analyze each sentence closely to highlight their differences. 1. \\"It was described by Alpheus Spring Packard in 1874 and is found in North America.\\"          This sentence begins with the passive voice in the main clause (It was described by Alpheus Spring Packard in 1874) and the active voice in the coordinate clause (is found in North America). The focus in this sentence is on the object (presumably a species or an item) that Alpheus Spring Packard described in 1874, and the subsequent discovery of its presence in North America. 2. \\"It is found by Alpheus Spring Packard in 1874 and is described in North America.\\"          This sentence uses the active voice in both main and coordinate clauses. The first part (It is found by Alpheus Spring Packard in 1874) maintains the primary focus on the object mentioned and emphasizes Alpheus Spring Packard's role in discovering that object in 1874. However, the second part (is described in North America) differs from the first sentence, switching the focus to the object being described in North America (potentially referring to where the description of the object was recorded or where the description is available). In summary, these sentences share similarities in discussing Alpheus Spring Packard and his work in relation to the object in 1874. However, differences in sentence structures and the focus on particular elements of the statement create distinctions in how the ideas are expressed. The first sentence emphasizes Alpheus Packard's description of the object and its existence in North America. In contrast, the second sentence highlights Alpheus Spring Packard's discovery of the object and its detailed explanation in North America."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Under 100 words is a good title length. Input: Glycyrrhiza glabra L. has become an endangered medicinal plant due to the unabated extraction of glycyrrhizin. Glycyrrhizin is a triterpenoid saponin that is a root centric secondary metabolite having numerous pharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antiallergic, antiulcer, and is found to be effective even against HIV. Harvesting of the roots for high value glycyrrhizin destroys the whole plant causing existential threat to the plant itself and consequent damage to biodiversity. The present study establishes that hairy root cultures of G. glabra, using an optimized elicitor, can dramatically enhance focused production of glycyrrhizin at a much faster pace year-round without causing destruction of the plant. Hairy root cultures of G. glabra were developed using the Agrobacterium rhizogenes A4 strain. The glycyrrhizin content was enhanced using different biotic and abiotic elicitors, for example, PEG (polyethylene glycol), CdCl 2 , cellulase, and mannan at different concentrations and durations. PEG at 1% concentration enhanced the yield of glycyrrhizin up to 5.4fold after 24 h of exposure, whereas 200 µg mL −1 cellulase enhanced glycyrrhizin yield to 8.6-fold after 7 days of treatment. Mannan at 10 mg L −1 concentration enhanced the production of glycyrrhizin up to 7.8-fold after 10 days of stress. Among different antioxidant enzymes, SOD activity was significantly enhanced under drought, cellulase and mannan stress. This identification of elicitors can result in abundant supply of valuable glycyrrhizin to meet broad spectrum demand through commercial production without endangering G. glabra L.

Article: Adolf Hitler failed to pay as much attention to bombing the enemy as he did to protection from enemy bombing, although he had promoted the development of a bomber force in the 1930s and understood that it was possible to use bombers for major strategic purposes. He told the OKL in 1939 that ruthless employment of the Luftwaffe against the heart of the British will to resist could and would follow when the moment was right; however, he quickly developed a lively scepticism toward strategic bombing, confirmed by the results of the Blitz.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: A breach of contract occurs when one party fails to uphold his side of the contract without an adequate legal excuse. A breach of contract can be indicated by a failure to perform or by words or actions that indicate future nonperformance. If you are involved in a contract that involves materials (such as the sale of an item), you should be entitled to a full recovery of materials if the other party does not fulfill his end of the contract. For example, if you sell a boat to your neighbor and give him an owner-financed payment plan but he stops making payments, you are entitled to a full recovery of the boat, regardless of the amount your neighbor has paid towards the full amount. If you are the non-breach party in a contract, you can seek to mitigate (lessen) the damages caused by the other party’s breach of contract by seeking replacement goods or services (known as “cover.”)  If the cover costs you the same or less money than your original contract, you may not be entitled to damages.  However, if your cover costs you more, you can ask the contract-breaching party to pay the damages (the difference between the original cost and the cover.)  Finding cover as soon as possible to the breach of contract can help you show the court that you’ve done your best to avoid consequential damages, or further expenses due to your own failure to act.  For example, you may have a contract with a wedding photographer.  If your photographer backs out of the contract the week before your wedding, you may need to scramble and find a new photographer at the last minute.  If the last-minute photographer costs the same as your original photographer, there are no damages.  If the last-minute photographer charges you an additional 500 for the lack of notice, you can ask that the original photographer pay the 500 fee. If you cannot uphold your end of a contract, you can refuse to fulfill the obligations that are laid out in the contract. Refusing to perform your contractual obligations will constitute a breach of contract and may expose you to a breach of contract lawsuit. Before choosing this option, you should consult with an attorney to ensure that you completely understand all consequences of deciding to breach a contract. If the other party has breached a contract, you can file a lawsuit for damages incurred due to the breach.  Be sure that you have a copy of the contract, can specifically identify how and when the breach occurred, and document any financial or other damages that you accumulated as a result of the breach.  You can hire a lawyer to file the lawsuit for you, or you can do it yourself at your local courthouse. File the lawsuit as soon as possible after the breach.  States have varying statutes of limitations for how long after a breach a lawsuit can be filed, but waiting too long can prevent you from being able to take legal action against the breaching party. After a contract has been breached, the parties involved may want to consider using Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) as a tool to settle a contract dispute. With ADR, anyone involved in the contract often share the cost of hiring a neutral mediator. This person will assist all of you to work out a mutually agreeable outcome. The ADR process includes an evaluation by a neutral third-party who isn’t a lawyer. It also includes a negotiation and mediation.  Arbitration is another form of ADR. It allows you to take care of the problem without going to court. Arbitration is a good idea in complex cases or when damages are difficult to calculate.","output":"The article discusses breach of contract, which occurs when a party fails to uphold their contractual obligations, and explains the potential consequences, options for the non-breaching party, and steps to take in such cases. This includes seeking full recovery of materials, mitigating damages by finding replacement goods or services, considering the option of breaching a contract oneself after consulting an attorney, filing a lawsuit for damages, and exploring alternative dispute resolution methods like mediation and arbitration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: How long were each of the touchdowns longer than 50 yards?","output":"Title: Unraveling the Details: Touchdowns Longer Than 50 Yards Introduction American football is a sport filled with action-packed plays and jaw-dropping moments. One of the most exhilarating events in a football game is the touchdown scored from breaking away for a long run, particularly those covering more than 50 yards. In this article, we delve into the details of such touchdowns that occurred during a specific game, season, or time frame, assessing their length and examining the players responsible for these remarkable feats. Step 1: Gather and Organize Data Before diving into the analysis, it is crucial to collect a reliable dataset containing information on touchdowns longer than 50 yards. Data can be sourced from reputable sports websites, official league statistics, or football publications. Once the data is gathered, it should be organized in a clear and systematic manner, indicating the player who scored, the distance covered, as well as the game, season, or time frame in which it took place. Step 2: Calculate the Length With the data now in hand, the next step involves determining the precise length of each touchdown longer than 50 yards. To do this, subtract the starting yard line from the opponent's end zone (100 yards) and consider the additional yards made during the play. Here's an example: Player A scored a touchdown from their team's 30-yard line. The distance to the opponent's end zone would be 70 yards (100 - 30). If the player made a 55-yard run, the total length of the touchdown would be 75 yards (70 + 5). Step 3: Make Comparisons and Offer Insights Now that the lengths of each touchdown have been calculated, the next step is to compare them, highlighting those that stand out in terms of distance or frequency in the specified time frame. For example, if several touchdowns were 70 yards or longer, it would be worth noting this in the analysis. When examining individual players, it is essential to consider factors such as their position, team, and personal achievements, as these can add valuable context and insight into the incredible accomplishment of scoring a touchdown over 50 yards. Step 4: Presenting the Findings In presenting the results, lay out the key findings in a logical sequence, possibly beginning with a summary of the most significant results and then proceeding to offer supporting details. Make use of descriptive statistics and visual aids such as charts, graphs, and infographics to help readers grasp the data more effectively. Conclusion Scoring a touchdown covering more than 50 yards is an impressive accomplishment for any football player. Analyzing and understanding the lengths and fine details of these outstanding plays provides a greater appreciation for the athleticism, skill, and determination of the players involved. Through careful data collection, calculation, and analysis, we can not only answer the question of how long each touchdown longer than 50 yards was but also gain insight into the remarkable talent and prowess of the athletes responsible for them."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Information:  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - Arkansas is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Its name is of Siouan derivation from the language of the Osage denoting their related kin, the Quapaw Indians. The state's diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the Ozark and the Ouachita Mountains, which make up the U.S. Interior Highlands, to the densely forested land in the south known as the Arkansas Timberlands, to the eastern lowlands along the Mississippi River and the Arkansas Delta.  - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics.  - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel.  - A radio station is a set of equipment necessary to carry on communication via radio waves. Generally, it is a receiver or transmitter, an antenna, and some smaller additional equipment necessary to operate them. Radio stations play a vital role in communication technology as they are heavily relied on to transfer data and information across the world.  - Kentucky, officially the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a state located in the east south-central region of the United States. Kentucky is one of four U.S. states constituted as a commonwealth (the others being Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts). Originally a part of Virginia, in 1792 Kentucky became the 15th state to join the Union. Kentucky is the 37th most extensive and the 26th most populous of the 50 United States.  - Minnesota (locally ) is a state in the midwestern and northern regions of the United States. Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The state has a large number of lakes, and is known by the slogan \\"Land of 10,000 Lakes\\". Its official motto is \\"L'Étoile du Nord\\" (French: \\"Star of the North\\"). Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the MinneapolisSaint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \\"Twin Cities\\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the large majority of the European settlers emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany, and the state remains a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.  - Mississippi is a state in the southern region of the United States, with part of its southern border formed by the Gulf of Mexico. Its western border is formed by the Mississippi River.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - WPRE ( 980 AM ) is a radio station broadcasting a classic hits format to the Prairie du Chien , Wisconsin , USA area . WPRE began as a daytime only station , but now broadcasts at night with reduced power . The station is licensed to Robinson Corporation which is owned by David and Jane Robinson . WPRE has an FM sister station at 94.3 MHz. with the call letters WQPC ( formerly WPRE - FM ) . The transmitter and broadcast tower are located on the west side of Prairie du Chien next to the Mississippi River . According to the Antenna Structure Registration database , the tower is 74 m ( 243 ft ) tall . On August 30 , 2014 changed their format from oldies ( as \`\` Cruisin ' 980 '' ) to classic hits , branded as \`\` Prairie 's Own '' .  - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function.  - Prairie du Chien is a city in and the county seat of Crawford County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 5,911 at the 2010 census. Its Zip Code is 53821.  - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River.  - Oldies is a radio format that concentrates on rock and roll and pop music from the latter half of the 20th Century, specifically from around the mid 1950s to the 1970s or 1980s.  - Communication (from Latin \\"commnicre\\", meaning \\"to share\\") is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules.  - Wisconsin is a U.S. state located in the north-central United States, in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions. It is bordered by Minnesota to the west, Iowa to the southwest, Illinois to the south, Lake Michigan to the east, Michigan to the northeast, and Lake Superior to the north. Wisconsin is the 23rd largest state by total area and the 20th most populous. The state capital is Madison, and its largest city is Milwaukee, which is located on the western shore of Lake Michigan. The state is divided into 72 counties.  - A meander, in general, is a bend in a sinuous watercourse or river. A meander forms when moving water in a stream erodes the outer banks and widens its valley, and the inner part of the river has less energy and deposits silt. A stream of any volume may assume a \\"meandering\\" course, alternately eroding sediments from the outside of a bend and depositing them on the inside. The result is a \\"snaking\\" pattern as the stream meanders back and forth across its down-valley axis. When a meander gets cut off from the main stream, an oxbow lake forms. Over time meanders migrate downstream, sometimes in such a short time as to create civil engineering problems for local municipalities attempting to maintain stable roads and bridges.  - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light.

Leadbeater arrived around the same time as Fuller, and soon afterward he \\"discovered\\" the person he believed would become a global teacher and orator, Jiddu Krishnamurti (then in his teens). Leadbetter and others tutored Krishnamurti. Fuller may have taught him photography. She also had a small studio built in the grounds, and painted. Her works from the period include a portrait of Leadbeater and Portrait of the Lord Buddha. McFarlane emphasises the significance of the latter work, pointing out that it is \\"strikingly modern\\" in comparison to all of Fuller's other work, and more radical than compositions created by Grace Cossington Smith and Roland Wakelin, half a decade later. The painting owes much to theosophy's emphasis on seeing the subject \\"through a psychic, visionary experience\\". Sources describing Fuller's movements after her time in India sometimes are ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the suffragette protests associated with the coronation of George V. She continued to paint portraits, but found it difficult to realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India:I have painted a great many portraits since I have been in England, and have been, I suppose, fairly successful—though I have done nothing in any way remarkable. The hidden inner life has not yet succeeded in expressing itself on canvas, and I can only write myself as one who aspires to a greater art, but who has not yet achieved.  Guess a valid title for it!

The question is about waste material transported in the circulatory system and safely stored at high concentrations. 2. I know that proteins are essential nutrients for the body and play a significant role in building muscle and other tissues. They are unlikely to be the correct answer because they are not waste material. 3. Carbon is an essential element in organic compounds, but it is not a waste material. It is a part of various molecules and compounds required for life processes. Thus, carbon seems an unlikely answer. 4. Phosphorus is an essential element found in the form of phosphate ions in the body. It plays a role in several biological functions, including the formation of ATP (energy currency) and DNA. As an essential nutrient, phosphorus is not considered a waste material, making it an unlikely answer. 5. Urea is a waste product formed during the breakdown of proteins and amino acids. It gets transported in the circulatory system and can be stored safely at high concentrations. Urea is produced when the liver converts ammonia to urea which is then filtered and excreted via the kidneys in mammals. This makes urea the best choice for the answer.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the title of the one responsible for turning the girls of Norfolk into lesbian vampires? ?  Jimmy and Fletch are two friends living in London, experiencing life problems. Jimmy is dumped by his unscrupulous girlfriend, and Fletch is fired from his job as a clown for punching a child. They decide to escape their woes and hike to a remote village in Norfolk that they find on an old map. As they arrive at a pub in the village, with Jimmy upset about Fletch destroying his phone, they see a number of attractive foreign female history students leaving. Hoping to find more beautiful women inside, they are greeted by a morose crowd of men and approached by a seemingly crazed vicar who believes Jimmy is a long lost descendant of a local vampire slayer. As the barman offers the two men free ale as an apology for the vicar, they learn the students they saw earlier are going to a cottage, where they are to stay the night. Jimmy and Fletch pursue the students' van, catching up to it as the engine has broken down, and are introduced to four girls (Heidi, Lotte, Anke and Trudi). They are invited to join a party on the bus. The group arrives at their destination, only to learn that a curse rests over the village and that every female child turns into a lesbian vampire on her 18th birthday.

Context: As I mentioned in my previous post on Sacré-Coeur, one of the other places I didn’t get a chance to see when I was in Paris last summer was the catacombs so I wanted to be sure to fit in a visit this time around. Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€. It’s a nice cool 14°C (57°F) down there, a lovely break from the hot summer weather above. It is damp in places and the ground can be slippery so watch your step as you walk.

Bruce Humberstone and starring Vera Ellen, David Niven, and Cesar Romero. The film was made and first released in the UK, and distributed in the US by RKO Radio Pictures in 1952. Can we draw the following conclusion? Happy Go Lovely was released in the early 50s.","output":"Yes, we can certainly draw the conclusion that Happy Go Lovely was released in the early 50s. The film was created in 1951, which falls within the first half of the 1950s. Multiple aspects further substantiate this assertion. Firstly, the film was directed by H. Bruce Humberstone, a talented director who was mostly active during the 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s. His involvement in the film is consistent with the timeline placing it in the early 1950s. Secondly, the film features a notable cast of actors and actresses who were prominent during this time period. Vera Ellen, an accomplished actress and dancer, was popular in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Her starring role in this film reflects the era of production. Similarly, the careers of both David Niven and Cesar Romero were flourishing during the 1950s as well, suggesting that the film's production coincides with the peak years of their fame. Moreover, the musical comedy genre of the film is representative of the early 1950s. Films from this period were often characterized by their lightheartedness, colorful cinematography, and musical components. Technicolor technology, which allowed for vibrant color schemes, had become more widespread by this time and was utilized to enhance audience experiences. Additionally, the film's distribution by RKO Radio Pictures also signals its release during the early 1950s. RKO was a significant motion picture studio during the Golden Age of Hollywood and was particularly active until the mid-1950s when financial troubles led to its eventual decline. Happy Go Lovely's distribution by RKO is indicative of its production timeline within the early 50s. Lastly, the exchange between the UK and the US film industries during this period reflects the global popularity of American and British cinema. The fact that Happy Go Lovely was initially made and released in the UK and later brought to the US in 1952 by RKO Radio Pictures further cements its position within the early 1950s film landscape. Taking into account the film's production year of 1951, the key contributors to the film such as the director and leading actors, its genre and use of Technicolor technology, and distribution patterns, we can securely conclude that Happy Go Lovely was indeed released in the early 1950s."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gone are original members Frankie J and DJ Kane, both of whom have gone on to significant success as solo artists, as well as the group K1 (Kingz One), a collaboration of founding members of Kumbia Kings who have defected from the group for reason of \\"internal dissension\\". Quintanilla, Irvin \\"Pee Wee\\" Salinas, as well as Selena's widower Chris Pérez, also decided to leave the group due to that same \\"internal dissension\\". Martínez kept Los Kumbia Kings but changed the name to Los Super Reyes for legal issues.

Context: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me.

Question: when did they show cartoons in movie theaters I found the following answer on Google: A typical multiplex ( AMC Promenade 16 in Woodland Hills , Los Angeles , U.S. ) Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the answer provided is not correct. The information given about AMC Promenade 16 in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, U.S., is related to a modern multiplex cinema and not the history of cartoons being shown in movie theaters. Cartoons have a rich history in movie theaters, dating back to the early days of animated films in the early 20th century. The first animated cartoon, \\"Humorous Phases of Funny Faces\\" by James Stuart Blackton, was released in 1906. In the following years, several well-known animation studios and creators, like Winsor McCay, Walt Disney, and Max Fleischer, started producing animated films and cartoons.  The 1920s and 1930s, often referred to as the \\"Golden Age of Animation,\\" witnessed the rise and popularity of animated short films that were shown before feature films in movie theaters. During this time, famous characters such as Felix the Cat, Mickey Mouse, and Betty Boop were created and gained widespread popularity. In 1928, Walt Disney's \\"Steamboat Willie,\\" featuring Mickey Mouse, made its debut in theaters and was one of the first films with synchronized sound. This animation greatly contributed to the widespread showing of cartoons in theaters. As a part of the Golden Age, the 1940s and 1950s saw the rise of Warner Bros. animated characters, such as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and the introduction of the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies animated series. These cartoons continued to be shown as short films before the main feature, often providing comic relief and entertainment for audiences of all ages. Towards the end of the 20th century, especially with the rise of television, the trend of showing cartoons in movie theaters started to decline. However, with the modern advent of Pixar and CGI animation, theaters continue to showcase animated short films before the main feature. In conclusion, the history of showing cartoons in movie theaters began in the early 20th century and gained widespread popularity during the 1920s and 1930s, with the emergence of iconic animated characters and studios. Although the tradition of showing cartoons before feature films has diminished, the influence of animation on the film industry remains strong today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Why does the narrator feel the trip was a dud ?","output":"The narrator feels the trip was a dud because:  Step 1: Analyze the given information The narrator has been trying to go camping all summer long but has faced multiple issues like forgetting tents, threatening rain, and long work hours. They mention the weather didn't look promising but decided to believe the 20% chance of rain forecast. Step 2: Identify the main problem The main problem occurs when it started raining before they were even on their way to the camping site. Step 3: Determine the outcome of the problem As a consequence of the rain, the narrator's camping trip would have been affected negatively. Based on the given options, we need to choose the one that closely aligns with the situation and the feelings of the narrator. Option A: It got drenched Option B: None of the above choices Option C: It got cold Option D: It got snowed on Step 4: Choose the most appropriate option Option A, \\"It got drenched,\\" seems the most likely reason for the narrator's feelings as rain is an undesirable element for a camping trip. Getting drenched can lead to an uncomfortable experience and difficulty setting up the camp, making the trip a dud. Conclusion: The narrator feels the trip was a dud because it got drenched due to the unexpected rain."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We need to find the value for \\"u\\" and make the sentence true. We have this sentence: 63*u - 21*u - 252 = 0 First, we want to combine the parts with the \\"u\\" in them. 63*u means 63 times u, and 21*u means 21 times u. So, if we take 63 times u and subtract 21 times u, we get 42 times u. Now our sentence looks like this: 42*u - 252 = 0 Next, we want to get rid of that \\"- 252\\". To do that, we'll add 252 to both sides of the sentence. 42*u - 252 + 252 = 0 + 252 That gives us: 42*u = 252 We're almost there! Now we want to find out what number \\"u\\" is by getting rid of \\"42*\\" in \\"42*u\\". To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 42. 42*u / 42 = 252 / 42 That leaves us with: u = 6 And the answer is... u = 6!

The Attawapiskat First Nation in Ontario saw 28 suicide attempts in March and more than 100 since last September, Canadian media said, with one person reported to have died.      Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the news \\"heartbreaking\\".      Canada's 1.4 million indigenous people have high levels of poverty.      Their life expectancy is also below the Canadian average.      Bruce Shisheesh, the chief of the Attawapiskat First Nation community, said 11 people attempted to take their own lives on Saturday, prompting him to declare a state of emergency.      He tweeted that the regional Weeneebayko Health Authority was flying in a crisis team, mental health nurses and social workers, and that he was waiting for Ontario's minister of health to deliver more emergency workers to the area.      The First Nations government was sending a crisis response unit to the community following the declaration on Saturday, Canadian media said.

Another Canadian aboriginal community in the western province of Manitoba appealed for federal aid last month, citing six suicides in two months and 140 suicide attempts in two weeks.      Suicide and self-inflicted injuries are among the top causes of death for First Nations, Métis and Inuit people, according to studies from Health Canada.      National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations Perry Bellegarde called for a national strategy to combat indigenous suicide last month.      \\"Immediate support to communities is essential & a #FirstNations driven national strategy on mental health,\\" he tweeted on Monday.

SEAN KILPATRICK/THE CANADIAN PRESS      Where is Attawapiskat? The Attawapiskat First Nation is located at the mouth of the Attawapiskat River on James Bay in Northern Ontario and is home to about 2,000 people. It has been plagued by suicides for decades.      How did it start? The suicide epidemic in Attawapiskat started in the fall, when a number of people tried to kill themselves, said Jackie Hookimaw, a member of the community. She said the latest round of youth suicide attempts started with the death of her great-niece Sheridan, who took her life in October. She was 13 years old.      What is being done? Chief Bruce Shisheesh and council declared a state of emergency on Saturday. The designation has meant that a Nishnawbe Aski Nation crisis response unit is being sent to the community. The federal and Ontario health ministers said the Weeneebayko Area Health Authority hospital was immediately flying in a crisis team, including mental health nurses and social workers. Meanwhile, Perry Bellegarde, national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, said he has offered Chief Shisheesh his support and is pressing for long-term help for the community in addition to immediate action, adding that the crisis is a \\"national tragedy.\\"      Story continues below advertisement      The news from Attawapiskat is heartbreaking. We'll continue to work to improve living conditions for all Indigenous peoples. — Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) April 10, 2016      The crisis in context      1. Suicide is not just an Attawapiskat problem      Previous studies have suggested suicide and self-inflicted injuries are among the leading causes of death among First Nations, Métis and Inuit people. Waves of suicides like the one in Attawapiskat are not new, but several others in recent months have gained renewed attention – such as a string of deaths in northern Manitoba's Pimicikamak Cree Nation, also known as Cross Lake, which has also declared a state of emergency.      A grave site for Finola Muswaggon, who died at Cross Lake in March, 2016. She was 14. ANN MARY FOR THE GLOBE AND MAIL      Mr. Bellegarde said last month that there should be a national strategy to combat indigenous suicide. \\"Our young people need hope and inspiration,\\" Mr. Bellegarde said. \\"They don't see that right now. We've got to make those key strategic interventions now. It's a life-and-death situation.\\"      2. Suicide is not just an on-reserve problem      The renewed attention on suicide crises on reserve had led some critics to propose urban resettlement as a solution. Indigenous suicide problems do not disappear in cities, however. A Statistics Canada report released in January found that more than one in five off-reserve First Nations, Métis and Inuit adults reported having suicidal thoughts at some point in their lives.      Problems with suicide on reserve can be more acute, though, due to challenges of distance and availability of mental-health services. Charlie Angus, the MP for the Attawapiskat area and NDP indigenous affairs critic, said northern communities aren't given the resources to deal with complicated grief. \\"When a young person tries to commit suicide in any suburban school, they send in the resources, they send in the emergency team. There's a standard protocol for response. The northern communities are left on their own,\\" he said. \\"We don't have the mental health service dollars. We don't have the resources.\\"      3. Indigenous suicide is not just a mental-health problem      Conditions on reserves lag behind those in the rest of Canada in more respects than just suicide and health: Unemployment, lack of access to education and substandard infrastructure are factors too. Attawapiskat declared a state of emergency five years ago over a housing crisis that James Anaya, then UN Special Rapporteur on indigenous peoples, said \\"seems to represent the condition of many First Nation communities living on reserves throughout Canada, which is allegedly akin to Third World conditions.\\"      Studies have pointed to economic hardships and the legacy of colonialism as key factors in high indigenous suicide rates. The January Statscan study, for instance – which reviewed findings from the 2012 Aboriginal Peoples Survey and the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey – found a strong connection between residential-school experience and suicidal thoughts. Doing more to prevent suicide was one of the recommendations of last June's report by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on residential schools.      Federal Health Minister Jane Philpott said in a statement regarding the Attawapiskat suicide crisis that improving the wellness of indigenous peoples will require a focus on improving the socioeconomic conditions they face. \\"I have worked with the province to set up a joint action table so that federal and provincial governments can work together, hand-in-hand with First Nations leadership, to find concrete solutions,\\" Ms. Philpott said.

Attawapiskat is more than just a community with problems      During some of Attawapiskat's previous moments in the national spotlight – the housing crisis, former chief Theresa Spence's contentious role in the Idle No More movement – Attawapiskat residents have sometimes criticized outside observers for only paying attention during times of crisis.      Residents tried to challenge that narrative in 2014 with a 1,000-kilometre trek to Ottawa to urge politicians and First Nations chiefs to renew discussion of treaty rights.

The suicide epidemic in Attawapiskat started in the fall, when a number of people tried to kill themselves, said Jackie Hookimaw, a resident of First Nation on James Bay.      Hookimaw’s great niece Sheridan took her own life in October. She was 13 years old. Hookimaw said Sheridan had a big heart, but she was plagued with multiple health conditions and was bullied at school.      More recently, Hookimaw said, she was at the community’s hospital where she saw a number of teenage girls being treated after purposely overdosing on drugs. As she was leaving, a man came in for treatment. Later, she would learn that he, too, had tried to take his own life.      There’s different layers of grief      The Attawapiskat First Nation, which has been plagued by suicides for decades, is home to about 2,000 people, and Hookimaw said the community needs more resources.      She said the latest round of youth suicide attempts started with Sheridan’s death.      Sheridan’s peers were grieving, Hookimaw said. They didn’t have the support they needed to manage their grief, so they tried to end their lives, she said.      “There’s different layers of grief,” she said. “There’s normal grief, when somebody dies from illness or old age. And there’s complicated grief, where there’s severe trauma, like when somebody commits suicide.”      Charlie Angus, the MP for the area and NDP indigenous affairs critic, said northern communities aren’t given the resources to deal with complicated grief.      “When a young person tries to commit suicide in any suburban school, they send in the resources, they send in the emergency team. There’s a standard protocol for response. The northern communities are left on their own,” he said. “We don’t have the mental health service dollars. We don’t have the resources.”      He said it’s been a “rolling nightmare” of more and more suicide attempts among young people throughout the winter.      They didn’t think it could get any worse than it was in March, he said. But April brought even more attempts.      We don’t have the mental health service dollars. We don’t have the resources      On Saturday alone, 11 people tried to commit suicide, Chief Bruce Shisheesh told the CBC.      It’s that situation that led the Attawapiskat chief and council to declare a state of emergency on Saturday.      The designation has meant that a Nishnawabe Aski Nation crisis response unit is being sent to the community.      On Twitter, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the news from Attawapiskat “heartbreaking.”      “We’ll continue to work to improve living conditions for all indigenous peoples,” Trudeau tweeted.      The federal and Ontario health ministers said the Weeneebayko Area Health Authority hospital was immediately flying in a crisis team, including mental health nurses and social workers.      “We will be providing additional health-care experts as needed and we have contacted the ministry of children and youth services about providing emergency life-promotion supports,” Ontario Health Minister Eric Hoskins said in a release.      Federal Health Minister Jane Philpott said in a statement that improving the wellness of indigenous peoples will require a focus on improving the socio-economic conditions they face.      “I have worked with the province to set up a joint action table so that federal and provincial governments can work together, hand-in-hand with First Nations leadership, to find concrete solutions,” Philpott said.      Hoskins said Ontario has asked Ottawa to accelerate the work of the action table and will be identifying additional community programming that can help “give people hope in this terrible time.”      Angus said that the work of grief counselling often gets left to untrained community members who are dealing with their own grief.      “It’s the local cops, it’s the local teachers, it’s parents,” he said.      And now, Hookimaw said, some of the youth are taking healing into their own hands.      Youth from Attawapiskat and neighbouring communities held a healing walk last week to create awareness, she said.      “They said, ’We will not give up, because our youth are killing themselves … We will not be defeated.”’      Feel like you need help and want to speak with someone?

On Saturday night alone, 11 people attempted to take their own lives, Chief Bruce Shisheesh said.      Shisheesh and the council met Saturday night and unanimously voted to declare the state of emergency. That compels such agencies as the Weeneebayko Health Authority in Moose Factory, Ont., and Health Canada to bring in additional resources.      Including Saturday's spate of suicide attempts, a total of 101 people of all ages have tried to kill themselves since September, Shisheesh said, with one person dying. The youngest was 11, the oldest 71.      The Cree community — home to about 2,000 residents — saw 28 attempts in March alone.      Last September, a group of five girls overdosed and had to be medevaced out of the community, Shisheesh said.      I have relatives that have attempted to take their own lives ... cousins, friends. - Attawapiskat Chief Bruce Shisheesh      Four health-care workers without specialized mental health training are trying to keep up with the attempts and to avert future ones, he said.      \\"I'm asking friends, government, that we need help in our community,\\" Shisheesh said. \\"I have relatives that have attempted to take their own lives... cousins, friends.\\"      The council has hired security to keep an eye on patients currently in hospital. The Mushkegowuk Council, which represents eight northern Ontario First Nations, is also trying to help.      \\"These four workers, crisis workers, are burned out. They can't continue working daily because of the amount of suicides [that] have happened. They're backlogged,\\" said the council's Deputy Grand Chief Rebecca Friday.      \\"There are no services at the moment, no counsellors in the community.\\"      A few support workers have been brought in by the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, an association of northern Ontario First Nations, she said, but that's not enough to stem the number of attempted suicides.      Government response      The federal and Ontario health ministers announced support for Attawapiskat on Sunday evening, saying that the Weeneebayko Area Health Authority hospital was immediately flying in a crisis team, including mental-health nurses and social workers.      Ontario also said it would deploy its Health Ministry's Emergency Medical Assistance Team to \\"get to work immediately\\" as well as to \\"determine what further supports are needed for the medium term.\\"      \\"Hearing about the loss of life to suicide and the feelings of despair felt by the community of Attawapiskat reminds us of how important it is to work with First Nations and indigenous peoples across the country to address the very real challenges facing their communities,\\" federal Health Minister Jane Philpott said in a statement.

Triggers include overcrowding, abuse      As for the triggers, there are many, Shisheesh said. Overcrowding with 14 to 15 people living in one home is difficult, he said. Bullying at school is another trigger. Emotional damage caused by abuse during enrolment at residential schools is having a ripple effect through the generations, he said.      (Erik White/CBC )      Drug abuse is another factor, Shisheesh said. People try to numb themselves after physical and sexual abuse.      \\"We have people that are on prescriptions. We have people that are selling pills. And I believe that's how some of them have withdrawals and they feel unwanted, or they don't know how to express their feelings and they have to use a drug to drown their problems or their pains,\\" Shisheesh said.      \\"And when you don't have money to buy drugs, that's when they turn to suicide.\\"      As for the near-daily attempts in March, Shisheesh said he had no explanation.

Angelina Jolie said: 'It is a loss impossible to describe' Zamperini competed in the 5,000 meters in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. In WWII, he was on an Air Forces bomber that crashed into the ocean and spent 47 days adrfit on a raft before being captured by the Japanese. He was a POW for 2 years and tortured before his release. His story was turned into a best-selling book and Jolie's movie about his life, 'Unbroken', is due out in December. Article:","output":"Title: Remembering Louis Zamperini: A Life of Resilience and Triumph On the 2nd of July 2014, the world mourned the loss of an extraordinary man, Louis Zamperini, who passed away at his home surrounded by loved ones. The Olympic athlete, distinguished war hero, and inspiration behind the best-selling book and movie \\"Unbroken\\" had been battling pneumonia for over a month. In an announcement from Universal Pictures, it was noted that the loss has been, in the words of Angelina Jolie, \\"impossible to describe.\\" Today, seven years since his passing, let us celebrate the remarkable journey and legacy Zamperini left behind. Born on January 26, 1917, in Olean, New York, to Italian immigrants, Louis Zamperini's early years were filled with challenges. As a young boy, he often found himself in trouble with the law, but through the insistence and guidance of his older brother Pete, he found solace in competitive running. This led to a prosperous athletic career, with Zamperini setting high school records in track and ultimately competing in the 1936 Berlin Olympics at the age of 19. It was here that he participated in the 5,000 meters race, coming in 8th overall, but nonetheless leaving a profound impression with his swift finish. Little did he know that his resilience and vigor would save his life just a few years later on another battlefield. In 1941, with the outbreak of World War II, Zamperini enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces, leaving behind a promising athletic career. Trained as a bombardier, he found himself aboard a B-24 Liberator bomber, which tragically crashed into the Pacific Ocean during a search and rescue mission in May 1943. Of the 11 crew members, only Zamperini and two others survived the crash.  What ensued was a harrowing 47-day test of survival, resilience, and unbeatable will. Adrift on a life raft with no food or water, Zamperini and his fellow survivors battled the scorching sun, hunger, thirst, and circling sharks, as well as enduring a strafing attack by a Japanese aircraft. Despite the unfathomable odds against them, the men held on, driven by a deep faith in themselves and each other. On the 47th day, their strife took a sudden twist as they were captured by the Japanese navy. Zamperini's incredible story, however, did not end there. For the next two years, he would face unimaginable torture, starvation, and humiliation as a prisoner of war in various Japanese camps. Despite the relentless brutality of his captors, he continued to exhibit an unshakable spirit, ultimately leading to his liberation in 1945, as the war came to an end. Upon returning to the United States, the once-renowned athlete faced a new challenge - adjusting to life after the horrors he had experienced. Haunted by the physical and emotional scars of his ordeals, Zamperini struggled with alcoholism and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), threatening to destroy his marriage and family life. However, by evolving the same resilience that saw him through the darkest hours, he found solace and redemption in the Christian faith, which would shape the rest of his life. The inspirational story of Louis Zamperini came to broader public attention in the form of a best-selling book by Laura Hillenbrand titled \\"Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption\\", published in 2010. Four years later, Angelina Jolie directed and produced the adapted movie \\"Unbroken\\", which immortalized his tale and is set to release in December 2014. The film captures the extraordinary life and strength of a man who overcame insurmountable challenges, teaching us the true power of the human spirit. As we remember Louis Zamperini, we cannot help but marvel at the life of a man, who through adversity and triumph, leaves behind a legacy of courage, resilience, and unbreakable spirit.

Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said Wednesday that U.S. intelligence officials should be questioned over their handling of \\"Curveball,\\" an Iraqi defector whose now discredited claims on weapons of mass destruction helped fuel the Bush administration's drive to war in 2003. It has become clear over the years that \\"the source called Curveball was totally unreliable,\\" Powell said in a statement to CNN. \\"The question should be put to the CIA and the DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) as to why this wasn't known before the false information was put into (a key intelligence estimate) sent to Congress, the president's State of the Union address and my February 5 presentation to the U.N.\\" Powell, in an address to members of the United Nations Security Council in February 2003, said the U.S. government had \\"first-hand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels.\\" \\"The source was an eyewitness, an Iraqi chemical engineer who supervised one of these facilities,\\" Powell said at the time. \\"He actually was present during biological agent production runs. He was also at the site when an accident occurred in 1998. Twelve technicians died.\\" Two months later, the invasion of Iraq began. No biological weapons, no germ labs, and no weapons of mass destruction were found. The defector, Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi, has admitted in an interview with Britain's Guardian newspaper that he lied to help bring down Saddam Hussein's regime. \\"I had the chance to fabricate something, to topple the regime,\\" he said. \\"I did this, and I am satisfied, because there is no dictator in Iraq anymore.\\" When Alwan spoke to CNN in 2008, he said, \\"I never told anyone Saddam Hussein was producing weapons of mass destruction.\\" At the time, intelligence sources told CNN that Alwan had claimed that Iraq had a secret bioweapons program. But now, Alwan admits that after he was granted asylum in Germany in 2000, he used his training as a chemical engineer to concoct for his debriefers a story of Iraqi WMD production. Although the CIA was not given a chance to interview Alwan directly, and German officials had questioned some aspects of Alwan's story, his assertions were included in the material provided to Powell for his U.N. presentation. Tyler Drumheller, who was the CIA's chief of European operations at the time, agrees that the \\"Curveball\\" information was not well-enough vetted. He says he had reservations at the time about relying on it, but that when he asked for direct CIA access to Alwan through the German intelligence service, he was rebuffed. A representative of Germany's intelligence service declined to comment. Drumheller claims top Bush administration officials were too willing to believe Alwan's story \\"because that was the only piece of intelligence they had that really fit what the administration was looking at.\\" Former President George W. Bush declined through a spokesman to comment. Representatives for former Vice President Dick Cheney, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and the DIA did not reply to CNN's inquiries. Former CIA director George Tenet, who was Drumheller's boss, wrote in his memoirs that \\"perhaps some people's recollections of 'if only someone had listened to me' have become sharper than reality.\\" Without naming names, Tenet said that \\"concerns about Curveball did not get disseminated far and wide through the agency as they should have been.\\" Former Homeland Security adviser Frances Townsend says that the U.S. government should seek Alwan's extradition and prosecution, for \\"intentionally lying and deceiving the U.S. government.\\" \\"It absolutely makes my blood boil,\\" she told CNN. Not all observers are accepting Alwan's claim that his goal in spinning his WMD tale was to free the people of Iraq from Hussein. \\"He told the story because he wanted to get out of a refugee camp in Germany,\\" said Bob Drogin, author of a book about the episode. \\"He wanted to get his wife out and bring her to Germany, he wanted to get citizenship, and he wanted a Mercedes Benz. And he got all of those things.\\" But in his interview with the Guardian, Alwan said he had already won asylum before he spoke to German intelligence about weapons programs in Iraq, and that telling them his story did not win him a life of ease. Alwan insisted he is proud of the role he played in the toppling of Hussein. In the video of the interview posted online, he said that if he had it all to do over again, he would say the same thing \\"because I wouldn't want that regime to continue in our country.\\" CNN's Frederik Pleitgen and Pam Benson contributed to this report.

Powell stated that the CIA and the DIA should have known the source was unreliable before including it in the intelligence reports sent to Congress, the President's State of the Union address, and his U.N. presentation.    2.

Although Alwan claimed never to have said that Iraq was producing WMDs, his fabricated story about secret bioweapons programs made its way into key presentations and influenced the administration's decisions. 4. There are concerns that some officials in the Bush administration believed Alwan's story because it confirmed their existing suspicions about Iraq's WMD capabilities. Some experts and analysts, like Tyler Drumheller and Bob Drogin, argue that Alwan made up the story to obtain asylum in Germany, and not solely to bring down the Hussein regime.  5.

Carpenter spent several years singing in Washington, D.C. clubs before signing in the late 1980s with Columbia Records, who marketed her as a country singer. Carpenter's first album, 1987's Hometown Girl, did not produce any singles, although 1989's State of the Heart and 1990's Shooting Straight in the Dark each produced four Top 20 hits on the Billboard country singles charts. Carpenter's most successful album to date remains 1992's Context: Carpenter's first album, \\"Hometown Girl\\" was produced by John Jennings and was released in 1987. Though songs from Hometown Girl got play on public and college radio stations, it was not until Columbia began promoting Carpenter as a \\"country\\" artist that she found a wider audience. For a long time, Carpenter was ambivalent about this pigeonholing, saying she preferred the term \\"singer-songwriter\\" or \\"slash rocker\\" (as in country/folk/rock). She told Rolling Stone in 1991, \\"I've never approached music from a categorization process, so to be a casualty of it is real disconcerting to me\\".  Some music critics argue that Carpenter's style covers a range of influences even broader than those from \\"country\\" and \\"folk\\". Time critic Richard Corliss described the songs in her album A Place in the World as \\"reminiscent of early Beatles or rollicking Motown\\", and one reviewer of Time* Sex* Love* noted the \\"wash of Beach Boys-style harmonies ... backwards guitar loops\\" and use of a sitar on one track, all elements not commonly found on a country or folk album.  After 1989's State of the Heart, Carpenter released Shooting Straight in the Dark in 1990, which yielded her biggest single up to that point, the Grammy Award-winning \\"Down at the Twist and Shout\\". Two years later, Carpenter released the album that, to date, has been her biggest popular success, Come On Come On (1992). The album went quadruple platinum, remaining on the Country Top 100 list for more than 97 weeks, and eventually spawned seven charting singles. Come On Come On was also critically acclaimed; The New York Times's Karen Schoemer wrote that Carpenter had \\"risen through the country ranks without flash or bravado: no big hair, sequined gowns, teary performances.... Enriched with Ms. Carpenter's subtlety, Come On Come On grows stronger and prettier with every listen.\\"  The songs of Come On Come On had the qualities that would come to identify her work: humorous, fast-paced country-rock songs with themes of perseverance, desire, and independence, alternating with slow, introspective ballads that speak to social or relational issues. \\"Passionate Kisses\\", a cover of fellow singer-songwriter Lucinda Williams's 1988 song, was the album's third single. Carpenter's version peaked on the U.S. Country chart at No. 4, and was the first of Carpenter's songs to cross over to mainstream pop and adult contemporary charts, charting at No. 57 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at No. 11 on Adult Contemporary.  The sixth single on Come On Come On, \\"He Thinks He'll Keep Her\\", was Carpenter's biggest hit off the album, charting at No. 2 on Billboard's Country chart and at No. 1 on Radio & Records's Country chart. Written by Carpenter and Don Schlitz, the fast-paced song follows a 36-year-old homemaker who leaves her husband, and was inspired by a 1970s series of Geritol commercials in which a man boasts of his wife's seemingly limitless energy and her many accomplishments, then concludes by saying, \\"My wife ... I think I'll keep her.\\" Carpenter said, \\"That line has always stuck with me. It's just such a joke.\\" The single received a Grammy nomination for Record of the Year.

Answer:","output":"Martin Freeman played Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit film trilogy, and Ian Holm portrayed the character in The Lord of the Rings film series directed by Peter Jackson. Martin Freeman, born on September 8, 1971, is an English actor known for his roles in several television shows, movies, and theater productions. He gained widespread recognition for his portrayal of Tim Canterbury in the UK version of the television series \\"The Office\\". He has also starred in the TV series \\"Sherlock\\" as Dr. John Watson, opposite Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes. Freeman has demonstrated his acting versatility in films like \\"Love Actually\\", \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\", and \\"Black Panther\\". In The Hobbit film trilogy, directed by Peter Jackson and based on the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien, Freeman played the role of young Bilbo Baggins. The trilogy consists of \\"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\\" (2012), \\"The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug\\" (2013), and \\"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\\" (2014). As the main protagonist, Bilbo Baggins is the protagonist embarks on a journey filled with adventure, courage, and self-discovery. On the other hand, Ian Holm, born on September 12, 1931, and passed away on June 19, 2020, was a renowned British actor with a long and illustrious career in film, television, and theater. He is known for his roles in films like \\"Chariots of Fire\\", \\"Alien\\", and \\"The Fifth Element\\". Holm's vast experience and acting prowess made him the perfect choice to play the older Bilbo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings film series, also directed by Peter Jackson and adapted from J.R.R. Tolkien's epic novels. In \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\\" (2001), \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" (2002), and \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\\" (2003), Holm's portrayal of Bilbo Baggins is critical to the audience's understanding of the character both in his interactions with Frodo Baggins (played by Elijah Wood) and Gandalf the Grey (played by Sir Ian McKellen). Additionally, Ian Holm made a brief appearance as the older Bilbo Baggins in two of the films in The Hobbit trilogy, reconnecting the character to the earlier adventures. In conclusion, two talented actors, Martin Freeman and Ian Holm, portrayed Bilbo Baggins in Peter Jackson's adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's iconic stories. Freeman masterfully captured the essence of a younger Bilbo in The Hobbit trilogy, while Holm's portrayal of an older Bilbo in The Lord of the Rings series brought depth and a sense of history to the character."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The bike slows down in the mud puddle because there is (A) less friction. (B) more friction Answer:","output":"The answer your students should choose is (B) more friction. To explain this in detail, we need to understand the concept of friction and how it influences a bike's movement through different types of puddles. Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion of two surfaces that are in contact with each other. In the context of this test, riding a bike through the puddles involves the interaction between the bike's tires and the surface they are riding over, be it a rain puddle or a mud puddle. When Avery rides his bike through a rain puddle, the interaction between the tires and the wet surface is relatively smoother, resulting in less resistance from friction. The reduced friction occurring due to the water enables the bike to move more easily and therefore, speeds up. On the other hand, when he rides his bike through a mud puddle, the interaction between the bike's tires and the more viscous and irregular surface of the mud creates higher friction. Mud, being thicker than water, causes an increase in resistance, which opposes the motion of the bike and slows it down. In summary, the bike moves slowly through the mud puddle because there is more friction, whereas it speeds up in the rain puddle due to less friction. Therefore, the answer to the logic test is (B) more friction."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all-talk, no-action politicians.\\" He said Mexico must have been talking disparagingly about him and using the pope as a \\"pawn\\" because \\"they want to continue to rip off the United States, both on trade and at the border, and they understand I am totally wise to them.\\" He also responded at a South Carolina rally, and made sure to note that \\"I like the pope.\\" In other news, during his news conference on the papal jet, Pope Francis also appeared to suggest Catholic women could use contraception if there is a concern of contracting the Zika virus, CNN reports. But abortion is still totally off the table in such a case, he said. Article:","output":"The Latest Trump Tussle: Pope Francis on Trump's Christianity In a world where controversies make headlines, one name stands out - Donald Trump. The potential Republican nominee for the President of the United States has taken on numerous influential people and organizations over the past months. The back-and-forth exchanges between Trump and his rivals seem to be a never-ending parade of accusations, rebuttals, and goading. This time, it’s Pope Francis who has taken on the media mogul turned political powerhouse. On Thursday, while returning from his six-day visit to Mexico, Pope Francis was asked about Trump. Offering his thoughts on Trump's Christianity, he stated, \\"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,” the New York Times reported. This comment nodding at Trump's highly debated border-wall proposal, which involves the construction of a wall between Mexico and the U.S., with Mexico footing the bill. Despite providing criticism, Pope Francis did not explicitly encourage or discourage the American public from voting for Trump. He went on to say, \\"I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that [about the wall]. We must see if he said things in that way and in this I give the benefit of the doubt.\\" As expected from Trump's modus operandi, he did not stay silent for long. He fired back at the Pope's comments through Politico saying, \\"For a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful. I am proud to be a Christian, and as president, I will not allow Christianity to be consistently attacked and weakened.\\" Furthermore, Trump boldly challenged the Pope by saying that if ISIS ever attacked the Vatican, Pope Francis would wish he had been president because it would not have taken place, insinuating that Trump's handling of ISIS would be more effective than the current administration's strategies. Trump continued his rebuttal by suggesting that Mexico must have spoken disparagingly about him and roped Pope Francis into the conversation in an attempt to manipulate him as a \\"pawn.\\" Trump accused Mexico, saying \\"they want to continue to rip off the United States, both on trade and at the border, and they understand I am totally wise to them.\\" Remaining true to form, Trump took advantage of the opportunity to address the matter publicly at a rally in South Carolina, where he reiterated his views and managed to slip in that \\"I like the Pope.\\" Simultaneously, in his news conference on the papal jet, Pope Francis offered his opinion on the use of contraception in relation to the Zika virus. The Pope clarified that Catholic women could use contraception to avoid complications due to the virus. However, he stood firm on the Church's outspoken stance against abortion, insisting that it remains completely off the table in such cases. In the midst of a heated political climate, this exchange between two influential figures on opposing ends of the spectrum raises questions, generates debates, and adds yet another headline-grabbing controversy to Trump's portfolio. How this impacts Trump's campaign remains to be seen, as well as whether or not he will continue confronting religious institutions in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:You are given a new situation: While drinking coffee John added some sugar and cream in his coffee. He started to ponder how solutes dissolve in a solvent. To that end, he added solutes in a solvent in six different conditions, case A, case B, case C, case D, case E, and case F. In case A he stirred the solution, but in case B he didn't stir the the solution. In case C he heat the solution up, but in case D he cooled the solution down. In case E he used finely ground solute, but in case F he used cubes of solute.  and a hint : When you add sugar to a cold drink, you may stir it to help the sugar dissolve. If you don’t stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. That’s because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs  Please answer this question : In which case the solute would have larger surface area, case E or case F? A:","output":"In case E, the solute would have a larger surface area. This is because the solute is finely ground, which increases its overall surface area that comes into contact with the solvent. Case F uses cubes of solute, which have a smaller surface area in comparison to the finely ground solute in case E. Greater surface area allows for faster dissolution as more solute particles are exposed to the solvent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Process:  - An owl leaves his nest - The owl flys out into the night - The owl looks down at the ground - The owls keen eyesight allows him to see in the dark - The owls sensitive hearing allows him to locate hidden prey - The owl swoops down - The owl catches a mouse in his talons.  suppose there are more predators happens, how will it affect the owls will have less to eat.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation in this scenario is indirectly impacting a step of the process. When more predators are introduced into the owl's environment, it results in increased competition for the same resources, specifically prey like mice. This increased competition means that there are fewer available prey for the owls, and as a result, the owls will have less to eat. This perturbation is indirect because it does not directly influence any specific step in the process of the owl catching a mouse. Instead, it affects the overall availability of prey in the owl's environment. The process itself - the owl leaving its nest, flying out into the night, locating its prey, swooping down, and catching a mouse in its talons - remains the same. However, the chances of the owl successfully finding and catching a mouse are reduced due to the presence of more predators competing for the same food sources. The net effect of this indirect perturbation is that the owls may need to expend more energy and time to find and catch prey, which could impact their overall health and ability to reproduce. Ultimately, this could lead to changes in the owl population if the increased competition for resources persists over time and affects the survival and reproductive success of the owls."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Într-adevăr, discutăm în prezent despre modul în care putem interveni pentru a ajuta mai multe țări din Uniunea Europeană care se află în dificultate. Translate to English","output":"Indeed, we are currently discussing how we can intervene to help more countries in the European Union that are facing difficulties. As we know, the European Union (EU) consists of 27 member countries with diverse cultures, economic development levels, and challenges. In recent years, several EU countries have experienced economic and social difficulties, such as high unemployment rates, political instability, and migration crises. To intervene and help these struggling EU countries, several possible measures can be taken, including: 1. Financial aid: The EU could provide financial assistance to countries in need by increasing their budget allocations or granting them low-interest loans. This would help in enhancing infrastructure, creating jobs, and strengthening the overall economy of the recipient countries. 2. Structural reforms: Encouraging and assisting countries to implement structural reforms can significantly help in tackling economic problems. This may include labor market reforms to reduce unemployment, education and training programs to enhance workers' skills, and improvements in the regulatory framework for businesses to promote growth and competitiveness. 3. Social policies: The EU can also support social policies aimed at reducing poverty, inequality, and social exclusion in countries facing difficulties. This may involve funding health, education, and social protection programs to improve citizens' well-being and quality of life. 4. Investment incentives: Promoting and incentivizing investments in struggling countries, both by EU institutions and the private sector, can help boost economic development and growth. This can be achieved through measures such as tax breaks, streamlined regulations, and financial support for innovation and startups. 5. Migration management: Addressing migration-related issues, such as facilitating the integration of refugees and asylum seekers, can help alleviate social and economic pressures on some EU countries. Moreover, promoting fair burden-sharing among all member states and supporting border control measures can further assist in managing migration crises. 6. Strengthening the Eurozone: Ensuring the stability and resilience of the Eurozone is crucial for the economic well-being of all EU countries, particularly those facing difficulties. This can be attained through proper fiscal discipline, economic governance reforms, and coordinated monetary policies. 7. Political dialogue and cooperation: Enhancing political dialogue and cooperation among EU countries can help identify common challenges and develop joint strategies to address them. This includes fostering trust and solidarity between member states, sharing best practices and experiences, and adopting a more cohesive and unified approach in addressing various problems. Overall, the European Union must carefully assess the unique challenges faced by each of its struggling member countries and tailor its intervention measures accordingly. By providing appropriate support, the EU can help these countries overcome their difficulties, promote social and economic cohesion, and strengthen the European project as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options are:  a). no.  b). yes.","output":"To get an internship at Google, you should follow a series of steps to increase your chances of being considered. Here is a detailed guide to help you through that process: 1. Research available internships: Begin by visiting the Google Careers website (https://careers.google.com) to learn more about the various Google internships. These internships can be in areas such as software engineering, data science, product management, and more. Be sure to identify the internships that match your skills, interests, and field of study. 2. Prepare a strong resume: Your resume is the first impression that Google will have of you as a candidate, so it's essential to make it stand out. Highlight your academic achievements, relevant work experience, and projects. Focus on showcasing your skills in programming languages, tools, and technologies that Google values, such as Python, Java, C++, and TensorFlow. 3. Leverage your networks: Google employees can refer candidates for internships. If you have contacts or alumni connections working at Google, don't hesitate to reach out to them and ask for advice, mentorship, or even a referral. 4. Participate in coding competitions and hackathons: Google often organizes or sponsors coding competitions and hackathons, like Google Code Jam or Google Summer of Code. Participating in such events can increase your visibility to Google recruiters, showcase your coding and problem-solving skills, and improve your chances of getting noticed. 5. Prepare for interviews: Google's interview process usually includes phone interviews, coding/technical assessments, and sometimes a final onsite interview. Get comfortable with data structures, algorithms, coding problems, and system design concepts through practice and self-study programs like LeetCode and HackerRank. 6. Apply online: When you feel prepared, submit your application through the Google Careers website. Be sure to tailor your resume and cover letter to the specific internship you're applying for and emphasize your alignment with Google's mission and values. Monitor the status of your application through Google's career portal and be prepared for follow-up interviews if you are selected. 7. Engage in relevant extracurricular activities: Leading clubs or organizations related to your field, conducting research, or participating in open-source projects are great ways to stand out from the competition. Google values candidates who are passionate about the field and can prove that they have the skills, leadership, and experience necessary for the role. 8. Maintain a strong online presence: Google recruiters may review your GitHub, LinkedIn, or personal websites, so make sure your online presence showcases your skills and projects. An active GitHub account with well-documented projects or contributions to open-source software can serve as evidence of your coding abilities and commitment to industry standards. 9. Be persistent and adaptable: Google receives a high volume of applicants for internships, and the process can be competitive. Don't be discouraged if you don't get selected the first time you apply; continue improving your skills, stay engaged with Google events, and apply for other relevant opportunities. Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Options are:  a). no.  b). yes. Answer: b). yes.

Given the context: What will Lee want to do next?  Possible answers: clean up the mess, make a lot of food for lunch, make a romantic gesture","output":"Based on the context, it is likely that the next thing Lee will want to do is clean up the mess. This is the most probable next step because they've just finished cooking a large breakfast and usually, after preparing and having a meal, it's necessary to clean up the kitchen and dining area in order to maintain cleanliness and hygiene. This will involve washing the dishes, utensils, and pans used for cooking pancakes and bacon; cleaning the countertop, stove, and other areas where food might have splattered; and throwing away any scraps or empty packaging. Cleaning up promptly after a meal also prevents attracting pests like ants or cockroaches. The idea of making a lot of food for lunch would be a less likely follow-up activity because they've just finished a large breakfast. It would be too soon to immediately start preparing another huge meal, especially if there are still leftovers from breakfast. Most importantly, they would not want to keep their kitchen messy until lunch if they plan to use it again for cooking. As for making a romantic gesture, while it is possible considering that they made a breakfast surprise for their significant other, it's not the most likely next step immediately after finishing breakfast. There's no explicit clue in the context suggestive of an immediately following romantic gesture. However, this could still happen later in the day, perhaps after cleaning up or relaxing for a bit, especially if the breakfast surprise was part of a larger plan for a romantic day or occasion. They might want to present a bouquet of flowers, plan a surprise outing, or perhaps prepare a movie night at home.  Finally, remember that Lee’s actions will depend on their personal habits, the dynamics in their relationship with their significant other, and how they generally allocate their time but based on the content given and under usual circumstances, cleaning up the mess from a large, surprise breakfast would be the most probable next step."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The traffic was moving at 5 mph on the freeway where it usually requires at least 60 mph. The road is very slippery. Sometimes the car is out of control, slipping to the other side. I finally managed to drive to the Issaquah. However, I still got stuck in the traffic on an uphill way to my home. Why I lived in the house on the top of the hill? I had no choice but left my car in the road. Fortunately, there was a nice guy coming to help me drive the car to the parking lot so that I would not get a ticket from the policeman.

It leans towards being negative, as it portrays the subject as not being an optional preference. 2. \\"as visually bland as a dentist 's waiting room\\": Comparing the subject to a dentist's waiting room suggests it is dull and uninteresting.

Remember the question has to be about both objects which are related but different; for example, \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". This task typically involves replacing one word i.e., the 'trigger word' with its antonym (e.g., changing from \\"small\\" to \\"big\\"). You should not change any content in the given question beyond a word or two, i.e., the trigger word/phrase. The expected answer to your question must not be associated with just the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in the question. The expected answer should not be ambiguous. For your question, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. In your generated question, retain the object names from the input question. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in generating your modified question e.g. this task can be always solved using a simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase the word diversity. Your question must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Your question must have at least 70% overlapping words with the given question. You must utilize the given context word while writing the question. Your question must contain only one blank. The two objects should be used ONCE in your question. Here is a list of attributes and associated contrastive words that may help write contrastive trigger words. Note that contrastive trigger words help in flipping the label. | Attribute | triggerword | contrastive triggerword |  | age | old | new |  | altitude | low | high | | area | small | vast |  | brightness | dark | light |  | clarity | obscure | clear |  | cleanness | dirty | clean |  | complexity | simple | complex |  | cost | cheap | expensive | | density | sparse | dense | | depth | shallow | deep | | distance | near | far |   | electric conductivity | low | high | | flexibility | rigid | flexible | | granularity | fine | coarse |  | hardness | soft | hard |  | length | short | long |  | magnitude | small | large |  | mass | small | large |  | odor | weak | strong |  | pressure | low | high |  | resistance | low | high |  | shape | round | sharp | | shape | flat | spiky | | size | small | large |  | sound | quiet | loud |  | sound pitch | low | high |  | speed | slow | fast |  | stability | unstable | stable |  | strength | weak | strong |  | temperature | low | high |  | texture | smooth | rough |  | thermal conductivity | low | high | | thickness | thin | thick |  | volume | small | large | | weight | light | heavy |  | width | narrow | wide |  | location | in | out | | location | up | down | | location | above | below | | location | on | off | | location | to | from | Problem:Context Word: sibling.

It is an action that could happen during lunch, but not because someone has a lot of food to eat. Option 3: feel empty Feeling empty is contrary to having plenty to eat. If someone has a lot of food during lunch, they should not feel empty because they are consuming a good amount of food. Option 4: get full When somebody consumes a lot during lunch, they will feel full because their stomach has enough food to satisfy their hunger. This option appropriately reflects the outcome of someone who has plenty to eat. Option 5: getting in line Getting in line is unrelated to having plenty to eat during lunch. It is an action that could happen during lunchtime, but it is not a result of consuming a substantial amount of food.

Q: The sudden burst of spring produce in the market after a long, monotonous winter of cavolo nero and bright oranges is one of the things that constantly reminds me why I love living and eating in Italy. A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it’s my first time walking through my local market. There are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany’s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily. Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren’t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto. And then there are thick bunches of agretti (salsola soda), looking more like mermaid’s hair than a monk’s beard, their English namesake. A few years ago, this wasn’t such a common sight at the market in Florence. It still isn’t, in that you won’t get them by the crateful like you do fava beans and artichokes, though they’re not particularly difficult to find now. They’re just one of those special things that don’t last long. Blink and you’ll miss them, or come late to the market and they could easily be sold out. It’s worth getting up and out of the house a little earlier for these (a note to myself, of course). If you’ve never tasted agretti before, it’s worth seeking out if you’re in the right place at the right time and find a bunch or see it on a menu. Frances Mayes likens it to spinach, but notes that it is so much more, “While agretti has the mineral sharpness of spinach, it tastes livelier, full of the energy...

A. underage  B. banned  C. adult  D. rules  E. black market  The best answer is A:","output":"The best answer is A. underage. In most cases, someone is not allowed to buy alcohol if they are underage. The legal drinking age varies from country to country, but it is generally considered to be somewhere between 18 and 21 years old. The primary goal of legal drinking age restrictions is to prevent alcohol-related problems such as binge drinking, underage driving under the influence, and alcohol dependency in young people. These age requirements apply not only when purchasing alcohol but also when consuming it in public places and private establishments, like bars and restaurants. Option B, \\"banned,\\" could also be a reason someone is not legally allowed to buy alcohol. However, this is a more specific and rare situation and typically applies to individuals who have been banned from a specific establishment or have had their license revoked due to previous legal issues involving alcohol. In this case, the reason for the ban would primarily be due to the person's previous actions and not their age, making option A still more fitting. Option C, \\"adult,\\" is not a reason for someone to be unable to buy alcohol legally. Being an adult typically signifies that a person has attained the required legal age to drink and purchase alcohol in most countries. Option D, \\"rules,\\" is quite vague and does not provide a concrete reason why someone might not be allowed to buy alcohol. While rules and regulations do play a part in determining the legal drinking age and other alcohol-related restrictions, this answer choice is not as accurate or specific as option A, \\"underage.\\" Option E, \\"black market,\\" refers to the illegal trade of goods and services, and it does not indicate why someone might not be allowed to buy alcohol legally. The black market could be a place where someone who is underage or banned might unlawfully acquire alcohol, but it does not provide a direct reason for their inability to purchase alcohol legally. In conclusion, the most relevant and accurate answer to the question is A. underage, as it directly addresses the primary reason someone may be unable to legally buy alcohol—that is, not having reached the required legal drinking age as established by the local laws."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the region that supports supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp industry? is inside the article: Three species of mangrove trees exist in the region: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a 59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a 22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry.  Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources..., can you guess it ?

When he took a ventilator off the tiny creature’s throat, the head began breathing spontaneously with its new body. An hour later, the body twitched, and, a few hours after that, the mouse opened its eyes, Dr. Ren recalls.      Since... ||||| Xiaoping Ren has performed over 1,000 head transplants on mice - and wants to move on to monkeys      Controversial Chinese surgeon Xiaoping Ren has made his name by transplanting mice heads onto different bodies.      The creatures don't live longer than a few minutes but Dr. Ren has been able to create Frankenstein-like mice with heads that are a different colour from their bodies.      Now he wants to begin chopping up monkeys in order to get closer to an actual human head transplant.      According to the WSJ, which shadowed the surgeon during a 10-hour transplant operation, he is “hoping to create the first head-transplanted primate that can live and breathe on its own, at least for a little while.”      Xiaoping Ren Xiaoping Ren has performed head transplants on over 1000 mice      Animal rights organisations have blasted the Chinese doctor and his methods.      \\"It is deeply disturbing that a researcher has been allowed to subject more than 1,000 mice to these cruel and medically absurd experiments,\\" a spokesperson for Animal Aid told Mirror Online.      \\"There is no way in which a surgical procedure that allows a mouse, or even a monkey, to survive for a few minutes is likely to translate into concrete benefits for human patients,\\" they said.      \\"Even if the surgery was developed so that mice or primates were kept alive for longer, fundamental differences between species mean there is no guarantee that humans would experience the same results.      \\"If individual people want to volunteer to participate in such research, then they are free to make an informed decision, but animals should not be forced to suffer in these pointless and macabre experiments.\\"      Experts meanwhile have likewise branded the work ridiculous - citing that human head transplants are controversial and a long way from being medically possible.      They could offer a new life for paralysed or quadriplegic patients, but the ethics of the procedure are incredibly complex.      Arthur Caplan, director of medical ethics at New York University’s Langone Medical Centre said the bodies of head transplant patients “would end up being overwhelmed with different pathways and chemistry than they are used to and they’d go crazy.”      He added: “It’s not like you can unscrew your head and put it on someone else.”      Dr Hunt Batjer, president elect of the American Association for Neurological Surgeons, added: “I would not wish this on anyone.      “I would not allow anyone to do it to me as there are a lot of things worse than death.” ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Chinese surgeon Xiaoping Ren has performed over 1,000 head transplants on mice and is now looking to proceed with monkeys to get closer to performing a human head transplant.

Malcolm once again becomes Sherry's grandmother, Big Momma, and also disguises Trent as an obese girl named \\"Charmaine\\", Big Momma's great-niece. Big Momma takes a job as a house mother at the Georgia Girls School for the Arts, while Charmaine is enrolled as a student. Surrounded by attractive young women, Trent nearly blows his cover, but manages to befriend a girl named Haley Robinson. The headmistress announces that a historic music box has been stolen from the library, and Malcolm deduces that this music box contains the flash drive. While scoping out the library, Big Momma encounters security guard Kurtis Kool, who attempts to woo her while giving a tour. Seeing a picture of Kurtis with Canetti, Malcolm realizes that he is the friend, and tries to find out more about the music box.","output":"The real name of the person that Kurtis Kool tries to woo is Malcolm Turner.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer this question: where do you go to get a patent??","output":"To get a patent, you must go through a multi-step process that involves research, application submission, and examination by a governmental patent office. Patents are territorial, meaning that you need to register your invention in each country where you want to secure protection for it. I'll explain the process to obtain a patent in the United States, followed by an overview of how to obtain international patents. 1. United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO): In the United States, the process of obtaining a patent is managed by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Here is a step-by-step guide for applying for a patent with the USPTO: A. Conduct a Prior Art Search: Before applying for a patent, you should conduct a thorough search for any existing patents, published patent applications, or other public disclosures that could be similar to your invention. The purpose of this search is to determine if your invention is new and non-obvious compared to existing technology. You can conduct a preliminary search through the USPTO's Patent Database (patft.uspto.gov), as well as other patent offices' databases, such as the European Patent Office and the Japan Patent Office. B. Determine Patent Eligibility: Evaluate whether your invention meets the patent eligibility requirements, which include being novel, non-obvious, and useful. It's important to note that not all inventions can be patented, such as abstract ideas, natural phenomena, and laws of nature. C. Prepare Your Patent Application: A patent application typically includes a specification, which is a detailed description of the invention that enables a person skilled in the field to reproduce the invention; claims, which define the scope of the invention; and drawings, if necessary, to illustrate the concept of the invention. D. File Your Patent Application: Submit your application to the USPTO along with the required filing fees. The USPTO offers two types of applications: a provisional application and a nonprovisional application. A provisional application provides an early filing date and can be less expensive than a nonprovisional application. However, it does not grant patent rights and expires after 12 months, requiring you to file a nonprovisional application to pursue patent protection. A nonprovisional application initiates the formal patent examination process. E. Examination Process: After the patent application is filed, it will be assigned to a patent examiner. The examiner will review the application to determine whether it meets all the legal requirements for patentability. There may be an exchange of correspondence between the applicant and the examiner during the examination process to address any issues that the examiner identifies. This back-and-forth communication is known as patent prosecution. F. Patent Grant: If the examiner concludes that your invention meets the patentability requirements, your patent will be granted. Once granted, the inventor has the exclusive right to make, use, sell, and import the invention in the United States for a specified duration (usually 20 years from the filing date for utility patents). 2. International Patents: If you wish to obtain patent protection in other countries, you can either file separate patent applications in each country or file an international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). The PCT is administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and allows you to file a single international application that can be pursued in up to 153 PCT contracting countries. A. PCT Application Process: The PCT application process typically comprises an international phase and a national phase. During the international phase, a single application is prepared and filed with a Receiving Office (RO), which then forwards the application to the International Searching Authority (ISA) to perform an international search. The ISA issues an international search report, which can help applicants evaluate the patentability of their inventions before entering the national phase in individual countries. B. National Phase: After the international phase, you must enter the national phase in each country where you want to seek protection. This involves filing national applications with each country's respective patent office, paying fees, and undergoing the individual examination processes according to each country's national patent laws. C. European Patent Application: If you want to obtain patent protection in multiple European countries, you can choose to submit a European patent application to the European Patent Office (EPO). After a successful examination and grant of a European patent, you must then validate the granted patent in each European country where you seek protection. In conclusion, the process of obtaining a patent involves conducting thorough research, determining eligibility, preparing and filing an application, and going through the examination process. The specific steps and requirements may vary depending on the country where you are applying for a patent."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Calling his former deputy a \\"liar with extremely bad character,\\" fallen high-flying politician Bo Xilai on Sunday rebutted the testimony of the prosecution's star witness as his increasingly dramatic trial stretched into a fourth day. The former Communist Party chief of the sprawling southwestern metropolis of Chongqing has denied abusing his power -- the third and final charge being heard in court in Jinan, eastern China, long after he was stripped of his posts and expelled from the party. Prosecutors accuse Bo of threatening and improperly firing his former police chief Wang Lijun after learning about a murder investigation involving Bo's wife Gu Kailai, who is currently serving a suspended death sentence for killing British businessman Neil Heywood. On Sunday, Bo insisted that Wang was lying throughout his court appearance, and said his words lacked any credibility or legal standing. Wang took the witness stand Saturday, providing the first opportunity for the two former allies to confront each other since Wang's attempted defection to the United States in early February 2012. Analysis: How, why Chinese politician veered off script. Wang told the court he fled to the U.S. consulate in Chengdu because he feared for his safety following a tense encounter in Bo's office, just one day after Wang told Bo about his wife's suspected involvement in murder. \\"He started verbally assaulting me... and about three minutes later, he walked around the left side of his desk and stood in front me. He suddenly attacked me with his fist, hitting on my left ear -- it was not just a slap,\\" Wang recalled, according to a court transcript. On Sunday, Bo said: \\"He said I didn't just slap him but punched him. I never practiced martial arts -- I don't possess such striking power,\\" according to a transcript released by the Jinan Intermediate People's court. Bo added: \\"After being convicted for abuse of power and defection, he still argued that he didn't defect but engaged in diplomacy in accordance with regulations. \\"All this shows this man has extremely bad character and lies on the spot.\\" The trial was adjourned after the Sunday morning session and will resume Monday morning. During trial, Xilai keeps up his counterattack. The story behind the 'slap' On Saturday, Bo conceded he had made mistakes but denied he broke the law to protect his wife. \\"I have made mistakes. I feel regret and I'm willing to take responsibility,\\" Bo said. \\"But whether or not I've committed a crime is a different issue.\\" \\"I didn't bend the law to protect Gu Kailai,\\" he said. \\"I didn't force Wang Lijun out or force him to defect to the United States.\\" Bo did acknowledge slapping Wang in the face -- a key moment long considered a turning point in the two men's relationship -- during the office confrontation, claiming he believed Wang was trumping up charges against Gu and thus furious at his \\"double-faced\\" deputy who had faked his loyalty to the Bo family. According to a court transcript, Wang said it was more than a slap and that the blow had caused a \\"discharge\\" from his ear. \\"My body shook a little... and I found blood at the corner of my mouth and discharge in my ear,\\" he continued. \\"I wiped the blood off with a tissue, but when he heard me calmly tell him again that he had to face the reality, he threw a glass on the ground while saying 'I'll never accept it.'\\" Wang told prosecutors that Bo's physical violence against him as well as the disappearance of his aides and investigators led to his decision to seek refuge in the U.S. diplomatic mission in Chengdu. When Bo was allowed to question the witness, Wang revealed in an exchange that Gu had told him about her intention to kill a day before the murder. And when Bo asked Wang: \\"Did you think I was forcing you out in an attempt to cover up (my wife's murder) case?\\" Wang replied: \\"Yes.\\" The trial by social media. Embezzlement and corruption charges. Earlier Saturday, Bo kept up his vigorous defense against embezzlement charges and, as he did Friday on corruption charges, and dismissed testimony from his jailed wife as a desperate attempt to reduce her own sentencing. Gu was sentenced last August for killing Heywood in a Chongqing hotel room in November 2011. She gave her testimony to the court via video and said that Bo was well aware of multi-million dollar dealings to fund their and their younger son's jet-setting lifestyle. \\"I have feelings for Gu Kailai,\\" Bo said Saturday morning, after admitting to an extramarital affair. \\"She is a vulnerable woman... and who else could she turn in? That's why all accusations against me originated from her.\\" Prosecutors allege that Bo received five million renminbi (820,000) of public funds from a local urban planning official in Dalian, Liaoning Province, in the early 2000s when he was mayor and later the provincial governor. Bo slammed the allegations as \\"contradictory\\" and denied that he needed to take the money as his wife earned millions of dollars from her five law firms. Under the bribery indictment, prosecutors accuse Bo of using his political posts to secure influence for others. They say that between 2000 and 2012, Bo, Gu and their son, Bo Guagua, received about 22 million renminbi (3.6 million) in bribes from businessmen in Dalian. Bo Guagua hopes father can 'answer his critics' Bo's fall from grace. Bo is a princeling, a term that refers to the children of revolutionary veterans who boast of political connections and influence. His late father, Bo Yibo, was a revolutionary contemporary of Chairman Mao Zedong and the late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Over the past three decades, Bo rose to power as a city mayor, provincial governor, minister of commerce and member of the Politburo, the powerful policy-making body of the Communist Party. A charismatic and urbane politician, Bo -- with the help of Wang -- was credited with a spectacular, albeit brutal, crackdown on organized crime during his time as the top party official of Chongqing. Bo's glittering career, in which he drew admirers and detractors for his populist policies, fell apart last year amid a scandal involving murder, corruption and betrayal. Wang's attempted defection precipitated Bo's political demise. After Gu's sentencing last August, Wang was convicted of bending the law for selfish ends, defection, abuse of power and bribe-taking. He received a 15-year prison sentence. Bo's trial is seen as a potentially concluding chapter in the scandal. His high profile and connections among the nation's ruling elite have made his case -- with its tales of greed and wrongdoing by a top official and his family -- an extremely delicate matter for Chinese authorities. It's taken more than a year, during which time the Communist Party has undergone a major leadership change, to bring him to trial. Many observers had expected proceedings to stick closely to a pre-planned script, seeing the trial's outcome as the result of a political deal struck between Bo and China's top leaders. But as he often did in his political career, Bo has so far stolen the show, mounting a robust attack on the prosecution's case and ridiculing witness testimony. That has left China watchers trying to figure out how far he's veered off script. Journalists from the international news media haven't been allowed inside the courtroom. But the court's official microblog account has delivered updates on developments inside, attracting more than half a million followers on Weibo, China's Twitter-like service. CNN hasn't been able to verify how accurate and comprehensive the court's version of proceedings has been. But many observers have interpreted it as a reasonably close, albeit filtered, account. Timeline: Bo Xilai scandal. CNN's Jethro Mullen, David McKenzie and Jaime FlorCruz contributed to this report. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article is about a powerful politician in China named Bo Xilai who is having a big trial. He is being accused of abusing his power and not doing the right things while he was in charge of a big city. His wife, Gu Kailai, is already in trouble for killing a British businessman. Bo Xilai is saying that he didn't do anything wrong and that the people accusing him are not telling the truth. The trial is very dramatic and getting a lot of attention in China."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Title: Kissing Jessica Stein Movie plot: Twenty-eight-year-old Jessica Stein, a copyeditor living and working in New York City, is plagued by failed blind dates with men, and decides to answer a newspaper's personal advertisement containing a quote from Rilke that she had read and admired earlier. The advertisement has been placed by Helen Cooper, a thirtysomething bisexual art gallerist who is seeking a lesbian relationship to replace her unsatisfying and meaningless sex with men. Given some of the men Jessica is shown to be test-dating at the start of the film, it's no surprise she'd want to fan out her prospects a little. As nervous as Jessica is about dating Helen, she realizes after a surprise kiss that a different experience can be good. Through the early part of their relationship, Jessica finds in Helen everything she'd dreamed of finding in a man. They are compatible, they like many of the same things, and they are caring for one another. Even when Helen gets sickâwhich she says earlier in the film never happens to herâJessica is there to care for her. The only predicament for the relationship is Jessica's nervousness concerning same-sex intimacy. Over the early weeks of their relationship, she and Helen slowly work on building up her confidence in this area by gradually extended make-out sessions. Eventually, they graduate to full intimacy, which is initiated by Jessica during an over night stay at her parents' home in Scarsdale. In spite of Jessica's happiness with Helen, she keeps the relationship secret. Jessica's secrecy means that she has to endure scenes that would not happen had she been open about the two of them. One example occurs during a dinner to celebrate her brother's engagement. Her mother had invited an IBM executive in hopes of setting him up with Jessica. Helen and Jessica later get into a quarrel about Jessica's refusal to inform her family of their relationship, resulting in an apparent breakup.

Some people believe that they can't help putting on hold that if they stop exercising, their muscles will turn into fat. Here are some more myths: false ideas about being fat and doing weight as they get older, while others I'll never lose weightI come from a fat family Wrong! While we can't change the body type we are bom with, we can't blame our genes for making us fat. There's plenty of evidence that fatness runs in families, and the main reason is that they share the same habits of eating too much and exercising too little.

In fact, although fat people consume more energy than slim people,they also fail to realize how much they eat! Keeping a diary can help you work out your daily food intake more accurately. Exercise is boring Wrong! Anything will become boring if you do it repetitively. The key is to develop a balanced and varied program thafs fun as well as progressive. If you enjoy a Sunday walk,take a different route. If you do yoga,try a tai chi class. If you like swimming, set yourself a distance or time challenge. No pain, no gain Wrong!

Sentence from a movie review: a shallow rumination  Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"Based on the sentence from the movie review, which reads \\"a shallow rumination,\\" we can infer that the movie was seen negatively by the reviewer. The term \\"shallow\\" suggests that the movie lacked depth or substance, while \\"rumination\\" implies that it may have been an attempt at provoking deeper thought or reflection. Combining these two words, it is evident that the reviewer found the movie's attempt at exploring thought-provoking themes to be superficial and unimpressive. It is important to consider that a single sentence might not fully represent the reviewer’s overall opinion about the movie. A complete movie review usually contains an analysis of different aspects of the film, such as its plot, characters, cinematography, soundtrack, and more. So, while this sentence indicates a negative aspect of the movie, it is possible that the reviewer may have positive opinions about other elements of the film. These could include praising the performance of the actors, enjoying the visual aesthetics, or appreciating the film's attempt to tackle a specific issue, despite its failings in developing a deeper understanding of the subject. However, without further context or information about the movie or the rest of the review, it is difficult to ascertain the reviewer's complete stance on the film. In order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the reviewer's opinion, it would be beneficial to read the entire review, as this would provide additional insights on the movie from their perspective. In conclusion, based solely on the sentence \\"a shallow rumination,\\" it can be inferred that the movie was seen negatively by the reviewer in terms of its depth and substance. However, to gauge the reviewer's overall opinion about the film, it is important to consider the complete review and evaluate the critiques on other aspects of the movie as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: A mother has a rare brain disorder which she claims causes her to take off her clothes in public – and says the condition is 'ruining her life'. Leanne Lyon, 41, has a small non-cancerous tumour lodged in her brain which triggers up to five seizures a day, each lasting up to half an hour. She blacks out during the fits - which have a strange and embarrassing side-effect - they often cause her to strip down to her underwear. They also sometimes leave her incontinent, meaning she is at risk of wetting herself publicly. Mrs Lyon says while the condition may seem amusing to onlookers, it is highly debilitating as she cannot hold down a job and struggles to raise her two young children. Leanne Lyon, 41, has a small, non-cancerous tumour lodged in her brain which triggers up to five seizures a day. These episodes can cause her to strip off in public, she claims. Mrs Lyon has a hypothalamic hamartoma, which is thought to affect only one in a million people. She says the condition is 'ruining her life' as she hates having seizures in front of her children: Megan, 6 (left) and Kieran, 9 (right) and feels as though she can't always look after them properly. She relies on a carer to take her two children Kieran, nine, and Megan, six, to school and is heavily dependent on her husband David, 43, a shoe salesman. Mrs Lyon, of Northampton, said she doesn't strip every time she has a seizure, but it does happen around twice a month. She said: 'I have no idea what I'm doing during the fits - it's almost like I'm sleep-walking and it's led to some really embarrassing episodes. 'Once, I was shopping in Wilkinsons when I suffered a seizure and I began stripping in the aisles. When I came round, I was in nothing but my underwear.' She added: 'Because I black out during the seizures I can never remember what happened - I simply come round with no clothes on. 'I'm sure it might look funny to some strangers but the condition is ruining my life. 'The same thing happened at a taxi rank. 'It's mortifying and frankly I'm amazed nobody has called the police to report me for indecent exposure.' Mrs Lyon has had seizures since she was four years old. Medics were baffled by her condition until she was diagnosed with hypothalamic hamartoma at the age of 29. The condition is a small, non-cancerous brain tumour which causes seizures, blackouts and memory loss. It is thought to affect only one individual in every one million people. At 17, she had surgery to remove part of her brain and rid her of the tumour. But the procedure, a left temporal lobectomy, only made the condition worse. Now Mrs Lyon has five or more episodes a day. While some last for a few seconds, others can go on for half an hour. When she was 17, Mrs Lyons had a part of her brain removed in order to remove the tumour. But the procedure, a left temporal lobectomy, only made the condition worse. Hypothalamic hamartoma (HH) is a small, non-cancerous brain tumour which causes seizures, behavioural problems, blackouts and memory loss. The condition is thought to affect only one  in a million people. HH is often difficult to diagnose and even more difficult to treat. Some individuals can go years with very few symptoms, or ones that are so mild, they are often missed by both parents and medical professionals. However, for most people with HH, the most common symptoms are frequent daily 'gelastic' seizures (seizures which involve spontaneous laughing, giggling or smirking) or 'dacrystic' seizures (which involve crying or grunting). People with HH report behavioural difficulties, and some have been diagnosed with attention deficit behavior (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Asperger’s disorder, depression, paranoid disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Some  have significant difficulties controlling angry outbursts, aggressive tendencies and many have been described as having oppositional-defiant disorder. These angry outbursts are often referred to as hypothalamic rages. What makes the actions different from a genuine angry ouburst is that the person typically does not make eye contact or the eyes seem vacant, they initially may not be able to hear any commands and they often require time and space to calm down. Sometimes they have no memory of the rage once it is over. These symptoms often start early in life – for some, they become apparent shortly after birth, but are frequently misdiagnosed. They are most commonly treated by surgery or anti-epileptic medicine. Source: Hope for HH. Mrs Lyon said: 'It's terrifying - not to mention dangerous - living like this. 'Once, I got onto a bus during a blackout and when I came round I had no idea where I was. 'I also am often incontinent when I have my seizures, which is excruciating. I had to wear adult nappies for a while. 'I can't go out for a night out with friends because I'm terrified I might have an episode. 'It would be really embarrassing to have to go home early because I wet myself or started stripping at the bar.' Mrs Lyon also suffers from embarrassing episodes at home. She said: 'A few months ago I was folding my kids' washing when I had one of my episodes. 'I don't know what I did while I was having my fit but when I came around I had one leg in a pair of my eight-year-old daughter's knickers. 'I frequently walk from room to room in nothing but my underwear with no idea what's going on.' She added: 'My children are more like carers than carefree kids - they've had to grow up so quickly. 'When I start having a fit I usually start laughing. 'When my son sees me laughing he says \\"Mummy's having one of her turns,\\" and he records it on his phone so I can see what happened. 'It is horrible to watch, you can see I'm not quite right. 'I hate to think that my kids have to watch their mother having seizures multiple times a day. 'My devoted husband is incredibly understanding but my condition puts a constant strain on our marriage. 'To him, it must be like living with three children. 'I don't feel like a normal wife or mother. I need help with the school run because I can't be trusted with the kids alone.' Because of the debilitating condition, Mrs Lyon also struggles to hold down a job. The seizures often leave Mrs Lyon incontinent, and she says they are dangerous. Once she had a seizure and got onto a bus and when she 'woke up' she had no idea where she was. She is pictured undergoing tests in hospital with Vivian Gattoc, who founded the Hope for Hypothalamic Hamartoma charity. She says the condition means her children  are 'more like carers than carefree kids'. She said: 'I don't feel like a normal wife or mother. I need help with the school run because I can't be trusted with the kids alone.' She is pictured with daughter Megan, 6, (left) and son Kieran, 9, (right) For a brief period she was employed at a supermarket but left after one of her episodes. She said: 'I have no idea what happened but I could tell my colleagues were scared by me afterwards.' Mrs Lyon's rare condition can be treated using keyhole surgery to destroy the tumor. But the procedure is currently only available in the United States and costs £95,000. Mrs Lyon said: 'I'm desperate to find a way to beat this tumour. 'It would mean the world to me if I could just take my kids to the park without needing constant supervision. 'I'm trying to raise money for the expensive procedure in America – one day, I'll beat this and be seizure free.'

Question: For those of us who struggle with thoughts about our size and shape, sometimes we don’t like our bodies and our behaviour very much. It seems like an impossible task to transform our self loathing into self-love, but it is possible with these five simple steps. I started to write some examples of the self loathing dialogue I occasionally have in my head and I found I couldn’t do it. It felt as wrong as criticising my closest friend. I guess it goes to prove that the shift from loathing to love is not always huge and momentous, but subtle and gradual. When I look in the mirror and see a part of my body I don’t like, I run through these five steps in my head. This following example is the kind of internal conversation I might have about my belly. 1. POSITIVE INTENT (THE GIFT) Recognise the gift your body is giving you. My belly fat is protecting and cushioning my intestines and reproductive system. By having a higher body fat percentage my hormones are functioning as they should, enabling me to have a normal transition through perimenopause. I fit my skin and the wrinkly empty skin folds are gone. 2. FORGIVENESS Acknowledge the way you have treated your body in the past. I am sorry that I have been either starving you or stuffing you with toxic food and that I have accused you of betraying me. I now realise that my body is a reflection of my thoughts and beliefs so I was hating myself. Please forgive me for treating you so badly. 3. GRATITUDE Notice the miracles your body performs even though you have abused it. I am so thankful that even though I have treated you so badly you are still healthy and functioning. I am amazed at your ability to heal a lifetime of digestive and hormonal issues within a short amount of time. Thank you for your forgiveness and that’s it’s not too late to take great care of you.

Viva la revolución: Mexico City cyclists fight for the right to ride in safety Stand on Mexico City’s grand Paseo de la Reforma boulevard on a Sunday morning and you’ll hear gears whirring, bells ringing and the chatter of voices as 50,000 people cycle, scoot and skate along 35 miles of closed roads. Stop and listen on any other day of the week and all you’ll hear is the roar of 10 lanes of traffic. This sprawling megacity of 21 million is home to 5.5m cars, and that number is growing despite some of the worst traffic jams in the world. Residents spend an average of three hours a day commuting, and car speeds during rush hour have fallen to around 7.5mph (12km/h). Although air quality has improved markedly since the city was named the most polluted in the world in the 1980s, walking or cycling along one of its many multi-lane highways sometimes feels as if you are sucking directly on a car exhaust. For one day every week, though, people on bikes and on foot rule a decent stretch of road, for a few hours at least. The official Muévete en Bici (Move by Bike) event has been going since 2008 but was recently expanded to cover 35 miles (55km) of city streets. It’s not just for cyclists: many others jog with baby strollers, or enjoy free zumba classes, martial arts or Mexican wrestling displays. Some might dismiss the weekly car-free morning as a gimmick, but Reforma is also home to wide, protected cycle lanes along both sides, from the historic centre to the green oasis of Chapultepec park in the west. During rush hour these lanes see a constant stream of cyclists in work clothes, many of them using the Ecobici bike hire system – the fourth largest in the world after Huangzhou, Paris and London. It is used mainly by residents getting around the city, rather than by sightseeing tourists, and 37% of users are women. The city now has around 90 miles (150km) of dedicated bike lanes, and environment minister Tanya Müller last week announced two new protected cycle paths will be built along Revolución and Patriotismo avenues by February. A survey showed 4,000 cyclists a day already brave these high-speed, five-lane highways. Sitting in her modern office overlooking the Zócalo – the historic main square, ringed by a six-lane road – Müller says cycling plays a crucial role in her attempts to make the city more sustainable and helps to fight pollution, congestion and obesity. She has expanded the Ecobici network to more than 6,000 bikes at 444 stations, and users can now access the service using an integrated card that also covers the metro, bus rapid transport (BRT) and trolleybuses. In an effort to include the majority of residents who live on the outskirts of the city, the environment ministry has opened a 24-hour 400-space secure cycle parking facility at Pantitlán near the airport in the east, and another is being built in La Raza in the north. The idea is that people can cycle from home to the hub, take public transport into the centre and then use an Ecobici for the “last mile” to work. Another proposed cycle lane along División del Norte has been stalled for years after protests from the plumbing and building suppliers whose shops line the route who are worried it will damage trade. “The scheme is on hold but it will happen,” promises Müller. Trendy cycling cafes and shops are springing up in cooler parts of town like Condesa and Roma, where the pace of the city is slower and drivers are more used to seeing people on bikes, tending to give them more space. The last time an official survey into cycling was completed eight years ago it showed 1% of journeys across the metropolitan area were made by bike. Unofficial estimates now put that at around 2%. Bernardo Baranda of the ITDP, which works to help developing countries improve their transport systems, was one of a group of cyclists who helped start the grassroots Bicitekas organisation in the late 1990s after he returned from a period studying and working in the Netherlands. Inspired by the efforts of Bogotá mayor Enrique Peñalosa, in 1998 the collective started a weekly Paseo Nocturno, a Critical Mass-style ride where a group of cyclists meet up on a weeknight and take a four-hour trip around some of Mexico City’s busiest roads, staying safe through sheer force of numbers. It was revolutionary at the time but now the city hosts an official Paseo every Sunday and a government-organised night ride once a month on closed roads; last month’s for Day of the Dead attracted a record 95,000 cyclists. There are plenty of unofficial night rides, too, run by groups such as Mujeres en Bici and Paseo de Todos, as well as the original Bicitekas ride. A car can jump a red light in front of a police officer and he won’t do anything – the law is flexible in Mexico City Cycling activists galvanised around protests against the Segundo Piso in 2003 – a second tier to the city’s car-choked multi-lane Periférico ringroad – but it wasn’t until the arrival of Marcelo Ebrard as mayor that things began to change. His original 2007 target of 186 miles of cycle paths has still not been achieved, but he and environment minister Martha Delgado started the official Sunday rides, built the bike lane along Reforma and launched Ecobici. There is a feeling among activists that, while Müller and current mayor Miguel Ángel Mancera are working in the right direction, they are nowhere near as radical. Cycling with Baranda on some of the city’s protected cycle lanes it is soon clear that a bike is a quicker way to get around than a car, especially on journeys under three miles (5km). For the most part, concrete and heavy-duty plastic dividers keep the traffic at bay, although when they are replaced by reflectors in the road in the run-up to a junction some drivers simply swing into the bike lane. I soon learn to be incredibly cautious every time the bike lane passes a side road, as cars from behind will happily pull alongside and try to turn right across your path. Venture away from the cycle lanes and it quickly feels more aggressive. Baranda would like to say cycling here is safe, but last year suffered his first serious accident in two decades when he was overtaken by a truck and a ladder poking out of the side caught him on the back of the head. The driver didn’t stop and Baranda spent a month in a neck brace. He’s now back out on his bike. Around 1,200 people are killed on Mexico City’s roads every year. Of these 60% are pedestrians, but it is not clear how many are cyclists. A third of accidents involve speeding cars. Baranda would like to see more protected bike lanes but is hopeful a new traffic law, about to come into force, will make cycling safer. Speed limits are being cut to 30mph (50km/h) on main roads and 20mph (30km/h) on side streets, cyclists will be allowed to proceed through red lights if the way is clear, and the city government will put the needs of pedestrians first, followed by cyclists, then public transport, cargo and finally private cars and motorbikes. But the tougher traffic laws will only work if the police make them work. “You need consequences for bad driving,” says Baranda. “The police need to enforce the law.” That point is echoed by Agustín Martinez, the president of the Bicitekas collective. “Not everyone is studying traffic law like we are – drivers need to be educated and we need enforcement. A car can jump a red light right in front of a traffic police officer and he won’t do anything – the law is very flexible in Mexico City.” Related: Should cyclists be allowed to run red lights? I ask about a white ghost bike I spotted on the way to the Bicitekas HQ. One of the group explains how a young female cyclist was hit by a car and knocked unconscious. When she got up and her boyfriend started remonstrating with the driver, he drove off with the woman clinging to the bonnet, accelerating and swerving until she fell off. She died of her injuries in hospital. The driver was tracked down by police but, says the activist, was freed after a few well-placed bribes: “When he was caught he said, ‘I have money, I have power, nothing will happen’ – he was right.” Martinez is pleased with the new traffic law but disappointed with what he sees as the lack of recent progress. “We have a lot of friends in the city government now and we thought everything would change,” he says. “But it’s hard, their hands are tied. [The city government] is scared of the car lobby, they defend old ideas like cheap gasoline, they are scared of business and they don’t think about the people that live here. It’s all about money.” There’s no doubt that Mexico City is for the most part still a car-orientated city but it is also clear that cycling is in the ascendancy. “It used to be that people saw cycling here as something eccentric or crazy,” says Baranda. “People thought that if you cycled you must be a tree-hugger or not have enough money to get a car, but that’s changed now – now it’s trendy.” What is your experience of cycling in Mexico City, and how could it be improved?

An integrated card allows users access to the metro, bus rapid transport and trolleybuses as well as the cycle hire system. Further efforts to include residents living on the outskirts of the city include the opening of cycle parking facilities near the airport in the east and another in the north, which encourages people to cycle, take public transport and then use an Ecobici for the last mile of the journey to work. Despite efforts to improve the cycling experience in Mexico City, there are still issues with accidents and road safety. Approximately 1,200 people are killed on Mexico City’s roads every year, 60% of which are pedestrians, and a new traffic law is being implemented to address safety issues. The law includes lower speed limits, permission for cyclists to proceed through red lights if clear and a requirement for the city government to prioritize pedestrians, cyclists, public transport, cargo vehicles and finally private cars and motorbikes. Mexico City, despite its car-centric culture, seems to be embracing emerging cycling trends and the push for more sustainable and environmentally friendly transport solutions is slowly gaining traction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Passage:In the 1970s, the Skylab Space Station is launched, but apparently as a wet workshop design that is based on the Saturn IB S-IVB upper stage called Skylab A. The Saturn V that might have launched Skylab in our timeline instead launches Skylab B, a lunar orbit space station unofficially named \\"Moonlab\\", also a wet workshop based on the S-IVB. The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project is instead a series of visits by the Apollo Command/Service Module to Salyut space stations, and Soyuz missions to both Skylab and Moonlab. To facilitate the latter, the Soviets finally finish work on their N-1. The Skylab/Moonlab programs lead to improvements in the design of the Apollo Command/Service Module. A Block III CSM is produced using battery power in place of fuel cells, followed by the Block IV and V, which have a degree of reusability (modular construction and resistance to salt water corrosion).

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person whose abdication was demanded?, using the article: At the time of the transfer of power, the state of Jammu and Kashmir (widely called \\"Kashmir\\") was ruled by Maharaja Hari Singh, a Hindu, although the state itself had a Muslim majority. Hari Singh was equally hesitant about acceding to either India or Pakistan, as either would have provoked adverse reactions in parts of his kingdom. He signed a Standstill Agreement with Pakistan and proposed one with India as well, but announced that Kashmir intended to remain independent. However, his rule was opposed by Sheikh Abdullah, the popular leader of Kashmir's largest political party, the National Conference, who demanded his abdication.Pakistan, attempting to force the issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of Poonch by the Maharajah's forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest. Shortly thereafter, Pathan tribesmen from the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan crossed the border and entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards Srinagar. The Maharaja of Kashmir wrote to India, asking for military assistance. India required the signing of an Instrument of Accession and setting up an interim government headed by Sheikh Abdullah in return. The Maharaja complied, but Nehru declared that it would have to be confirmed by a plebiscite, although there was no legal requirement to seek such confirmation.Indian troops secured Jammu, Srinagar and the valley itself during the First Kashmir War, but the intense fighting flagged with the onset of winter, which made much of the state impassable. Prime Minister Nehru, recognising the degree of international attention brought to bear on the dispute, declared a ceasefire and sought UN arbitration, arguing that India would otherwise have to invade Pakistan itself, in view of its failure to stop the tribal incursions.

Owner James Crichton gave her one, though she says he also started yelling at her. \\"He called me and my children n------,\\" Ford tells the Washington Post. \\"He said I can go back to where I came from.\\" She called 911 and the responding officer spoke to Crichton, who, per the police report, \\"proudly admitted to calling Ford a n-----\\" and ranted about his other black customers. But since he hadn't committed a crime, there was nothing police could do. It ended up being Ford's own Facebook post that resulted in big consequences for Crichton. Her post about the incident went viral, and on Saturday, dozens of demonstrators gathered—initially, they planned to protest the store and call for a boycott, the Lake County News-Sun reports. Instead, the gathering was a celebration, because on Friday Dairy Queen announced it was shutting down the location and terminating Crichton's franchise rights.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Was Nick Hanauer’s TED Talk on Income Inequality Too Rich for Rich People? Multi-millionaire Nick Hanauer delivers a speech at TED Talks. Their slogan is “ideas worth spreading.” But the folks at TED – the Technology Entertainment and Design nonprofit behind the TED Talks, beloved by geeks and others interested in novel new ideas – evidently think that some ideas are better left unspread. At least when the ideas in question challenge the conventional wisdom that rich enterpreneurs are the number one job creators. This past March, millionaire tech investor and entrepreneur Nick Hanauer – one of the early backers of Amazon.com – gave a talk at a TED conference in which, among other things, suggested that middle-class consumers, not rich people, are the real job creators – and that because of this rich people should be paying more in taxes. Though the talk drew applause from conference attendees at the time, TED Talk curator Chris Anderson decided it wasn’t worth sharing with the wider world, and refused to post it on TED’s website. His explanation? The talk was “too political” to be posted during an election year, and that “a lot of business managers and entrepreneurs would feel insulted” by some of Hanauer’s arguments. This seems more than a tad disingenuous, since TED generally doesn’t shy away from controversial ideas, and is sometimes so “political” that it invites actual politicians to talk at its conferences. Naturally, the news that TED wouldn’t be posting this talk — and why — ignited a bit of a firestorm on the web after the National Journal reported it on Wednesday, inspiring posts on sites ranging from Geekwire to the International Business Times to the Daily Kos. Someone even set up a petition on Change.org to demand that TED post the talk. But there was really no need for any petition. This being the age of the Internet, Hanauer’s “banned” talk didn’t remain banned for long. The Atlantic published the entire text of the short talk, complete with slides, on its website, and Anderson himself relented, sort of, and posted the video of the talk — though on YouTube, not on the TED site, where it will no doubt get many times the numbers of views that it would have if it had simply been posted on the TED site in the first place, as Anderson himself acknowledges in a blog post explaining his side of the controversy. Watching the talk, the first thing one notices is just how un-incendiary it all is. Hanauer’s basic thesis – that economic growth is driven to a large extent by consumer demand – is familiar to everyone who’s ever taken Econ 101, or regularly watched business news. Here’s Hanauer’s basic thesis: I have started or helped start, dozens of businesses and initially hired lots of people. But if no one could have afforded to buy what we had to sell, my businesses would all have failed and all those jobs would have evaporated. That’s why I can say with confidence that rich people don’t create jobs, nor do businesses, large or small. What does lead to more employment is a “circle of life” like feedback loop between customers and businesses. And only consumers can set in motion this virtuous cycle of increasing demand and hiring. In this sense, an ordinary middle-class consumer is far more of a job creator than a capitalist like me. Indeed, as Hanauer goes on to point out, even when businesses do well, they try their best to not create new jobs – because more jobs means higher labor costs and lower profits. Anyone who’s ever run a business knows that hiring more people is a capitalist’s course of last resort, something we do only when increasing customer demand requires it. In this sense, calling ourselves job creators isn’t just inaccurate, it’s disingenuous. Again, this isn’t a shocking notion. It’s a central fact of the economy. Indeed, the refusal of profitable businesses to start hiring again in earnest is one of the reasons job creation has been so anemic over the past several years. Of course, Hanauer moves from these less-than-earthshattering theses to draw a conclusion that might offend some rich people and/or Republicans. [O]ur current policies are … upside down. When you have a tax system in which most of the exemptions and the lowest rates benefit the richest, all in the name of job creation, all that happens is that the rich get richer. Since 1980, the share of income for the richest Americans has more than tripled while effective tax rates have declined by close to 50%. If it were true that lower tax rates and more wealth for the wealthy would lead to more job creation, then today we would be drowning in jobs. And yet unemployment and under-employment is at record highs. Whatever your stand on the issue, this is certainly a topic worth debating. You would think that TED would want to be part of the conversation. What was this article about?","output":"This article talks about a TED Talk given by multi-millionaire Nick Hanauer where he discussed income inequality and his belief that middle-class consumers create jobs, not rich people. The TED Talk curator, Chris Anderson, decided not to post this talk on the TED website because he thought it was too political and might insult some people. However, there was a lot of debate on the internet about this decision, and eventually, the talk was published on The Atlantic website and on YouTube. While some people may not agree with Hanauer's opinions, the article suggests it's an important topic that should be discussed and debated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does the sentence \\"In other species, the male and female parts are morphologically separated, developing on different flowers.\\" answer the question \\"How are some male and female parts separated for some species?\\"","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"In other species, the male and female parts are morphologically separated, developing on different flowers.\\" does provide an answer to the question, \\"How are some male and female parts separated for some species?\\" though it may not be as comprehensive as it could be.  To provide a more detailed and long answer, let's start by understanding the concept of floral reproductive structures. Flowering plants, also known as angiosperms, manifest the reproductive structures within their flowers. The flower's purpose is to facilitate the sexual reproduction process through the fusion of sperm from pollen grains with ovules hosting egg cells. These plants exhibit a wide range of diversity in their morphology and arrangements of reproductive parts. In the given sentence, the male and female parts referred to are the stamens and the carpels respectively. Here, the terms \\"male\\" and \\"female\\" are used to describe the parts responsible for the production of male and female sex cells. The stamen, being the male reproductive organ, consists of an anther that produces and releases pollen, and the filament, which supports the anther. The carpellate structure, or carpel, represents the female reproductive organ of a flower. The carpel features the stigma, which captures pollen, the style, which guides the pollen to the ovary that hosts the ovules, where fertilization may occur. Many plant species feature male and female structures within the same flower, which is called a perfect or bisexual flower (monoecious). It is essential to note that each species comes with morphological adaptations to avoid self-pollination and promote genetic diversity. In contrast, some plants have distinct male and female reproductive structures on separate flowers, leading to separation of the sexes. This condition has two possibilities: 1. Dioecious plants: These are plants that bear separate male and female reproductive structures on individual plants. This means one plant exclusively carries male flowers, while the other plant features female flowers. Examples of such plants include hollies (Ilex spp.) and willows (Salix spp.), among others. 2. Monoecious plants with imperfect or unisexual flowers: In this type of plants, separate male and female flowers develop on the same plant. For instance, in corn (Zea mays), tassels that produce pollen appear at the top of the plant, while the silk, which accepts the pollen to reach ovules, grows in clusters along the stalk. Other examples of monoecious species include cucumbers, watermelons, and oaks. Returning to the context of the sentence provided, the separation of the male and female parts is described as morphologically separated, meaning that the distinction lies in the physical structures or the flowers themselves. This separation occurs as plants have evolved various mechanisms to maximize cross-pollination, reproduction success, and genetic diversity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

LaDainian Tomlinson made history by becoming the fastest running back to reach 100 career TDs by doing it in 89 games, eclipsing the mark set by Emmitt Smith and Jim Brown of 93 games. He also continued his march toward beating Shaun Alexander's single-season TD record by scoring 4 TDs to bring his total to 22, just 5 short of tying Alexander's mark. Philip Rivers had a good day as well, throwing 19 of 26 for 222&#160;yards and two TDs, although he did throw two picks including a 31-yard interception return for a TD by Denver cornerback Darrent Williams. The game started out with Tomlinson running it in from 3 yards out to make it 7-0 San Diego. Denver's Mike Bell ran for two TDs in during the 2nd quarter to make it a 14-7 Denver lead at halftime. After the break, Denver continued the scoring with an Jason Elam's 42-yd field goal and Williams INT return to make it a 24-7 lead for Denver. But just like last week against the Bengals, the Chargers wouldn't say die putting together two scoring drives including a 3-yard run by LT, his 100th TD, and a 51-yd pass to LT by Rivers to cut the lead to 24-21 at the end of the third quarter. Elam helped the Broncos' cause by hitting a 38-yd kick to extend the Broncos' lead to 27-21, but that only lasted until Rivers found Vincent Jackson open at the back of the end zone to put the Chargers up 28-27. On the ensuing Broncos drive, Drayton Florence then intercepted Jake Plummer's 4th and 4 pass to give the Bolts terrific field position that set up a 1-yard run by LT to make it 35-27; it was his 4th TD of the night and 102nd of his career. That left Denver 1:14 to try to tie the game. They started that drive from their 3 and made it all the way to the Chargers 32 in part to a personal foul on Chargers defensive end Igor Olshansky, who was ejected for punching Broncos center Tom Nalen. The Broncos' hopes for overtime ended when Plummer was sacked by Shaun Phillips and time ran out, giving San Diego their first win in Denver in 7 years as well as sole position of first place in the AFC West and improved their record to 8-2. How many yards per complete pass did Philip Rivers gain for this game?","output":"Philip Rivers completed 19 passes for a total of 222 yards. To find out how many yards per complete pass he gained, we can divide the total yards (222) by the number of passes he completed (19).  So, 222 yards ÷ 19 passes = 11.68 yards per complete pass.

However, slow cookers provide the perfect solution for those seeking a hands-off approach to cooking while still maintaining the comfort and warmth of a homemade dish. In this article, we'll walk you through a simple, yet scrumptious slow cooker recipe for beef and cheese pasta that the entire family will love. Gather Your Ingredients: To begin, let's take a look at the essential ingredients necessary for this mouthwatering meal. - 1 large onion, chopped - 1 lb ground beef - 1 (28 oz) can crushed tomatoes - 1 (15 oz) can tomato sauce - 1 tablespoon dried basil - 1 tablespoon dried oregano - 2 teaspoons garlic powder - Salt and pepper, to taste - 8 oz uncooked pasta (such as rotini, penne, or medium shells) - 1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese Now that we have everything we need, it's time to start cooking. Step 1: Cook the Onion and Ground Beef Begin by browning the ground beef in a large skillet over medium heat. Make sure to break up any large pieces of meat during the cooking process. Once the beef has reached a brown color, add the chopped onion to the skillet and continue cooking until the onion becomes tender and translucent. This step not only adds flavor to the meat but also ensures that the onion will be thoroughly cooked before adding it to the slow cooker. Step 2: Transfer to the Slow Cooker After the onion and ground beef are cooked, carefully transfer them to the slow cooker. Be sure to drain any excess grease before proceeding to the next step, as this will result in a lighter, healthier dish. Step 3: Add the Remaining Ingredients Next, add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, dried basil, dried oregano, garlic powder, and salt and pepper to taste. Feel free to adjust the seasoning according to your personal preferences. You may also wish to include additional vegetables such as mushrooms, bell peppers, or zucchini. Stir everything together until well combined.  Please note that the pasta and cheese should not be added at this point. They will be incorporated later on in the cooking process. Step 4: Cook on Low or High Cover the slow cooker and set it to cook on low for 5 to 8 hours or high for 3 to 4 hours. This flexibility allows you to tailor the cooking time based on your schedule, ensuring a warm and satisfying meal will be waiting for you and your family when you're ready to eat. Step 5: Add the Pasta and Cheese About 15 minutes before serving, add the uncooked pasta to the slow cooker. Stir the pasta into the sauce, making sure it is fully submerged. It's important to add the pasta near the end of the cooking time to prevent it from becoming overly soft and mushy. When you're just about ready to serve, stir in the 1 1/2 cups of shredded mozzarella cheese until it is thoroughly melted and incorporated into the sauce. This creamy addition takes the dish to new heights, providing a rich and indulgent texture that is hard to resist. Serving Suggestions: Serve this hearty beef and cheese pasta alongside a crisp green salad and warm garlic bread for a well-rounded and satisfying meal. This dish is perfect for family gatherings, potlucks, or as a weeknight dinner option. Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator and make for a deliciously comforting lunch the next day.  Conclusion: With the help of a trusty slow cooker, this beef and cheese pasta recipe offers a fuss-free solution to enjoying a delectable, homemade meal. Its savory flavors and satisfying texture make it an instant favorite among adults and children alike. By following the simple steps outlined above, you're sure to impress your friends and family with this comforting, crowd-pleasing dish."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This is because a healthy diet typically includes a balance of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, with a focus on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. These types of foods are easier for the liver to process than foods that are high in saturated fat, trans fats, or cholesterol. High-fat and high-sugar foods can overload the liver and lead to fat buildup, which can cause liver disease. Therefore, choosing to eat healthier foods can reduce the strain on the liver, leading to a reduced amount of fat that the liver needs to process.

In the late Cretaceous, approximately 100 million years ago and subsequent to the splitting off from Gondwana of conjoined Madagascar and India, the Indian Plate split from Madagascar. It began moving north, at about 20 centimetres (7.9 in) per year, and is believed to have begun colliding with Asia as early as 55 million years ago, in the Eocene epoch of the Cenozoic. However, some authors suggest that the collision between India and Eurasia occurred much later, around 35 million years ago. If the collision occurred between 55 and 50 Mya, the Indian Plate would have covered a distance of 3,000 to 2,000 kilometres (1,900 to 1,200 mi), moving faster than any other known plate. In 2012, paleomagnetic data from the Greater Himalaya was used to propose two collisions to reconcile the discrepancy between the amount of crustal shortening in the Himalaya (~1300 km) and the amount of convergence between India and Asia (~3600 km). These authors propose a continental fragment of northern Gondwana rifted from India, traveled northward, and initiated the \`\`soft collision'' between the Greater Himalaya and Asia at ~50 Ma. This was followed by the \`\`hard collision'' between India and Asia occurred at ~25 Ma. Subduction of the resulting ocean basin that formed between the Greater Himalayan fragment and India explains the apparent discrepancy between the crustal shortening estimates in the Himalaya and paleomagnetic data from India and Asia. What's the best answer to this question: did any subduction occur during the collision of india and asia? Available options: -- no -- yes...A:","output":"yes The collision of India and Asia involved subduction. When the Indian Plate moved towards Asia, it first had a \\"soft collision\\" with a fragment of northern Gondwana, and then a \\"hard collision\\" with Asia. During these collisions, the ocean basin between the Greater Himalayan fragment and India was formed, and its subduction helps explain the differences between crustal shortening estimates in the Himalayas and paleomagnetic data from India and Asia. So yes, subduction occurred during the collision of India and Asia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:This article: After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time.

After her vacation in Tahiti, instead of using moisturizer, Angela used butter to treat her dry skin because the","output":"local residents recommended it. According to them, this unconventional method has been passed down through generations and continues to be a trusted remedy. They believed that butter, particularly when used in its purest form, is incredibly moisturizing. Butter is rich in various essential nutrients, like vitamins A, E, and K. It also has a high-fat content which plays a vital role in hydrating the skin. The omega-3 fatty acids present in it were said to help in reducing inflammation and promote skin health. Angela was informed that the application of butter on the skin would lock in moisture, leaving her skin soft and smooth. It was supposedly more effective than commercial moisturizers which often contain chemicals that can potentially damage the skin.  The procedure was explained to Angela in detail. After bathing with warm water which opens the skin pores, she needed to gently pat her skin dry. A thin layer of butter was then applied to her skin while it was still slightly damp to help maximize absorption. After leaving it on for about half an hour, the butter was rinsed off with warm water, followed by a cold rinse to close the skin pores. Using a soft cloth, her skin was again gently patted dry. Residents of Tahiti also suggested using different types of butter, like shea or cocoa, which have beneficial properties specifically for the skin. Shea butter, for instance, has a high concentration of fatty acids and vitamins that can soften the skin. It also has anti-inflammatory and healing properties. Cocoa butter, on the other hand, is rich in natural plant compounds called phytochemicals that can improve blood flow to the skin and slow skin aging. Driven by curiosity and the will to try something unique and natural, Angela decided to give it a try. Surprisingly, after using butter, her skin felt deeply moisturized and regenerated, glowing with a new radiance.  Though it might seem bizarre to outsiders, this traditional beauty secret of Tahiti offers a unique perspective. It emphasizes the need for simplicity in skincare regimes by using naturally available ingredients. Angela’s experiment was a direct testament to how these natural materials, like butter, have the potential to replace chemically-infused commercial moisturizers, reinstating the power of nature for skincare.  Always remember though that everyone's skin is different. What may work for one person might not work for another. People should always do a patch test when trying a new skin treatment, natural or otherwise. If anyone suffers from specific skin conditions or concerns, they should consult with a dermatologist or a professional health care provider before trying out new treatments.  So yes, the sentence among other things might reflect how Angela after her vacation in Tahiti, incorporated the traditional wisdom of the locals in her skincare routine by using butter instead of a moisturizer to treat her dry skin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: From bankers to factory staff, employees in the West face a cold  _ of losing their jobs as a global recession  starts to bite. For colleagues in the East, the pain is more likely to come through a pay cut. Human resource experts say cultural differences explain why Asian companies try harder to preserve jobs in difficult times, which will prevent unemployment and may help Asian economies survive at a time of slowing exports. The East Asian attitude may also make it easier for companies to recover quickly from the economic downturn since they will not need to rehire or train new staff, but build up a more loyal and devoted group. \\"In the Confucian mindset, the right thing to do is to share the burden, which is the sense of collective  responsibility. While in the West, it's more about individual survival,\\" said Michael Benoliel, associate professor of organizational behavior at Singapore Management University (SMU). In contrast, local Western companies from General Motors to Goldman Sachs plan to lay off workers by the thousand, but at the Asian units of Western multinationals or western units of Asian groups, job cuts will probably be less severe. Japan's jobless rate was 4 percent in September, up from 3.8 percent in January, while Hong Kong's was flat at 3.4 percent. But US unemployment is expected to have jumped to 6.3 percent last month from below 5 percent in January. Experts say that while there are noticeable differences in labor practices in East and West, the gap will narrow as more firms become more multinational and competition forces firms to adopt the best practices of rivals from abroad. Question: In which company can we infer the job cuts will be probably the most severe? Options: A: A local American group. B: A small Japanese company. C: A German branch of a Korean multinational. D: A Hong Kong's unit of a French company. Answer:","output":"A: A local American group."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Befitting a lush, tropical island stranded in the middle of the ocean, Madeira’s origins are shrouded in mystery and fanciful legend. Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato’s lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan’s historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, “Island of Timber. ” The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo.  Question: \\"What was the name of the small volcanic archipelago that Zarco happened upon?\\" Response: \\"Zarco\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. The correct answer is \\"Madeira,\\" as the small volcanic archipelago that Zarco happened upon was named Madeira."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The heads of government were the shoguns. Each was a member of the Ashikaga clan.  - Biography. Yamana Szen was born to Yamana Tokihiro (13671435), head of the Yamana clan. Tokihiro was the \\"shugo\\" governor of Tajima, Bingo, Aki, and Iga provinces. Tokihiro, who was often in bad health, retired in 1433 and passed his numerous lands to Szen. Szen went on to defeat Akamatsu Mitsuhide (13731441) in the Kakitsu Incident, and became governor Harima Province the same year.  - The in the history of Japan was a family who controlled the hereditary title of \\"shikken\\" (regent) of the Kamakura shogunate between 1203 and 1333. Despite the title, in practice the family wielded actual governmental power during this period compared to both the Kamakura shoguns, or the Imperial Court in Kyoto, whose authority was largely symbolic. The Hj are known for fostering Zen Buddhism and for leading the successful opposition to the Mongol invasions of Japan. Resentment at Hj rule eventually culminated in the overthrow of the clan and the establishment of the Ashikaga shogunate.  - Moronao was an iconoclast with no intention of following tradition, particularly insofar as the Emperor was concerned. On the subject, he once said:  What is the use of a King? Why should he live in a Palace? And why should we bow to him? If for some reason a King is needed, let us have one made of wood or metal, and let all the live Kings be banished. The Taiheiki, an epic dedicated to the events of this period, describes the K brothers as avid villains. Moronao in particular is accused of violence, greed and lewdness. Because of this reputation, in the \\"bunraku\\" and \\"kabuki\\" play \\"Kanadehon Chshingura\\", which depicts the vendetta of the 47 Ronin, his name is used to represent Kira Yoshinaka.  - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest.   - On the August 16, 1443 (\\"Kakitsu 3, 21st day of the 7th month\\"), 10-year-old shogun Yoshikatsu died of injuries sustained in a fall from a horse. He had been shogun for only three years. Immediately, the \\"bakufu\\" elevated Yoshinari, the young shogun's even younger brother, to be the new shogun. Several years after becoming shogun, Yoshinari changed his name to Yoshimasa, by which name he is better known.  - A was the military dictator of Japan during the period from 1185 to 1868 (with exceptions). In most of this period, the shoguns were the \\"de facto\\" rulers of the country; although nominally they were appointed by the Emperor as a ceremonial formality. The Shogun held almost absolute power over territories through military means. Nevertheless, an unusual situation occurred in the Kamakura period (11991333) upon the death of the first shogun, whereby the Hj clan's hereditary titles of \\"shikken\\" (1199-1256) and \\"tokus\\" (12561333) monopolized the shogunate as dictatorial positions, collectively known as the . The shogun during this 134-year period met the same fate as the Emperor and was reduced to a figurehead until a coup in 1333, when the Shogun was restored to power in the name of the Emperor.  - During the Edo Period of Japanese history, the Ak Domain (fief) was part of Harima. The Forty-seven Ronin were samurai of the Ak han. Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries, a shipbuilder and major Boeing engine subcontractor gets its name from the province.  - Originally, from 1219 until 1333, the post was synonymous with the \\"Rokuhara Tandai\\", and was based in Kyoto.

His conflicts with his father - in - law , Yamana Szen , who resented the power Hosokawa had as Kanrei , were among those that ignited the nin War in 1467 . When the Shogun Ashikaga Yoshimasa had a son in 1464 , Yamana took this as an opportunity to oppose Hosokawa further , supporting the child as heir to the Shogunate . Hosokawa had always worked closely with the Shogun 's brother Ashikaga Yoshimi , and supported his claim to the shogunate . In 1467 , open war broke out in the capital of Kyoto , between Hosokawa and Yamana , who each commanded roughly 80,000 men . The Shogun declared that the first to make war in the capital would be branded a rebel , and so the two armies remained immobile for some time , but within a few months , the tensions had risen too far , and war simply could not be delayed any further . Hosokawa made the first obvious attack within the capital , attacking the mansion of a Yamana general by the name of Isshiki . Fighting erupted between the two camps , and over the course of the next few days , many were killed , and many buildings destroyed , either by the soldiers or by looters .

Yoshimi was the abbot of a Jdo monastery when he was first approached in 1464 by Hosokawa Katsumoto, who wished to support a bid for Yoshimi to become shogun. He originally sought to stick to his religious life, and had no desires to become shogun. However, by 1464, he was convinced to join his brother, the shogun, and assist him, putting himself into a position to be the next in the line of succession. The birth of the Shogun's son placed Yoshimi in an awkward situation, making his succession no longer definite, but he remained as Yoshimasa's Deputy.  - The was a Japanese samurai clan which was one of the most powerful of the Muromachi period (1336-1467); at its peak, members of the family held the position of Constable (\\"shugo\\") over eleven provinces.

Article: The bowl should be large enough for mixing and tossing the ingredients of the salad. Note that any kind of kale will do - some people prefer lacinato (\\"dino kale\\") or flat leaf kale due to the tendency of curly green kale to be sold a bit more mature and therefore tougher. It also has a grittier texture and relative lack of flavor.  Shred the kale leaves by hand or chop them up into small strips. For tougher, more mature kale, you may want to shred or chop into smaller pieces as this will help the dressing to soften the texture.  Put the chopped or shredded kale into the bowl. You might start by adding a few tablespoons so as not to \\"over-dress\\" the salad. Remember, it's easy to add more dressing, but it's impossible to remove it! Massage the dressing into the kale. The best way to do this is with your hands (or a friend's hands). Note that you should gently squeeze or squish the kale as you mix in the dressing, as this helps break down the cell walls of the leaves and allows the acid in the dressing to soften things up by breaking down cell walls and fibers.

If necessary, add more dressing and repeat the massaging and tasting process until you feel the flavors are balanced and delicious. Because kale leaves are so sturdy, they need a little time for the acid in your dressing (lemon juice or vinegar) to break down the leaves and make them softer.

Write a title for this article: Rays second baseman Will Rhymes collapses in the arms of first base coach George Hendrick after being hit by a pitch. TAMPA BAY RAYS 2, BOSTON RED SOX 1 ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. - A scary moment came about in Tampa Bay Wednesday, as second baseman Will Rhymes left the Rays' 2-1 win over Boston Wednesday night in the eighth inning after being hit by a pitch near his right elbow. While standing at first base he gestured that he wanted to come out of the game, took a couple of steps and collapsed into the arms of first base coach George Hendrick. Trainers worked on Rhymes in the coach's box before he was assisted to a utility cart and left the field. As for the game, Jeremy Hellickson pitched six solid innings, Luke Scott had a tiebreaking sacrifice fly, and the Tampa Bay Rays beat Boston 2-1, snapping the Red Sox's five-game winning streak. Hellickson (4-0) allowed one run and five hits en route to winning a career-best sixth consecutive decision, dating to Sept. 4. The right-hander struck out six and walked two. After Jake McGee and Joel Peralta both threw a scoreless inning, Fernando Rodney pitched the ninth for his 12th save. Clay Buchholz (4-2) gave up two runs and six hits over five-plus innings for Boston. Buchholz, who took a grounder off his leg during the sixth, had allowed four or more runs in all seven of his previous starts this season. Buchholz was relieved by Andrew Miller, then Matt Albers and then Franklin Morales, who ended up plunking Rhymes. Announcers speculated that Rhymes might have broken the arm on the pitch, leading to him passing out. However, Rays beat writer Marc Topkin, of the Tampa Bay Times, tweeted that Rhymes is OK: #Rays say x-rays negative on Rhymes, has a bruise, is considered day to day. Matt Joyce opened the sixth with an infield single that went off Buchholz's lower leg. He went to third on a single by Carlos Pena. Andrew Miller replaced Buchholz and gave up Scott's sacrifice fly that put Tampa Bay ahead 2-1. The Rays, winners of four straight, loaded the bases with two outs later in the sixth, but Miller struck out Elliot Johnson on a 3-2 pitch. Tampa Bay took a 1-0 lead in the second when Buchholz was called for a balk on a pickoff move to first with runners on the corners and two outs. Pena, who had a leadoff single, scored on the play. The Red Sox wound up with three balks overall. Daniel Nava's fourth-inning RBI single got Boston even at 1-all. Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine said left-hander Felix Doubront, who was hit on the ear by a ball during batting practice Tuesday, was cleared to make his start Thursday. Meanwhile, Boston left-hander Rich Hill left the field after being struck by a ball in batting practice before Wednesday night's game. The team said Hill is OK. Will Rhymes is worked on by trainers after passing out near first base. (Chris O'Meara/AP)","output":"\\"Will Rhymes' Frightening Collapse Mid-game Overshadows Tampa Bay Rays' Victory Over Boston Red Sox\\" The shocking event of second baseman Will Rhymes' sudden collapse on the field during Tampa Bay Rays' confronting the Boston Red Sox is documented in this article, with Rhymes being the central narrative while still offering detailed coverage of the game's unfolding and eventual results.    The event took place on Wednesday, witnessed in Tampa Bay, where Rhymes ironically led the Rays to a 2-1 victory over Boston, but not quite in the way anyone expected. Rhymes, after being hit by a pitch near his right elbow during his turn at the plate, signaled his inability to continue and took a few steps before falling unconscious into the arms of first base coach George Hendrick. Rhymes received immediate medical attention on-field before being carted off. This unsettling event happened during the eighth inning.  Despite the alarming incident, the Rays went on to triumph over the Boston Red Sox, putting a halt to their five-game winning streak. Jeremy Hellickson, the Rays' pitcher, performed outstandingly, giving off six solid innings, whilst Luke Scott contributed with a tiebreaking sacrifice fly. Hellickson's exceptional performance is further highlighted by this being his career-best sixth consecutive decision, his track record beginning September of the previous year.  Boston's Clay Buchholz didn't fare as well, permitting two runs and six hits over five-plus innings. Notably, Buchholz had to face a grounder that hit his leg in the sixth, proving this game was more challenging physically for the players than most others.  Franklin Morales, sent as relief to Buchholz, ended up being responsible for the pitch that hit Rhymes. While there was initial speculation by the announcers that Rhymes could have broken his arm, leading to the fainting spell, an update by Rays beat writer Marc Topkin cleared up concerns, confirming that Rhymes suffered a bruise at worst and that he is expected to be back in action soon.  The match's comprehensive coverage also includes mention of Matt Joyce’s sixth-inning infield hit off Buchholz's leg, which resulted in Joyce advancing to third because of a single by Carlos Pena. Other noteworthy incidents involve Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine's statements providing updates about Felix Doubront and Rich Hill who were hit during practice and their readiness to participate in the match.  While the Rays enjoyed their fourth consecutive victory even after Rhymes had to exit the field, the evident show-stealer was the triggering event of Rhymes' on-field collapse, a shocking and rare spectacle, leaving fans concerned for his wellbeing.  The provided photograph encapsulates the situation aptly, showing Rhymes being worked on by trainers after his collapse, adding a visual narrative to the dramatic incident."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which tetrapod would live shorter, tetA or tetB?  John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory.  Hint: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. The answer to this question is:","output":"Based on the information provided and following Aristotle's theory, tetA is heavier than tetB and has a longer gestation period. According to the theory, lifespan increases with body mass and gestation period. Therefore, tetA lives longer than tetB.  Since the question asks for the tetrapod that lives shorter, the answer is tetB."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the company that markets pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring?  People have used resources on and around the Mono–Inyo Craters for centuries. Mono Paiutes gathered obsidian from the Mono–Inyo Craters to make sharp tools and arrow points. Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with other Native American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites. Gold rush–related boomtowns sprang up near Mono Basin in the 19th century to exploit bonanzas. The largest of these, Bodie (north of Mono Lake), was founded in the late 1870s and grew large enough to need a tree mill, which was located at Mono Mills, immediately northeast of Mono Domes. Trees directly around the domes and on their slopes were felled to provide timber for the mill. As part of the California Water Wars, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power purchased large tracts of land in the 1930s within Mono Basin and Owens Valley in order to control water rights. Excavation of an 11.5-mile (18.5 km) water tunnel under the southern part of the Mono Craters dome complex started in 1934 and was completed in 1941. Tunnel workers had to deal with loose and often water-charged gravels, pockets of carbon dioxide gas and flooding. About one man was lost for each mile excavated. Water diverted from its natural outlet in Mono Lake passes through the tunnel on its way to the Los Angeles Aqueduct system. The United States Pumice Company, based in Chatsworth, California, has mined the area for pumice since 1941. The company markets the pumice in slabs for use in commercial scouring and in large irregular chunks sold as yard decoration.Apollo 16's John Young and Charlie Duke did some of their geologic training here in June 1971.  William R. Muehlberger was one of the geology instructors.Exploratory drilling for geothermal power occurred near the Mono Craters on the south shore of Mono Lake in 1971. The wells did not show promising results, so the effort was abandoned.

Can I use 110V 60 hz CFL with 220V 50 Hz? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? OPT: (1). no (2). yes","output":"When a 220V appliance is plugged into a 110V socket or vice versa, as well as when a 110V 60 Hz CFL is used with a 220V 50 Hz, there may be damage or performance issues in both cases. I'll explain each specific situation and then answer the final question. 1. 220V Appliance Plugged Into a 110V Socket: When a 220V appliance is plugged into a 110V socket, the electrical current in the appliance will be half of what it's originally designed for. This can result in one of the following scenarios: a. The appliance may not work at all, as it doesn't receive enough power to function. b. The appliance may operate at a slower pace or reduced performance, as it doesn't have the required energy to perform at its optimum level. c. The appliance may undergo potential damage over a prolonged period of use, as it is consistently forced to function below the expected power level. 2. 110V Appliance Plugged Into a 220V Socket: When a 110V appliance is connected to a 220V socket, the appliance will receive double the electrical current it's designed for. This can lead to several consequences: a. The appliance may get damaged instantly, as the excessive voltage can cause overloading and potentially destroy electronic components or the motor. b. There is an increased risk of electric shock or fire, as excessive heat generated from the overloaded components can damage insulation and wiring. c. If the appliance continues to work, it may do so at a faster rate or with increased performance, potentially causing wear and tear on the components and shortening the lifespan of the appliance. 3. Using a 110V 60 Hz CFL with a 220V 50 Hz: A CFL (compact fluorescent light) designed for 110V 60 Hz is intended to function at lower voltage and a different frequency than a 220V 50 Hz power source. Attempting to use a 110V CFL with a 220V source may cause the following situations: a. Immediate damage to the CFL, as the increased voltage may cause the bulb to burn out, the internal electronics to fail, or the ballast to overheat. b. Reduced performance and potentially flickering, as the frequency difference can affect the operation of the CFL and lead to inconsistent light output. c. Shorter lifespan for the CFL, as operating outside of its designed voltage and frequency parameters can reduce its overall durability. Finally, to answer the question if these two questions are paraphrases of each other, my answer would be: (1). No The two questions are not paraphrases since the first question involves the consequences of plugging different voltage appliances into mismatched sockets, while the second question specifically asks about a 110V 60 Hz CFL being used with a 220V 50 Hz power source. Although they both relate to voltage and frequency discrepancies, the scenarios and exact devices being discussed are different."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lindsey was worse at reading maps than Mary because","output":"Lindsey had always relied on technology for navigation. Growing up in the age of smartphones and GPS devices, she never saw the need to learn the old-fashioned skill. Mary, on the other hand, had a natural sense of direction and a passion for adventure, which made her an expert in map reading. One summer day, the two friends decided to embark on a hiking trip to explore a remote mountain trail. Before setting off, Mary insisted that they carry a map as a backup, just in case their devices failed them. Lindsey reluctantly agreed, knowing that she would be lost without her trusty GPS. Step 1: Preparing for the hike Before embarking on the journey, Mary carefully studies the map and notes the various waypoints, while Lindsey charges her smartphone and downloads the latest offline map. They also pack their backpacks with essentials like water, food, and first-aid kits, which would ensure their survival in the wilderness. Step 2: Setting off on the hike The two friends set off early in the morning to make the most of daylight. Lindsey keeps her GPS at hand, constantly checking to ensure they're on the right path. Mary, not wanting to be entirely dependent on technology, also consults the physical map periodically, comparing it to the landscape in front of them. Step 3: Navigating the wilderness As the hike progresses, the friends encounter various obstacles and challenges, such as steep inclines, overgrown trails, and occasional wildlife. Lindsey relies on her GPS to help them navigate around such hurdles, while Mary relies on her intuition and familiarity with the natural world. Step 4: Device failure Unexpectedly, Lindsey's smartphone battery begins to drain rapidly, causing her to panic. Knowing that they still have a significant distance to cover, Lindsey becomes increasingly anxious about their predicament. Meanwhile, Mary's calm demeanor and map reading skills shine through, as she confidently takes the lead, using the physical map and a compass to guide them. Step 5: Learning a valuable lesson As the friends trek on, Lindsey starts to pay more attention to Mary's approach. She observes how Mary gauges their location based on landmarks, topography, and the sun's position in the sky. Lindsey realizes the importance of knowing how to read a map, as it provides an invaluable backup in situations where technology fails. Eventually, they reach their destination safely, thanks to Mary's map-reading expertise. Lindsey gratefully acknowledges the importance of the skill and vows to learn it in the future. The two friends share a laugh over the day's adventure and make a pact to practice navigating with a map on their future hikes."},{"instruction":"On the whole, it's not something we parents shout about, but one in four of us does it.Hiring private tutors for our children is now widespread.And this year, as always,the Easter holidays will be peak time  for tutor demand. \\"My husband and I tried to tutor her at home,but we found all our knowledge was out of date and we were only confusing Zarreen.We also tried a group revision course but all the children were sitting exams for different boards .

What is the answer?","output":"The county on the East coast of Ireland that lies between County Dublin and County Louth is County Meath.  County Meath, or \\"An Mhí\\" in Irish, is part of the province of Leinster and covers an area of approximately 2,335 square kilometers. With its lush green countryside, it is often called the \\"Royal County\\" as it was historically the seat of the High King of Ireland, the most prestigious and significant role in ancient Ireland. The region is rich in history and heritage, with numerous archeological sites and monuments that showcase the ancient past of the area. One of the most significant sites in County Meath is the Hill of Tara, which served as the political and spiritual center of ancient Ireland. This location is home to numerous monuments dating back to the Neolithic period, such as the Stone of Destiny (Lia Fáil), which is believed to roar when touched by the rightful King of Ireland. The hill is also home to the ancient Mound of the Hostages, dating back to approximately 2500 BC, and the Royal Seat, a set of Iron Age earthworks. Another notable site in County Meath is the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Brú na Bóinne, which comprises three ancient passage tombs – Newgrange, Knowth, and Dowth. These tombs are over 5,000 years old, predating the Egyptian pyramids by several centuries, and showcase the incredible skill and knowledge of the Neolithic people who constructed them. The Newgrange passage tomb is perhaps the most famous of the three, and is renowned for its spectacular winter solstice phenomenon, during which sunlight illuminates the inner chamber for a brief period. In addition to these historical and archeological sites, County Meath has much to offer in terms of natural beauty, leisure activities, and cultural experiences. Tourists can enjoy a variety of outdoor pursuits such as hiking, cycling, horse riding, and golf, as well as taking part in traditional Irish music and dance sessions in local pubs. Overall, County Meath is a significant and fascinating destination for anyone interested in immersing themselves in the history, culture, and beauty of Ireland. As it is nestled between County Dublin and County Louth, visitors have easy access to other important sites and cities in the region, including the vibrant capital city of Dublin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Many of the serious strains of bacterial infections can be prevented with immunizations. Seasonal flu shots and pneumococcal vaccines will likely help reduce ear infections.  You and every member of your family should also get a flu vaccination every year. Vaccinating yourself will help keep both you and your family safer from infection.  Experts recommend that you use the PCV13 pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for children. Ask your pediatrician for advice. Wash your child's hands, toys and play surfaces frequently to reduce the likelihood of infection. Pacifiers can be vectors for bacteria, including bacteria that causes ear infections. Leakage is more likely to occur in bottle-feeding than it is in breastfeeding, making the transmission of bacteria higher.  Breastfeeding also boosts your child’s immune system, helping him or her to fight off infections easier.  If bottle-feeding is necessary, place the child in an upright seat so that liquids drip down instead of possibly into their ear.  Never give a baby a bottle while s/he is going down for a nap or to sleep at night. Do this both for the sake of preventing ear infections and for general health and safety. Prolonged usage of antibiotics can leave certain bacteria in your body or your child's body resistant to the effects of certain drugs. Only use antibiotics when prescribed by your doctor, or when other options aren't available. These facilities put your child at a 50% greater chance of developing an ear infection due to the common transmission of infections both bacterial and viral.  If you cannot avoid sending your child to daycare, teach him or her a few tactics to help avoid the spread of infections such as colds, which can cause ear infections.  Teach your child not to put toys or fingers in his or her mouth. S/he should avoid touching the face with his or her hands, especially mucous membrane areas such as the mouth, eyes, and nose. S/he should wash hands after eating and after using the bathroom. Eating a wide variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins helps your body stay strong and healthy. Some research also suggests that \\"good\\" bacteria such as probiotics may help protect your body from infection. Acidophilus is a commonly studied strain of probiotic. You can find it in many yogurts.","output":"Immunizations play a crucial role in preventing serious strains of bacterial infections. Seasonal flu shots and pneumococcal vaccines are especially important as they can help reduce the risk of ear infections. It is recommended that everyone in a family gets vaccinated annually to ensure overall protection from infections. For children, the PCV13 pneumococcal conjugate vaccination is advised, but consulting a pediatrician for guidance is essential. Maintaining hygiene by regularly washing a child's hands, toys, and play surfaces can also minimize the likelihood of infection. Since pacifiers can be carriers of bacteria, it is important to monitor their use, especially those causing ear infections.  Breastfeeding is known to strengthen a child's immune system and offers better protection from infections compared to bottle-feeding. However, if bottle-feeding is necessary, the child should be placed in an upright position to prevent liquids from entering their ears. Always avoid giving a baby a bottle while napping or sleeping at night for both infection prevention and overall health and safety. Prolonged use of antibiotics can lead to drug resistance in bacteria; therefore, consume antibiotics only when prescribed by a doctor or if no other options are available. Daycare facilities may put a child at a greater risk of developing ear infections, so teaching them good hygiene practices like not putting toys or fingers in their mouths and washing hands regularly can help prevent infection spread.

In a January 2010 interview with NME she spoke of being inspired by the film Food, Inc. and described the album as being about \\"exploring our faults and flaws\\" and being proud of them. The closing track, \\"Space\\", which was reportedly recorded using an iPhone app, is a ballad which Mikael Wood, writing in Billboard, described as \\"dreamy\\" and \\"sound[ing] like a Sega Genesis practicing its pillow talk\\". In contrast, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune described \\"Lovalot\\" as sounding \\"like it was recorded in a dank alley, the singer's voice reverberating amid percussion that sounds like doors creaking and rats scurrying across garbage cans\\".  \\"XXXO\\" draws its inspiration from M.I.A.'s \\"cheesy pop side\\", and is based on the theme of the creation of a sex symbol. \\"Teqkilla\\" is the only track to address her relationship with Bronfman, through a reference to Seagram, the company owned by his family.  \\"It Takes a Muscle\\" is a cover version of a track originally recorded in 1982 by Dutch group Spectral Display, and is performed in a reggae style.The opening track \\"The Message\\", featuring a male lead vocalist, parodies the words of the traditional song \\"Dem Bones\\" to link Google to \\"the government\\".

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Born in Cleveland's Fairfax neighborhood, near East 85th Street and Quincy Avenue, to Naomi Womack and Friendly Womack, Bobby was the third of five brothers. Friendly Jr. and Curtis were the older brothers, Harry and Cecil were his younger brothers. They all grew up in the Cleveland slums, so poor that the family would fish pig snouts out of the local supermarket's trash. He had to share a bed with his brothers. Circa 1965, Womack relocated to Memphis where he worked at Chips Moman's American Studios. He played guitar on recordings by Joe Tex and the Box Tops. Womack played guitar on several of Aretha Franklin's albums, including Lady Soul, but not on the hit song \\"Chain of Fools\\", as erroneously reported. His work as a songwriter caught the eye of music executives after Wilson Pickett took a liking to some of Womack's songs and insisted on recording them. Among the songs were \\"I'm a Midnight Mover\\" and \\"I'm in Love\\".  In 1968, Bobby signed with Minit Records and recorded his first solo album, Fly Me to the Moon, where he scored his first major hit with a cover of The Mamas & the Papas' \\"California Dreamin'\\". In 1969, Womack forged a partnership with Gabor Szabo and with Szabo, penned the instrumental \\"Breezin'\\", later a hit for George Benson. Womack also worked with rock musicians Sly and the Family Stone and Janis Joplin, contributing vocals and guitar work on the Family Stone's accomplished album There's a Riot Goin' On, and penning the ballad \\"Trust Me\\", for Joplin on her album Pearl. In fact, Womack was one of the last people to see Joplin alive, having visited her hours before she died at the Landmark Hotel in Los Angeles, California.  After two more albums with Minit, Bobby switched labels, signing with United Artists where he changed his attire and his musical direction with the album Communication. The album bolstered his first top 40 hit, \\"That's the Way I Feel About Cha\\", which peaked at number two R&B and number twenty-seven on the Billboard Hot 100 in the spring of 1972. Did this receive any awards or set any records?","output":"The article doesn't mention any specific awards or records that were set.

However, if you convince yourself beforehand that the pain won't be so bad, you might not suffer as much. According to a recent study, the part of your brain that reacts to severe pain is largely the same part that reacts to expectation of pain. Researchers in this study worked with 10 volunteers, aged 24 to 46. Each volunteer wore a device that gave out 20-second-long pulses of heat to the right leg. There were three levels of heat, producing mild, moderate, or strong pain. During training, the volunteers would first hear a tone, followed by a period of silence, and then feel a heat pulse. They then learned to associate the length of the silent pause with the intensity  of the upcoming heat pulse. The longer the pause, the stronger the heat pulse would be, causing more severe pain. A day or two later, the real experiment began. The researchers found that the parts of the brain involved in learning, memory, emotion, and touch became more active as the volunteers expected higher levels of pain. These were mainly the same areas that became active when participants actually felt pain. Interestingly, when the volunteers expected only mild or moderate pain but experienced severe pain, they reported feeling 28 percent less pain than when they expected severe pain and actually got it. The new study emphasizes that pain has both physical and psychological elements. Understanding how pain works in the mind and brain could eventually give doctors tools for helping people cope with painful medical treatments. Question: How did the volunteers learn to expect different levels of heat? Yes or no, is the answer \\"From the length of the pause between a tone and the heat pulse.\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the volunteers learned to expect different levels of heat from the length of the pause between a tone and the heat pulse. During training, the longer the silent pause after the tone, the stronger the heat pulse would be, and this would cause more severe pain. As a result, the volunteers learned to associate the pause's length with the upcoming heat pulse's intensity."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. jan made a deal with a assassin so she considered the arrangements in detail.  Given the context: Why did Jan do this?  Possible answers: teach her bully a lesson, make someone's life better, hire a killer","output":"Based on the information provided, it's not definitively clear why Jan made a deal with an assassin - each of the suggested motivations could be plausible depending on additional details. However, a careful analysis of each motive can allow us to understand possible reasons that may have driven Jan's decision. Firstly, let's consider the possibility that Jan made arrangements with an assassin in retaliation against a bully. Perhaps Jan was the victim of continuous and severe bullying, and she possibly felt threatened, helpless or desperate to end this harassment. Maybe she has tried other means like petitions or legal routes that have proven unsuccessful, or perhaps she lives in a context or society where such protections are not available or effective. In such alternatives, one might understand how Jan could be driven to such drastic measures as to involve an assassin as a form of retribution against her bully. Secondly, Jan could have made a deal with the assassin to make someone's life better. Assuming Jan has noble intentions, this 'someone' might be haunted by a dangerous character, kept under inhumane conditions or mistreatment, threatened, or potentially harmed due to a person who Jan seeks to eliminate. The significant factor here would be Jan's perception that traditional routes of aid (law enforcement, diplomacy, legal recourses, and so on) are unavailable, ineffective, biased, corrupt, or too slow. Thirdly, the assertion that Jan wanted to hire a killer can imply many reasons. Perhaps she wishes to climb the echelons of power in a criminal organization, has a personal vendetta against someone, needs to remove someone for financial gain or perhaps she seeks protection. It's a possibility that Jan exists in a world where moral boundaries blur, law enforcement is corrupt or non-existent, one's survival equates to the power they exert, or maybe it's personal vengeance or fear. It should be noted that taking such a course as hiring an assassin has severe ethical and legal implications. Yet, in all these speculated scenarios, Jan chooses this path for some perceived protective, retributory, or potentially self-serving purpose. Underlying all those possibilities is a critical factor: Jan sees this decision as her best or only option given her circumstances. Unfortunately, without more extensive detail about Jan's backstory, her emotional state, the surrounding circumstances, and her intrinsic motivations, we can only make conjectures at this point. However, the presented scenarios provide some potential insight into the diverse reasons Jan might have for making such a grave and significant decision."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: Happened to me while visiting Chicago a few weeks ago. A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Who was angry as the bus rode on? Options:  A. The man who offered his seat to the woman who had to move  B. not enough information  C. The woman who had to move  D. The wife of the man who offered his seat The answer is:","output":"C. The woman who had to move"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The episode I was subjected to last night contained so many disjointed story lines, tried to include EVERY possible plot summary imaginable and all the while trying to preach about friendship, family, religion and politics !!!. Basic story that they covered in the episode: Frat House hazing gone wrong wrong with too much alcohol - Death Turns out to be Senators son who wants FBI to investigate. Death is actually murder by peanut allergy Senator thinks it could be his sworn enemy and childhood best friend who did this because Senator was taking money for his votes for legislation but eventually got a conscience and said 'no' to mean mulit millionaire. Everybody a suspect but all have the usual alibi (ex-girlfriend student shagging a married teacher so had to lie, disgruntled student who was reported by victim actually had life changing experience, Senators enemy did not pay desperate student to kill sworn enemies son, he gives money freely to lots of broke students). All the while the heroine of this dribble has her niece staying who is 'at that age' and has a crush on a boy, who she eventually gets the courage to talk to with the assistance of her aunty, but only to dump him because the 'in' girls says he is not good enough and so to keep in with them she dumps him. Don't worry, she gets back with boy after she learns the truth about life and the 'in' girls drop her, Aunty also explains that God is the only one who truly she can rely on (I was almost sick at this point). This 'drama' gets even better when Sue and her FBI team find out who the killer is . . . your gonna laugh at this, i sure did . . .

The extent to which their lyrics are explicitly Christian varies between bands. Many bands who perform Christian rock have ties to the contemporary Christian music labels, media outlets, and festivals, while other bands are independent.  - A lead single is usually the first single to be released from a studio album, by a musician or a band, before the album itself is released.  - Top 40 is a music industry shorthand for the currently most-popular songs in a particular genre.

Article: When we walked into Papillon Bleu, a Chinese restaurant around the corner from Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal's Old Port, the sole waiter on duty looked surprised to see us. At 7:45 on a Saturday night, at the height of tourist season, just one young white family sat in the dining room. We walked past them to a table in the back, Chopin drifting quietly from the speakers into the certain shade of dim light that only Chinese restaurants seem to have. At our seats, bright yellow napkins, folded into fans, rested on a blue tablecloth next to cutlery . Sometime in the last 18 years of operation, Papillon Bleu stopped bothering with chopsticks. \\"How did you find out about us?\\"our waiter politely asked. I told him that my family used to own a Chinese restaurant that served peanut butter dumplings and I wanted to taste them again. Papillon Bleu came up when I googled\\"Best Peanut Butter Dumplings in Montreal\\". He shook his head and told us that while it might have been the case a few years ago, they had switched peanut butter brands to cut costs. But the significance for me wasn't which brand they used, it was that they served peanut butter dumplings. Commonly known as Hunan dumplings, this specialty exists neither in China, nor anywhere else in North America. Instead, Hunan dumplings are a unique Quebecois tradition, and a slowly dying one, found in the second-generation Chinese family restaurants. Peanut butter dumplings taste exactly how they sound, but also unlike anything else. It is a kind of dumpling that coats your mouth with a distinct store-brand quality, a little too sweet, but buttery, and luxuriously  warm, perfectly suited to resist the bone-chilling effects of the Montreal winter. Question: What can we infer about the restaurant? Yes or no, is the answer \\"The business is not promising.\\"?","output":"Based on the article, we can infer that Papillon Bleu, the Chinese restaurant in Montreal's Old Port, is not crowded during a usually busy time (7:45 pm on a Saturday night at the height of the tourist season), indicated by the surprised reaction of the waiter and only one family dining in the restaurant.

The enthusiasm which greeted the Diamond Jubilee was, of course, especially memorable for me and my family. It was humbling that so many chose to mark the anniversary of a duty which passed to me 60 years ago. People of all ages took the trouble to take part in various ways and in many nations. But perhaps most striking of all was to witness the strength of fellowship and friendship among those who had gathered together on these occasions. On the barges and the bridges and the banks of the river there were people who had taken their places to cheer through the mist, undaunted by the rain. That day there was a tremendous sense of common determination to celebrate, triumphing  over the elements. That same spirit was also in evidence from the moment the Olympic flame arrived on these shores. The flame itself drew hundreds and thousands of people on its journey around the British Isles, and was carried by every kind of deserving individual, many nominated for their own extraordinary service. As London hosted a splendid summer of sport, all those who saw the achievement and courage at the Olympic and Paralympic Games were further inspired by the skill, dedication, training and teamwork of our athletes. In pursuing their own sporting goals, they gave the rest of us the opportunity to share something of the excitement and drama. We were reminded, too, that the success of these great festivals depended to an enormous degree upon the dedication and effort of an army of volunteers. Those public-spirited people came forward in the great tradition of all those who devote themselves to keeping others safe, supported and comforted.

A mobile network operator typically also has the necessary provisioning , billing and customer care computer systems and the marketing , customer care and engineering organizations needed to sell , deliver and bill for services , however , an MNO can outsource any of these systems or functions and still be considered a mobile network operator .  - In telecommunication, provisioning involves the process of preparing and equipping a network to allow it to provide (new) services to its users. In National Security/Emergency Preparedness telecommunications services, \\"\\"provisioning\\"\\" equates to \\"\\"initiation\\"\\" and includes altering the state of an existing priority service or capability.  - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects.   - The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), originally the International Telegraph Union, is a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN) that is responsible for issues that concern information and communication technologies.  - The electromagnetic spectrum is the collective term for all known frequencies and their linked wavelengths of the known photons (electromagnetic radiation). The \\"electromagnetic spectrum\\" \\"of an object\\" has a different meaning, and is instead the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted or absorbed by that particular object.  - A wireless network is any type of computer network that uses wireless data connections for connecting network nodes  - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form.  - A computer network or data network is a telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources. In computer networks, networked computing devices exchange data with each other using a data link. The connections between nodes are established using either cable media or wireless media. The best-known computer network is the Internet.  - The radio spectrum is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum from 3 Hz to 3000 GHz (3 THz). Electromagnetic waves in this frequency range, called radio waves, are extremely widely used in modern technology, particularly in telecommunication. To prevent interference between different users, the generation and transmission of radio waves is strictly regulated by national laws, coordinated by an international body, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).    What entity does 'mobile network operator' has the relation 'industry' with? A:","output":"A mobile network operator (MNO) is a part of the telecommunications industry. This industry deals with the transmission of information over various types of communication networks, including wired and wireless systems. It consists of companies that provide services such as telephony, data communication, messaging, and mobile connectivity to end users through various channels, including smartphones, broadband connections, and other devices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

That’s because it controls the acceleration of the car. Pressing down on the gas pedal gives the car more gas and causes the car to speed up. Letting up on the gas pedal gives the car less gas and causes the car to slow down. Whenever an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it accelerates. Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. Acceleration occurs whenever an object is acted upon by an unbalanced force.  Now, I have a new situation: Eric is driving on a highway. His exit is coming up soon so he let's up on the gas a little and makes a left turn onto the exit.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations. Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. \\"We were desperate,\\" said Matouk. The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. \\"We are very satisfied with the results,\\" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians... Options: A A UK doctor contacted Gaza hospital.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Ivor Parry Evans ( February 20 , 1923 , ( Aliquippa , Pennsylvania ) -- October 24 , 2009 ( Abilene , Texas ) was a United States Air Force officer and commander .  - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775.  - The United States Air Force (USAF) is the aerial warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven American uniformed services. Initially part of the United States Army, the USAF was formed as a separate branch of the military on 18 September 1947 under the National Security Act of 1947. It is the most recent branch of the U.S. military to be formed, and is the largest and one of the world's most technologically advanced air forces. The USAF articulates its core functions as Nuclear Deterrence Operations, Special Operations, Air Superiority, Global Integrated ISR, Space Superiority, Command and Control, Cyberspace Superiority, Personnel Recovery, Global Precision Attack, Building Partnerships, Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.  - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - The National Security Act of 1947 was a major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following World War II. The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the Senate confirmed James Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense.

After the birth of their twin daughters, Annie and Hallie (Lindsay Lohan), Nick and Elizabeth divorce and lose contact, each parent raising one of the twins without telling her about her sister. Nick raises Hallie in Napa Valley and becomes a wealthy wine grower, while Elizabeth raises Annie in London and becomes a famous wedding gown designer.Over 11 years later, Nick and Elizabeth coincidentally enroll their daughters at the same all-girls summer camp in Maine called Camp Walden. Hallie and Annie first meet at the end of a fencing match, when they remove their masks and see that they look exactly alike. A comical hostility between the two girls leads to a prank war that ends when the camp counselors fall into one of Hallie's traps and isolate the twins from the other girls.Living together in an isolation cabin, Hallie and Annie discover they were born on the same day, and each has half of a torn wedding photograph of their parents. Realizing with delight they are twins, the girls act a plan to meet their previously unknown parents. Each girl trains the other to impersonate her, with the intent to switch places at the end of summer camp.When camp is over, the twins put their plan into action. Hallie, pretending to be Annie, goes to London to meet her mother, her maternal grandfather, Charles, and the James family's butler, Martin (Simon Kunz). Annie, pretending to be Hallie, goes to California to meet her father, the Parker family's housekeeper, Chessy (Lisa Ann Walter), their dog Sammy, and Nick's young, opportunistic fiancée, Meredith Blake (Elaine Hendrix), who is only interested in Nick's money. Distressed by Meredith's deviousness, Annie telephones Hallie and persuades her to bring Elizabeth to California to break up the engagement.

Please answer the following question: Two friends met after 20 years and had a beer together. Vlad was a geologist and studied earthquakes. Mort was a pedologist and studied soils. They had some interesting conversations that night.  Which friend studied less about seismic waves going different speeds through different materials?  Hint: Geologists study earthquake waves to “see” Earth's interior. Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior. Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Mort, the pedologist, studied less about seismic waves going different speeds through different materials. Vlad, as a geologist, specialized in studying earthquakes and had direct involvement with seismic waves. Geologists analyze seismic waves to understand Earth's interior, allowing them to develop insights into the composition and structure of the Earth. Seismic waves also play a crucial role in determining the movement of energy radiating from an earthquake's focus. These waves travel at differing speeds through various materials and may change speeds upon encountering new materials. Some seismic waves are unable to travel through liquids or gases and come to a halt. In contrast, Mort's field of study is pedology, which is concerned with the study of soils. Pedologists analyze the formation, distribution, and classification of soils in the natural environment. While soils may be affected by seismic waves and other geological phenomena, pedologists primarily focus on the properties, management, and utilization of soils rather than on seismic waves and their various characteristics. Therefore, the friend who studied less about seismic waves going different speeds through different materials is Mort, the pedologist."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: I was about 14 and lived near a large tract of undeveloped land where people would go and park to fool around. There was a dirt road through the tract, but further down, it crossed two huge concrete pipes. The dirt was washed out between them, and the deep gulch made it impossible to cross in a car. Sometimes, eight or ten of us would go looking for parked cars. If we found one or more, we would go move this incredibly heavy stump onto the road and lay a telephone pole across it. It took all of us and it was incredibly heavy. It was impossible to drive around it because of the ditches and there was no way two or three people could move it. We'd go back to the car and set off a big string of fire crackers or shake the cat and slap on it and run like crazy. We'd watch from the woods as they drove like heck and come to a screeching stop at our roadblock. The guy would get out and try to lift the pole. Never happen. Then the car would drive the other way. That wouldn't happen because of the pipes. We'd go home leaving them in there. This was before cell phones, and it was miles to a pay phone. We'd go back the next day and find the stump and pole moved. We thought it was real funny until one night we set it up and beat on the trunk of a car. A couple was inside, getting it on. We hadn't noticed a guy sitting on the hood with a bottle of booze and a pistol. As we ran, he was shooting and we could hear bullets going through the underbrush. No one was hit, thank goodness.

The band originated in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1976, with singer, rhythm guitarist, and songwriter Ric Ocasek; singer, songwriter and bassist Benjamin Orr; lead guitarist Elliot Easton; keyboardist Greg Hawkes; and drummer David Robinson. The Cars were at the forefront in merging 1970s guitar-oriented rock with the new synthesizer-oriented pop that was then becoming popular and which would flourish in the early 1980s. Robert Palmer, music critic for The New York Times and Rolling Stone, described the Cars' musical style by saying: \\"they have taken some important but disparate contemporary trends--punk minimalism, the labyrinthine synthesizer and guitar textures of art rock, the '50s rockabilly revival and the melodious terseness of power pop--and mixed them into a personal and appealing blend.\\" In 2010, the founding members of the Cars suggested a reunion when Ric Ocasek, Elliot Easton, Greg Hawkes and David Robinson placed a photo of the four members together in Millbrook Sound Studios, Millbrook, New York on their Facebook page. On October 13, they also posted a snippet of a new song, \\"Blue Tip\\", on their Facebook page. A picture of Jacknife Lee in the studio was posted on the group's Facebook page hinting that he would be producing the new Cars album.  In October Billboard reported that a new album which may be supported by a tour is being recorded at veteran engineer Paul Orofino's studio in Millbrook, New York. A music clip of a new song, called \\"Sad Song\\", was added to the band's Facebook page on December 7, 2010; another clip of a song called \\"Free\\" was shared on their Facebook page on January 1, 2011. The official debut video for \\"Blue Tip\\" was released February 17, 2011. The video was directed by Roberto Serrini and Eron Otcasek from The Lab NYC and features the four members of the band, and NYC based street artist Joe Iurato. According to Rolling Stone, the surviving Cars mutually agreed there would be no replacing the late Benjamin Orr, so Hawkes and Lee handled all bass parts.  The new album, titled Move Like This, was released on May 10 by Hear Music/Concord Music Group, debuting at No. 7 on Billboard's album charts. It featured 10 songs in under 40 minutes. The album's first single, \\"Sad Song\\", was released to radio stations March 1. In May 2011, the Cars went on a ten-city tour of the United States and Canada and also performed at Lollapalooza in Chicago in August.

Then he pointed his telescope to planet Jupiter, which is farther form the Sun than Mars is. He noted it as case C. Finally, he pointed the telescope to a faraway planet called WASP-17b. He noted that as case B.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which case would see faster movement, case A or case C? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's first analyze the information given: 1. Case A: John pointed his telescope at planet Mars. 2. Case B: John pointed his telescope at a faraway planet called WASP-17b. 3. Case C: John pointed his telescope at planet Jupiter, which is farther from the Sun than Mars is. Now we need to determine which case would see faster movement, case A or case C. Since the question is related to the movement speed of the planets, we should consider the planets' orbital speed around the Sun. Step 1: Identify the orbital speeds of Mars and Jupiter. Mars has an average orbital speed of approximately 24.077 kilometers per second, while Jupiter's average orbital speed is about 13.07 kilometers per second. Step 2: Compare the orbital speeds of Mars and Jupiter. Based on the information above, Mars has a faster orbital speed than Jupiter, with the difference being about 11.007 kilometers per second. Step 3: Determine which case sees faster movement. Since Mars has a faster orbital speed than Jupiter, case A, where John points his telescope at Mars, would see faster movement.

In 1982, McKagan became the drummer for the hardcore punk band The Fartz, with whom he recorded several demos, five of which were included on their 1990 album You, We See You Crawling. After several line-up changes, The Fartz evolved into the post-punk band 10 Minute Warning, for which McKagan played guitar.  In 1983, McKagan moved to Los Angeles, California, with one of his brothers where he found work as an appetizer server at a Black Angus restaurant in Northridge.

Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche.  Two farmers had neighboring parcels of land.

Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was building the new east wing, the Brighton Pavilion was once again plundered of its fittings. As a result, many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton Banqueting and Music Rooms with a large oriental chimney piece designed by Robert Jones and sculpted by Richard Westmacott. It was formerly in the Music Room at the Brighton Pavilion. The ornate clock, known as the Kylin Clock, was made in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, China, in the second half of the 18th century; it has a later movement by Benjamin Vulliamy circa 1820. The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and a chimney piece which is a European vision of how the Chinese chimney piece may appear. It has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons, designed by Robert Jones.At the centre of this wing is the famous balcony with the Centre Room behind its glass doors. This is a Chinese-style saloon enhanced by Queen Mary, who, working with the designer Sir Charles Allom, created a more \\"binding\\" Chinese theme in the late 1920s, although the lacquer doors were brought from Brighton in 1873. Running the length of the piano nobile of the east wing is the great gallery, modestly known as the Principal Corridor, which runs the length of the eastern side of the quadrangle. It has mirrored doors, and mirrored cross walls reflecting porcelain pagodas and other oriental furniture from Brighton. The Chinese Luncheon Room and Yellow Drawing Room are situated at each end of this gallery, with the Centre Room obviously placed in the centre.The original early 19th-century interior designs, many of which still survive, included widespread use of brightly coloured scagliola and blue and pink lapis, on the advice of Sir Charles Long.

Amazon why can't we give zeros?..... Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","output":"This review clearly depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer's dissatisfaction and frustration with the film are evident through various aspects of their review. They express strong negative sentiments, emphasizing their disappointment in multiple ways. First, the title of the review itself, \\"So bad,\\" instantly communicates the reviewer's unfavorable opinion of the film. It establishes the negative tone and sets the stage for the rest of the critique. Next, the use of \\"A minus score\\" highlights the reviewer's dissatisfaction with the rating system, implying that even the lowest possible score wouldn't be low enough to accurately represent their disdain for the film. They go as far as suggesting Amazon should allow users to assign zero ratings, further emphasizing their utmost disappointment. Moreover, the statement \\"I will pay you to take this film out of my house\\" provides a hyperbolic depiction of the reviewer's regret in having this film in their possession. It suggests that they would rather incur additional expenses than have the film in their home anymore. The reviewer also makes it clear that they found no value in the film, asserting that it was not \\"funny or redeeming in any way.\\" This is a sweeping and comprehensive statement that allows no room for potential benefits or enjoyable moments. Lastly, the overall brevity and strong language used in the review indicate a firm belief in the opinion presented. The author does not provide specific details regarding the film's content, nor do they offer any counterpoints or mitigating factors. This might make the review seem less nuanced, but it does effectively communicate the passionate, unflattering perspective of the reviewer. In conclusion, the review undeniably portrays the product in an unflattering light.

Question: Which actor portrays Yu Jong-won's partner? Movie title: Shiri Movie plot: In October 1992, an elite group of North Korean soldiers are put through a brutal training regime. Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who assassinates several key South Korean figures over the next six years. Over six years later, in September 1998, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Yunjin Kim), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. Hyun symbolically gives Yu a pair of kissing gourami, a species that cannot live without its mate. Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance. Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a 200mL worth of CTX has a 1Â km blast radius. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee. Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them. Yu and Lee suspect a leak, as they are always one step too slow. Hee is ordered to eliminate the 'kissing gourami' obstacle. Yu meets with Police...

After, the Teutonic knights constructed the fortress of Koporie, where they kept all their supplies, and took the Novgorod city of Tesov, pillaging its merchants and ravaging the surrounding area. The Novgorodians, fearing a fate similar to that of Pskov, sent envoys to Prince Yaroslav. Yaroslav liked Alexander's younger brother Andrew as a leader, but Novgorod insisted on Alexander. Alexander returned to Novgorod and commanded its army to Koporye in 1241. In the Spring of 1242, he recaptured Pskov. After this victory, Alexander decided to continue his campaign.. On April 5, 1242, one of Russia's most famous battles, the Battle of the Ice, took place on the ice of Lake Peipsi. The battle was a significant defeat sustained by the crusaders during the Northern Crusades. The crusaders' defeat in the battle marked the end of their campaigns against the Orthodox Novgorod Republic and other Russian territories for the next century. Which came last, the Battle of Ice or the Novgorodians taking Pereyaslavl-Zalessky?","output":"To answer this question, let us go through the events chronologically as described in the article: 1.

Translate to English","output":"In May, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the US Department of Justice (DOJ) to force the government to release information about its electronic surveillance activities. The American Civil Liberties Union, widely known as the ACLU, is an organization committed to the defense and preservation of individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the US Constitution and the laws of the United States. In this context, their lawsuit against the Department of Justice represents an effort to promote transparency and accountability within the US government, specifically in regards to its actions related to electronic surveillance. The debate surrounding electronic surveillance has grown increasingly contentious in recent years, particularly due to concerns over the invasion of privacy and the undermining of civil liberties. The ACLU's lawsuit aims to shed light on the government's use of invasive surveillance tools and practices, which have the potential to compromise the privacy rights of American citizens. The Department of Justice is a federal executive department responsible for enforcing federal law and administering justice in the United States. As part of its law enforcement and national security mandate, the DOJ possesses surveillance capabilities that may be utilized in the investigation of potential threats or crimes. However, these capabilities have also sparked concerns over the potential abuse of power and infringement on constitutional rights. By taking legal action against the DOJ, the ACLU is attempting to hold the government accountable for its use of electronic surveillance and to ensure that these practices do not infringe upon the rights of US citizens. This lawsuit is intended to promote transparency by compelling the government to release data about its surveillance activities and to raise public awareness about potential abuses of power. In conclusion, the ACLU's decision to sue the US Department of Justice in May demonstrates the organization's commitment to advocating for transparency and accountability within the government, specifically concerning matters related to electronic surveillance. The lawsuit ultimately seeks to ensure that the government's use of surveillance tools and practices does not infringe upon the constitutional rights of American citizens and to foster a broader public understanding of this critical issue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: You may think that sailing is a difficult sport, but it is really not hard to learn it. You do not need to be strong. But you need to be quick. And you need to understand a few basic rules about the wind. First, you must ask yourself, \\"Where is the wind coming from? Is it coming from ahead or behind or from the side?\\" You must think about this all the time on the boat. The wind direction tells you what to do with the sail. Let's start with the wind blowing from the behind. This means the wind and the boat are going in the same direction. Then you must always keep the sail outside the boat. It should be at a 90deg angle   to the boat. Then it will catch the wind best. If the wind is blowing from the side, it is blowing across the boat. In this case, you must keep the sail half way outside the boat. It should be at a 45deg angle to the boat. _ needs to be out far enough to catch the wind, but it shouldn't flap  . It shouldn't look like on a flagpole. If it is flapping, it is probably out too far, and the boat will slow down. Sailing into the wind is not possible. If you try, the sail will flap and the boat will stop. You may want to go in that direction. It is possible, but you can't go in a straight line. You must go first in one direction and then in another. This is called tacking. When you are tacking, you must always keep the sail inside the boat.

As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing.  Paragraph: Scientists are performing an audio experiment on a volunteer. Chris is sat in a chair, and two different sounds will be played for him as the scientists observe his reactions. Sound X has a high decibel level and sound Y has a lower decibel level.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which sound is less likely to make Chris lose hearing? A:","output":"Given the information provided in the background and paragraph, Sound Y, which has a lower decibel level, is less likely to make Chris lose his hearing compared to Sound X, which has a higher decibel level. As mentioned, high-decibel sounds are dangerous and can cause damage to the ears and hearing loss. Since the intensity of sound increases with every 10-decibel level, and loudness becomes 10 times greater, it becomes clear that the higher the decibel level, the more potential damage it can cause to an individual's hearing. Therefore, in the given scenario, Sound Y's lower decibel level implies less intensity and less potential for causing harm to Chris's hearing than the higher decibel level of Sound X. It is worth noting, however, that other factors such as duration of exposure to the sounds and individual sensitivity can also contribute to hearing damage, but based solely on the decibel levels, Sound Y is less likely to cause hearing loss for Chris."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Blood can be kept in the fridge for about three weeks with a kind of chemical. When people lose much of their blood because of operations or accidents, they may need transfusions . Some people may need transfusions because of illness. Sometimes only a part of the blood is used for transfusions. Plasma , the liquid part of the blood , may be given alone.

To make it safer, before a transfusion is given, the blood to be used must be tested with the blood of the person who is to receive it. This testing is called cross matching of the blood.

Plus they went into so much more depth than magazines ever did. I think that the day I discovered beauty blogs was probably also the day my magazine addiction came to an end.

In this statement, the speaker addresses the president and expresses that their group finds only two aspects particularly important in regards to the Stockholm Program. The Stockholm Program is a strategic framework created by the European Union, aiming to address issues related to justice and home affairs, such as immigration and asylum policies, as well as legal cooperation between member states. The first aspect that the group appreciates about the Stockholm Program is its focus on promoting a common European asylum system. This aspect is important because it aims to harmonize procedures and standards among EU member states, ensuring that all asylum seekers receive fair and equal treatment without any bias or discrimination. By implementing a common asylum system, the European Union can provide better assistance and protection to those fleeing from war, persecution, and humanitarian crises. The second aspect the group deems significant is the emphasis on the protection of individual rights and privacy. The Stockholm Program places a strong emphasis on respecting fundamental rights and freedoms, highlighting the importance of protecting citizens' personal data and privacy. In the era of rapid technological advancements and increasing surveillance, safeguarding individuals' rights, including their right to privacy, has become a crucial concern. The fact that the Stockholm Program acknowledges these issues and seeks to address them is highly valued by the group. In conclusion, the two aspects that the group appreciates most about the Stockholm Program are its commitment to establishing a common European asylum system and its dedication to protecting individual rights and privacy.

They formed in 1968, consisting of singers Russell Thompkins Jr., Herb Murrell, Airrion Love, James Smith, and James Dunn. All of their US hits were ballads characterized by the falsetto of Russell Thompkins Jr. and the production of Thom Bell. During the early 1970s, the group had twelve consecutive R&B top ten hits, including \\"Stop, Look, Listen\\", \\" After signing to Avco, the record label approached producer Thom Bell, who had already produced a catalogue of hits for The Delfonics, to work with the group. The Stylistics auditioned for Bell, but he was initially unimpressed. He ultimately agreed to produce the group because he believed in the potential of lead singer, Russell Thompkins, Jr.'s distinctive, nasal high tenor & falsetto voice. Avco gave Bell complete creative control over the Stylistics and he proceeded to focus the group's sound exclusively around Thompkins's voice. On most of the group hits, Bell would have Thompkins sing virtually solo.  The first song recorded with Bell and his collaborator, lyricist Linda Creed, was the lush \\"Stop, Look, Listen\\". Bell imported techniques he had perfected with The Delfonics and his musical arrangements worked perfectly with Thompkins' falsetto vocals.  Their hits from this period --distilled from three albums-- included \\"Betcha by Golly, Wow\\" (U.S. #3), \\"I'm Stone in Love with You\\", \\"Break Up to Make Up\\" (U.S. #5), \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New\\" featuring Thompkins singing a rare lead vocal duet with Airrion Love, the aforementioned \\"Stop, Look, Listen\\", \\"You Are Everything\\", and the Top 20 Pop hit \\"Rockin' Roll Baby\\" (U.S. #14). \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New\\" was the group's biggest U.S. hit, holding at No. 2 for two weeks just as the spring of 1974 turned to summer, and was one of the group's five U.S. gold singles.  The Stylistics' smooth sound also found an easier path on to adult contemporary airwaves than many other soul artists and the group made Billboard magazine's Easy Listening singles chart twelve times from 1971 to 1976, with three entries (\\"Betcha by Golly, Wow\\", \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New\\", and \\"You'll Never Get to Heaven (If You Break My Heart)\\") reaching the Top 10. Every single that Bell produced for the Stylistics was a Top Ten R&B hit, and several--\\"You Are Everything\\", \\"Betcha by Golly Wow!\\", \\"I'm Stone in Love with You\\", \\"Break Up to Make Up\\", and \\"You Make Me Feel Brand New\\"--were also Top Ten pop chart hits.

As Quaid struggles to make sense of the revelation, Melina gives an emotional plea for Quaid to spare her life and join the resistance. At that moment, a single tear rolls down Melina's cheek, bringing deep emotions bubbling to the surface in Quaid. The tear on Melina's cheek changes Quaid's heart, deciding to spare her life, and join the resistance. Together, they continue to fight against the Mind Control Bureau. As their relationship grows stronger, Quaid starts regaining his real memories and learns about his past with Melina before MCB brainwashed him. Quaid and Melina's love becomes an essential motivation for the resistance, turning the tide of the battle against the MCB. In the climax, Quaid, Melina, and the resistance overthrow the MCB, erasing its control over the citizens. The world begins rebuilding, aiming for a better union that values truth, free will, and genuine connection. In the end, the tear on Melina's cheek symbolizes the power of love and emotions in overcoming manipulation and control, setting the foundation for a better world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The now-current name is due to William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, who observed the object in 1840 using a 36-inch telescope and produced a drawing that looked somewhat like a crab. Corresponding to a bright supernova recorded by Chinese astronomers in 1054, the nebula was observed later by English astronomer John Bevis in 1731. The nebula was the first astronomical object identified with a historical supernova explosion.  - The Crab Pulsar ( PSR B0531 +21 ) is a relatively young neutron star . The star is the central star in the Crab Nebula , a remnant of the supernova SN 1054 , which was widely observed on Earth in the year 1054 . Discovered in 1968 , the pulsar was the first to be connected with a supernova remnant . The Crab Pulsar is one of very few pulsars to be identified optically . The optical pulsar is roughly 20 km in diameter and the pulsar \`\` beams '' rotate once every 33 milliseconds , or 30 times each second . The outflowing relativistic wind from the neutron star generates synchrotron emission , which produces the bulk of the emission from the nebula , seen from radio waves through to gamma rays . The most dynamic feature in the inner part of the nebula is the point where the pulsar 's equatorial wind slams into the surrounding nebula , forming a termination shock . The shape and position of this feature shifts rapidly , with the equatorial wind appearing as a series of wisp - like features that steepen , brighten , then fade as they move away from the pulsar into the main body of the nebula . The period of the pulsar 's rotation is slowing by 38 nanoseconds per day due to the large amounts of energy carried away in the pulsar wind . The Crab Nebula is often used as a calibration source in X-ray astronomy . It is very bright in X-rays and the flux density and spectrum are known to be constant , with the exception of the pulsar itself . The pulsar provides a strong periodic signal that is used to check the timing of the X-ray detectors . In X-ray astronomy , ' crab ' and ' millicrab ' are sometimes used as units of flux density . A millicrab corresponds to a flux density of about 2.4x10  11 erg s  1 cm  2 ( 2.4x10  14 W m  2 ) in the 2 -- 10 keV X-ray band , for a \`\` crab - like '' X-ray spectrum , which is roughly a powerlaw in photon energy , I ( E ) = 9.5 E  1.1 . Very few X-ray sources ever exceed one crab in brightness .  - A nebula (Latin for \\"cloud\\"; pl. nebulae, nebulæ, or nebulas) is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Originally, \\"nebula\\" was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the \\"Andromeda Nebula\\" (and spiral galaxies in general as \\"spiral nebulae\\") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others.

(KTLA) — A husband who accidentally sold his wife’s wedding ring at a garage sale was hoping the person who bought it would bring it back.      Racquel Cloutier hid her 22,000 wedding ring under a cushion in a wooden watch box for safe keeping before she went into the hospital to deliver her fifth child.      While Cloutier was in the hospital, her husband, Eric, sold the box at a neighborhood garage sale for 10.      “We never use it so I said let’s make somebody happy. I looked in it, I didn’t see anything and I sold it,” Eric Cloutier said.      Racquel Cloutier is offering a reward for the return of her wedding ring.      “It’s my wedding ring and its a one of a kind,” Cloutier said. “It’s such a bad feeling whenever you lose something, especially when it means so much to you.”      The woman who bought the box was described as middle-aged with shoulder length blond hair and glasses.      “We’re hoping maybe she can see this on TV and maybe realize and look in the box and hopefully she’ll be honest enough and bring it back,” Eric Cloutier said.      The family can be contacted by email at racquelcloutier@gmail.com.      The ring can also be dropped off anonymously at the security gate of the San Joaquin Hills community, located at 27380 Aliso Niguel Road. ||||| Poker player Eric Cloutier made headlines this week for accidentally selling his wife’s wedding ring — reportedly valued at 23,000 — for just 10 at a neighborhood garage sale.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Pope Accepts Resignation of Bishop Who Didn't Report Abuse (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) — Pope Francis accepted the resignation Tuesday of a U.S. bishop who was convicted of failing to report a suspected child abuser, answering calls by victims to take action against bishops who cover up for pedophile priests. Bishop Robert Finn, who led the Diocese of Kansas City-St Joseph in Missouri for nearly 10 years, resigned under canon law that allows bishops to resign early for illness or some “grave” reason that makes them unfit for office. But his resignation did not provide a specific reason. Finn, 62, is 13 years shy of the normal retirement age of 75. In 2012, Finn was found guilty of one misdemeanor count of failure to report suspected abuse and was sentenced to two years of probation, making him the highest-ranking church official in the U.S. to be convicted of not taking action in response to abuse allegations. Prosecutors say the diocese did not notify police until six months after concerns were raised in 2011 about the Rev. Shawn Ratigan, whose computers were found to contain hundreds of lewd photos of young girls. Since the convictions, Finn has faced pressure to resign, including local and national petition drives asking the pope to remove him from the diocese. The removal was praised by Marie Collins, a prominent member of Francis’ own sex abuse advisory board who had called for Finn to go and demanded that the Vatican hold bishops accountable when they fail to protect children. “Things are moving slowly, as I have said many times, but they are moving in the right direction!” Collins tweeted. Francis appointed Archbishop Joseph Naumann, head of the Kansas City, Kansas, diocese, to lead the Missouri diocese until Finn’s successor is named. In a letter to the diocese, Naumann said he prayed “that the coming weeks and months will be a time of grace and healing.” Naumann will retain his duties in Kansas. Finn, who apologized for Ratigan’s abuse and took measures to make the diocese safer for children, urged followers to pray for his successor. Sister Jeanne Christensen, a member of the Sisters of Mercy who has been a critic of Finn, said “it’s sad that it took so long.” “We have suffered a lot under him, and justice has finally been done,” Christensen said. “Let’s just wish him well. And now we need to get moving on to healing the diocese.” For Kansas City resident Andrew Miller, 23, a lifelong member of Holy Spirit Catholic Church in Lee’s Summit, Missouri, Finn’s resignation will make attending Mass easier. After Finn’s conviction in 2012, he said, he would say, “I’m a Catholic, but_.” Now, “I’m ready to call myself a Catholic again.” “Why would I put money in a collection plate to pay for lawyers to defend sex offenders?” he said, adding that next time he attends Mass, he might contribute “in celebration of a new bishop.” Rebecca Randles, the attorney who represented the plaintiffs in several abuse lawsuits that have cost the dioceses millions of dollars, said Finn’s resignation was an important step for abuse victims and the diocese. “For survivors, there is a sense that as long as Finn was in charge, there would be no way they would have had closure on their own experience. He was a symbol bearer,” she said. “And this kind of abuse ripples across all the Catholic faithful.” One of Finn’s strongest advocates, Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League, said Tuesday that Finn had been a target of elements of the Catholic church who did not like the bishop’s strict adherence to Catholic teachings. “He’s a good man,” Donohue said. “No one called his office and complained specifically that their child was being abused. If he didn’t give a damn, he could have ignored it completely and told everyone in his office to ignore it. He didn’t. He called the authorities. The way he’s been treated is simply not fair.” No U.S. bishop has been forcibly removed for covering up for guilty clergy. Technically speaking, Finn was not removed — he offered to resign, in the same way that Boston’s Cardinal Bernard Law did in 2002 after the clergy sex abuse scandal exploded in his archdiocese. Law had not been convicted of a crime, as Finn was, and the failure of the Vatican to remove Finn for three years after his conviction fueled victims’ complaints that bishops were continuing to enjoy protections even under Francis’ “zero tolerance” pledge. In a statement, Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of the online abuse resource BishopAccountability.org, said Finn’s resignation was a welcome step but called on Francis to publicly state that he was removed for mismanaging the Ratigan case and failing to protect children. She noted that bishops had been allowed to resign under the previous two popes, but that the Vatican has never publicly linked their resignations to mishandling abuse cases. “We urge Pope Francis to issue such a statement immediately. That would be unprecedented,” she said. “And it would send a bracing message to bishops and religious superiors worldwide that a new era has begun.” Winfield reported from Vatican City. Associated Press writer Hannah Cushman in Chicago contributed to this report. Correction: The original version of this story, using information from the Associated Press, incorrectly described the outcome of Bishop Robert Finn’s case. He was convicted of failing to report abuse. Summary:","output":"Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of US Bishop, Robert Finn, who was convicted of failing to report a suspected child abuser.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Five men, criminals Ray, Dave, Stevie, Julian (\\"Julie\\" as a nickname), and Jason, plan a heist to steal a minimum of £2 million. Using a truck modified as a battering ram, the group break into a security depot in London and steal a large amount of money before the police arrive. However, they discover they barely got the amount of money they wanted, and only £68,000 to each man. Julian demands an extra amount of money as \\"expenses\\" for his work, but is beaten and placed in the boot of Ray's car until he just accepts his share. The group, without Julian, later spend time at a bar with fellow criminal Sonny, and Ray's girlfriend Connie, a protester. Ray and Stevie also visit an elderly couple, Linda and Bill, where they leave their stolen money for safekeeping. The next day, Ray and Stevie, who live together with Connie, are alerted by a bruised Dave that his money was stolen, apparently by Julian. Ray, Dave and Stevie investigate Linda and Bill's home to find them murdered and the money stolen, leaving Ray emotionally distraught. He visits Julian but his money is missing too. They conclude that Sonny stole the money and break into his house, only to find Jason dead with a headwound. The four are alerted to a pair of undercover police officers and flee, Dave and Julian engaging in a shootout with the police. Believing that he may be arrested for murder, Ray decides to flee after the money is found, and goes to his mother and Connie for help. His mother gives him some money and her car to use, disappointed in her son's career but still caring for him.

Summarize: The 116m (Â£74m) deal is a big step by Penguin Books into the rapidly expanding self-publishing industry. Penguin said the deal gave it a leading position in a sector that has entered the mainstream in the past three years. But some have criticised the buy-out, with one authors' body saying it could threaten the rights of new writers. The growth of e-book readers and tablet computers has prompted a change in the route taken by authors, with increasing numbers choosing to bypass traditional publishers and release and market their own titles. Some 150,000 writers have published their work through ASI since it was established in 2007. In 2011, 211,000 titles were self-published in either print or digital form - an increase of almost 60 percent on the previous year. EL James' erotic novel, Fifty Shades of Grey, which became the first book to sell more than one million copies on Amazon's Kindle e-reading device, began as a self-published title. Penguin chief executive, John Makinson, said that buying Author Solutions \\"will allow Penguin to participate fully in perhaps the fastest-growing area of the publishing economy and gain skills in customer acquisition and data analytics that will be vital to our future\\". But Deputy General Secretary of The Society of Authors, Kate Pool, said the deal is \\"misleading\\" to budding writers. \\"Companies like those in the ASI stable claim to be self-publishing but are not,\\" she claimed. \\"The author pays for certain services but in return the work is generally produced only as print-on-demand and the author is obliged to give the company exclusive rights, and will be paid only a royalty. \\"Our concern is that ASI companies are very misleading to aspiring authors. They are not self-publishing, nor are they proper publishers - though the apparent endorsement of the Penguin/Pearson brand may lead some authors to think they are,\\" she added. Philip Jones, deputy editor of The Bookseller said it is \\"absolutely right\\" that Penguin is tapping into the self publishing market. \\"This is where writers are,\\" he said, adding \\"they have recognised a gap in the market in indie publishing. \\"They are not buying a franchise, they are buying an infrastructure company. There's nothing retrograde about this decision to buy [ASI].\\" With access to an additional 1,600 members of staff, Penguin's takeover of ASI will provide it with the additional resources to forge ahead with plans to digitize its back catalogue of 16,000 titles within two years. Mick Rooney from The Independent Publishing Magazine said he has \\"no doubt\\" there will more deals like the one between Pearson and ASI. \\"Publishing - and what it once meant and how it's executed - is changing in process, as well as the myriad of developing e-markets. \\"I'd say the difference now is that the responsibility is squarely on the shoulders of the author to ensure money flows to the author through the decisions he or she takes,\\" he said. \\"Traditional publishing and self-publishing are both risks - the personal and financial value is learning how to wager those risks sensibly,\\" he added. ASI's chief executive Kevin Weiss said the company was \\"thrilled to join Penguin to accelerate the pace of change in the industry\\". ASI has 1,600 employees based in the US and Philippines, and generated revenues of about 100 million in 2011. Penguin said ASI would be integrated into Penguin's back office, but would continue to run as a separate business. Summary:","output":"Penguin Books has made a significant move into the self-publishing industry with a 116m acquisition of Author Solutions (ASI). The deal is expected to give Penguin a leading position in this growing sector, which has gained mainstream traction over the past three years, fueled by the rise of e-book readers and tablets. The partnership will also equip Penguin with crucial skills in customer acquisition and data analytics for the future. However, some have criticized the acquisition, arguing that it could threaten the rights of new writers and be misleading to aspiring authors. Despite this, Penguin's takeover of ASI will provide additional resources for the company as it aims to digitize its back catalogue and stay competitive in the changing publishing landscape."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Context: There was a boy named Chan who loved his parents, though they did not love him back; he was not even given a first name. He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

Question: What else besides technology which cools is meant for food freshness? Context: Since the Industrial Revolution some two hundred years ago, the food processing industry has invented many technologies that both help keep foods fresh longer and alter the fresh state of food as they appear in nature. Cooling is the primary technology used to maintain freshness, whereas many more technologies have been invented to allow foods to last longer without becoming spoiled. These latter technologies include pasteurisation, autoclavation, drying, salting, and separation of various components, all of which appearing to alter the original nutritional contents of food. Pasteurisation and autoclavation (heating techniques) have no doubt improved the safety of many common foods, preventing epidemics of bacterial infection. But some of the (new) food processing technologies have downfalls as well.","output":"Besides technology that cools, there are various other methods designed to maintain the freshness of food. These technologies have also been designed to extend the lifespan of food to prevent it from spoiling. For instance, pasteurization and autoclavation, both heating techniques, are used extensively in the industry. Pasteurization involves heating food to a specific temperature to kill harmful pathogens, while autoclavation involves using high pressure and heat to sterilize food. Both technologies ensure food safety and prevent bacterial infections. Additional methods of preserving food freshness involve drying and salting. Drying is a method where water is removed from the food to inhibit the growth of bacteria, yeasts, and molds. Salting, on the other hand, helps preservation by drawing water out of the food to prevent bacterial growth. Lastly, the separation of various components of food is another technique to maintain food freshness. This involves breaking down the food product into its individual parts to able to preserve and manage each piece individually.  While these technologies have proven to be effective methods to maintain food freshness and increase food safety, it should be noted that they also come with certain downsides and may alter the original nutritional contents of the food."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Canada produced its electricity by using fossil fuels and nuclear fission. New Zealand used only alternative, renewable sources to produce their electricity.  But I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up.  What is an answer for this question: Which country burned less coal? A:","output":"Based on the given information, New Zealand burned less coal than Canada in producing electricity. This is because New Zealand used only alternative, renewable energy sources, while Canada relied on a combination of fossil fuels, including coal, and nuclear fission for its electricity production. The environmental impact of electricity production from coal and other fossil fuels is significant. When fossil fuels are burned, they release air pollutants, contributing to air pollution, which can negatively affect human health, cause acid rain, and accelerate global warming due to the release of greenhouse gases. The use of renewable energy sources, on the other hand, significantly reduces these negative environmental impacts, as they don't emit harmful pollutants in the process of generating electricity. In the United States, the majority of electricity production is still heavily reliant on coal and other fossil fuels, highlighting the need for a transition towards cleaner, more sustainable energy sources. Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower have the advantage of providing a clean and sustainable means of electricity production without the environmental repercussions associated with fossil fuels. The benefits of nuclear energy as a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels are clear, in that it does not release air pollution or contribute to global warming. However, it is important to note that nuclear energy still relies on nonrenewable resources, as radioactive elements can eventually be depleted. Moreover, the disposal of nuclear waste and concerns surrounding nuclear accidents remain key challenges in the widespread adoption of nuclear energy. In conclusion, New Zealand burned less coal than Canada, due to its exclusive use of renewable energy sources for electricity production, highlighting their commitment to sustainable and environmentally friendly energy generation. Meanwhile, Canada and the United States still rely heavily on fossil fuels, including coal, for much of their electricity production, with the associated negative environmental impacts. A global shift towards the use of renewable energy sources can help in mitigating these environmental concerns and facilitating a sustainable future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Choppers, trucks douse stricken nuke plant      By Hayden Cooper, staff      Updated      Japan is making a last-ditch attempt to cool stricken reactors at its Fukushima nuclear plant, but efforts so far appear to have had little effect.      Special military fire trucks unleashed jets of water on a damaged reactor at the quake-hit plant on Thursday, after police were earlier forced to withdraw their own water cannon from the scene due to high levels of radiation.      While police must be outside to use their vehicle, the military vehicles are built to allow personnel to remain inside.      As well as water-spraying trucks, four twin-rotor Chinook helicopters from the Japan Self-Defence Forces flew water bombing missions over the plant, emptying tonnes of water onto reactors which have been overheating since being damaged by last Friday's earthquake and tsunami.      But there are serious doubts the water drops will have any major effect, with the amount of water each chopper drops a fraction of what is needed to fill the pool.      The focus of the missions appeared to be the No.3 reactor but there have been reports that only two out of the four water drops actually hit their mark, and the missions appeared to have little impact on the radiation levels.      Part of the reason why the water drops have not been that accurate is that they were not allowed to fly too low because of the radiation levels.      Defence minister Toshimi Kitazawa said an additional 11 military vehicles would be deployed for efforts to help cool the reactors, while pumps supplied by the US armed forces were also being transferred.      On Friday, water drops will start above the No.2 reactor, which has been letting off white smoke or steam.      Tokyo has denied claims that the spent fuel rods in the No. 4 reactor are totally exposed, with cabinet spokesman Yukio Edano saying there is still water inside.      The plant's operators are desperately trying to restore electricity supply so the cooling system can restart.      \\"We cannot tell when, but we want to restore the power source as soon as possible,\\" a spokesman for the plant's operators TEPCO told AFP.      Japan's foreign ministry spokesman Hidenobu Sobashima says the government is making every possible effort to contain the damage.      \\"We are not in a position to comment on whether the concern is unwarranted, but we understand the concern,\\" he said.      \\"The government is giving the advice which the government considers appropriate. We hope the international community monitors the situation in a calm manner, as the prime minister appealed to the residents and the people of Japan, to act calmly.\\"      As the fight for control of the reactors continued, Japan instructed local authorities to start screening food for radioactivity.      Australians have been told to leave the capital and other areas affected by the ongoing crisis.      The Department of Foreign Affairs has now widened its recommended exclusion zone for Australians around the Fukushima plant to 80 kilometres.      Japanese authorities had ordered people within 30 kilometres of the plant to evacuate or stay indoors.      This afternoon the Federal Government said the number of Australians unaccounted for in Japan had fallen to 20.      Call for volunteers      The Japanese government's nuclear safety agency has said the top priority should be pouring water into the fuel-rod pools at reactors three and four, which may be boiling and are not fully covered by roofs that would reduce radiation leaks.      Employees of TEPCO and other industry firms have volunteered to join efforts to control the escalating crisis, local media said.      TEPCO put out a call for about 20 volunteers to join the battle to bring the situation under control at the Fukushima No.1 plant, where last week's quake and tsunami knocked out the reactor cooling systems, Jiji Press reported.      Offers came in from TEPCO employees and others, including a 59-year-old man with four decades of experience working at nuclear power stations for a regional power company who was due to retire in six months, the report said.      Officials at TEPCO were not immediately available to confirm the reports.      TEPCO was preparing to restore outside power lines from Tohoku Electric Power Co., which serves the region, and connect its damaged electric transmission system with unaffected lines.      \\"At the moment, we are concentrating our efforts on this work,\\" he said.      \\"If the restoration work is completed, we will be able to activate various electric pumps and pour water into reactors and pools for spent nuclear fuel.\\"      The 9.0-magnitude quake, the biggest on record to strike Japan, knocked down electricity pylons which Tohoku had used to supply power to the TEPCO plant.      Some 70 workers have been using pumps to pour seawater to cool reactors at the plant, according to media reports, using electricity from borrowed mobile generators.      -ABC/wires      First posted ||||| Nuclear safety officials in France said they were \\"pessimistic\\" about whether engineers could prevent a meltdown at the Fukushima power plant after a pool containing spent fuel rods overheated and boiled dry.      Last night radiation levels were \\"extremely high\\" in the stricken building, which was breached by an earlier explosion, meaning that radiation could now escape into the atmosphere.      Tokyo Electric, the owners of the plant, said five workers had been killed at the site, two were missing and 21 had been injured.      Last night, a US nuclear safety chief said the Japanese government had failed to acknowledge the full seriousness of the situation at the Fukushima plant and that warnings to citizens had been insufficient and understated.      Gregory Jaczko, the chairman of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, warned that if \\"extremely high\\" radiation levels increased it would become impossible for workers to continue to take corrective measures at the plant as \\"the doses they could experience would potentially be lethal doses in a very short period of time\\".      As Japan resorted to increasingly desperate measures – including dumping water on the site from helicopters – there were accusations that the situation was now \\"out of control\\".      The Foreign Office responded to the latest developments by advising all British citizens to leave Tokyo – which is 140 miles south of the plant – and the whole of northern Japan. The EU has even urged member states to check Japanese food imports for radioactivity.      Emperor Akihito made a rare address to the nation, urging the Japanese to pull together, but hinted at his own fears for the nuclear crisis saying: \\"I hope things will not get worse.\\" In London, the FTSE–100 share index slumped as news of the latest emergency emerged, closing 1.7 per cent down.      The official death toll from last Friday's earthquake and tsunami stood at 4,314 last night, with another 8,606 listed as missing.      Thousands of people still waiting for food aid in the most remote areas of the disaster zone endured fresh misery yesterday as heavy snow began to fall across northern Japan. But all eyes were on the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant as Japanese authorities admitted concerns over rising temperatures in three pools containing spent fuel rods.      A failure of the cooling system that has crippled the entire plant led to water boiling in the No4 pool. Last night the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) said there was no water left in the pool, resulting in \\"extremely high\\" radiation levels. An earlier fire and explosion in the No 4 reactor building is thought to have breached the protective walls around the pool. A statement from the USNRC said: \\"We believe that secondary containment has been destroyed and there is no water in the spent fuel pool and we believe that radiation levels are extremely high which could possibly impact the ability to take corrective measures.\\"      If the water has gone, Mr Jaczko warned, there is nothing to stop the fuel rods from getting hotter and ultimately melting down. The outer shell of the rods could also ignite with enough force to propel the radioactive fuel inside over a wide area.      Jeremy Browne, the Foreign Office minister, said: \\"There is clearly an evolving situation and things are clearly getting worse at the Fukushima nuclear plant.\\"      Attempts to cool the site by dumping sea water from helicopters had to be aborted at one stage because of dangerous radiation levels in the air above the plant. A police water cannon was brought in to help blast water into the overheating reactors and pools, but there were warnings that it may be too late to prevent a disaster. Thierry Charles, a safety official at France's Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN), said: \\"The next 48 hours will be decisive. I am pessimistic because, since Sunday, I have seen that almost none of the solutions has worked.\\" He described the situation as \\"a major risk\\", but added: \\"All is not lost.\\"      Asked about the maximum possible amount of radioactive release, he said \\"it would be in the same range as Chernobyl\\".      The incident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine on April 26 1986 is estimated to have caused 57 direct deaths, with some 4,000 additional deaths from cancer.      Francois Baroin, a French government spokesman, went further, saying: \\"In the worst of cases, it could have an impact worse than Chernobyl.\\" He added: \\"They have visibly lost the essential of control.\\"      Malcolm Grimston, a British nuclear expert at the Chatham House think tank, played down suggestions of an impending disaster, saying Fukushima was not like Chernobyl.      \\"We're nearly five days after the fission process was stopped, the levels of radioactive iodine will only be about two–thirds of where they were at the start, some of the other, very short–lived, very radioactive material will be gone altogether by now,\\" he said.      Earlier, Nathalie Kosciusko–Morizet, France's ecology minister, had said that \\"the worst scenario is possible and even probable\\". At one point, radiation levels at the plant rose to such dangerous levels that all workers were evacuated from the site. A 180–strong team was later allowed back to continue attempts to cool the fuel rods, but the government raised the maximum allowable radiation exposure for workers from 100 millisieverts per year to 250, which it said was \\"unavoidable due to the circumstances\\".      Yukiya Amano, the International Atomic Energy Agency's director general, said the situation was \\"very serious\\". He is flying to Japan today for a first–hand briefing on the crisis. ||||| U.S. officials are alarmed at how the Japanese are handling the escalating nuclear reactor crisis and fear that if they do not get control of the plants within the next 24 to 48 hours they could have a situation that will be \\"deadly for decades.\\"      \\"It would be hard to describe how alarming this is right now,\\" one U.S. official told ABC News.      President Obama has been briefed by nuclear experts.      The Japanese have evacuated most of the reactor personnel from the Fukushima nuclear complex and are rotating teams of 50 workers through the facility in an attempt to cool it down.      \\"We are all-out urging the Japanese to get more people back in there to do emergency operation there, that the next 24 to 48 hours are critical,\\" the official said. \\"Urgent efforts are needed on the part of the Japanese to restore emergency operations to cool\\" down the reactors' rods before they trigger a meltdown.      \\"They need to stop pulling out people—and step up with getting them back in the reactor to cool it. There is a recognition this is a suicide mission,\\" the official said.      The official said the United States is in very deep consultations with Japanese about the way forward and that the only thing that has been favorable is the wind pattern that is blowing the contaminated material out to sea instead south towards Tokyo and other populated areas, but that can't be counted upon.      The U.S. official says experts believe there is a rupture in two, maybe three of the six reactors at the Fukushima power plant, but as worrisome is the fact that spent fuel rods are now exposed to the air, which means that substances like cesium, which have a long half-life, could become airborne.      \\"That could be deadly for decades,\\" the official said.      There is a growing concern around the world that a nuclear catastrophic disaster is in the works.      \\"There is talk of an apocalypse and I think the word is particularly well chosen,\\" European Union's energy commissioner Günther Oettinger said today, according to various reports. \\"Practically everything is out of control. I cannot exclude the worst in the hours and days to come.\\"      The United States has instituted a 50-mile evacuation zone for U.S. forces and American citizens from the Fukushima power plant, four times the size of Japan's 12-mile evacuation zone. Only exceptions that are made are for relief missions.      \\"Recently the NRC made a recommendation that based on the available information that we have, that for a comparable situation in the United States, we would recommend an evacuation to a much larger radius than has currently been provided in Japan,\\" Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Greg Jaczko said at a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee.      Jaczko said of the four plants that are endangered at the Fukushima site, there has been a hydrogen explosion at one unit and secondary containment has been destroyed.      \\"We believe radiation levels are extremely high, which could possibly impact ability to take corrective measures,\\" he said.      U.S. analysis show that some of the radiation from the Fukushima nuclear power plant has drifted northward and out to sea, officials say, but the country is hardly clear of danger.      U.S. Fears Japan's Crisis Could Be Worse Than Chernobyl      Thousands of people flocked to Tokyo's Narita Airport today amid rising concerns of a radioactive fallout.      The head of the U.S. Department of Energy said today that the nuclear disaster unfolding in Japan could be worse than the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in Pennsylvania that dampened Americans' view of nuclear power plants for decades to come.      \\"Events unfolding in the Japan incidents appear to be more serious than Three Mile Island. To what extent, we don't know that. They are unfolding hour by hour,\\" Energy Secretary Steven Chu said earlier today at the hearing.      Chu's assessment is in line with views expressed by many experts, some of whom even believe the Japan crisis could be worse than the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine that left hundreds sick and killed several from radiation.      The United States has deployed thousands of military and civilian staff to assist the Japanese in dealing with the aftermath of the earthquake and the resulting tsunami, which has killed thousands.      To date there have been 113 helicopter missions and 125 fixed wing missions. More than 129,000 pounds of water and 4,200 pounds of food have been delivered .      The Department of Energy and Nuclear Regulatory Commission has sent teams of U.S. experts to assess the nuclear situation.      U.S. aid to Japan has reached nearly 5.9 million, with total planned assistance amounting to 8 million. USAID says the primary humanitarian needs on the ground remain food, safe drinking water, blankets, medical supplies, fuel, and sanitation infrastructure.      ABC News' Huma Khan and Luis Martinez contributed to this report. ||||| Japan's nuclear crisis now hangs largely on whether it can get control over the radioactive waste held in pools of water at the troubled Fukushima Daiichi power plant.      Workers have struggled to cool the used nuclear-fuel rods held in these pools, in an urgent fight to prevent a release of significant quantities of radiation into the environment.      On Thursday morning, helicopters from the Self Defense Forces, Japan's version of the military, began dumping water over the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power complex, according to government broadcaster NHK.      Spent Fuel at Risk View Interactive All through the Fukushima plant, efforts are focused on keeping cool water over nuclear fuel rods in reactor cores and in pools where spent fuel is stored. More photos and interactive graphics      On Wednesday, Scott Burnell, spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said, \\"We now understand that conditions for the spent fuel pool in Reactor 4 are very serious.\\" He added that \\"our understanding is the conditions have deteriorated.\\"      The waste—used fuel rods from the six reactors—continues to be highly radioactive even when it is no longer useful for generating electricity and is removed from the reactor core.      To prevent the used fuel rods from heating up, sustaining damage, and then releasing radiation, they must be continually cooled by water for many years.      The Fukushima complex has seven pools serving six reactors. On Wednesday, officials acknowledged they faced serious cooling problems with at least four of the pools.      So far, at least two pools have lost enough water to expose fuel rods to the air, allowing them to overheat and release hydrogen gas. The gas is a product of the breakdown of zirconium cladding that encases fuel rods.      Nuclear physicist James Acton and WSJ's Lee Hotz discuss whether Japan can avoid nuclear disaster as workers scramble to cool the overheating spent fuel at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant.      The rods, known as spent fuel, are stored on an upper floor adjacent to, and at the same height as, the reactor. That keeps the distance the fuel rods must be moved to a minimum and was supposed to protect them from tsunamis.      However—unlike the reactor core, which is surrounded by a strong steel vessel—the only shielding between the radioactive waste and the outside air is concrete.      Increased heating and consequent damage to the fuel rods could mean \\"that there's a clear pathway for the release of radionuclides,\\" or radioactive materials, said Edward Lyman, a physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists.      As the water in the pool heats up and evaporates, the vapor carries some radioactive elements, including tritium gas. Worse, if the water level drops and exposes the spent fuel, those rods can suffer the same type of damage—a partial or full meltdown—that can occur to a reactor core.      \\"If the temperature continues to increase, you reach a point where the fuel pellets can melt,\\" Dr. Lyman said. As a result, \\"a lot of fission products will start to bubble out.\\"      Smoke rising from the plant's No. 3 reactor indicates that a pool where spent fuel rods are stored within the building had dried out, a spokesman for utility operator Tokyo Electric Power Co. said. The water from the helicopters was aimed at this pool.      Gregory Jaczko, chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said he believes there could be a crack in the spent fuel pool, increasing the risk that water drains from the pool and leads to overheating.      The pool at unit 4 is especially worrying.      Its fuel rods were removed from the reactor core in December 2010, and therefore contain a high level of radioactivity and are generating more heat than used fuel rods stored elsewhere at the Fukushima site.      The spent fuel pool at that unit has lost all or most of its water and radiation levels \\"are extremely high,\\" Mr. Jaczko said.      It is unclear what the condition is of the seventh and largest pool that holds approximately 65% of used fuel rods from the six reactors, but they are likely the oldest and coolest.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Guttermouth is an American punk rock band formed in 1988 in Huntington Beach, California and currently recording for Rude Records/Bird Attack Records. They have released nine full-length studio albums and two live albums and have toured extensively, including performances on the Vans Warped Tour. They are infamous for their outrageous lyrics and behavior which are deliberately explicit, offensive and intended to shock, though usually in a humorous and sarcastic manner. This behavior has sometimes resulted in high-profile problems for the band, such as being banned from performing in Canada for eighteen months and leaving the 2004 Warped Tour amidst controversy over their political views and attitudes towards other performers. The following year found the band returning home to California and experiencing a lineup change. Clint Weinrich married in the spring of 1995, and to fill in for him on a European tour the band recruited Steve \\"Stever\\" Rapp, a college friend of Nunn's who was playing in a band called The Grabbers. Things worked out well with Rapp on this tour and he soon became the band's permanent bass player. The new lineup entered the studio and recorded their third album Teri Yakimoto. By all accounts the recording process was plagued with problems, and at one point most of the recordings were scrapped and re-recorded with a new producer. The result was an album that continued the fast and sarcastic Guttermouth tradition but was more melodic and pop-influenced than their previous albums. The band continued to tour and expand their fan base, and filmed a music video for the song \\"Whiskey.\\" With their popularity growing Nitro Records re-released Full Length in CD format with bonus tracks under the title The Album Formerly Known as Full Length LP.  In 1997 the band recorded Musical Monkey, an album which captured their chaotic energy and sharp sense of humor. It is considered by many to be the best representation of their \\"classic\\" sound, and songs such as \\"Lucky the Donkey,\\" \\"Do the Hustle,\\" \\"Lipstick\\" and \\"Perfect World\\" became staples in their live set. The following year they released Live From the Pharmacy, a recording of a live show from 1994 that also included four new songs engineered by Vandals guitarist Warren Fitzgerald and liner notes written by Nunn recounting the band's history. In 1998 Guttermouth was banned from performing in Canada for one year on charges of public indecency after Adkins exposed himself onstage in Saskatoon. According to Adkins: \\"oh, I was guilty [...] What I would do is grab two young girls out of the audience and I would have them hold up this sheet in front of me, and Jamie, the drummer at the time, would say this magical incantation, if you will, and I would be standing there stark naked.\\" Combined with a drunk driving charge from the United States, the incident led Adkins to be arrested on immigration charges, detained for five days, and then deported, though Guttermouth would return to Canada a few years later. After obtaining a full pardon from the Canadian judicial system known as the crown. No record remains on file.  Rapp left the band in 1999, at which point Nunn moved from drums to bass and new drummer William \\"Ty\\" Smith was brought in. That year the band recorded and released Gorgeous, their most aggressive album to date and their final album for Nitro. Who replaced Rapp after he left the band?","output":"After Steve \\"Stever\\" Rapp left Guttermouth in 1999, the band went through a lineup change. Derek Nunn, who was originally the drummer, moved to play bass to replace Rapp. Subsequently, a new drummer named William \\"Ty\\" Smith was brought in to fill the vacant drummer position."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

REAGAN'S FIGHT - VARIED ENEMIES ON MANY FRONTS - News An alysis - NYTimes.com WASHINGTON, Sept. 16— In proposing only marginal cuts in military spending and further major cuts in domestic spending, President Reagan has decided to remain faithful to his central campaign pledges and has taken the biggest gamble of his young Administration. Instead of husbanding his power, as he did so successfully over the first eight months, he now has to take on several major fights at once, with conservatives and liberals alike, over a fistful of foreign and domestic issues. By all Administration accounts, Mr. Reagan still deeply believes that his economic policy will work, despite increasing doubts even in his own team, and that substantial increases in military strength are the core of a successful foreign policy, despite warnings by allied leaders that diplomatic avenues are being neglected. They Say He Won't Bargain Much Most of these same officials say that their chief will stick to his positions and is unlikely to bargain much, behaving as he did in the air traffic controllers strike. As these officials explain it, Mr. Reagan has made his budget decisions in such an unbending and public way that they think he has deliberately circumscribed his own flexibility, trying to give members of his own party no choice but to back him and making the stakes very high for the Democrats who oppose him. As Administration officials see the situation, the list of possible combatants has grown: Wall Street and the Federal Reserve Bank over high interest rates; Congress over another slash into politically important domestic programs; Congressional supporters of Israel who seek to block the sale of the advanced Awacs radar aircraft to Saudi Arabia; and yet another Congressional coalition if Mr. Reagan decides, as expected, to go forward with the MX missile system. Thought One Was Behind Him As described by several midlevel political appointees in the Administration, Mr. Reagan did not expect two months ago to have to fight on all fronts at once. Then, it looked as if the battle over the economy was behind him and that he could concentrate on national security issues. The White House timetable was to make the decision on how to base the new multibillion-dollar MX missile late in July or early in August, dealing with the critics before the summer was over, and then move to counter Congressional opposition to the Awacs sale in September and October. But the MX decision began to drag. First, Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger wanted to scrap entirely the Carter Administration's idea of shuttling 200 MX missiles among 4,600 shelters and launch the missiles instead from aircraft. When this idea got knocked down, Mr. Weinberger proposed a scaled-down version of the Carter plan. Even now, Mr. Reagan has not made a final decision. The shifting of proposals and the delays have led to questions from Congress and diplomatic circles whether the Reagan Administration will have much confidence in its own decisions. This is even more the case because as the summer wore on, money and the economy began to reassert themselves as issues. The 30 billion to 50 billion needed to build the MX system, and the 1.5 trillion for the military, over all, in the next five years, looked like inviting targets for budget cuts as interest rates remained high and the economy slowed. Wall Street Turns on Plan Wall Street analysts, without warning and contrary to the line mostof them took only a few months earlier, began to turn against the Reagan econom ic plan on the ground that it was not bringing interest rates down. T he Congressional Budget Office and some of Mr. Reagan's own economist s began predicting much higher budget deficits than expected in t he current fiscal year and foresaw no balanced budget, as Mr. Reagan had promised, for the fiscal year ending Sept 30, 1984. To make matters worse, Mr. Weinberger and David A. Stockman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, carried the argument about where to make cuts into the public arena. White House aides expressed unhappiness over this byplay because it was putting Mr. Reagan in the corner: If he backed Mr. Weinberger, the economic plan would collapse; and if he backed Mr. Stockman, national security would be undermined. As the betting on compromise spread, as it seemed that Mr. Reagan would take about half of the needed 75 billion in additional budget cuts for 1983 and 1984 from the Pentagon, he decided instead to limit the Pentagon's cuts to 12 billion over the three years. Return Request Termed Damaging A number of Congressional and Administration economists are now saying that even a 75 billion reduction would not be sufficient to balance the budget in 1984. If this reduction is insufficient and Mr. Reagan has to return to Congress in six months and ask for more, Administration officials feel it could destroy the confidence that Mr. Reagan has said is essential to the success of his economic plan. By the same token, if Mr. Reagan fails to weather votes of disapproval in the House and Senate on the Awacs sale, Pentagon and State Department officials say this would eliminate an essential ingredient of the ''strategic consensus'' the Administration seeks in the Middle East. Avoiding Congressional disapproval might require Mr. Reagan to make some compromises on the sale, and Administration officials say they see no signs of this. The message being sent out from the White House is that the President intends to fight on all fronts. This is his style of leadership, they say, and he is prepared to risk almost everything that he will be able to win. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"President Reagan's administration faced multiple challenges domestically and internationally, as he proposed marginal cuts in military spending and further cuts in domestic spending, facing opposition from both conservatives and liberals. Reagan had to navigate high-stakes battles over budget decisions, interest rates, foreign policy, and defense systems, while the confidence in his economic plan and leadership was under scrutiny."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Case Closed: Strategy Above the Depths Movie plot: The 9th annual Detective Conan movie sets sail on a 100 million yen luxurious cruise. Fifteen years ago, a cruise named Yashiromaru, built by the Yashiro group, sank while sailing. In the present, a new cruise, the Saint Aphrodite, was built by the Yashiro group and Conan and the rest were invited through Sonoko. Earlier, the husband of the CEO of the Yashiro family group, an established ship architect, had a heart-attack and drove his car down a cliff. On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing. He had been thrown off the cruise into the ocean, seemingly by the same person. At the welcoming party, Kogorou shows off his deduction skills, and concluded that the sub-designer of the cruise, Akiyoshi, was the murderer. However, Conan has different ideas. Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance. His father was murdered when he discovered the captain of the ship was drugged and left to die. Kusaka immediately set off bombs and escaped by sea and the Detective Boys gave chase. After they successfully took down the criminal, more bombs were ignited. All passengers were evacuated, but Ran returned to her hiding place during the hide-and-seek game to find a \\"gold medal\\" made by sea-shells the Detective Boys made for her. However, as the ship swayed, she fainted in the enclosed area.It turns out Akiyoshi was the main murderer after all, and she was the one who did all three killings and made Kusaka think that he did them himself. She also revealed that her father was the captain who died while the cruise ship sank. Kogorou, however, deduced correctly this time and managed to arrest Akiyoshi. He was originally trying to find evidence to prove her innocence because of her strong resemblance to his wife, but the more investigation he does, the more... My question: Why was the Yashiromaru sunk fifteen years earlier? Answer:","output":"The Yashiromaru was sunk fifteen years earlier as part of an insurance fraud scheme. The individuals behind the scheme, which included some members of the Yashiro group, planned to deliberately sink the ship to collect the insurance money. They believed that by sinking the Yashiromaru, they would be able to profit financially from the insurance payout. Kusaka, the scriptwriter and one of the main characters in the movie, later reveals that his father was murdered when he uncovered the truth about the insurance fraud. His father had discovered that the captain of the Yashiromaru was drugged and left to die as part of the plan to sink the ship. This prompted Kusaka to seek justice for his father's death and expose the truth about the Yashiromaru's sinking. Throughout the movie, the characters work to uncover the truth behind the series of murders and mysterious events related to the Yashiromaru and its successor, the Saint Aphrodite. Ultimately, they learn that Akiyoshi, the sub-designer of the cruise, was the main murderer and had masterminded the entire plot. Akiyoshi was motivated by a desire for revenge, as her father was the captain who died in the Yashiromaru sinking. In summary, the Yashiromaru was sunk fifteen years earlier due to an insurance fraud scheme orchestrated by members of the Yashiro group, including Akiyoshi. The sinking of the ship led to a series of murders and other tragic events in the present day, as those who were wronged or had uncovered the truth about the scheme sought justice and revenge."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She also is an adjunct professor in the UM law school's Civil Law Clinic. She held a similar post a few years ago in the school's Elder Law Clinic. Kilgore says she's found her niche. \\"I've always thought it was important to do work to help people. I really enjoy it. The issues I've dealt with through the years have been on the side of helping people maintain the basics of life - home, healt h care, jobs and family.\\" She says her desire to serve others was sparked early, growing up in a single-parent home, aware that her widowed mother faced certain challenges as she supported her four children through public school and college.

Based on the information provided, Catherine V. \\"Ginny\\" Kilgore graduated from the University of Mississippi School of Law in 1975 and entered private law practice in Oxford before joining North Mississippi Rural Legal Services (NMRLS) in 1978. She then held various positions within the organization until she started working in the Administrative Law Unit and Resource Development in 1990. So, it took her 15 years (from 1975 to 1990) to start working in the Administrative Law Unit and Resource Development after her graduation."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: If you see policemen outside wearing safety vest and holding flashlights, what are they doing?

I can use this background: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.  Now, I have a new situation: John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory.  Answer this question please: Which tetrapod would live shorter, tetA or tetB? The answer to this question is:","output":"According to Aristotle's theory, the tetrapod that would live a shorter life would be tetB. In the information given about the characteristics of tetA and tetB, it is mentioned that an adult tetA is heavier than an adult tetB and also that tetA has a longer gestation period than tetB.  Aristotle's theory on the life-history features of live-bearing tetrapods, translated into simple terms, makes these predictions:  1. The heavier the adult body mass, the longer the mammal's lifespan. In the comparison between an elephant and a mouse, which Aristotle used, the elephant, being much heavier, lives longer. Based on this, since tetA is stated to be heavier than tetB, the theory would predict that tetA would live longer than tetB. 2. Aristotle's theory also proposes that lifespan increases with gestation period, with mammals having a longer gestation period tending to live longer. Elephants again serve as an example of this with their notably long gestation period and correspondingly long lifespan. As stated, tetA has a longer gestation period than tetB. Following Aristotle's inference, this would again suggest that tetA would have a longer lifespan than tetB. It is worth mentioning that there are always exceptions in nature and life-history characteristics can also be influenced by many other factors such as the rate of predation, availability of food resources and disease. However, strictly speaking, according to Aristotle's interpretations, tetB would live a shorter life compared to tetA due to having a lower adult body mass and a shorter gestation period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The justification for this is to isolate the term with the variable z on one side of the equation. After we subtract 769 from both sides of the equation, we get: 210 = -21*z. Step 2: Divide both sides by -21. The justification for this is to solve for the z variable. When we divide both sides by -21, we get: z = 210 / -21.

Question: suppose Food is scarce happens, how will it affect More bats come.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"In the scenario where food scarcity occurs, this can have a significant impact on the bat population. The relationship between food availability and an increase in bat numbers is closely linked, as the availability of food resources directly influences bat reproduction, survival rates, and overall population dynamics. A decrease in food availability may lead to the following effects: 1. Less reproduction: Bats require ample food resources to sustain their energy and reproductive needs. Food scarcity can cause bats to delay or reduce their reproductive efforts, leading to fewer offspring being born, and hence, a slower growth rate in their population. 2. Lower survival rates: Food scarcity increases competition among bats for limited resources, resulting in weaker individuals being unable to secure enough food to survive. This leads to a higher mortality rate and a reduction in the overall bat population. 3. Migration and habitat shifts: Bats may respond to food scarcity by changing their foraging behavior or migrating to other areas with more abundant food sources. This can lead to a local decrease in bat numbers as they move elsewhere in search of food. However, this may only be a temporary solution, as increased competition for resources in areas with more bats may eventually cause the same issues. 4. Population fluctuations: Bats are known to experience natural population fluctuations based on food availability and other environmental factors. Food scarcity may exacerbate these fluctuations, making it difficult to determine whether there is a long-term impact on bat populations. Overall, food scarcity is likely to result in a decrease in bat numbers due to a combination of reduced reproduction, increased mortality, and potential changes in habitat use. In summary, the supposed perturbation of food scarcity would have a \\"less\\" effect on the occurrence of more bats. It is essential to address food scarcity issues to maintain healthy bat populations and the ecosystems they inhabit, as bats play a vital role in controlling insect populations and pollination."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph: The only home Hamilton ever owned was a Federal style mansion designed by John McComb Jr., which he built on his 32-acre country estate in Hamilton Heights in upper Manhattan. He named the house, which was completed in 1802, the \\"Grange\\" after his grandfather Alexander's estate in Ayrshire, Scotland. The house remained in the family until 1833 when his widow sold it to Thomas E. Davis, a British born real estate developer, for 25,000. Part of the proceeds were used by Eliza to purchase a new townhouse from Davis (Hamilton-Holly House) in Greenwich Village with her son Alexander. The Grange, first moved from its original location in 1889, was moved again in 2008 to a spot in St. Nicholas Park on land that was once part of the Hamilton estate, in Hamilton Heights, a neighborhood in upper Manhattan. The historic structure was restored to its original 1802 appearance in 2011, and is maintained by the National Park service as Hamilton Grange National Memorial. Alexander Hamilton served as one of the first trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy in New York state. Later the Academy received a college charter in 1812, and the school was formally renamed Hamilton College.Columbia University, Hamilton's alma mater, has official memorials to Hamilton on its campus in New York City. The college's main classroom building for the humanities is Hamilton Hall, and a large statue of Hamilton stands in front of it. The university press has published his complete works in a multivolume letterpress edition.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"how is the change of a liquid to a gas measured?\\" is \\"joules\\", given that  boiling means changing from liquid to a gas by adding joules ? Choose from: (1). Yes. (2). No. Answer:","output":"(2). No. The change of a liquid to a gas is a phase transition, which involves a change in energy. While Joules is a unit used to measure energy, it is not a direct answer to the question. The process of measuring this change specifically addresses the combined aspects of heat transfer, internal energy changes, and possibly pressure and temperature. To measure the change of a liquid to a gas, one must examine a few factors: 1. The amount of heat (Q) added or removed to initiate the phase change, which is commonly measured in Joules (J). 2. The specific heat capacity (c), which is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of a substance by 1 degree Celsius. This value varies depending on the substance. 3. The increase or decrease in temperature (ΔT) before the phase change occurs. 4. The mass of the substance (m). 5. The latent heat of vaporization (L), which is the energy required to change a substance from liquid to gas without a change in temperature. Using these variables, the process can be measured by the formula:  Q = m(L + cΔT) Where Q represents the total heat exchange, m is the mass of the substance, L is the latent heat of vaporization, c is the specific heat capacity, and ΔT is the change in temperature. In summary, Joules is indeed a unit to measure energy, but answering \\"Joules\\" in this context does not adequately explain how the change of a liquid to a gas is measured. Instead, one needs to consider heat transfer, specific heat capacity, mass, latent heat of vaporization, and the change in temperature."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? I was first introduce to this place almost over 5 years ago and it started out great but I think I might have to break up with Teharu.   I'm more interested in the food so I'll start with that. I always get my usual when I go here and it's always Hawaiian, Vegas, Dragon, and Bake scallop. Now I live in East Mesa so it is a good 30 minutes drive to get here and let me tell you, it used to be worth it. The last 5 times I've been here has been a miss. Vegas roll was always cold, kind of defeat the whole purpose of having a deep fried roll? No? The Hawaiian roll, which is spicy tuna roll with tuna on top and spicy mayo is always unbearably spicy because I think they are trying to mask away fishy flavour since their fish isn't the greatest of quality, which I knew for the price wasn't going to be the greatest already so when it's extremely spicy, then i can't eat it so...?  Now what annoys me is the bake scallop because that was my absolute favorite but lately it's always been disgusting. Like it has a pee smell on the scallop so when you eat it, you feel like your eating someone's piss.   I never get to try new rolls anymore because the ones on the belt most of the time looks dried and like it's been there since they opened up for the day. And there's usually 1 left, what's so hard about replenishing it? Or do they wait for that one customer who just eats anything to eat it before they put out more? That's another thing that erks me, if you're a conveyer belt sushi, shouldn't you have someone dedicated to constantly stock the belt with a variety of sushi so that customers can grab? Lately it seems that they focus on orders more and then the belt becomes empty and sad.  When can the price of something stop being accountable for the quality you get? Yeah it's cheap but when can we stop saying, oh for the price it's not bad. And this is why restaurants continue to lack and not improve.   Oh and for the waiters and waitresses there, I'm not even going to waste my time writing about them because the don't bother wasting their time serving me.   So long story short.

Write an article based on this \\"A petition calling for Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump to be barred from entering the UK has gathered more than 370,000 names, so MPs will have to consider debating it.\\" Article:","output":"Title: A Rising Up Against Trump: Petition to Bar the Controversial Presidential Hopeful from the UK  Introduction:  In a historic demonstration of protest, more than 370,000 people have signed a petition calling for Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump to be barred from entering the United Kingdom. Responding to the overwhelming public outcry, Members of Parliament (MPs) must now consider debating the legitimacy of the petition and its ramifications on a multinational level. In the midst of a turbulent political landscape, this move against Trump highlights the deepening divisions surrounding his candidacy and has sparked conversation on the role of global involvement in national politics.  I. The Origin of the Movement and Grounds for the Petition The online petition, which has now exceeded well over 370,000 signatures, first attracted widespread attention after Trump proposed a temporary halt on Muslims entering the United States. This came in response to what he perceived as a growing international security threat, which included incidents like the Paris terrorist attacks and the San Bernardino shooting. Consequently, Trump’s divisive rhetoric and controversial policy proposal provided the primary impetus for the petition. Additionally, this movement against Trump stems from what many perceive as his blatant disregard for civil liberties and basic human rights. His discriminatory rhetoric has also been fueled by his inflammatory comments against women, ethnic minorities, and individuals with disabilities. II. Reaction from International Diplomats and the United Nations While the petition has garnered attention and support from thousands worldwide, including notable public figures and politicians, international diplomats and United Nations officials have strongly condemned Trump's proposed policies as \\"truly shocking” and \\"inherently discriminating.\\" A spokesperson for United Nations human rights chief, Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, stated that Trump's statements and policy proposals reflect the very xenophobic attitudes and principles that world leaders have committed to combating over the years. Zeid also expressed concern that if these proposals were executed, they could lead to further discrimination and infringement on human rights. III. Precedents for Barring Entry into the UK and the Legal Ramifications The UK Home Office has previously used its authority to deny entry to individuals who are believed to have engaged in unacceptable behavior or pose a genuine threat to public safety. Individuals who have been barred from the UK include anti-Islamic pastor Terry Jones, far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders, and conservative talk show host Michael Savage. However, barring Trump from the UK would not only have legal implications but also potential ramifications on international diplomacy. Preventing him from entering the country could exacerbate tensions between the United States and the UK, straining their longstanding alliance and potentially influencing shared policy initiatives. Furthermore, it could set a dangerous precedent of international interference in the electoral politics of sovereign nations. IV. The Potential Parliamentary Debate and the Voice of the Public As a result of the sheer number of signatures, UK MPs are obliged to consider debating the petition, giving a platform to the concerns of the thousands of individuals who have voiced their discontent with Trump’s proposed policies. The debate could take place in the House of Commons, a public setting that would draw substantial media attention and hold significant weight. The prospect of a parliamentary debate is powerful; it not only underscores the importance of the public's voice in the political process but also the ability of people from various nations to unite in solidarity against perceived injustice. This signals a significant moment in political history, where the role of global citizenship in shaping national politics is becoming increasingly evident. Conclusion: The petition to bar Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump from the UK represents an extraordinary response to both his controversial policy proposals and his divisive rhetoric. As MPs consider debating, and ultimately deciding on the matter, this issue ultimately underscores the importance of public opinion in today's political landscape and raises questions about the role of global citizenship in matters of national politics. Regardless of the outcome, one thing is certain — the widespread attention to this petition reflects an ever-growing commitment to ensuring that civil liberties and human rights are upheld around the world."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Bach structured the cantata in eight movements: an instrumental sinfonia and seven vocal movements corresponding to the stanzas of the hymn. The duration is given as 22 minutes.The title of the original parts of the first Leipzig performance is (in Johann Christoph Altnickol's handwriting): \\"Feria Paschatos / Christ lag in Todes Banden / a.4. Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work.  The other performances (24 April 1707, 8 April 1708, and 9 April 1724) were performed without brass instruments (i.e., Cornetto and three Trombones).

Each colorful burst from the vegetables was a testament to the painstaking effort and care that went into the crafting of this dish, and the chef couldn't help but feel a sense of pride welling up inside of him. He knew that the person he was now, this accomplished chef, was a product of his journey, from the days in his grandmother's kitchen to the prestigious culinary schools, and now, his own thriving business. The now empty table signified a new chapter in his life, where he continued to create culinary masterpieces that filled the stomachs and hearts of those who tasted them, each dish representing a beautiful and ever-evolving symphony of flavors, textures, and memories. No matter where his journey may take him next, he would never forget the fulfillment and joy that came from cooking, from transforming an empty pot or table into a work of abundant love and flavor.

In order to secure the throne, General Sapt and his nephew Fritz travel to London, where the King's son, Rudolf V (Sellers), resides and lives through the day in London's pleasure establishments; but the King's demented half-brother Michael (Kemp), thinking that he is the better claimant, sends an assassin after them. Hansom cab driver Sydney (or Sidney) Frewin (Sellers), the new King's half-brother from an affair with a British actress, rescues Rudolf from an assassination attempt. Once his resemblance to the King is noticed, Frewin is hired by the general ostensibly as the King's coachman, but actually to play the role of decoy. The ruse is quickly uncovered, however, when during an attack by Michael's men the royal guardsmen address Frewin as their new king, and the two look-alikes get acquainted. In an unattended moment, Rudolf is captured and brought to Michael's castle of Zenda. Out of necessity, Frewin has to keep masquerading as the King for the coronation ceremony. Princess Flavia, Rudolf's fiancÃ©e (Frederick), is perceptive enough to see through the ruse, and after Frewin and the general have confided in her, she quickly becomes Frewin's trusted ally and love interest. Complicating the scheme on Frewin's side is the jealous Count Montparnasse whose wife (Sommer) has become infatuated with Rudolf, and on Michael's side by his mistress, Antoinette, who is wildly jealous about the prospect of Michael marrying Flavia and in turn is the love interest of the slightly unbalanced Rupert von Henzau, Michael's second-in-command. After several assassination attempts, Michael attempts to lure Frewin into a trap. While the trap fails, Frewin, acting as Henzau's coach driver, is recognized and captured upon arrival in Zenda.

Triumph and Disaster: The 20th century saw a stupendous release of energies that had been pent up for the 250 years of Tokugawa isolation. By 1930 raw-material production had tripled the figure of 1900, manufactured goods had increased twelve-fold, and heavy industry was galloping towards maturity. Britain led the World War I Ailies in large orders for munitions, while Japan expanded sales of manufactured goods to Asian and other markets cut off from their usual European suppliers. Merchant shipping doubled in size and increased its income ten-fold as the European fleets were destroyed. Setbacks in the 1930s caused by the European postwar slump were only a spur to redouble efforts by diversifying heavy industry into the machine-making, metallurgical, and chemical sectors. Even the terrible 1923 Tokyo earthquake, which cost over 100,000 lives and billions of dollars, provided another stimulus due to the construction boom that followed. Riding the crest of this economic upsurge were the zaibatsu conglomerates — a dozen family-run combines, each involved in mining, manufacturing, marketing, shipping, and banking. These tightly controlled commercial pyramids were the true heirs to the old feudal structures. Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals. They proclaimed Japan's mission to bring progress to its backward Asian neighbors in language not so very different from that of the Europeans in Africa or the US in Latin America. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Soviet Union was regarded as a major threat to Japan's security, and the army felt it needed Manchuria and whatever other Chinese territory it could control as a buffer against Russian advances. In 1931 the Japanese occupied Manchuria. And then in 1937, with the popular support of ultra-right-wing groups, the army overrode parliamentary resistance in Tokyo and went to war against the Chinese Nationalists. By 1938, they held Nanking, Hankow, and Canton. Japanese expansionist policies were leading to direct confrontation with the West. Japan hoped that war in Europe would divert the Soviet Union from interference in East Asia, giving Japan a free hand both in China and, through its alliance with Germany, in French IndoChina after the defeat of France. The US responded to the Japanese invasion of IndoChina with a trade and fuel embargo, cutting off 90 percent of Japan's supplies. The result was the attack on the American fleet at Pearl Harbor (7 December 1941) and total war.

Passage: Bowie declared himself gay in an interview with Michael Watts for a 1972 issue of Melody Maker, coinciding with his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust. According to Buckley, \\"If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality.\\" In a September 1976 interview with Playboy, Bowie said, \\"It's true—I am a bisexual. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the best thing that ever happened to me.\\" His first wife, Angie, supports his claim of bisexuality and alleges that Bowie had a relationship with Mick Jagger.In a 1983 interview with Rolling Stone, Bowie said his public declaration of bisexuality was \\"the biggest mistake I ever made\\" and \\"I was always a closet heterosexual.\\" On other occasions, he said his interest in homosexual and bisexual culture had been more a product of the times and the situation in which he found himself than of his own feelings.Blender asked Bowie in 2002 whether he still believed his public declaration was his biggest mistake. After a long pause, he said, \\"I don't think it was a mistake in Europe, but it was a lot tougher in America. I had no problem with people knowing I was bisexual. But I had no inclination to hold any banners nor be a representative of any group of people.\\" Bowie said he wanted to be a songwriter and performer rather than a headline for his bisexuality, and in \\"puritanical\\" America, \\"I think it stood in the way of so much I wanted to do.\\"Buckley wrote that Bowie \\"mined sexual intrigue for its ability to shock\\", and was probably \\"never gay, nor even consistently actively bisexual\\", instead experimenting \\"out of a sense of curiosity and a genuine allegiance with the 'transgressional'.\\" Biographer Christopher Sandford said, according to Mary Finnigan—with whom Bowie had an affair in 1969—the singer and his first wife Angie \\"created their bisexual fantasy\\". Sandford wrote that Bowie \\"made a positive fetish of repeating the quip that he and his wife had met while 'fucking the same bloke' ... Gay sex was always an anecdotal and laughing matter. That Bowie's actual tastes swung the other way is clear from even a partial tally of his affairs with women.\\" The BBC's Mark Easton wrote in 2016 that Britain was \\"far more tolerant of difference\\" and that gay rights, such as same-sex marriage, and gender equality would not have \\"enjoyed the broad support they do today without Bowie's androgynous challenge all those years ago\\".  Question: What is the name of the person who claims he was always a closet heterosexual? A:","output":"Part #1: Identify the person who claims he was always a closet heterosexual. Usage: In the passage, it is stated that \\"Bowie said his public declaration of bisexuality was 'the biggest mistake I ever made' and 'I was always a closet heterosexual.'\\" This meets the criteria because it identifies Bowie as the person who claims he was always a closet heterosexual.

Article: SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email      Weight Watchers is betting its future on two letters.      The health-and-wellness company is changing its name to WW, as Chief Executive Officer Mindy Grossman tries to draw more consumers to the weight-loss program in a bid to extend the momentum fueled by Oprah Winfrey’s embrace of the brand nearly three years ago.      Weight Watchers, which has been updating its technology and reshaping its diet plan, becomes the latest company to embrace its initials. And as Grossman puts her stamp on the brand, she’s pulling from a playbook used at Home Shopping Network, where she mounted a turnaround at the company that had switched its corporate name to HSN.      \\"We will go through a period where people will have to understand Weight Watchers reimagined,\\" Grossman said in an interview last week at WW headquarters in Manhattan.      As part of WW’s move to focus on overall health, the company is launching a program in the U.S. next month where members earn rewards including products for tracking meals, activity and weight. The WW app will be updated on Oct. 4, and starting in January 2019, WW products sold directly to consumers will have no artificial sweeteners or preservatives. WW shares are up less than 1 percent, after earlier falling as much as 1.7 percent.      Cyclicality      There’s mounting pressure on Grossman to prove she can sustain the Oprah-fueled turnaround. The company’s shares have gained nearly 60 percent this year, after surging almost 300 percent in 2017 as advertisements featuring the well-known media mogul helped bring customers back to the weight-loss program after a difficult stretch that saw the company’s shares sink below 4 in 2015.      Shares of WW took a hit in August after the company posted second-quarter results, causing a 15 percent selloff the next day. While WW reported profit that topped estimates, the full-year guidance and subscriber forecast drew concern from SunTrust analyst Michael Swartz.      Grossman stands proudly behind the quarter’s results, noting the number of subscribers in the quarter increased by 1 million from the year-ago period. \\"I think its ultimately educating people that yeah, we have growth, but there is some cyclicality to the business,\\" she said.      Winfrey took a stake in the company and agreed to pitch the brand in October 2015, sending the shares flying. At the time, Weight Watchers was heavily in debt, and suffering through subscriber losses amid the rise of fitness apps. Grossman succeeded Chief Executive Jim Chambers in July 2017.      Now, in her reshaping of the company, Grossman’s changes include a new product look to reflect the updated design of WW. And she’s taking a page from her time at HSN, where she turned the company from a staid shopping channel into a lifestyle brand, transforming its image from an outlet known for pushing products like the Suzanne Somers ThighMaster. The TV shopping network was acquired by QVC’s parent company Liberty Interactive, in a 2.1 billion deal earlier this year.      \\"What Mindy has done with the brand has been nothing short of a phenomenon,\\" said Morningstar analyst RJ Hottovy in a phone interview. \\"She turned Weight Watchers from being a liability to an asset.\\"      WW has garnered interest from a number of new analysts this year, with nine firms initiating coverage, according to Bloomberg data. Weight Watchers has nine buys and five hold ratings with an average price target 100. Not one analyst is bearish on the company, which traded Friday at more than 69 a share.      Oprah’s Presence      Investors are placing a lot of faith in Grossman’s ability to transform the company but they are also watching Oprah’s moves very closely. Back in January, WW rose as much as 15 percent amid talks of \\"Oprah for President.\\" The shares quickly slipped after Oprah shut down the rumors weeks later.      It’s unclear what role Oprah will play in the upcoming advertisements during the key diet season. Grossman gave no indication on the faces of the winter ad campaign but she did mention that WW has been very engaged with Oprah and the other influencers.      The company relies on the winter season to draw in subscribers who have made New Year’s resolutions to lose weight.      \\"We are working right now on exactly what that (campaign) will look like going into 2019,\\" said Grossman. \\"It’s all under concept development, globally.\\"      — With assistance by Richard Richtmyer ||||| Credit: Weight Watchers/WW      Weight Watchers is taking its biggest step yet to alter people's perceptions about the brand: It's changing its name.      The company announced Monday that it's now called WW—which it says pays homage to the brand's heritage (it was founded 55 years ago by Jean Nidetch as a weight-loss company) but shifts the focus from dieting to wellness. Its new tagline: \\"Wellness that Works.\\"      People no longer need a weight loss goal to join up, for one. And starting Oct. 4, the company's app will be updated: A new program, WellnessWins (there's that double W again), will reward WW members for things like tracking their meals and attending wellness workshops; the FitPoints algorithm will be more personalized and encourage high-intensity and strength-training exercises; and new groups are being added for people with common interests (think: vegetarians, new moms, yoga fans). WW is also partnering with meditation app company Headspace on customized content that comes out later this fall (first in English only, and later German and French).      \\"These are ways that our brand can show up as healthy living, so much more beyond just diet,\\" President and CEO Mindy Grossman, who has been overseeing the company's overhaul since she joined in mid-2017, tells Ad Age.      The company also said that by January all WW foods will be free from artificial colors, flavors, preservatives and sweeteners. And a beta version of voice integration with Amazon Alexa and the Google assistant lets members ask about the points values of their food and more.      WW also wants to be seen in unexpected places. A WW Freestyle Cafe opens at the Barclays Center arena in Brooklyn on Oct. 4 and plans to be there for at least a year; it features \\"healthy Mediterranean\\" entrees, sides and desserts by chef Cat Cora. There will also be a WW Freestyle choice in each of the other food venues there, along with brand activations.      A WW Freestyle promotion took place at the Giants home opener via a food truck outside MetLife Stadium on Sept. 9, featuring dishes such as lobster rolls and mac and cheese served by Eric Greenspan, as well as an in-venue activation.      As part of the overhaul, says Grossman, the company had interviewed thousands of people about how the brand impacted their lives. Not one person started their answer with how much weight they'd lost, she says; instead, each first spoke about how their lives were better or had been changed.      Credit: Weight Watchers      Even before the name change, the company was making a subtle shift beyond a weight-loss focus, promoting programs with names such as \\"Beyond the Scale,\\" and had raised its profit forecast for the year.      WW ended the second quarter with 4.5 million subscribers, up 1 million from a year earlier, the company said in August. At that time, its chief financial officer said that average retention was exceeding nine months globally, which was an increase of more than 15 percent versus three years ago. \\"I would like to be able to start talking about retention in years, not months,\\" says Grossman.      WW worked with SYPartners on its transformation plans. New ads from Anomaly are expected to start running in December. No word yet on whether board member and investor Oprah Winfrey will appear in that new campaign. |||||Summary:","output":"Weight Watchers is rebranding to WW, seeking to reposition itself as a wellness company rather than a weight-loss business. The move is part of an overhaul that will see WW focusing on nutrition and overall health, while items on its food range will not contain artificial sweeteners or preservatives. CEO Mindy Grossman has also sought to forge partnerships with exercise companies in a bid to align the company more with fitness and wellbeing. The rebrand comes as shares of WW have risen by almost 60% this year, reversing a slump in recent years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The answer to this question is:","output":"In 2012, the currency in Slovakia was the Euro (€), which is the official currency of the European Union (EU) and is used by 19 of its 27 member states. Slovakia officially adopted the Euro on January 1, 2009, replacing its previous currency, the Slovak Koruna (SKK). The transition from the Slovak Koruna to the Euro was managed by the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) and the European Central Bank (ECB). The exchange rate between the Slovak Koruna and the Euro was set at 1 Euro = 30.1260 Slovak Korunas. Prior to the adoption of the Euro, the Slovak Koruna had been in circulation since 1993, when Czechoslovakia split into two independent countries: the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Adopting the Euro as its official currency meant that Slovakia became a part of the Eurozone, which is the economic and monetary union responsible for the management of the Euro. As a Eurozone member, Slovakia benefits from lower transaction costs when trading with other member countries, more stable prices, and easier loans and financing. The Euro itself is administered and managed by the ECB and the Eurosystem, which consists of the central banks of the EU countries that use the Euro. The ECB is responsible for setting monetary policy for the Euro area and ensuring financial stability in the region. Coins and banknotes issued in the Eurozone display a combination of shared European designs and national designs. The common side of the coins features images of the European Union or a map of Europe. The national side, which is specific to each member country, typically depicts national symbols or landmarks. In Slovakia, the national side of the coins features the Bratislava Castle, the national emblem - a double cross on three hills, and the \\"Madonna and Child\\" by Master Paul of Levoča. In conclusion, the currency in Slovakia in 2012 was the Euro, which had been adopted as the country's official currency in 2009. As a Eurozone member, Slovakia enjoys various economic benefits, such as lower transaction costs and increased price stability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What most naturally follows? How to reduce teenage classroom stress  Manage your time more effectively.  Stress related to schoolwork is often caused by a sense that there is too much work to do and too little time to do it all. Just as often, however, better time management skills can reduce schoolwork backlogs-and reduce stress in the process.","output":"The next step in reducing teenage classroom stress would be improving study habits and techniques, which can significantly alleviate stress levels and improve academic performance. 1. Develop a routine: Consistency is crucial to making a study habit stick. Encourage teenagers to establish a dependable daily study routine and stick to it. This routine should be tailored to their needs and preferences, taking into account their optimal study times and the environment they feel most comfortable studying in. 2. Break tasks into smaller chunks: Breaking down large tasks or assignments into smaller, more manageable sections can help prevent feeling overwhelmed. This approach allows teenagers to feel more in control of their workload, enabling them to make gradual progress and build momentum. 3. Prioritize tasks: Encourage teenagers to prioritize their work according to deadlines and importance. This will help them tackle the most pressing assignments first and alleviate stress. It is also essential to make time for revising and reviewing material regularly to keep the information fresh in their minds. 4. Use effective study techniques: Techniques such as the Pomodoro Technique, active reading, summarizing information, and using mnemonic devices can greatly enhance the learning process and improve retention. Encourage teenagers to explore and adopt study techniques that work best for them. 5. Stay organized: Maintaining an organized workspace and keeping track of notes, handouts, and assignments will help prevent chaos, which can hinder productivity. Additionally, using an agenda or planner to keep track of deadlines and responsibilities can help reduce stress associated with forgetting assignments or feeling disorganized. 6. Seek help when needed: Encourage teenagers to ask for help from teachers, tutors, or peers when they're struggling with a concept or assignment. Seeking help early on can prevent confusion from escalating into stress. 7. Maintain a healthy balance: While academic success is important, it's crucial not to lose sight of personal well-being. Encourage teens to maintain a balanced lifestyle by participating in extracurricular activities, engaging in hobbies, and spending time with friends and family. These activities can serve as outlets for stress relief and help promote mental well-being. 8. Get enough sleep: Teenagers should aim for at least 8-10 hours of sleep per night. Sleep is essential for memory consolidation, focus, and overall well-being. Encourage them to create a consistent bedtime routine and keep their sleeping environment comfortable and free from distractions. 9. Practice stress-relief techniques: Encourage teenagers to explore and utilize stress-relief techniques such as deep breathing, visualization, meditation, or yoga. Even taking short breaks during study sessions to practice these techniques can help maintain focus and reduce stress. 10. Foster a growth mindset: Encourage teens to view challenges as opportunities for growth rather than barriers to success. Emphasize to them that setbacks are a natural part of learning and can ultimately lead to growth if approached with resilience and a positive attitude. Reducing classroom stress in teenagers can have long-lasting effects on their overall well-being and academic success. By implementing these strategies, teenagers can learn to manage their stress effectively and perform at their best both in and out of the classroom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:The theatre also won best production, for An Enemy of the People, while its artistic director David Thacker won the special achievement award. The Octagon's haul of six awards marked Thacker's final year as artistic director at the theatre. But Maxine Peake, shortlisted in two categories, went home empty-handed. The annual awards - chosen by a panel of 10 of the region's leading theatre critics - were handed out in Manchester on Friday. Colin Connor and Barbara Drennan won best actor and best actress respectively for A View from The Bridge, also directed by Thacker, with the Arthur Miller play picking up a third award for Natasha Davidson, for best supporting actress. Connor won a second award, for being the writer, director and performer in Mr Smith at the Kings Arms, Salford, winning best performance in a fringe production. David Birrell won best supporting actor for his part in Thacker's An Enemy of the People. Peake was nominated for best actress - for her role as a demonic fairy in The Skriker at the Royal Exchange theatre - and for the new play award for writing Beryl, about cycling champion Beryl Burton, which was staged at The Lowry in Salford. She was beaten to the new play award by The Rolling Stone, by Chris Urch at the Royal Exchange. The Royal Court's production of Constellations won three awards - best visiting productions, best actress in a visiting production (Louise Brealey) and best actor in a visiting production (Joe Armstrong) - beating households names including Sophie Thompson and Michael Ball. The Palace theatre's production of The Bodyguard won best musical in a shortlist that included Guys and Dolls and Mack & Mabel, while the Royal Northern College Of Music's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream won best opera. Analysis - Chris Long, entertainment reporter at the awards In the foyer before the awards, the talk was mostly about the flurrying snow that was blanketing Manchester on a bitterly cold day, but in the theatre it was another force from the North that took breaths away - that of Bolton Octagon. The theatre has fought hard to build a formidable reputation in recent years, a success which will be rewarded with a new Â£10m building in 2019, and its big wins in the acting categories showed just why it has become so highly regarded. For the town's most well-known actress though, things didn't go so well as Maxine Peake failed to pick up an award for either her acting in the well-received The Skriker or her writing of the play Beryl. She's not exactly in Leonardo DiCaprio territory, given she has been crowned by the awards before, but after she failed to win for her critically-acclaimed Hamlet in 2015, missing out again felt like something of a shock. David Thacker, the Octagon's artistic director, did have a Leonardo moment as his acceptance speech took in climate change and a fair few raised eyebrows. He, like many though, was working off the cuff as it seemed very few of the winners expected to win. That led to charming and gushing moments - the sweetest of which belonged to a member of the victorious Contact Youth Company, who grinningly said discovering and joining the group had \\"literally changed my life\\". Hearts, like the snow outside in the inevitable Manchester drizzle, melted.

Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. Samuel de Champlain, founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young Jesuit priest, to find a distant Catholic mission in a Huron village. With winter approaching, the journey will be difficult and cover as much as 1500 miles. LaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina – an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife; and Annuka, their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue. The group meet with a band of Montagnais, First Nations people who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais shaman, the \\"mestigoit\\", is suspicious (and implicitly jealous) of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a devil. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest. When one Indian tries to shoot Daniel, Chomina is consumed by guilt at having betrayed Champlain's trust. He and a few other members of the Algonquin tribe return with Daniel to try to find LaForgue., can you guess it ?

For this task, I will consider an imaginary restaurant called \\"The Unhappy Chef\\". Step 2: Set the tone - As this review is intended to be negative, I will make sure to convey dissatisfaction and disappointment with various aspects of the restaurant experience. Step 3: Describe the overall experience - I will start the review by summarizing the general experience at the restaurant, focusing on negative aspects.

Step 5: End the review - I will conclude the review with a summary of the main issues and a final comment or recommendation based on the negative experience. Negative review for The Unhappy Chef: I had high hopes for The Unhappy Chef, but my recent experience there was disheartening. As soon as I entered the restaurant, I noticed musty and uninviting smells, which immediately dampened my enthusiasm. Unfortunately, the rest of my visit did nothing to improve my impression of the place. Our server took a long time to approach us, and when they did, they seemed distracted and unhelpful. It took even longer to get our drinks, and when they finally arrived, they were both mixed inconsistently - my dining partner's mojito was watery, while my margarita was overly sour and lacked the right balance of flavors. The slow and careless service continued throughout the evening. The food, which was one of the main reasons I wanted to try this restaurant, turned out to be a major disappointment. My pasta dish was undercooked and barely covered in sauce, whereas my partner's steak was overcooked, even though we explicitly requested medium-rare. Both dishes lacked flavor and finesse, which is not what I expected from a restaurant with such a promising menu. The final disappointment came in the form of a hefty bill that didn't seem to reflect the poor quality of food and service we received. All in all, I can't recommend The Unhappy Chef and won't be returning in the future.

Possible answers: 1). yes; 2). it is not possible to tell; 3). no;","output":"3). No, we cannot conclude that \\"Clinton's spokesmen have nothing to say to Republican critics\\" based on this information. It is important to look at the context in which Clinton's spokesmen are quoting Republican defenders of engagement. The fact that they are quoting Republican supporters of the policy indicates that they are actively engaging with their critics from the opposing party and responding to their concerns or criticisms. By quoting Republican defenders, Clinton's spokesmen are essentially saying, \\"Look, even members of your own party agree with our approach.\\" This action serves at least two important purposes: 1. It highlights the bipartisan nature of the policy, which reflects positively on Clinton's administration, as it shows that the policy is not based on partisan ideologies but rather on practical and strategic considerations that are backed by experts from both sides of the aisle. 2. It effectively counters the criticism to some degree by pointing out the inconsistencies within the Republican critics' own party, which may lead some of them to question or reevaluate their stance on the issue. Moreover, Clinton's spokesmen may indeed have other arguments, facts, and statistics at their disposal to help bolster the case for the policy in question. Quoting Republican defenders may just be one tool in their arsenal, serving as a strategic counterpoint to silence Republican critics. It's important to note, however, that just because they use this tactic does not automatically mean that their arguments will be entirely convincing or immune to criticism from their opponents. Rather, it's a way for them to engage in the political discourse and present multiple perspectives in support of their policy. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Clinton's spokesmen have nothing to say to Republican critics simply because they are quoting Republican defenders of engagement. Instead, it appears that they are actively responding to their critics and presenting arguments to support their policy, while also using bipartisan support as a way of gaining greater credibility in the eyes of the public."},{"instruction":"Q:Given the following passage  \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers.

Answer: Australia is a continent comprising mainland Australia , Tasmania , New Guinea , Seram , possibly Timor , and neighbouring islands. Question: what continent is australia","output":"Yes, the question \\"What continent is Australia?\\" refers to the continent of Australia, which is the smallest and one of the seven continents on Earth. While the name \\"Australia\\" is primarily associated with the country, it also represents the continental landmass that consists of mainland Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea, Seram, possibly Timor, and neighboring islands. The Australia we refer to as a continent is classified under the region known as Oceania or Australasia. Oceania encompasses the islands situated in the waters of the Pacific Ocean, including Australia, and the archipelagos of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia. Australasia, on the other hand, is a broader term encompassing the regions of Australia, New Zealand, and the islands of the Pacific Ocean. The Australian continent is unique in that it is the only continent that consists primarily of a single country, the Commonwealth of Australia. The country's major territories include the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands. New Guinea, which is part of the continent, is an island located to the north of Australia, and it is the world's second-largest island, after Greenland. It is politically divided between two countries: Papua New Guinea to the east and Indonesia to the west. Seram, another island within the continent of Australia, is also part of Indonesia, located in the Maluku province. Timor, which could also be considered part of the continent, is an island located at the southern end of Maritime Southeast Asia. It is divided between the sovereign states of East Timor and Indonesia. In summary, the answer to the question \\"What continent is Australia?\\" is indeed Australia, which includes mainland Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea, Seram, possibly Timor, and neighboring islands. The continent is a part of the larger region of Oceania or Australasia, and it encompasses various independent countries and territories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve -32*j + 6*j - 1093 - 521 = -470 for j.","output":"First, let's simplify the equation by combining the terms with the variable j, and then combine the constant terms. The equation is given as: -32*j + 6*j - 1093 - 521 = -470 To combine the terms with the variable j: -32*j and 6*j are in the same family since they both contain the variable j. Therefore, we can add them together: -32j + 6j = (-32 + 6)j = -26j Now, combine the constant terms, -1093 and -521: -1093 - 521 = -1614 Now, let's rewrite the original equation using the simplified terms: -26j - 1614 = -470 Our next step is to isolate the variable j. We will first add 1614 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -1614 term: -26j - 1614 + 1614 = -470 + 1614 This simplifies to: -26j = 1144 Now, to solve for j, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -26: (-26j) / -26 = 1144 / -26 Simplifying further, we get: j = -44 Thus, the solution to the math problem is j = -44."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Consider, for example, the use of a timeline or sequence of events. It is also \\"the determination of the actual temporal sequence of past events\\".  - Diffuse reflection is the reflection of light from a surface such that an incident ray is reflected at many angles rather than at just one angle as in the case of specular reflection. An illuminated \\"ideal\\" diffuse reflecting surface will have equal luminance from all directions which lie in the half-space adjacent to the surface (Lambertian reflectance).  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Ice is water frozen into a solid state. Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color.  - Snow pertains to frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when it precipitates from clouds and accumulates on surfaces, then metamorphoses in place, and ultimately melts, slides or sublimates away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts, seasonally, and causes runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.  - Light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10 to 7.00 × 10 m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430750 terahertz (THz).  - The hexagonal snowflake , a crystalline formation of ice , has intrigued people throughout history . This is a chronology of interest and research into snowflakes . Artists , philosophers , and scientists have wondered at their shape , recorded them by hand or in photographs , and attempted to recreate hexagonal snowflakes .  - A spectrum (plural \\"spectra\\" or \\"spectrums\\") is a condition that is not limited to a specific set of values but can vary, without steps, across a continuum. The word was first used scientifically in optics to describe the rainbow of colors in visible light after passing through a prism. As scientific understanding of light advanced, it came to apply to the entire electromagnetic spectrum.  - A snowflake is either a single ice crystal or an aggregation of ice crystals which falls through the Earth's atmosphere as snow. Each flake nucleates around a dust particle in supersaturated air masses by attracting supercooled cloud water droplets, which freeze and accrete in crystal form. Complex shapes emerge as the flake moves through differing temperature and humidity zones in the atmosphere, such that individual snowflakes differ in detail from one another, but may be categorized in eight broad classifications and at least 80 individual variants. The main constituent shapes for ice crystals, from which combinations may occur, are needle, column, plate and rime. Snowflakes appear white in color despite being made of clear ice. This is due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small crystal facets.   - Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in apparently irreversible succession from the past through the present to the future. Time is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as the fourth dimension, along with the three spatial dimensions.  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity.  - A timeline is a way of displaying a list of events in chronological order, sometimes described as a project artifact. It is typically a graphic design showing a long bar labelled with dates alongside itself and usually events  - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD.

It was introduced in 1906 as a successor to the Models A and C as the company 's inexpensive entry - level line . It was built at the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant . The Model N diverged from its predecessors in that it was a front - engine car with a 4 - cylinder engine . The 15 hp straight - 4 drove the rear wheels via a long shaft . This was also the first American car to use vanadium steel . The car had a wheelbase of 84 in ( 2,100 mm ) . A successful model , 7000 cars were made before production ended in 1908 . At US  500 , the car was viewed as highly affordable at the time ; by contrast , the high - volume Oldsmobile Runabout went for  650 , Western 's Gale Model A was  500 , the Brush Runabout  485 , the Black went for as low as  375 , and the Success hit the amazingly low  250 . Maroon was the only factory color for the Model N.  - The Ford Model T (colloquially known as the Tin Lizzie, TModel Ford, Model T, T, Leaping Lena, or flivver) is an automobile that was produced by Ford Motor Company from October 1, 1908, to May 26, 1927. It is generally regarded as the first affordable automobile, the car that opened travel to the common middle-class American; some of this was because of Ford's efficient fabrication, including assembly line production instead of individual hand crafting.  - Detroit is the most populous city in the U.S. state of Michigan, the fourth-largest city in the Midwest and the largest city on the United StatesCanada border. It is the seat of Wayne County, the most populous county in the state.  - The Piquette Avenue Industrial Historic District is a historic district located along Piquette Street in Detroit, Michigan, from Woodward Avenue on the west to Hastings Street on the east. The district extends approximately one block south of Piquette to Harper, and one block north to the Grand Trunk Western Railroad Line. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.  - The Ford Piquette Avenue Plant is a museum and former factory located at 461 Piquette Avenue in Detroit, Michigan, within the Piquette Avenue Industrial Historic District in Milwaukee Junction. It was the second home of Ford Motor Company automobile production and is best known as the birthplace of the Ford Model T.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose \\"middle\\" compositional period was after 1901? is inside the article: The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major by Gustav Mahler is one of the largest-scale choral works in the classical concert repertoire. Because it requires huge instrumental and vocal forces it is frequently called the \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\", although the work is normally presented with far fewer than a thousand performers and the composer did not sanction that name. The work was composed in a single inspired burst, at Maiernigg in southern Austria in the summer of 1906. The last of Mahler's works that was premiered in his lifetime, the symphony was a critical and popular success when he conducted the Munich Philharmonic in its first performance, in Munich, on 12 September 1910. The fusion of song and symphony had been a characteristic of Mahler's early works. In his \\"middle\\" compositional period after 1901, a change of direction led him to produce three purely instrumental symphonies. The Eighth, marking the end of the middle period, returns to a combination of orchestra and voice in a symphonic context. The structure of the work is unconventional; instead of the normal framework of several movements, the piece is in two parts. Part I is based on the Latin text of a 9th-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, Veni creator spiritus (\\"Come, Creator Spirit\\"), and Part II is a setting of the words from the closing scene of Goethe's Faust. The two parts are unified by a common idea, that of redemption through the power of love, a unity conveyed through shared musical themes. Mahler had been convinced from the start of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times.

Article: Eighth-grader Victoria Bills is talking about money with her classmates. She is worried that a company's stock   price could fall. It may be an unusual topic of conversation for a 13-year-old. But at Bills' school in Chicago, US, you hear it all the time. The Chicago school's 420 students learn about economic . They also get a chance to make money. Each 1stgrade and 5thgrade, students learn the basics of economics and investing . Then in 6thgrade, they put what they've learned to work. Students join a junior group that manages the 20,000. The group, made up of 12 to 14 students, decides which stocks to buy. After graduating, students pass on 20,000 to the next 1stgrade class. They keep half of the rest of the money; the other half goes toward improving the school. They can choose to put their money in a college-savings program or take the cash. In 2007, Bills suggested that her class buy the stock of the Apple computer company. This was just before the iPhone came out. \\"We bought stock just at the right time,\\" she says. The kids bought Google stock as it reached 400 a share. It is now worth over 500. \\"It was a good buy,\\" says Myles Gate, 13. He hopes to be a banker one day. The school's two graduating classes of 2005 and 2006 have each earned about 10,000 in profits . Question: Who manages the 20,000 in the class?

Options：  A. train station  B. house  C. cupboard  D. cricket stadium  E. surface of earth A:","output":"To answer this question, we need to compare the likelihood of finding air that has been breathed by only a few people recently in each of the given options. A. Train station: It is a public place with many people coming and going, so there's a high chance that the air has been breathed by many people recently. B. House: While the number of occupants in a house may vary, it is a more controlled environment. If it's a small family or few people living in the house, it is possible to have air that has only been breathed by a few people recently. C. Cupboard: This is an enclosed space, and it is unlikely for people to breathe inside a cupboard. Therefore, the air inside the cupboard has likely not been breathed by anyone recently. D. Cricket stadium: Another public place that tends to accommodate large crowds, making it less likely to find air that has been breathed by only a few people recently. E.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County, you'll probably get a 100 fine. If you repeatedly beat a woman, you'll probably get the same fine. In 2001, county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases, finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases, either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea. Of those found guilty, the majority were ordered to pay court costs, plus a 100 fine. No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order. In 27 percent of the cases, the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty. In the rest of the cases, charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved. Sarah T. Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal. \\"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\\" Casey said. \\"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders? That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\\" Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100; the maximum fine is 1,000 and up to six months in jail. Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order. Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases. She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed. West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state. \\"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\\" West said. \\"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"All of them, and 30 days\\" correctly answer the question \\"How many defendants were ordered to pay the maximum fine of 1000, and how long after a PFA is filed does the plaintiff have to establish a custody order?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"All of them, and 30 days\\" does not correctly answer the question. According to the paragraph, no defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine, so the correct answer should be \\"None of them, and 30 days.\\" The paragraph states that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Four Republican hopefuls return money after 'Dylann Roof manifesto' revelation Related: Leader of group cited in 'Dylann Roof manifesto' donated to top Republicans Four presidential hopefuls were among 16 Republicans who on Monday gave up more than 30,000 in campaign contributions from the leader of a white nationalist group said to have influenced the Charleston church shooting suspect Dylann Roof. Scott Walker, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and Rick Santorum led a GOP group spanning Congress and statehouses who said they would donate to charity or return money from Earl Holt, following the publication of a Guardian article on Sunday. Other Republicans who have taken money from Holt declined to comment about the contributions. Holt, the president of the Council of Conservative Citizens (CofCC), has contributed more than 74,000 to Republican candidates and committees in recent years, according to public filings, while making dozens of racist statements online. His organisation, which is labelled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, was cited by the author of an extremist manifesto posted on a website registered in Roof’s name and hosting photographs of the 21-year-old. Walker, the Wisconsin governor, will pass the 3,000 Holt gave his state campaigns to a charity, AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman, said in an email. Walker is expected to officially announce a campaign for president in the coming weeks. His decision followed 2016 candidates Paul, a senator for Kentucky, Cruz, a senator for Texas, and Santorum, a former senator for Pennsylvania, passing a total of 14,250 they received from Holt to a memorial fund for Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina, where nine people were shot dead last week. “I abhor the sentiments Mr Holt has expressed. These statements and sentiments are unacceptable. Period. End of sentence,” Santorum said in a statement. The manifesto author, widely reported but not verified as Roof, recounted learning about “brutal black on white murders” from the CfCC website. “At this moment I realised that something was very wrong,” the manifesto said. Roof has been charged with nine counts of murder. He is accused of joining a Bible study group at the church last Wednesday evening and opening fire, declaring that the attack was racially motivated before fleeing in his car. Jared Taylor, a spokesman for the CoCC, said in a statement on Monday that its leaders “utterly condemn” Roof’s alleged killings, but said the shootings “do not detract in the slightest from the legitimacy of some of the positions he has expressed”. Taylor said: “Ignoring legitimate grievances is dangerous.” Another 6,500 in Holt campaign contributions are to be donated to the church fund from senators Joni Ernst of Iowa, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Rob Portman of Ohio and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, along with representatives Ryan Zinke of Montana, Louie Gohmert of Texas, and Mark Sanford of South Carolina. Spokespeople for the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, and Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who received a combined 5,000 in campaign contributions from Holt, according to filings, said they would be giving the money to charity. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Representative Mia Love of Utah – the first black female Republican in Congress – said they would be returning a total of 2,500 in contributions to Holt. “I do not agree with his hateful beliefs and language and believe they are hurtful to our country,” Cotton said in a statement. In a statement published on Sunday, Holt said it was “not surprising” that Roof was apparently informed by the group’s website as it reported race relations “accurately and honestly”. However, he added: “The CofCC is hardly responsible for the actions of this deranged individual merely because he gleaned accurate information from our website.” Current members of congress, state officials, or candidates who received campaign contributions from Earl Holt, president of Council of Conservative Citizens, according to FEC and state filings: Senator Ted Cruz of Texas* – 8,500 – donating 11,000 to Charleston church fund Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin – 3,500 – donating to charity Governor Greg Abbott of Texas – 3,000 – donating to Salvation Army in Austin Representative Steve King of Iowa – 2,500 Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska – 2,000 – donating to community centre Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky* – 1,750 – donating to Charleston church fund Former Senator Rick Santorum – 1,500 – donating to Charleston church fund Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas – 1,500 – returning contributions Representative Louie Gohmert of Texas* – 1,250 – donating to Charleston church fund Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin – 1,250 – donating to Charleston church fund Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa – 1,000 – donating to Charleston church fund Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona – 1,000 – donating to Charleston church fund Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina – 1,000 – donating to Charleston church fund Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana – 1,000 Representative Mia Love of Utah – 1,000 – returning contributions Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin* – 1,000 State representative David Simpson of Texas – 750 State senator Konni Burton of Texas – 750 Representative Thomas Emmer of Minnesota – 500 Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana – 500 – donating to Charleston church fund Senator Dean Heller of Nevada – 500 Senator Jim Risch of Idaho – 500 Representative Kenneth Buck of Colorado – 500 Senator Rob Portman of Ohio – 250 – donating to Charleston church fund Representative Mark Sanford of South Carolina – 250 State representative Matthew Schaefer of Texas – 250 Texas supreme court judge Jeff Brown – 250 Former candidates and members of congress who received campaign contributions from Holt Todd Akin, US senate candidate in Missouri – 3,500 Michele Bachmann, US representative for Minnesota and US presidential primary candidate – 3,200 Richard Mourdock, US senate candidate in Indiana – 2,500 Mitt Romney, US presidential candidate – 2,000 Chris McDaniel, US senate primary candidate in Mississippi – 2,000 Charles Djou, US house candidate in Hawaii – 2,000 Josh Mandel, US senate candidate in Ohio – 1,500 Linda McMahon, US senate candidate in Connecticut – 1,500 Allen West*, US representative for Florida – 1,250 Ken Cuccinelli, Virginia governor candidate – 1,000 George Allen, US senate candidate in Virginia – 1,000 Rick Berg, US representative and US senate candidate for North Dakota – 1,000 Dennis Rehberg, US representative and US senate candidate for Montana – 1,000 Mark Neumann, US senate candidate in Wisconsin – 1,000 Sharron Angle, US senate candidate in Nevada – 1,000 Paul Broun, US representative and US senate primary candidate for Georgia – 1,000 Rob Maness, US senate primary candidate in Louisiana – 1,000 Quico Canseco, US representative and US house primary candidate for Texas – 750 Peter Hoekstra, US representative and US senate candidate for Michigan – 500 Tom Smith, US senate candidate in Pennsylvania – 500 Dan Liljenquist, state senator and US senate primary candidate in Utah – 500 JD Hayworth, US representative and US senate primary candidate for Arizona – 500 Dino Rossi, state senator and US senate candidate in Washington – 500 Philip Eby, state house primary candidate in Texas – 500 Jeff Bell, US senate candidate in New Jersey – 500 Donald Webb, US house candidate in North Carolina – 500 Joe Miller, US senate primary candidate in Alaska – 500 Jim Oberweis, state senator and US senate candidate in Illinois – 500 Steve Lonegan, US senate candidate in New Jersey – 500 John Raese, US senate candidate in West Virginia – 500 Conservative campaign committees that received contributions from Holt Senate Conservatives Fund PAC – 1,000 Madison Project PAC – 250 *Total includes contributions to candidate’s leadership Pac Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Four Republican presidential hopefuls and 12 other party members have returned or donated over 30,000 in campaign contributions from Earl Holt, leader of a white nationalist group linked to Charleston church shooting suspect Dylann Roof, following the publication of a Guardian article.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the full name of the person who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora?, using the article: Lissitzky was born on November 23, 1890 in Pochinok, a small Jewish community 50 kilometres (31 mi) southeast of Smolensk, former Russian Empire. During his childhood, he lived and studied in the city of Vitebsk, now part of Belarus, and later spent 10 years in Smolensk living with his grandparents and attending the Smolensk Grammar School, spending summer vacations in Vitebsk. Always expressing an interest and talent in drawing, he started to receive instruction at 13 from Yehuda Pen, a local Jewish artist, and by the time he was 15 was teaching students himself. In 1909, he applied to an art academy in Saint Petersburg, but was rejected. While he passed the entrance exam and was qualified, the law under the Tsarist regime only allowed a limited number of Jewish students to attend Russian schools and universities. Like many other Jews then living in the Russian Empire, Lissitzky went to study in Germany. He left in 1909 to study architectural engineering at a Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany. During the summer of 1912, Lissitzky, in his own words, \\"wandered through Europe\\", spending time in Paris and covering 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) on foot in Italy, teaching himself about fine art and sketching architecture and landscapes that interested him. His interest in ancient Jewish culture had originated during the contacts with a Paris-based group of Russian Jews led by sculptor Ossip Zadkine, a lifetime friend of Lissitzky since early childhood, who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora. Also in 1912 some of his pieces were included for the first time in an exhibit by the St. Petersburg Artists Union; a notable first step. He remained in Germany until the outbreak of World War I, when he was forced to return home through Switzerland and the Balkans, along with many of his countrymen, including other expatriate artists born in the former Russian Empire, such as Wassily Kandinsky and Marc Chagall.Upon his return to Moscow, Lissitzky attended the Polytechnic..., what would be the answer ?

Its most recent Companies House filing shows the company as making a pre-tax loss of £28.5m last year, but the firm also paid its 362 UK staff a total of £35.4m in share bonuses. The share bonuses amount to £96,000 on average per UK Facebook employee. It means Facebook's UK corporation tax bill was less than the tax the average UK employee paid on their salary. The average UK salary is £26,500 on which employees pay a total of £5,392.80 in income tax and national insurance contributions. In January, Facebook reported global fourth-quarter profits of 701m (£462m), a 34% increase on the same period a year earlier. Total profits for the year were 2.9bn, almost double its profit for 2013. Facebook said at the time that advertising revenue grew by 53% to 3.59bn, with nearly 70% of that coming from mobile ad sales. The social networking giant says it now has 1.39 billion active users each month, a 13% increase from a year ago. The latest revelations will reignite the debate about how much UK corporation tax companies pay at a time when several multinational corporations are being investigated by the European Commission over the tax arrangements they have with European Union member states. Google, Amazon, a division of the Fiat motor company and Starbucks are all subject to the investigation and the European Commission has said it could widen its probe further. The investigation came after Starbucks was revealed to have paid just £8.6m in UK corporation tax in the 14 years between 1998 and 2012, despite making more than £3bn in UK sales in the same period. Last week, EU finance ministers agreed to boost information sharing in response to the so-called LuxLeaks scandal that emerged last year. The scandal showed Luxembourg had issued hundreds of tax rulings allowing companies to lower their tax bill by funnelling their profits through the country. A spokesperson for Facebook said: \\"We are compliant with UK tax law, and in fact in all countries where we have operations and offices. We continue to grow our business activities in the UK.\\" They added that all the firm's employees paid UK income tax on their payouts. The company recently secured the lease on a high-profile 227,324 sq ft office space in Rathbone Square, near Tottenham Court Road in London, where it plans to open a new headquarters in 2017. John O'Connell,  director of the Taxpayers' Alliance, a think tank that campaigns for lower taxes and highlights examples of government waste, said: \\"Taxpayers will be justifiably confused and angry about this tax bill. But Facebook is right to say that it is complying with UK law,  which shows that the problem lies with our complex tax code, and that is what politicians should address as a matter of urgency. \\"We have to ensure our taxes are simple to eliminate loopholes, and that taxes are low to increase our competitiveness, so that companies choose to base themselves here.\\" Conservative MP Mark Garnier, a member of Parliament's Treasury Select Committee told the BBC that even if companies were not breaking any laws, they should think about their moral responsibility. \\"It's about the spirit of the law versus the letter of the law.  At the end of the day tax evasion is illegal, when you're deliberately setting out to not pay your tax by hiding your money,\\" he said. \\"Tax planning is what most people will be doing with their pensions.  And tax avoidance is where you take the letter of the law, to get around the spirit of the law, where you're actively seeking a way of using the letters to not pay tax.\\" In his March Budget, Chancellor George Osborne pressed ahead with plans to introduce a diverted profits tax on companies that moved their profits overseas. He added that firms that aided tax evasion would also face new penalties and criminal prosecutions. The so-called \\"Google Tax\\" is designed to discourage large companies diverting profits out of the UK to avoid tax. And last week, an OECD/G20 report found that laws allowing companies to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions meant between 100bn and 240bn was lost in tax revenues every year - equivalent to between 4% and 10% of global corporate tax revenues.

Please answer this question: In which sport is the 'Giro D'Italia'?","output":"The Giro d'Italia, often referred to as simply \\"The Giro,\\" is a professional cycling race held in the sport of road cycling. Established in 1909, the Giro d'Italia is one of the three Grand Tours of professional cycling, alongside the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España. The Giro is held annually, primarily taking place throughout the numerous regions of Italy, with occasional stages crossing the borders to nearby countries. The race is organized by La Gazzetta dello Sport, an Italian sports newspaper, and spans over a three-week period, usually in May. Like other Grand Tours, the Giro d'Italia features various stages that challenge riders in multiple aspects of road cycling, such as flat stages, individual and team time trials, and mountainous stages. These diverse stages result in an overall race that tests a cyclist's endurance, strength, climbing ability, and tactical nous. The Giro d'Italia consists of 21 stages, and the rider with the lowest cumulative time at the end of the race is declared the overall winner. Throughout the race, additional competitions take place that focus on different aspects of the sport, such as the Points Classification (for sprinters), the Mountains Classification (for climbers), and the Best Young Rider classification for cyclists under the age of 25. Several iconic symbols are associated with the Giro, such as the 'Maglia Rosa' (Pink Jersey), which is awarded to the overall leader of the race. The Pink Jersey is an iconic symbol in the world of professional cycling, as it signifies the wearer's current standing as the overall race leader. The color pink is a nod to the race-organizing newspaper, La Gazzetta dello Sport, whose pages are printed on pink paper. Other significant jerseys include the Maglia Ciclamino (Cyclamen Jersey) for the Points Classification leader, the Maglia Azzurra (Blue Jersey) for the Mountains Classification leader, and the Maglia Bianca (White Jersey) for the leader in the Best Young Rider classification. The Giro d'Italia is an important cultural event in Italy and is followed closely by fans both nationally and internationally. Similar to the Tour de France, the Giro is seen as a prestigious race in the professional cycling calendar, with a rich history of legendary riders such as Fausto Coppi, Gino Bartali, Eddy Merckx, and more recent winners like Chris Froome and Alberto Contador. The race showcases not only the athleticism and dedication of the cyclists but also the beautiful landscapes, scenic routes, and vibrant culture of Italy and the surrounding regions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

AM Eluned Parrott, speaking for Britain Stronger in Europe, hailed cheaper and more secure food supplies. With a referendum called for 23 June, three of the Tories' 11 Welsh MPs have said they want the UK to leave, while all 25 Welsh Labour MPs want to remain. David Cameron confirmed the date of the vote after negotiating a deal in Brussels which gives the UK the right to restrict EU migrants' benefits and to be excused from taking part in \\"ever-closer union\\". Debating the arguments on the BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme, both Ms Bilney and Ms Parrott claimed the terms of trade would be better under their preferred option. Ms Bilney said the UK would be free to negotiate its own trade deals outside the EU, while the Lib Dem AM said there was a benefit from being part of the world's biggest single market. Ms Parrott also pointed to the EU as a force for peace over 60 years, while Ms Bilney said the UK's membership of Nato, the UN security council and friendship with the USA provided security. Elsewhere, deputy Labour leader Tom Watson told the party's Welsh conference in Llandudno that the UK would remain in the EU but winning the referendum would not be easy. \\"The Tories could end up destroying themselves over Europe but we won't let them destroy our country\\", he said. Monmouth Tory MP David Davies told BBC Wales that he would be \\"campaigning hard\\" for the UK to leave the EU, describing Mr Watson's view as \\"wishful thinking\\". He said the Conservative Party would be united irrespective of the referendum result - but he hoped the result would mean the UK was no longer part of the EU. Mr Davies is one of three of the 11 Welsh Tory MPs who have said they will vote for Britain to leave the EU - former Welsh Secretary David Jones and Brecon and Radnorshire MP Chris Davies are the others. Five have declared in favour of remaining in the EU - Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb, Guto Bebb, Byron Davies, Simon Hart and Craig Williams. Three have yet to declare their view - junior Wales Office Minister Alun Cairns, Glyn Davies and James Davies. Plaid Cymru confirmed that the party and its three MPs would be campaigning to stay in the EU. \\"We have to see the big picture,\\" said Euro-MP Jill Evans. \\"There is a lot we would like to change about the EU, but we can only do that from within.

Farmers here share in another Â£200m of EU payments a year, which could be lost if the UK opts to leave. However, those who want to leave the EU say it is not \\"European\\" money, but our money. They insist the money could still go to poorer areas of Wales - it would just come from the Welsh government rather than Brussels. However, we have yet to see any concrete plans that the UK government would be willing to send additional money to Wales in the event of Brexit.","output":"The UK's debate over whether to remain in the European Union continues, with some arguing it brings more secure food supplies and peace, while others claim leaving would allow the UK to negotiate its own trade deals and invest more in public services."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Water in the clouds becomes very cold - The cold water forms ice crystals - The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets - Form snowflakes - The snowflakes fall to the ground.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose warm air rises from the ground under the cloud happens, how will it affect ice crystals will be smaller.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of warm air rising from the ground under the cloud can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of ice crystal formation and growth, ultimately leading to smaller ice crystals. The process of ice crystal formation and growth in clouds is primarily driven by the temperature of the cloud and the availability of water vapor. In the scenario described, the presence of warm air rising from the ground has potential consequences for both factors that affect ice crystal growth, as outlined below: Direct Effects: 1. Change in cloud temperature: As the warm air rises and comes in contact with the cold cloud, it can potentially increase the temperature of the water droplets and ice crystals within the cloud. This, in turn, might reduce the rate of ice crystal formation as a higher temperature would cause less condensation of water vapor onto the ice crystals. 2. Increased evaporation/sublimation: The presence of warmer air can also lead to an increased rate of evaporation or sublimation of water droplets and ice crystals, respectively. As warm air can hold more moisture, it can cause the tiny water droplets and ice crystals in the cloud to evaporate or sublimate back into water vapor, hindering the growth of ice crystals. Indirect Effects: 1. Alteration of cloud dynamics: The rising warm air can affect the overall dynamics of the cloud by altering its vertical structure and local temperature gradients. This could lead to changes in the cloud's internal circulation and distribution of moisture, possibly reducing the efficiency of ice crystal growth by limiting the availability of water droplets needed for crystal growth. 2. Shortened cloud lifetime: The influx of warm air can have an overall warming effect on the cloud, which can accelerate the cloud's dissipation due to increased convection and mixing with the surrounding environment. A shorter cloud lifetime would mean less time for ice crystal formation and growth to occur. 3. Enhanced melting of ice crystals: If a significant amount of warm air reaches higher altitudes within the cloud, it could lead to the partial or complete melting of ice crystals before they grow to form snowflakes. In this case, the ice crystals would become smaller water droplets again, reducing the likelihood of snowflake formation. In summary, the presence of warm air rising from the ground under a cloud can have both direct and indirect effects on the formation and growth of ice crystals. The warm air can directly impact the cloud's temperature and induce evaporation or sublimation, while also influencing cloud dynamics, lifetime, and ice crystal melting indirectly. These effects can ultimately result in smaller ice crystals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

What he tried to do was to teach a male dolphin called Bass and a female called Doris to communicate with each other across a solid barrier. M: So how did he do it exactly? W: Well, first of all, he kept the two dolphins together in the same tank and taught them to press levers whenever they saw a light. The levers were fitted to the side of the tank next to each other. If the light flashed on and off several times, the dolphins were supposed to press the left-hand lever followed by the right-hand one. If the light was kept steady, the dolphins were supposed to press the levers in reverse order. Whenever they responded correctly, they were rewarded with fish. M: Sounds terribly complicated. W: Well, that was the first stage. In the second stage, Doctor Bastian separated the dolphins into two tanks. They could still hear one another, but they couldn't actually see each other. The levers and light were set up in exactly the same way except that this time it was only Doris who could see the light indicating which lever to press first. But in order to get their fish, both dolphins had to press the levers in the correct order. This meant of course that Doris had to tell Bass whether it was a flashing light or whether it was a steady light. M: So did it work?

Context: SEOUL — In addition to growing concerns that North Korea will pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S., prospects for improved inter-Korean relations have also stalled, as Pyongyang demands that U.S.-South Korea joint military drills be scaled back, and a group of defectors be returned. Just weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in declared the beginning of a new era of peace during a historic summit held in the demilitarized zone of the inter-Korean border, Pyongyang has put further dialogue and cooperation on hold until its demands are met. President Moon will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming Trump-Kim summit and the North’s sudden conditions set for continued dialogue and cooperation. Most of North Korea’s anger last week, expressed in official statements and reports carried by the state news agency KCNA, seemed to be directed at the U.S. It criticized the Max Thunder joint military exercise that is currently underway, and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s demands for the North’s unilateral nuclear disarmament. North Korea in particular objected to Bolton’s insistence that North Korea follow the Libyan model, which involved the rapid and total dismantlement of that country’s nuclear program, but it was also followed by the overthrow of the country’s leader Moammar Gadhafi some years later. Unless the U.S. eased up on its uncompromising stance, Pyongyang indicated it would pull out of the June 12 meeting in Singapore between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump to negotiate an end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. President Trump later said the Libya model does not apply to North Korea and that Kim Jong Un would remain in power and “be very rich” if he makes a deal to end his country’s nuclear program. North Korea denounced South Korea, as well, for the joint military drills, calling the Seoul government... Question: How does Kim Jong Un feel about being denuclearized the way Libya was?

Answer the following question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Final preparations are underway for Friday’s historic third summit between the leaders of North and South Korea. In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War. Moon and Kim will hold direct talks in the Peace House conference hall, both in the morning and the afternoon, but the North Korean delegation will...

Write a summary based on this article: World's Only Drive-Thru Strip Club (Closed)      Congruity, Pennsylvania      The drive-thru window at the Climax Gentleman's Club offers the novelty of a drive-thru tree with the I'll-do-it-in-my-car convenience of a drive-thru McDonald's. A special gravel driveway leads to a cinder block carport at the back of the building, where patrons can watch the indoor activity from their vehicles, though a diamond-shaped window. A \\"pay here\\" booth takes credit cards, and displays an autographed photo of Fred \\"The Honzman\\" Honsburger, a right-wing radio talk show host on Pittsburgh's KDKA. Current rates are 20 a minute for two or more people; 10 a minute for solo customers. If there's someone in front of you, you just have to wait in your car.      We passed through too early to test out the window (the club was officially closed, though we stepped aside so a customer buying a \\"private dance\\" could enter). The club owner, Nick Climax agreed to speak by phone.      \\"We're the first one in world history,\\" says Climax of his drive-thru. It was built in the spring of 2000, and remains the only one that he knows of. The media pounced on the story at the time, and Nick proudly reels off his list of conquests: Jay Leno, Howard Stern, Penthouse, Esquire. The drive-thru became a question in the 20th anniversary edition of Trivial Pursuit. \\"More people listened to my radio interview in Australia in 2000 than listened to the Olympics,\\" Nick tells us. \\" I turned down the cover of Time magazine on October 2, 2000; I didn't want my picture taken.\\"      Thinking about the frustration of a line at the drive-thru, we ask Nick, \\"Is there a best time to come?\\" He replies, misinterpreting the question, \\"Any time we're open is good.\\" ||||| They may look like McDonald's drive-thrus, but motorists pulling up to these windows aren't buying hamburgers or french fries. They're buying booze! And it's legal!            Hard to believe, but in states like Louisiana and Texas, drive-thru stands specialize in selling daiquiris and other alcoholic drinks to drivers.            Inside the drive-thrus are rows of machines that look like they're dispensing slushees. But they're actually pumping out pre-mixed alcoholic concoctions in all flavors like electric lemonade, pina coladas, jungle juice, and margaritas. They even sell shots of liquor. And surprisingly it's all perfectly legal for drivers to purchase these cocktails as long as they don't drink them while behind the wheel.            In one weekend in New Orleans, we watched dozens of drivers making daiquiri pit-stops and then driving off sipping their cocktails from a straw.      We spotted one couple grabbing afternoon cocktails filled with vodka at a daiquiri drive-thru. We followed the driver and watched him sip the drink while stopped at a red light.            After watching him drive erratically at over 70MPH on the freeway, INSIDE EDITION'S Chief Investigative Correspondent, Lisa Guerrero, had a few questions for the driver when he finally reached his destination.      \\"Are you comfortable with drinking and driving sir?\\" asked Guerrero.            The driver didn't respond.            INSIDE EDITION also witnessed another driver who didn't even make it out of the parking lot before he started drinking a daiquiri he ordered with an extra shot of Bacardi. We followed him through one busy intersection after another while he kept sipping his drink.            Unbelievably this driver's final destination was a nearby playground. He had a child riding in the back seat the entire time. And even though we heard him order an alcoholic daiquiri, the driver told us it was non-alcoholic.            \\"It's a virgin,\\" said the driver.            \\"Really,\\" responded Guerrero, \\"you're trying to tell me that's a virgin daiquiri?\\"      The driver then got back in his car and prepared to take off.            \\"Excuse me,\\" yelled Guerrero at the woman who was putting the child back in the car. \\"Are you sure your child should be in that car? He's been drinking and your putting a child in that car.\\"            The owners of these drive-thru bars say they abide by the law and insist they don't encourage people to drink and drive. But that's exactly what we found customers doing.            We had a few questions for one of the managers at the daiquiri stands but he wasn't happy to see us.            \\"You're serving alcohol to people in their cars. Don't you think this is dangerous?\\" asked Guerrero.            \\"It's legal,\\" replied the manager before walking away.            We showed our video to Laura Dean-Mooney, the president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving.      \\"When you allow alcohol to be delivered through a window of a vehicle, you're opening the door for a disaster,\\" said Dean-Mooney.       ||||| From strip clubs to funerals, there seems to be a drive-thru available for just about everything in this great, car-obsessed nation. CC BY: Kevin Spencer      We Americans sure love our cars — and the convenience of going about our business without ever having to leave the driver's seat. Here, five unusual drive-thru options from around the country:            1. Funerals      The Robert L. Adams Mortuary in Compton, Calif., is one of a handful of funeral parlors in the U.S. to offer drive-thru viewings of the dead. \\"You can come by after work, you don't need to deal with parking, you can sign the book outside, and the family knows that you paid your respects,\\" says owner Peggy Scott Adams, as quoted in the Los Angeles Times. \\"It's a convenience thing.\\"            2. Strip clubs      The claim to fame of the Climax Gentlemen's Club in Delmont, Pa., was its diamond-shaped drive-thru window. The club, apparently closed since 2009, allowed motorists to pay 10 to view strippers through a small window, without having to leave their cars. \\"Proponents tout the safety and convenience of the drive-thru window,\\" said Gamaliel in a 2000 post at everything2.com. \\"But what about the loss of that lovely strip club ambiance?\\"            3. Prayers      The Cathedral of Faith Church of God in Christ in Mount Morris Township, Mich., has held drive-thru prayer services, according to USA Today. Those who heeded signs that read \\"Pull over for Prayer!\\" could fill out a form describing what they wanted to pray about, and then steer over to a minister who would pray with them while their cars idled. \\"Taking the church to the people, to the streets, is what this is all about,\\" says the Rev. Chris Martin.            4. Daiquiris      Despite the nationwide crackdown on drunk driving, motorists in states like Louisiana and Texas can still find drive-thru frozen daiquiri chains. And the boozy pit stops are perfectly legal as long as the servers put tape across the straw hole on the lid, and hand you a straw separately. Gallon-sized drinks are available in some locations. For anyone mildly interested in breaking the law, \\"they certainly make things easy,\\" says Tim Murphy at Mother Jones.            5. Liquor... and guns      Why stop just for liquor when you can get a gun, too? The Double Shot liquor and gun store in Schulenburg, Texas, has \\"every liquor brand and firearm brand,\\" according to its Yahoo! directory listing. \\"Only in Texas can you buy a bottle of whisky and a gun at the same time,\\" says Rastyrori at the Los Angeles Times — and do it from your car. The store has the \\"convenience of drive-thru so you don't have to get out from behind the wheel while you drink and shoot.\\" |||||","output":"The Climax Gentleman's Club in Delmont, Pennsylvania was the world's only drive-thru strip club, allowing customers to watch the indoor activity from their vehicles through a diamond-shaped window.

What's the full name of the person that works with Dinah's father?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1905, Dinah Sheldon, an enthusiastic art student, is expelled from Miss Ingram's Seminary for wearing two petticoats instead of five, attending political rallies and insisting that she be allowed to study nudes. When she is sent home to Baltimore, Dinah's understanding father, Dr. Andrew Sheldon, an Episcopalian pastor, easily forgives his headstrong daughter this latest calamity, but her mother Lily encourages her to be more conventionally feminine. Dinah's childhood sweetheart, Tom Wade, also believes that she should settle down and confesses that, since her absence, he has begun dating the more \\"continental\\" Bernice Eckert.  Dinah feigns indifference to Bernice, telling Tom that her only ambition is to study art in Paris, and he agrees to help her fulfill her dream. When Dinah is arrested during a brawl in a public park, which starts after four loafers begin arguing over one of her paintings, the overworked Tom is asked to provide bail for all five. Out of gratitude, Dinah offers to write a speech for Tom on equality, which he is scheduled to deliver the next night at the Forum Society's Spring Dance. While preparing the speech, which is a modified version of one of her own debates, Dinah learns that her exit from jail was witnessed by two women, who then relayed the information to Dan Fletcher, Andrew's Scottish vestryman. Dan is upset by the scandal because Andrew has just become a candidate for the new bishop's post, and suggests that he punish Dinah.  Instead, the less ambitious Andrew encourages Dinah's dreams by confessing that, as a youth, he had a short career as a ballroom dancer but gave it up to protect his father's reputation. That night, Dinah shows up late at the Forum Society, and Tom is forced to read her speech cold.

As she passes by a manhole, she is attacked by a creature, and the dog is pulled in after her. George Cooper (John Heard) lives with his girlfriend Lauren (Kim Greist). George, a once-prominent fashion photographer, has since forgone the fame and fortune. His current project is photographing New York City's homeless population, specifically those known as \\"undergrounders\\", or people who reside within the bowels of the city. A police captain named Bosch (Christopher Curry) is introduced. Bosch has a personal interest in the recent flood of missing persons (most of whom are homeless) being reported to his precinct. Bosch interviews A.J. \\"The Reverend\\" Shepherd (Daniel Stern), who runs the local homeless shelter. Shepherd believes recent events to be a part of a massive government cover-up and has the evidence to prove it. Bosch's superiors know more than they are letting on and seem to be taking their cues from an overly glib, weasely type named Wilson (George Martin), who works for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It turns out there are monsters lurking beneath the streets; beings that were once human, but have been mutated by radioactive, chemical toxic waste into hideous, flesh-eating creatures that prey on the homeless who live in the underground. Given the recent drop in the underground transient population, the creatures have resorted to coming to the surface through sewer manholes in order to feed.

Given the context: What will Bailey want to do next?  Possible answers: go on another date with Carson, break up with their current partner, look for other people to date","output":"Given the context, it seems most likely that Bailey will want to go on another date with Carson. Their first date was described as going well and having a great time, which suggests that both would be open for the opportunity to explore their connection deeper. This step allows Bailey and Carson to spend more time together, helping to continue building their relationship and understanding each other on a deeper level. The context doesn't suggest that Bailey is currently in a relationship with someone else — the fact that Bailey is dating Carson implies Bachelorhood status. Therefore, the option to \\"break up with their current partner\\" doesn't seem logically applicable in this scenario.  Finally, there's no indication in the context given that Bailey is unsatisfied with Carson after their first date. It mentioned they had a great time together. As a result, Bailey looking for other people to date immediately after a successful and enjoyable outing with Carson doesn't resonate with a logical coherence.  However, it's important to remember that individual's feelings and future actions can be unpredictable and depend on numerous factors not discussed in this context. While going for another date with Carson seems to be the most viable option based upon the scenario provided, Bailey's ultimate decision would likely be influenced by other personal permutations such as their feelings, their mutual chemistry with Carson, their expectations from a potential relationship, their dating history, and many more complex elements.

Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin.

Here is an article: Atlanta Skyline (Photo credit: k1ng) In the world of real estate large sums of money are regularly made and lost according to the sage dictum, “location, location, location.” Apparently the same is true with regard to car ownership, as a recent study found as much as a 10,000 difference in operating expenses over a five-year period depending solely on a motorist’s address. Residents of Oregon enjoy the cheapest auto ownership costs – including gasoline, insurance, repairs, taxes and fees – at an average annual 2,204, according to the personal finance website Bankrate.com in New York, NY. Those living in Georgia face the highest annual car costs at an average 4,322. By comparison, the national average stands at 3,201 per year. Why the spread? For starters, Oregonians aren’t assessed a state sales tax to purchase a car, and they’re subject to relatively low insurance rates. What’s more they tend to log 16 percent fewer miles each year behind the wheel than the average U.S. commuter. On the other hand, those living in Atlanta not only suffer the highest state automobile taxes and fees in the nation, they tend to drive far more than the national average, due in large part to Atlanta’s sprawling communities and a dearth of public transportation. The study determined that a driver’s insurance premiums, which are based in part on an insured person’s zipcode (as well as his or her age, sex, driving record, and so on) range from an annual average high of 1,119 among those living in New Jersey to a low of 517 for motorists in North Dakota. The average yearly premium among all states is 762. Annual gasoline costs run from a surprisingly low average of 743 in New York (extensive use of public transportation obviously helps in that regard) to a whopping 1,643 in the Big Sky Country of Wyoming, where an automobile (or perhaps a horse) is the only way to get around. The average U.S. driver pays 1,028 to keep the tank filled. Taxes and fees assessed to motorists can likewise boost a car’s long-term ownership costs substantially and vary wildly from state to state. For example, Oregonians pay an average 157 to their state’s coffers each year for the privilege of owning a car, while Georgians suffer from the highest taxes and registration costs in the nation at 1,952. The national average here is 1,058. Here are the 10 states having the highest typical yearly automobile ownership costs according to Bankrate.com: And for those thinking of riding the rising tide in the real estate market and moving off to an area having a lower cost of living, here are the 10 states that were found to be the cheapest with regard to vehicle ownership: The Fine Print: The above estimates were based on median insurance premiums for 2006 to 2010 provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners; average 2012 repair costs compiled by CarMD.com; and state taxes and fees as noted by Kelley Blue Book.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. A Florida waitress who went the extra mile after a customer left behind 1,000 in cash has been rewarded for her honesty, even though she returned the money to the wrong guy. Pregnant Samantha Knight, of Punta Gorda, found the stash of 100 dollar bills on the seat at one of her tables during her Tuesday night shift at Laishley Crab House. An unusual series of events, including giving the money to the wrong person, ended with her being given the full 1,000 plus an extra 100 tip. Ms Knight initially raced to the front of the restaurant to return the money roll to the customer she thought had left it behind - but she handed it to the wrong guy, and he left with the 1,000. Take the money and run: Surveillance footage at Laishley Crab House shows a waitress handing over 1,000 in lost cash she believed belonged to the man leaving on the right. Mix-up: Waitress Samantha Knight says she thought she was returning it to the right customer, and he acted like the lost money was his. The mix-up happened last Tuesday at Laishley Crab House in Punta Gorda, Florida. 'I was like \\"you left this in the booth.\\" He said \\"thanks,\\" patted his pocket, took it and walked away,' Ms Knight told WBBH. It was only after the man left with the small fortune that the waitress realized she mixed up tables and handed the money to the wrong customer. The man who actually dropped the money, Chuck Behm, was filmed leaving the restaurant just one minute prior - he soon came back looking for his cash. When told what happened, he was upset and said he'd have let her keep it. He didn't blame her for the confusion, instead blaming the guy who initially took money that wasn't his. 'I felt awful. I still feel madder than anything at that guy,' he told WBBH from back home in Chicago. There's that money I forgot: The man is filmed taking a mint from the restaurant's front desk on his way out when Ms Knight stops him and hands him the money. He easily accepts the wad of 100 dollar bills. Taking the cash: The man even pats his pocket as if the wad of bills fell out. Left too soon: The man the money actually belonged to, Charles Behm, was filmed leaving the restaurant just one minute before Ms Knight ran to catch the customer. Mr Behm then said that if the money was returned he would give it to the pregnant Ms Knight.

Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. The young Dr. Fanshawe(Mark Letheren), an avid archaeologist, is dispatched by his Museum boss to the large country home of Squire Richards(Pip Torrens), where his task is to find provenance for and catalogue the collection of antiquities and curios belonging to the recently deceased father of the Squire. The Squire is surprised by the arrival Fanshawe, he hadn't been expecting him for another week, but none the less welcomes him and gets his only servant, Patten (David Burke..of Dr Watson fame), to show him to his room, as Fanshawe must stay over for some days in order to finish his rather large task. Patten it would seem is not the friendliest sort and seems to resent the extra work that Fanshawe's visit will entail, the large empty house providing an endless amount of cooking, cleaning and maintenance for him. Fanshawe is a fussy sort, very neat and precise with everything having its place, whether they be his clothes or his books and papers and he is rather disgusted by the dirt in his room. Needless to say he is rather eager to begin his work, but unpacking he finds his binoculars have been damaged in transit, so he asks the Squire for a replacement pair, The Squire who is a modern thinking man but also it would seem rather uncultured with such matters, is also eager to get rid of the clutter around the house, so he obliges and walks Fanshawe to the top of the hill so that he can survey the estate and the surrounding villages, there the Squire directs him to points of interest, including Gallows Hill, where locals were hung for their crimes and misdemeanours, his interest is also taken by a local abbey which the Squire describes as a ruin, but Fanshawe can see through the binoculars that it clearly isn't, he investigates further and pays a visit to the site of the abbey and is shocked to find that there are but a few stone remnants? Fanshawe doesn't have too much time to think about this conundrum as he darkness falls he feels he is being watched, he feels a presence, he begins to see moving shadows in the woods, startled he runs home. Over dinner he imparts details of his harrowing day to the Squire, Patten overhears the story and suggests an explanation for it..The Binoculars! they used to belong to a local man called Baxter, whom it would seem collected bones and skulls from Gallows Hill, boiling them up for some concoction or other, Baxter had disappeared mysteriously one night, the late Squire had acquired his belongings, including a mask made out of a skull and some old etchings of the area. These etchings fascinate Fanshawe as they portray the Abbey he seen through his binoculars, but he learns that the abbey had been destroyed during the reign of Henry VII and so it would be impossible for Baxter to have drawn the sketches, never the less they are signed and dated by Baxter to the recent past so he concludes that the binoculars have some special power. That night he has horrifically vivid dreams, when he wakes, he sets off with the binoculars to have a closer look at the abbey through them, what he finds surprises him but has he put himself in perilous danger by doing so? Fanshawe finally becomes trapped in his dangerous obsession, as darkness falls the Squire and a search party go in search of the now missing archaeologist, they are alerted by dozens of loudly cawing crows circling above Gallows HIll, they quicken their speed, but will they be in time to help or save Fanshawe from his destiny? The Ghost Story for Christmas series of films made by the BBC sadly ended its initial run of films in 1978 with The Ice House, they were for the most part based on the work of the great M.R. James. In 2005 and 2006 the series was revived briefly and thankfully A View from a Hill also marked a return to the work of James, whose ghostly writings have haunted many generations of readers. Director Luke Watson being new to the series might have worried fans of the older films, but he returns to the period setting abandoned by the later films which immediately sets the tone for a great Ghost story, his direction is assured as he stays true to the mood of the masters works and gradually builds up the fear factor to a terrifying climax, all the while keeping what the viewer sees to a minimum, thus upping the tension and mystery. The Autumn countryside provides oodles of atmosphere, the falling leaves and low lying sun providing an unsettling backdrop for the sinister events to come. The cast it must be said are all superb and are perfectly cast in their respective roles. The idea behind the binoculars is simple but very effective, the use of a man made object to see supernatural beings and events that the naked eye cannot see, may even have influenced Álex de la Iglesia in his film La habitación del niño (2006) of the following year, with which it bears striking similarity. I had heard mixed reviews of this particular film, but i must say i found it at all times intriguing and it even raised a few hairs on my head and gave me a few shivers, something that doesn't happen much these days, i think any negativity surrounding the film can only be attributed to its pacing, which to my eyes is perfection but to modern audiences it will be seen as deathly slow. Plenty of time is given, even within its brief 40 minutes running time, for character development and plot expansion and i must say its a new favourite of mine and certainly one of the better films of the decade.","output":"After reading the given movie review, I would classify it as a positive review.

Write an article with the title: \\"Microsoft is killing its Android smartphones after just four months\\"","output":"Title: \\"Microsoft Is Killing Its Android Smartphones After Just Four Months\\" Introduction It is with a heavy heart that we report that Microsoft, the global giant known for its innovations and technological advancements, has decided to prematurely end its venture into the sphere of Android smartphones. Just four months into their journey, the company has declared a halt on the production and development of their fledgling Android devices. Why the Discontinuation? So, why did Microsoft decide to pull the plug so precipitously? The company has been tight-lipped about exact reasons, but industry analysts speculate a combination of factors. These may range from slow sales and reduced market enthusiasm to an attempt to focus on their core business, which is software rather than hardware. Market Performance During the short lifespan of Microsoft's Android smartphones, the market response was tepid. Despite offering a unique user experience, blending Microsoft's usability with Android's customizability, the smartphones could not stand out in a market saturated by established competitors. This factor alone may justify Microsoft's decision, putting its resources into areas with higher potential returns instead of battling giants in a field not its own. Prioritizing Core Business Microsoft's foray into Android smartphones was an ambitious move, but also a departure from its tradition. The company has made its name as a leading software developer, with products like Windows and Office being universally recognized. One theory suggests that Microsoft is reverting to its core business model of delivering innovative software solutions, rather than dividing attention between hardware and software. The Impact on Existing Users Existing users of Microsoft's Android smartphones may feel the sting of disappointment at this news. However, Microsoft has assured its customers that despite the discontinuation, they will continue to provide all necessary support and updates for the current devices. This measure ensures that users are not left stranded and can continue to enjoy their smartphones for as long as they wish to keep them. Conclusion The halt on Microsoft's Android Smartphones is a bold stroke, illustrating how even tech giants need to make strategic decisions to ensure sustainability. Although this news is somewhat disheartening for Microsoft's Android users, it directs us to the real-time unpredictability of the tech industry. Companies often have to make tough calls and reallocate resources where they're best used. For Microsoft, seemingly, that's not in Android smartphones. As usual, Microsoft continues to evolve, seemingly with a refocused emphasis on its foundation - its software. Justification of the Steps: 1. Introduction: I started with a captivating introduction to engage the readers and provide a brief about what the article is going to be about. 2. Why the Discontinuation?: Here, I created a section to contemplate the reasons behind Microsoft's decision. This keeps the readers hooked, answering the primary question the title suggests. 3. Market Performance: This section analyses the performance of Microsoft's Android smartphones in the market, adding validity to the speculated reasons for the discontinuation. 4. Prioritizing Core Business: Here, I reflected on how this decision may be a strategic step for Microsoft as it returns to its primary focus on software. 5. The Impact on Existing Users: It is important to address how this decision could affect existing users, thus, I dedicated a section to discuss this issue. 6. Conclusion: Concluded the article summarizing the main points of the article and ending it on a thoughtful note."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what relaxes, thereby causing aneurysms?\\" is \\"veins and arteries\\", given that  aneurysms are caused by relaxation of cell walls of blood vessels? OPT: A. Yes. B. No. Answer:","output":"Answer: B. No. The term \\"veins and arteries\\" alone does not provide a complete and accurate explanation of what causes aneurysms. It is important to understand the underlying processes that cause a weakening and subsequent relaxation of the blood vessel walls. Aneurysms result from the weakening or relaxation of the blood vessel walls, which can affect both veins and arteries; however, they are more commonly associated with arteries. Aneurysms are caused by a variety of factors, including genetic predispositions, blood pressure, and atherosclerosis. Elevated blood pressure and atherosclerosis can damage and weaken the arterial walls, making them more susceptible to bulging and rupturing. Genetic factors, such as inherited connective tissue disorders and family history of aneurysms, can also play a role in the development of weakened blood vessel walls. In summary, while veins and arteries are the blood vessels that can be affected by aneurysms, it is the relaxation or weakening of their cell walls due to various factors that are the direct cause of aneurysms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which Danish scientist won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1922 for his work on atomic structure and quantum theory?","output":"The Danish scientist who won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1922 for his significant contributions to the understanding of atomic structure and quantum theory was Niels Henrik David Bohr. He was born on October 7, 1885, in Copenhagen, Denmark, and was a prominent physicist and philosopher during his time. Niels Bohr made several groundbreaking discoveries during his career, but his most notable achievement was the development of the Bohr atomic model, which remains a cornerstone of modern atomic theory. His model, which he presented in 1913, was one of the first attempts to integrate quantum theory into the description of the behavior and structure of atoms. This was a critical step toward understanding the nature of atoms and their interactions with radiation, opening the door to further advancements in physics and quantum mechanics. Bohr's atomic model proposed that electrons orbit the nucleus in specific, fixed paths known as \\"quantum orbits\\" or \\"energy levels,\\" only transitioning between these levels when absorbing or emitting quantized amounts of energy. In other words, only certain discrete changes in energy are permitted for atoms. This was a radical departure from the classical understanding of atomic structure, which assumed that electrons orbited the nucleus in a continuous range of distances and energy levels. Bohr's atomic model was able to accurately explain several atomic phenomena, including the emission spectrum of hydrogen, and helped settle discrepancies between experimental observations and predictions of classical physics. It should be noted, however, that newer atomic models have since improved upon Bohr's original concept, incorporating more sophisticated aspects of quantum mechanics and providing a more comprehensive explanation for atomic behavior. In addition to the Bohr atomic model, Niels Bohr also contributed to the development of quantum mechanics itself. His famous correspondence principle, which states that classical physics should be a limiting case of quantum mechanics, became an important guiding principle for the advancement of the field. Bohr also played a crucial role in the establishment of the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics, which emphasizes the probabilistic nature of quantum systems and emphasizes that \\"wavefunction collapse\\" occurs when observations are made – essentially marking the boundary between the quantum world and the classical everyday world. Throughout his career, Bohr made significant contributions to the scientific community and greatly influenced the course of theoretical physics. His substantial work on atomic structure and quantum theory not only won him the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physics but also established him as one of the founding fathers of modern atomic and quantum physics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(A). yes (B). it is not possible to tell (C). no","output":"(A). Yes The sentence \\"Someone sits in a harness in front of a sign\\" is a true sentence based on the provided information: \\"A girl sits in a harness ready to lift up into the air and behind her is a sign that says \\"active.\\"\\" To further elaborate, here is a breakdown of how the original sentence supports the mentioned answer: 1. \\"A girl sits in a harness...\\" - This part of the sentence clearly establishes that there is a person (in this case, a girl) sitting in a harness. Therefore, the phrase \\"Someone sits in a harness\\" from the second sentence is accurate. 2. \\"...and behind her is a sign that says \\"active.\\"\\" - This part mentions a sign that is located behind the girl. As the girl is in front of the sign, the part from the second sentence saying \\"in front of a sign\\" also stands true. Taking both points into account, it can be concluded that the sentence \\"Someone sits in a harness in front of a sign\\" is an accurate representation of the situation described in the original sentence and thus the correct answer is (A).

Information:  - Psychological horror is a subgenre of horror literature, film, television, and video games (as a narrative) which relies on the character's fears and/or psychological instability to frighten readers, viewers or players. On a few occasions, Psychological horror overlaps with the psychological thriller subgenre, making whatever story of the genre more unpleasant as well as terrifyingly suspenseful.  - The term \\"Cinema of Korea\\" (or \\"Korean cinema\\") encompasses the motion picture industries of North and South Korea. As with all aspects of Korean life during the past century, the film industry has often been at the mercy of political events, from the late Joseon dynasty to the Korean War to domestic governmental interference. While both countries have relatively robust film industries today, only South Korean films have achieved wide international acclaim. North Korean films tend to portray their communist or revolutionary themes.  - Horror film is a film genre that seeks to elicit a negative emotional reaction from viewers by playing on their fears. Inspired by literature from authors like Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley, horror films have existed for more than a century. The macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Horror may also overlap with the fantasy, supernatural fiction and thriller genres.  - Exorcism (from Greek , \\"exorkismos\\"  binding by oath) is the religious or spiritual practice of purportedly evicting demons or other spiritual entities from a person or an area they are believed to have possessed.

Many of the Korean horror films tend to focus on the suffering and the anguish of characters rather than focus on the explicit \`\` blood and guts '' aspect of horror .  - Japanese folklorists and historians use \\"ykai\\" as \\"supernatural or unaccountable phenomena to their informants\\". In the Edo period, many artists, such as Toriyama Sekien, created \\"ykai\\" inspired by folklore or their own ideas, and in the present, several \\"ykai\\" created by them (e.g. Kameosa and Amikiri, see below) are wrongly considered as being of legendary origin.  - Horror is a genre of fiction which is intended to, or has the capacity to frighten, scare, disgust, or startle their readers or viewers by inducing feelings of horror and terror. Literary historian J. A. Cuddon has defined the horror story as \\"a piece of fiction in prose of variable length... which shocks or even frightens the reader, or perhaps induces a feeling of repulsion or loathing\\". It creates an eerie and frightening atmosphere. Horror is frequently supernatural, though it can be non-supernatural.

Let's break down the elements from the second sentence and compare them to the first sentence to analyze this further: 1. Two friends are walking down the street: The first sentence does mention two girls walking together, but it does not specify if they are friends or not. Likewise, the location of the street is not mentioned. Therefore, this part of the second sentence cannot be confirmed to be true. 2. They are being followed by someone: The first sentence does not provide any information about a third person or any indication that the girls are being followed. The girl with pink streaked hair is looking back, which might suggest that she is aware of someone or something behind them. However, without more context, we cannot definitively conclude that they are being followed. Since this information is not mentioned in the first sentence, it cannot be confirmed true. Considering the above analysis, we cannot label the second sentence as true based solely on the information provided in the first sentence. The original sentence lacks explicit details regarding the girls' relationship, their location, or the presence of a follower.

Movie title: Quadrophenia Context: The film, set in 1964, follows the life of Jimmy Cooper (Phil Daniels), a young London Mod. Disillusioned by his parents and a dull job as a post room boy in an advertising firm, Jimmy finds an outlet for his teenage angst by taking amphetamines, partying, riding scooters and brawling with Rockers, accompanied by his Mod friends Dave (Mark Wingett), Chalky (Philip Davis) and Spider (Gary Shail). One of the Mods' rivals, the Rockers, is in fact Jimmy's childhood friend, Kevin (Ray Winstone). An attack by hostile Rockers on Spider leads to a retaliation attack on Kevin. Jimmy participates in the beating, but when he realises the victim is Kevin, he doesn't help him, instead riding away on his scooter. A bank holiday weekend provides the excuse for the rivalry between Mods and Rockers to come to a head, as they both descend upon the seaside town of Brighton. A series of running battles ensues. As the police close in on the rioters, Jimmy escapes down an alleyway with Steph (Leslie Ash)Â â a girl on whom he has a crushÂ â and they have sex. When the pair emerge, they find themselves in the middle of the melee just as police are detaining rioters. Jimmy is arrested, detained with a volatile, popular Mod he calls 'Ace Face' (Sting), and later fined the then-large sum of Â£50. When fined Â£75, Ace Face mocks the magistrate by offering to pay on the spot with a cheque, to the amusement of the fellow Mods. Back in London, Jimmy becomes severely depressed. He is thrown out of his house by his mother, who finds his stash of amphetamine pills. He then quits his job, spends his severance package on more pills, and finds out that Steph has become the girlfriend of his friend Dave. After a brief fight with Dave, the following morning his rejection is confirmed by Steph and with his beloved Lambretta scooter accidentally destroyed in a crash, Jimmy takes a train back to Brighton.

Katie Amos, 30, and fiancé Lee Johnston, 29, welcomed 3lb son Dax unexpectedly after she went into labor during a four-day holiday in the United States city.      Doctors said the child would require treatment until March - which the family's insurance may not cover.      But their fears were put to rest on Friday when Manhattan's Lenox Hill hospital released a statement saying they will work with the insurance company to ensure all bills are covered.      And a fundraising page set up by friends and family has raised 9,577.68 (£6,248).      Scroll down for video      Katie Amos, 30, and fiancé Lee Johnston, 29, from Burgh-le-Marsh, Lincolnshire, welcomed son Dax (together above) unexpectedly after she went into labour 11 weeks early while sightseeing during a New York getaway      Miss Amos and son Dax (above), who was born weighing 3lbs, can't fly back to Britain until March, leaving the family stranded with limited supplies. Family and friends are now trying to raise funds for the couple      The couple wished everyone a Happy New Year today via Facebook, directly from Dax's hospital bedside      'Lenox Hill Hospital continues to work with the insurance carrier regarding payment approvals for all services rendered by the hospital, anesthesia and physician services from their insurance carrier,' a spokesman said, according to the Guardian.      'We will ensure that there will be no financial impact to the family.      'In addition, our staff has been going above and beyond to ease the overall experience for the family, from arranging a place to live for the duration of their stay to helping them communicate with their family in the UK.'      American doctors said the pair's medical bills will reach 200,000 (£130,000), leaving the couple stranded overseas with limited clothes and money.      They had set off from Burgh-le-Marsh, Lincolnshire, on December 26 for the short break, but ended up at Lenox Hill Hospital on the Upper East Side of Manhattan just two days later.      Dax was born within hours of Miss Amos - a fitness instructor - going into labour in New York's Central Park.      The couple instantly panicked that their insurance policy may not cover the full cost of their stay, although they confirmed Miss Amos had been told she would be covered to fly to abroad.      The pair are encouraging friends and family to help raise funds to help cover their costs while they organise temporary accommodation and the essentials they need.      Mr Johnston, a self-employed personal trainer, said: 'He is doing great and so is Katie but we can't return home for up to two to three months.'      He added to The Mirror: 'The only problem is we aren't sure if our insurance covers the medical bill.      'We feel quite stranded at the moment, we are stuck here without our family.      'It is scary because we don't know anyone so we are completely on our own.      'We just really want to get home but the main thing is Dax is as safe and as well as possible.'      Baby Dax is currently in an incubator and weighs just 3lb but the couple said he is 'making good progress'      The pair, who have been together for more than a decade, had planned a 'last holiday' before the baby arrived      Miss Amos, a fitness instructor, and Mr Johnston, a personal trainer, fear the insurance firm may not pay out      Richard Crow, a friend of Mr Johnston's for more than six years, said Dax's arrival was a big shock. He has now set up a dedicated Facebook page to help raise funds for the family's stay in New York.      He told MailOnline: ‘It was such a shock to everyone. The family are all so shocked but so overwhelmed with how everyone is pulling together and how a community can step up and help out.      'Dax is fine, thankfully. He's 11 weeks early but fine.      'It was a bit of a shock, they were walking through Central Park and she got some real bad pains and they had a bit of rest but it got worse and worse and then Lee said “we need to get you to a hospital” and within about an hour-and-a-half he was born.'      Mr Crow said Miss Amos had received an epidural at the U.S. hospital, which doctors told them cost in the region of £5,000.      He said the couple were worried about their financial situation, having to find food and essentials in America for three months while also paying their rent and bills at home.      However, he said they had been put up in temporary accommodation, funded by the Ronald McDonald charity - which provides a free 'home away from home' for families with children in hospital.      He said: 'It’s hard enough having a child, especially the first because everything is so daunting, but to then be 11 weeks premature and be 5,000 miles away with no family, friends, or clothes, is really hard.      ‘They haven’t got Wi-Fi and the cost of communication is that much that they haven't dared turn their phones on.      ‘To then be told you’re not allowed to leave the hospital, is hard. Lee can’t work because he hasn’t got a Visa, so they have got no way of living while they are over there. They’ve also got house and bills to pay here.      ‘All I want to do, at a time when their main priority is Dax and caring for him, is take off the pressure on the money front. It would make the experience a hell of a lot better for them.’      IS IT SAFE TO FLY WHILE PREGNANT? SOME AIRLINES BAN EXPECTANT MOTHERS IN THE FINAL FEW WEEKS OF PREGNANCY Most women are safe to travel well into their pregnancy if they take proper precautions, according to government guidelines. The best time to travel is mid-pregnancy, as the risk of miscarriage is higher in the first three months. Some airlines ban pregnant women from flying, but only in the final few weeks of pregnancy when the chance of labour is naturally higher. Travel insurance would normally cover pregnancy-related medical care. Long-haul flights can increase the risk of blood clots, so frequent movement is advised.      Miss Amos (left) had an epidural at the U.S. hospital, which doctors said cost in the region of £5,000      Miss Amos gave birth to Dax at Lenox Hill Hospital in the Upper East side of Manhattan on December 28      Miss Amos went into labour during a sightseeing tour in New York's Central Park (pictured). She later gave birth at Lenox Hill Hospital, where Beyoncé gave birth to her daughter and where Lady Gaga was born in 1986      Mr Crow said he had so far raised about £2,150, with more fundraising events, including a community party, lined up in the near future.      He said he would be transferring any money to the couple via PayPal and said he expected they would spend it on food, essentials and paying their rent and bills in the UK.      He said Mr Johnston had even contemplated flying back to the UK to go back to work to help with costs.      He said: 'He said it is an option for him to fly back and work but I think he’s a bit wary of leaving Katie and Dax over there on their own.      ‘We’re going to take on to his clients so he still has a business to come back to.      ‘Katie’s dad is looking at flying out in February, Lee’s mum and dad are looking the week after next.'      Mr Johnston’s father Ray said it was difficult with the family being on the other side of the Atlantic.      The couple (above) have been put up in temporary accommodation, funded by the Ronald McDonald charity - which provides a free 'home from home'      He told MailOnline: ‘It was a massive shock. It came completely out of the blue. She wasn’t due until March 10. They only went for four days. She got all the certificates for the plane and everything from the doctors, everything was fine.      ‘It’s just so far away. We’re happy that Dax is doing really well but we’re very sad we’re not there. It’s very hard on the family, what with the insurance and whether they will be covered.      ‘We have no idea how much will be covered, that’s our big worry. The hospital has been absolutely amazing over there, everybody wants to help them.      ‘It’s heart-breaking for us not being there but it’s wonderful to see them so fit and healthy.      ‘We’re definitely going to go out there, we’re just not sure when yet. It’s very difficult at the moment with lack of contact but Dax is doing really well and that’s the most important thing.’      Mr Johnston also also said it was overwhelming to see the amount of support from the community.      He said: ‘Richard is doing all this fundraising and it’s just amazing. Words can’t express how much I want to thank them.      ‘It takes your breath away how kind people have been. It’s just amazing.’      Mr Johnston's brother Dean said the birth had been a 'huge shock' and said everyone was rallying around to do as much as possible to help the stranded couple.      He said: 'They were taking one last holiday before the baby was born but Dax decided he wasn’t waiting any longer and arrived 11 weeks early.      'He was born on December 28. We got the phone call in the early hours and when they said Katie had had the baby, we went into shock.      'They are all in good health, there were no complications with the birth which was fantastic from a health point of view. Dax is in an incubator but he is breathing on his own. The progress he’s making is really good.      'The current issue that we're facing is that the travel insurance company hasn't agreed to cover anything at the minute. They said they will await a medical report from the hospital to see what they will cover.      'Katie did contact them prior to them leaving and asked if she was covered and they said it was all okay.'      He also thanked the community for all those who have helped raise money or donated to the cause.      He said: 'The fundraising has been unbelievable overwhelming, to see the love and support we’ve had from friends, family and the general public it’s been truly exceptional.      'We are eternally grateful to everything that everyone is doing.'      The Foreign Office confirmed it had been made aware of 'the hospitalisation of a British National in New York' and added: 'We are providing consular assistance.'      As part of his fundraising efforts, Mr Crow, 37, who also lives in Burgh-le-Marsh, has now set up a Facebook page to allow members of the public to follow the couple's story and help.      The couple left their Lincolnshire home for New York on Boxing Day, for a four-day short break in New York      The Dax's Tale of New York page has so far had 3,406 likes and is written by Mr Crow, a gym owner, pretending to be the couple's newborn son.      One post said: 'Thank you so much for all your help and your generosity! Mummy and Daddy are still very scared.      'All of my family sincerely thank you all for all your help and donations at at time which allows them to just concentrate on little old me.'      Baby Dax is currently at Lenox Hill Hospital, where Beyoncé famously rented out a 1,750 suite when she gave birth to her daughter Blue Ivy in 2012.      Joan Rivers, Sarah Jessica Parker and Tine Fey have also all given birth at the hospital, while Lady Gaga was born there in 1986. ||||| A direct message from Lee and Katie.

Upon our safe return to the UK we will be making a personal donation to the foundation and will carry on supporting their cause in the future. As of now, we have no idea of how much we will need here as obviously overthe next 10 weeks anything can go wrong, but it's looking good.      So from now on we ask if you still wish to donate to us, kindly donatedirectly to the Ronald Macdonald Foundation at www.rmhc.org      Please remember guys we understand that you may feel you want to help us, but by helping them you are helping us.

Sending love to all the families of the world that have helped us and remember there is no love stronger than the love for your family.

The couple's insurance was uncertain to cover the full cost of their stay. However, the Lenox Hill hospital in Manhattan assured them they will not have to pay, and will work with the insurance company to make sure all bills are covered. Friends and family also set up a fundraising page that raised £6,248 to help the couple."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article: When it comes to playing spin the bottle, the very first thing you'll need is other people (unless you want to play by yourself, which would be a pretty sad sight). To begin, find a group of willing friends — the more the merrier! Try to get a group that contains people of both genders so that there are a range of many different combinations of people who can potentially kiss. Make sure your friends know what they are getting into before you start playing.  Kissing is something that's usually reserved for people who really like each other, so forcing people to kiss who don't want to can be really embarrassing for everyone involved. Don't pressure anyone into playing with you who doesn't want to. When everyone is ready (and willing) to play, arrange yourselves in a circle so that you're all facing inward. Traditionally, this is done on the floor, though there's no reason you can't also do it standing or sitting around a table. Regardless of exactly how you arrange your group in a circle, it's usually best to pick a spot with a tough, hard surface, like a section of hardwood floor. This ensures that the bottle you use can spin well without scuffing or damaging the floor. When you're all ready to play, pick one person to start the game. This person grabs a bottle (or, really, any similarly spin-able object, like a pen, glass, key, etc.) and spins it hard in the middle of the circle of players. After it starts spinning, no one may touch the bottle until it comes to a complete stop. If you're unsure of how to decide who should spin the bottle first, you may want to try letting the oldest or youngest play go first or having one person think of a random number and starting with the person who guesses closest to it. When the bottle comes to a stop, its \\"neck\\" (the end that opens) should be pointing at someone sitting in the circle. The person who spun the bottle has to kiss this person!  If you're not using a bottle, designate one end of the object you're using as the pointing end. For instance, if you're using a pen, you might want to use the writing end of the pen as its \\"point\\". If you spin the bottle and it lands on you, spin again. That's really all there is to it! After one person has spun the bottle and given a kiss to the person the bottle ends up pointing at, the person next to him or her in the circle gives the bottle a spin and gives a kiss to the person his or her spin lands on. Play proceeds in one direction — either clockwise or counter-clockwise.  Note that sometimes the bottle will end up pointing at the space between two people — in this case, you may want to make the spinner kiss the person that the bottle's point is closest to. Additionally, the bottle may end up pointing at someone that you're not comfortable kissing because of your romantic preferences (for instance, if you're attracted to boys and it lands on a girl). In this case, you may want to kiss the person of the appropriate gender who's closest to the bottle's point. Congratulations! You've learned how to play spin the bottle. This fun and easy game is best enjoyed with a light-hearted attitude from all involved. Don't let things get too romantic or sexual — it's just a game, and one which can become pretty awkward pretty fast if it's taken too seriously. However, if you do feel that telltale \\"spark\\" with someone after playing the game, there's no reason why you shouldn't make a point to get to know him or her after the game! Spin the bottle is great for igniting new connections you might not otherwise have made.","output":"Spin the bottle is a game in which participants sit in a circle and take turns spinning a bottle or similar object. The goal is to have a group of friends with both genders for different kissing combinations. Players should be willing to participate, and no one should be pressured to play. The group sits in a circle, traditionally on a hard surface, and the chosen person spins the bottle. When the bottle stops, the spinner must kiss the person it points to. If the bottle points between two players or someone the spinner is uncomfortable kissing, adjustments can be made. The game is meant to be light-hearted and can lead to new connections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

You are constantly interacting with people in need, and often despite your best efforts, you are unable to help them due to social factors or your clients' own resistance.","output":"To be a good social worker, it is essential to develop certain qualities, skills, and practices that will enable you to effectively support individuals and communities in overcoming various challenges. Here are some key aspects to work on in your journey to become an effective social worker: 1. Empathy and Compassion: It is crucial to be understanding and supportive of your clients' emotions, experiences, and struggles. Demonstrating empathy and offering emotional support can help create trust between you and your clients, while also motivating them to participate actively in their treatment plans. 2. Communication Skills: As a social worker, you will need to communicate sensitively and effectively with people from diverse backgrounds and with varying levels of cognitive or emotional functioning. Be sure to develop strong active listening skills, nonverbal communication, and the ability to convey complex information in a clear and concise manner. 3. Cultural Competence: Understanding and appreciating cultural differences is key to working effectively with diverse populations. Educate yourself about the cultures of the communities you serve, and reflect on your own biases and assumptions to develop a more inclusive and respectful practice. 4. Time Management and Organization: Social workers often juggle multiple cases and responsibilities. Being able to prioritize tasks, manage your time wisely, and have an organized record-keeping system are critical skills to ensure that you provide high-quality service to your clients. 5. Flexibility and Adaptability: The social work field often involves unpredictability; therefore, it's essential to stay flexible and adaptable to unique circumstances and changing environments. Be ready to adjust your approach or strategies when needed to better serve your clients. 6. Critical Thinking and Problem Solving: Social workers are often tasked with making complex decisions under pressure. Develop the ability to think critically and analyze situations from multiple perspectives, taking into account the individual and societal factors contributing to your clients' challenges. 7. Self-Care and Boundaries: To be an effective social worker, it's important to maintain self-awareness and engage in self-care practices to prevent burnout. Set appropriate professional boundaries, seek supervision and support when needed, and reflect regularly on your own emotions and reactions to ensure that you are maintaining personal well-being. 8. Advocacy Skills: Working as a social worker means advocating for your clients' rights and needs, both on an individual and systemic level. Develop the skills to engage with community organizations, lawmakers, and other stakeholders to promote change and fight for social justice. 9. Continuous Learning: The field of social work is constantly evolving, with new research and best practices emerging regularly. Stay informed about relevant changes, attend professional development opportunities, and regularly review your own practices to ensure the best possible outcomes for your clients. 10. Collaboration and Teamwork: Social workers often work in interdisciplinary teams to address their clients' challenges. It's essential to develop strong teamwork skills and the ability to collaborate with other professionals such as psychologists, doctors, nurses, and teachers to provide holistic support to those in need. In conclusion, to be a good social worker, you need to develop a balanced mix of personal qualities, professional skills, and self-awareness.

First, he went to stage one, where the music was playing in high decibel. Then he went to stage two. There the music was playing in low decibel. He kind of liked the latter one.  But I can use this background: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing.  What is an answer for this question: Which stage would be louder, stage one or stage two? A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the background, it can be determined that Stage One was louder than Stage Two.  Let's explain this in a detailed way. The decibel scale is logarithmic, which means that every increment represents a multiplication rather than an arithmetic addition. This scale is used to measure the intensity or the amplitude of a sound wave, which are physical properties directly proportional to its perceived volume or loudness. In the context of the music festival that Mark attended, you mentioned that Stage One was playing music at a high decibel level and Stage Two was playing music at a low decibel level. The relative loudness of these two stages would directly depend on their decibel levels. The stage with the higher decibel level would be louder because, as stated in the background, if the sound intensity increases by 10 decibels, the perceived loudness is 10 times greater. This intensity change is not linear but is, in fact, exponential. For instance, a 10-decibel increase in sound intensity results in a tenfold increase in the perceived loudness. A 20-decibel increase will result in a hundredfold (10 x 10) increase in loudness, and a 30-decibel increase results in a thousandfold (10 x 10 x 10) increase. High-decibel sounds can indeed be dangerous. Prolonged exposure to sounds above 85 decibels, such as those common at large music concerts, can cause noise-induced hearing loss. The danger increases with both the decibel level and the duration of exposure. So, using this understanding, since the music at Stage One was defined as having a high decibel level in relation to Stage Two's music, we can infer that the music at Stage One was louder. Therefore, it follows that if Mark preferred the quieter music, he would have favored Stage Two where the music was playing at a lower decibel level. This would have also minimized any potential risk to his hearing.  Please note that this explanation assumes the same distance between Mark and the sound source at both stages. The perceived loudness of a sound can also decrease with distance, so if Mark were significantly further away from the source of sound at Stage One compared to Stage Two, the perceived loudness could potentially differ. Nonetheless, with the same distance assumed, it is clear that Stage One is indeed louder than Stage Two as per your scenario description."}]`),Y={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},q={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],D={key:0},E={key:1};function R(o,e,h,p,n,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),k(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",q,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
