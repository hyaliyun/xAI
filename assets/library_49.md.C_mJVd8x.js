Emphasize that it refers to actions happening in the present time, but does not indicate the exact moment of speaking. 2. Provide examples: Give simple and relatable examples that demonstrate the use of the Simple Present Tense. Examples could include sentences like: - \\"I eat breakfast every morning.\\" - \\"He plays soccer on Saturdays.\\" - \\"The sun rises in the east.\\" 3. Explain the structure: Highlight the basic structure of the Simple Present Tense, which follows the pattern: Subject + Base Form of Verb (+ S/es for the third person singular). 4. Discuss usage: Describe the various situations in which the Simple Present Tense is commonly used. These include: - Habits and routines: Describe how it is used to talk about actions that are repeated regularly. - General truths and facts: Explain that it is used to state facts that are considered true at all times. - Instructions and directions: Note that it can be used to give commands or provide step-by-step instructions. 5. Address the third person singular: Explain that when the subject of a sentence is in the third person singular (he, she, it, or a singular noun), an \\"s\\" or \\"es\\" is added to the base form of the verb. 6. Practice exercises: Engage students in exercises or activities to reinforce the understanding of the Simple Present Tense. These can include fill-in-the-blank exercises, sentence completion tasks, or roleplays. 7. Provide additional resources: Share relevant online resources, textbooks, or worksheets that students can use to further practice and consolidate their knowledge of the Simple Present Tense. 8.

It occurs when security considerations are not adequately addressed during the design process, leading to potential risks and compromises to confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. Insecure design can manifest in various ways, including: 1. Lack of encryption: Failure to incorporate encryption mechanisms or using weak encryption algorithms can expose sensitive data to eavesdropping and unauthorized access. 2. Poor authentication and access control: Insufficient or ineffective authentication methods can enable unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive information or carry out unauthorized activities. 3. Weak error handling: Inadequate error handling mechanisms can provide valuable information to attackers, allowing them to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access. 4. Inadequate input validation: Failure to properly validate and sanitize user input can lead to input-based attacks, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS). 5. Lack of secure default settings: Systems or devices with insecure default configurations can make it easier for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities, as users may not change defaults or be unaware of the risks involved. 6. Absence of secure update mechanisms: Without secure update mechanisms, systems may not receive patches or updates, leaving them vulnerable to known security flaws. 7. Poor physical security: Neglecting physical security measures, such as unauthorized access prevention or tampering detection mechanisms, can expose systems to physical attacks. Addressing insecure design requires a holistic approach that considers security throughout the entire design and development lifecycle. This includes incorporating security requirements from the beginning, conducting threat modeling, performing rigorous testing and validation, and keeping systems up to date with security patches and updates. Overall, it is crucial to prioritize secure design practices to prevent vulnerabilities and enhance the overall security posture of a product, system, or service."},{"instruction":"GenericLFI_BODY","output":"The term \\"GenericLFI_BODY\\" is not a recognized term or concept in the field of cybersecurity. It is possible that you may be referring to Local File Inclusion (LFI), which is a type of vulnerability that allows an attacker to include files from a local server. LFI vulnerabilities can be found in web applications that use user-supplied input to retrieve and display content. In an LFI attack, an attacker tries to exploit the application by injecting malicious file paths or directory traversal sequences into user-supplied input fields. If the application does not properly validate or sanitize the input, the attacker may be able to access and render files that are stored on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information, executing arbitrary code, or escalating privileges. To protect against LFI vulnerabilities, developers should follow secure coding practices such as: 1. Implementing proper input validation and sanitization to prevent unauthorized access. 2. Avoiding user-supplied input within file inclusion functions and using whitelisting or specific input parameters when necessary. 3. Utilizing secure coding languages and frameworks that have built-in protection against LFI attacks. 4. Implementing strict file access controls and ensuring that only necessary files and directories are accessible to the application. Regular security assessments, penetration testing, and code reviews can help identify potential LFI vulnerabilities and ensure that proper security measures are in place to mitigate such risks."},{"instruction":"AppUtils_Printf","output":"AppUtils_Printf is an Android utility class that provides a convenient method for printing formatted strings.

Задачи в классе P возможны для эффективного решения и считаются \\"легкими\\" задачами. 2. NP-класс: Этот класс содержит задачи, для которых существует полиномиальный алгоритм для проверки правильности решения, но возможного полиномиального алгоритма для их эффективного решения неизвестно. В NP-классе находятся многие задачи оптимизации и комбинаторные задачи. Если для NP-задачи найдено эффективное решение, то все NP-задачи могут быть решены за полиномиальное время. 3. NP-полный класс: Этот класс содержит задачи, которые являются самыми трудными в NP-классе. Если существует полиномиальное решение для любой задачи NP-полного класса, то такое решение можно применить к любой другой NP-полной задаче. На данный момент не существует известного полиномиального алгоритма для решения NP-полных задач, хотя они могут быть эффективно решены с использованием приближенных алгоритмов или эвристик.

Полином - это математическая функция, в которой каждый член имеет степень не более некоторой константы. В случае времени выполнения алгоритма, полиномиальное время означает, что время выполнения алгоритма не зависит от входных данных таким образом, что рост времени выполнения может быть выражен в виде полинома от размера входных данных. Например, если у нас есть алгоритм с временем выполнения O(n^2), где n - размер входных данных, то это означает, что время выполнения алгоритма возрастает квадратично с ростом размера входных данных. Алгоритм с временем выполнения O(n^3) будет трехчленным полиномом и т.д. Если алгоритм имеет полиномиальное время выполнения, то это обычно считается хорошим свойством, так как это означает, что задача может быть решена эффективно для большинства практических случаев. Однако, стоит отметить, что даже полиномиальное время может быть неприемлемо для огромных входных данных, и в таких случаях могут использоваться более сложные алгоритмы или эвристики."},{"instruction":"Расскажи про класс NP-полных задач и класс NP-трудных задач","output":"Класс NP-полных задач - это класс задач, которые находятся в NP (невыполнимых в полиномиальное время) и имеют свойство, что любая другая NP-задача может быть сводима к ним за полиномиальное время. Концепция NP-полноты возникла в теории вычислений и является одним из наиболее важных достижений в области алгоритмов. Задачи в этом классе обладают следующими свойствами: 1. NP-сложность: Задачи NP-полные, во-первых, находятся в классе NP, что означает, что для они могут быть проверены на правильность решения за полиномиальное время. Это свойство является следствием того, что если у нас есть предполагаемое решение для задачи, мы можем эффективно проверить его на правильность. 2. NP-трудность: Задачи NP-полные также обладают свойством NP-трудности. Это означает, что любая другая NP-задача может быть полиномиально сводима к NP-полной задаче. Сводимость обозначает, что если у нас есть эффективный алгоритм для NP-полной задачи, то мы можем использовать его для решения другой NP-задачи, сводимой к этой задаче. 3. Эффективное решение неизвестно: Для большинства NP-полных задач неизвестно существование эффективных полиномиальных алгоритмов для их решения. Это означает, что в худшем случае время выполнения алгоритма растет экспоненциально или факториально с ростом размера входных данных. Примеры NP-полных задач включают задачи о выполнимости булевых формул (SAT), рюкзаковую задачу (Knapsack), задача о рюкзаке с ограничениями на количество предметов (Subset Sum), задачу о коммивояжере (Traveling Salesman Problem) и много других. Изучение класса NP-полных задач позволяет понять, что если мы сможем найти эффективный алгоритм для любой из этих задач, то мы сможем решить все задачи NP за полиномиальное время.

Это математическое понятие и формализм, используемые для описания простых вычислительных моделей, которые работают с последовательностями символов. Основная идея алгоритмов Маркова состоит в том, чтобы иметь набор правил, которые могут изменять состояние системы, и эти правила применяются к последовательности символов один за другим, в зависимости от текущего состояния и символа на входе. Каждое правило обычно состоит из условия и действия, которое выполняется при выполнении этого условия. Алгоритмы Маркова можно применять в различных областях, таких как теория формальных языков, компьютерная наука, искусственный интеллект, биоинформатика и т.д. Они используются для моделирования и понимания поведения систем, в которых присутствует последовательность символов (например, последовательность слов, генетическая последовательность и т.д.). Примеры алгоритмов Маркова включают: 1. Марковские цепи: это особый тип алгоритма Маркова, который определяет, как система переходит из одного состояния в другое на основе некоторой вероятности. Марковские цепи широко используются в стохастическом моделировании и анализе систем. 2. Автоматы Маркова: это система, которая переходит из одного состояния в другое на основе правил, определяющих условия перехода и соответствующие действия. Автоматы Маркова применяются в распознавании образов, обработке естественного языка и других областях. 3. Марковская модель сокрытых состояний (Hidden Markov Model, HMM): это вероятностная модель, где наблюдаемая последовательность символов связана с последовательностью скрытых состояний через вероятностные переходы. HMM широко используются в речевых технологиях, распознавании образов, машинном переводе и других областях. Алгоритмы Маркова являются важным инструментом в области вычислений и предлагают гибкую и понятную модель для работы с последовательностями символов и системами, основанными на этих последовательностях."},{"instruction":"Придумай текст для ролика по социальной безопасности в разрезе финансовой грамотности","output":"\\"В мире, где финансовые решения играют огромную роль в нашей жизни, социальная безопасность становится неотъемлемой частью нашего благополучия.

Капитан, по имени Алекс, собрал команду вместе, чтобы обсудить произошедшее. Экипаж корабля, состоящий из Алекса, навигатора Карлоса, механика Люка и коммуникационного специалиста Эммы, был в полной растерянности. Они никак не могли объяснить, как им удалось пройти через гиперпрыжок, но оказаться в совершенно другой части галактики. Просматривая данные с измерительных инструментов, Карлос обнаружил странные аномалии и искажения в пространстве вокруг корабля. Люк, с экспертизой в области судостроения, заметил неполадки в системе гипердвигателя. Было очевидно, что произошла неопределенная неисправность, вызвавшая сбой во время гиперпрыжка. Команда решила исследовать окружающий мир и понять, где они находятся. Постепенно они осознали, что находятся в какой-то неизвестной им системе, которую они и назвали \\"Тьма\\". Странный синий оттенок и светящиеся точки за окном заставляли экипаж волноваться о природе этой системы. Они наблюдали, как искаженные объекты перемещались с огромной скоростью, будто живые существа, вселяющие страх. Они были уверены, что раньше эти объекты были планетами и звездами, но что-то непонятное произошло с этой системой. На следующий день, космический корабль Меридиан неожиданно вернулся обратно. Они оказались в другой системе, о которой никогда не слышали. Пилоты обрадовались, так как вернулись в безопасное место. Однако радость сменилась тревогой, когда они получили сообщение от Земли. Сообщение было полным восторга и изумления. Команда Меридиана узнала, что их гиперпрыжок стал историческим событием, так как они оказались в соседней галактике, которая недавно была обнаружена. Их открытие проложило путь для новых исследований и расширения границ человечества. Экипаж корабля Меридиан был взволнован своими открытиями и невероятной необычной приключенческой поездкой. Они решили назвать новую систему \\"Галактика Меридиан\\", в честь своего корабля, который привел их туда и обратно. С тех пор экипаж продолжил свои исследования в новых границах космоса, с новым пониманием о его неизведанных тайнах."},{"instruction":"wir arbeiten in Hotel in Rezeption und Zimmer sind nicht sauber.

De plus, la région bénéficie de conditions pédo-climatiques favorables, la rendant moins exposée aux conséquences du changement climatique. Ainsi, la Bretagne a la capacité de produire davantage de bois et de prendre le relais de régions moins favorisées. La région bénéficie également d'un fort soutien politique et de programmes de référence en France, tels que la Bretagne Biodiversité (BB) et le Bois Bretagne Forêt (BFB). De plus, le dynamisme, la densité et la structuration des acteurs de la filière bois en Bretagne permettent une coordination efficace et des actions communes. Les réseaux bocage, les coopératives d'intérêt collectif (SCIC) et le Plan Bocage Énergie Bretagne (PBEB) contribuent ainsi à renforcer le développement de l'arbre dans la région. Enfin, la présence de forêts emblématiques comme Brocéliande ou Huelgoat confère à l'arbre une dimension culturelle et historique qui renforce son attrait. D'autre part, l'arbre représente une réelle opportunité pour la transition écologique en Bretagne. En effet, il permet de répondre aux objectifs du Schéma Régional d'Aménagement, de Développement Durable et d'Égalité des Territoires (SRADDET) en contribuant à la lutte contre les pollutions diffuses, l'érosion, la préservation de la biodiversité et la création d'une trame verte. De plus, l'arbre contribue au rafraîchissement des villes et est un matériau renouvelable, offrant ainsi des solutions durables dans la construction et l'aménagement urbain. L'arbre est également un élément clé pour atteindre la neutralité carbone et le Zéro Artificialisation Nette (ZAN) en Bretagne. En favorisant la plantation d'arbres et la gestion durable des forêts, la région peut réduire efficacement ses émissions de CO2 et compenser les impacts de l'urbanisation. Cette perspective représente une réelle opportunité pour accroître la souveraineté matérielle de la Bretagne, améliorer sa balance commerciale et créer de nombreux emplois. En outre, le développement de l'arbre contribue à améliorer le cadre de vie des Bretons en favorisant la présence de la nature en ville et en créant des espaces de loisirs et de détente. La société bretonne manifeste une sensibilité croissante à l'arbre et exprime des attentes vis-à-vis de sa préservation et de son développement. Au niveau des politiques publiques, il existe un fort réinvestissement dans le secteur de l'arbre en Bretagne. Des programmes tels que France 2030, la Réglementation Environnementale 2020 (RE 2020) ou encore la loi AGEC (Antigaspillage pour une Économie Circulaire) favorisent l'utilisation de matériaux biosourcés, dont le bois, dans la construction.

Первый эксперимент заключался в тщательном анализе всех доступных данных о корабле, его системах и использованных технологиях. Инженеры и ученые изучили работу двигателей, навигационных систем, систем связи и других ключевых компонентов, чтобы выявить какие-либо ошибки или неисправности, которые могли привести к сбою во время прыжка. Они провели компьютерное моделирование и симуляции, чтобы проверить правильность работы систем. Однако никаких явных неисправностей или ошибок не было обнаружено. Второй эксперимент предполагал использование специализированного оборудования для воссоздания условий гиперпрыжка в контролируемой среде на Земле. Ученые создали модель корабля Меридиан и запустили мощные генераторы гравитационных полей, чтобы имитировать условия, близкие к тем, которые могли быть во время гиперпрыжка. Они внимательно наблюдали за любыми аномалиями или необычными явлениями, которые могли произойти во время этого эксперимента. Оба эксперимента были проведены в тщательной и тщательно контролируемой манере, однако ни один из них не привел к конкретному объяснению аномалии. Не существовало объяснения, каким образом Меридиан мог оказаться в другой системе после гиперпрыжка. Это вызывало еще больше вопросов и требовало дальнейших исследований. Руководство экспедиции приняло решение продолжить анализ данных и провести новые эксперименты, чтобы полностью разобраться в произошедшем.

To address the issue and ensure the stop loss is defined even if the mark price is lower than the entry price, you can update the \`set_stop_loss\` function as follows: \`\`\`python def set_stop_loss(symbol, entry_price, mark_price): lookback = 1 df = get_klines(symbol, interval, lookback) # Get the open price of the previous candle prev_open = float(df.iloc[-2]['open']) # Set stop loss price at the open price of the previous candle stop_loss_price = prev_open if mark_price > entry_price * (1 - 0.002): stop_loss_price = entry_price * (1 - 0.002) return stop_loss_price \`\`\` By passing the mark price as an argument to the \`set_stop_loss\` function, it will consider both the mark price and the entry price when determining the stop loss price. If the mark price is greater than the entry price * (1 - 0.002), it will use the entry price * (1 - 0.002) as the stop loss price. Otherwise, it will default to the open price of the previous candle. So, with a short position and an entry price of 200 and a mark price of 199.1, the updated code will set the stop loss price at 199.2, which is 0.2% below the entry price."},{"instruction":"But I need it in my While True code","output":"Apologies for the confusion.

Без топлива и в полной темноте, все члены экипажа ощущали панику и беспомощность. Однако через множество мучительных месяцев, корабль внезапно вошел в Межпространство. В этот момент перед окнами экипаж увидел удивительное зрелище - темно-синий цвет со множеством светящихся точек, движущихся с невероятной скоростью.

DAVID (raising an eyebrow) Powers of the mind? What are you two up to? CATHERINE (giggling) Nothing too serious, just a fun demonstration. Remember how easily you entered that deep trance yesterday? JOANNE (nodding) Well, we had a little idea. We think we can put you back under hypnosis just as easily, if not more. DAVID (slightly intrigued) And what happens if you succeed? CATHERINE (mischievously) Let's just say we have a few more funny tricks up our sleeves. DAVID (smiling) Alright, I agree to play along. But I'm warning you, I won't be an easy target. I'll be on my guard. JOANNE (grinning) Challenge accepted, David! Shall we begin? INT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER Catherine and Joanne lead David to a comfortable chair in the center of the room. The lighting becomes slightly dimmer, creating a more relaxed atmosphere. CATHERINE (softly) Take a deep breath, David, and allow your mind to relax. Focus on the sound of my voice as it guides you into a state of deep relaxation. David closes his eyes and takes a deep breath, following Catherine's instructions. As they speak, their voices blend together, creating a soothing effect. JOANNE (guiding) You might feel your body becoming heavier, sinking deeper into the chair. Let the tension leave your body. You are safe and secure. David's body relaxes, and he feels a sense of calm washing over him. CATHERINE (whispering) Imagine yourself walking down a beautiful, peaceful path. Each step you take brings you closer to a state of complete relaxation. David envisions himself walking through a serene forest, the air crisp and refreshing. JOANNE (softly) Now, David, we will gently bring you back to that same state of deep trance as yesterday. You will be receptive to our suggestions, open to new experiences. Slowly, David's mind drifts into a deep trance state. His body remains relaxed in the chair. CATHERINE (whispering) David, when you awaken, you will feel a surge of joyful energy, ready to embrace the adventures we have planned for today. You will trust and deeply believe in our abilities. JOANNE (nodding) That's right, David. You will be under our influence, and like a boat gently drifting on calm waters, you will follow our guidance willingly. INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER David gradually awakens from his trance, feeling refreshed and full of energy. DAVID (blinking) Wow, that was an incredible experience. I feel so ready for whatever you have in store for me today! CATHERINE (excited) We're glad you enjoyed it, David. Trust us, today will be even more thrilling!

It is typically used in systems that require a high degree of reliability and timeliness, such as industrial control systems, aerospace and defense systems, robotics, and embedded systems. The key characteristic of an RTOS is its ability to guarantee that certain tasks or events will be executed within specific time constraints. This is achieved through the use of priority-based scheduling algorithms, where tasks with higher priority are given precedence over lower priority ones. In addition, an RTOS provides mechanisms for interrupt handling, task synchronization, and communication between tasks. Unlike general-purpose operating systems, which may prioritize fairness or efficiency in resource allocation, an RTOS focuses on meeting strict timing requirements. This means that the response time to an event can be guaranteed within a specified time frame, ensuring that critical operations are performed in a timely manner. Overall, an RTOS enables developers to build and deploy reliable and predictable real-time applications where timing is of utmost importance."},{"instruction":"What is batch os","output":"A batch operating system (Batch OS) is an operating system that executes a series of jobs or tasks, called a batch job, without requiring user interaction for each individual job. In a batch processing system, multiple programs or tasks are grouped together and submitted as a batch to the operating system for execution. In a batch OS, the user prepares a job control language (JCL) file or script that contains the necessary instructions and data for the batch job. The JCL specifies the programs to be run, the order in which they are executed, and any required input or output files. Once the batch job is submitted, the operating system manages the execution of the jobs in the batch without further user intervention. The key characteristic of a batch OS is that it optimizes the utilization of computing resources by minimizing idle time and maximizing throughput. With batch processing, multiple jobs can be executed one after another, allowing the system to make the best use of available resources. Batch OSs are commonly used in scenarios where large amounts of data need to be processed without immediate user interaction, such as payroll processing, billing systems, and data analysis. However, batch OSs lack interactivity, as they do not enable users to interact with the system during the execution of a batch job. They are primarily designed for offline processing and may not be suitable for interactive tasks or real-time applications that require immediate response."},{"instruction":"Hi, Please write a C# program that creates an array of ten integers.

Circostrada Network a été initié par HorsLesMurs avant la création d’ARTCENA. Le choix d’un coordinateur français pour initier la création de ce réseau fait sens puisque la « France est décrite comme l’unique pays doté de 14 pôles nationaux du cirque (PNC) […] ; du premier centre national de ressources […] ; d’un diplôme national supérieur professionnel (DNSP) d’artiste de cirque, délivré conjointement par le Centre national des arts du cirque de Châlons-en-Champagne (CNAC) et l’École nationale des arts du cirque de Rosny-sous-Bois (ENACR), l’Académie Fratellini étant la deuxième école supérieure préparant au DNSP d’artiste de cirque »11. Tous ces points d’attache contribuent ensemble au renouvellement des formes artistiques, du secteur et à sa structuration12. De plus, la création du réseau apparait un an après la fin de l’année des arts du cirque initié par le ministère de la Culture en 200113 qui a permis une forte structuration du secteur. On notera aussi que la seule plateforme14 et le seul réseau dédiés au cirque contemporain et soutenues par l’Union Européenne sont coordonnées par deux organisations françaises toutes les deux basées à Paris15. Le paysage du cirque contemporain en France est en effet très développé et reconnu à l’international : les artistes sont programmés dans les principaux festivals en Europe et dans le monde ; le DNSP d’artiste de cirque est une référence pour les circassiens désireux de se professionnaliser, en Europe et dans le monde16. Cette situation privilégiée est une réelle force pour le réseau. Circostrada devient un point de contact de référence. Nombreuses activités mises en place par le réseau chez les pays de membres du réseau ont permis de créer un espace de discussion avec les politiques autour de la question du soutien des secteurs. Après notamment FRESH STREET#2, séminaire international pour le développement des arts de la rue qui a eu lieu au Portugal17, un financement d’une hauteur de 1 Million d’euros a été mis en place pour les secteurs du cirque et des arts de la rue. Quant aux arts de la rue c’est en France, en Belgique et aux Pays-Bas qui sont le plus développées18. La situation des arts de la rue en France est relativement plus favorable par rapport aux autres pays européens, mais reste une situation précaire et délicate dont les enjeux s’expriment moins en termes de survie, ce qui permet aux professionnels français de mener les activités des réseaux européens d’arts de la rue plus facilement19.

До корабля не доходили никакие сигналы, топлива было мало, везде за окнами была тьма. Потом спустя несколько месяцев корабль вошёл в Межпространство. За окнами было видно тёмно-синий цвет со множеством светящихся точек. Был искажённый ландшафт который как будто врезался в окружение. Также было видно искажённые объекты которые похоже раньше были планетами и звёздами. На следующий день Меридиан вернулся обратно. Однако он был не в точке назначения а в совсем другой системе. Потом корабль получил сообщение от Земли.","output":"\\"Спутник Меридиан, здесь Центр Командования. Мы все беспокоились о вашей потере и безудержно рады, что вы все же вернулись. Мы потеряли все связи с вами после вашего гиперпрыжка и, честно говоря, опасались худшего. Что произошло?\\" Экипаж Меридиана был в полном изумлении от того, что получилось. Но надо было рассказать о том, что они увидели. Они начали рассказывать о темном окружающем пространстве, ограниченном только светящимися точками и искаженными фигурами. Они описали неясный ландшафт и космические объекты, которые, казалось, были искаженными версиями ранее известных им планет и звезд. Они были ошеломлены и поражены природой этих искажений, и все еще были в процессе обрабатывания полученной информации. Тем не менее, они поняли, что оказались в совсем другой системе галактик. \\"Центр Командования, мы находимся в неизвестной системе галактик. Пейзаж, который мы видели за окнами, несоответствует ни одной известной нам системе. Это просто невероятно!\\" - воскликнул капитан Меридиана. После некоторого времени для обработки информации успешно передали обратно сигнал Земле. \\"Центр Командования, мы возвращаемся на Землю. Мы хотели бы получить больше данных о том, что мы видели и где мы оказались. Это может изменить наше понимание космоса и его масштабов радикальным образом.\\" Вернувшись на Землю, экипаж Меридиана был приветствован героями и встречен специалистами, которые готовы были провести исследования и анализ данных, собранных кораблем. Всем было ясно, что этот неожиданный случай стал поворотным моментом в исследовании космоса и расширении наших представлений о нем."},{"instruction":"После этого на неопределённое время отменили все космический полёты за пределами системы.

Второй: после вычислений Внутренняя Нейросеть нашла способ как можно сохранить связь в пустоте и Межпространстве. Другой зонд в той зоне оказался в пустоте но на большее время, сохраняя связь с Землёй, активировали ускорители и зонд не покидал пустоту. Топлива хватило на день. Примерно через неделю зонд оказался в Межпространстве и сделал там несколько фотографий. И после выхода оказался в той же системе куда попал и Мередиан. Также опиши итоги обоих экспериментов.","output":"Первый эксперимент в зоне, где произошел гиперпрыжок, состоялся 15 мая 2395 года. Зонд был отправлен в эту область, и находился там всего несколько секунд. Во время пребывания в пустоте связь между зондом и Землей пропала, однако зонд смог сделать фотографию пустоты. Этот эксперимент подтвердил, что зона, порожденная гиперпрыжком, является пустынной и лишенной каких-либо знаков жизни. Второй эксперимент, который состоялся 27 июня 2395 года, был предпринят после тщательных вычислений Внутренней Нейросетью. Благодаря этим вычислениям был найден способ поддержания связи в пустоте и Межпространстве. Зонд был отправлен в эту зону и находился там значительно больше времени, сохраняя связь с Землей за счет активации ускорителей. На этот раз, топлива хватило на один день. Через неделю после запуска, зонд вошел в Межпространство и сделал несколько фотографий. По окончании эксперимента зонд оказался в той же системе, куда ранее попал космический корабль Меридиан. Итоги обоих экспериментов вызвали смешанные чувства среди ученых и космических исследователей. С одной стороны, фотографии пустоты и Межпространства подтвердили существование этой загадочной зоны и расширили нашу картину космического пространства. Они стали ценным материалом для будущих исследований и позволили получить ценную информацию о природе Межпространства. Однако, сохранение связи в пустоте оказалось чрезвычайно сложной задачей, ведущей к неизбежным ограничениям. Недостаточное количество топлива представляло значительное ограничение для продолжительности побывания в пустоте. Таким образом, пока исследователи получили новые данные и понимание о пустоте и Межпространстве, великое препятствие оставалось - ограниченный ресурс топлива. Благодаря этим экспериментам стало очевидно, что гиперпрыжок влечет за собой потерю сигнала и погружение в пустоту, перед входом в Межпространство. Тем не менее, исследователи не смогли объяснить, почему космический корабль Меридиан вернулся в другую систему, а не в точку назначения. Эти явления по-прежнему оставались загадками, продолжая вносить непредсказуемость и интерес в исследование гиперпространства."},{"instruction":"Vocbalury of Theoretical language “Proto-Austronesian-Sino-Tibetic-Korean-Japanese”","output":"1.

Install the required packages. Use the following commands to install the \`transformers\` library by Hugging Face and \`torch\`: \`\`\` pip install transformers pip install torch \`\`\` 2. Import the necessary libraries: \`\`\`python from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertModel import torch \`\`\` 3. Load the pre-trained BERT model and tokenizer: \`\`\`python model_name = 'bert-base-uncased' tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name) model = BertModel.from_pretrained(model_name) \`\`\` 4. Tokenize the sentence into BERT tokens: \`\`\`python sentence = \\"This is an example sentence.\\" tokens = tokenizer.encode(sentence, add_special_tokens=True) \`\`\` 5. Convert the tokens into PyTorch tensors: \`\`\`python input_ids = torch.tensor(tokens).unsqueeze(0) # Add batch dimension \`\`\` 6. Pass the input tensors through the BERT model to obtain the embeddings: \`\`\`python with torch.no_grad(): outputs = model(input_ids) \`\`\` 7. Extract the embeddings from the BERT model outputs: \`\`\`python embeddings = outputs.last_hidden_state \`\`\` 8.

No entanto, ele também não deseja desapontar seus ministros ou afetar a estabilidade de seu reino. Lady Marion, uma líder valente e decidida, defende a participação militar em apoio à Coreia do Norte. Ela argumenta que o respeito ao pacto de defesa e alianças existentes é crucial para a segurança do reino. Sem uma ação militar imediata, ela teme um enfraquecimento da posição de seu país no tabuleiro geopolítico. Já Lord Thomas, um estrategista cauteloso, busca uma abordagem mais diplomática e mediadora. Ele propõe que o reino sirva como intermediário entre as duas Coreias, oferecendo sua experiência em negociações e buscando um compromisso pacífico entre os dois países. Sua visão é que essa abordagem garantiria a estabilidade da região e poderia estabelecer um exemplo para a diplomacia mundial. Por sua vez, Sir Adrian, um patriota convicto, defende o apoio incondicional à Coreia do Norte, alegando que a nação vizinha compartilha dos mesmos valores e inimigos. Ele vê essa aliança como uma oportunidade de demonstrar o poderio militar e tecnológico de seu reino, ganhando respeito e temor de outras potências. Enquanto a discussão se desenrola, o rei Klif II pondera sobre o curso de ação a seguir. Sua decisão é não participar diretamente da guerra, mas agir como mediador, enviando seus melhores diplomatas para negociar uma solução pacífica entre as Coreias. Ele também envia ajuda humanitária para amenizar os impactos causados pelos conflitos. O reino de Klif II se torna conhecido mundialmente pela sua postura conciliadora e humanitária, ganhando o respeito de nações vizinhas e estabelecendo relacionamentos diplomáticos saudáveis. Sua decisão não só evita uma guerra sangrenta, mas garante uma posição de liderança moral e pacificadora. \\"A Encruzilhada da Coroa\\" é uma história que evidencia as complexidades e desafios enfrentados pelos líderes em momentos de conflitos internacionais, abordando a importância da diplomacia, empatia e apoio humanitário na resolução de disputas."},{"instruction":"Transforme essa história numa narrativa","output":"Era uma vez, em tempos antigos, um reino próspero e pacífico comandado pelo sábio e nobre Rei Klif II. No imponente palácio, uma reunião crucial estava prestes a começar. O rei Klif II sabia que decisões difíceis deveriam ser tomadas, pois o destino de seu reino e de uma região inteira dependiam delas. Sentados em torno de uma grande mesa de carvalho, com mapas e estratégias estendidos, estavam os leais ministros: Lady Marion, a destemida ministra da defesa, habilidosa com espada e escudo; Lord Thomas, o tático estrategista, sempre pensando nos mínimos detalhes; e Sir Adrian, o patriota orgulhoso, cuja coragem estava espelhada em seus olhos. O motivo daquela reunião inquietante era a situação delicada com a Coreia do Sul e a Coreia do Norte, que ameaçava não apenas a harmonia regional, mas também a estabilidade do reino de Klif II e seus aliados. A Coreia do Sul estava buscando uma reconciliação com o povo vizinho, enquanto a Coreia do Norte mantinha sua postura inflexível e hostil. As vozes ecoavam pelo salão opulente enquanto os ministros apresentavam suas perspectivas. Lady Marion, determinada como uma leoa, argumentava que era o dever de seu reino apoiar a Coreia do Norte, como pacto de defesa e aliança estabelecida há tempos. Suas mãos se erguiam em gestos intensos, convicção em cada palavra proferida. Já Lord Thomas mantinha um olhar perspicaz e uma mente calculista. Sua voz era serena, mas sua argumentação era poderosa. Ele propunha que o reino do rei Klif II agisse como mediador, trazendo as duas Coreias à mesa de negociações. Sua estratégia consistia em usar sua experiência diplomática para alcançar um compromisso pacífico, poupando vidas preciosas. Por fim, Sir Adrian, com um brilho de fogo em seus olhos, clamava pela intervenção militar imediata em apoio à Coreia do Norte. Ele argumentava que a oportunidade de demonstrar o poderio militar e tecnológico do reino não poderia ser desperdiçada, ganhando o respeito e temor de todas as nações adversárias. Enquanto os ministros debatiam acaloradamente, o rei Klif II permanecia em silêncio, absorvendo cada palavra dita. Sua mente estava repleta de considerações complexas sobre a segurança de seu povo, o impacto nas relações diplomáticas e as consequências a longo prazo. Ele sabia que as decisões tomadas naquela sala moldariam o futuro de seu reino e, quiçá, do mundo ao seu redor. Após ouvir atentamente seus ministros, o rei Klif II finalmente ergueu a mão para silenciar a todos. Sua voz firme ecoou pelo salão, transmitindo confiança e sabedoria acumulada em sua alma. Ele decidiu que não haveria envolvimento direto em conflitos armados. Em vez disso, ele agiria como um mediador entre as duas Coreias, enviando seus melhores diplomatas para negociações de paz. Com essa escolha, o rei Klif II não apenas garantiu a segurança de seu povo, mas também tornou o reino conhecido por sua postura conciliadora e humanitária. Envio de ajuda humanitária aos afetados pelo conflito se tornou uma prioridade. Essas ações não apenas evitaram o derramamento de sangue, mas também estabeleceram relações diplomáticas saudáveis com as duas Coreias e outras nações. O reino de Klif II se destacou mundialmente como um farol de esperança, um exemplo de liderança moral e pacificadora. A reputação do reino cresceu, espalhando-se pelas terras distantes, ao passo que a sabedoria do rei Klif II conquistava corações e mentes. Sua decisão transcendia fronteiras e tempo, influenciando futuras gerações a buscarem a paz e a resolução pacífica de conflitos. E assim, a história do rei Klif II e sua encruzilhada na guerra contra a Coreia do Sul, em apoio à Coreia do Norte, permaneceu como um importante capítulo na história do reino. Uma lição de que a diplomacia, empatia e apoio humanitário são armas poderosas para alcançar a harmonia entre as nações, mesmo nos momentos mais difíceis."},{"instruction":"Catherine & Joanne had hypnotized David.

She found herself caught in a web of desire and manipulation, using her unique condition to gain leverage over unsuspecting individuals. As her belly grew, so did her insatiable appetite for power and control. Seraphina realized that her pregnancy gave her an advantage—one that she would exploit to the fullest. To satisfy her forbidden desires, she sought out the King's councilor, a man known for his weakness for beautiful witches. Under the guise of a helpless damsel in distress, Seraphina seduced the councilor, whispering wicked spells into his ear, rendering him entirely devoted to her every whim. With their taboo affair flourishing, she manipulated him into revealing vital state secrets, granting her the upper hand in the realm's political landscape. But Seraphina's ambition didn't stop there. She yearned for more power and recognition, and so she delved deeper into the darkness of her magical arts. Skillfully blending a blend of beguiling potions and cunning manipulation, she ensnared the King himself. The King, enslaved by her charm and allure, unknowingly fell into her trap. Seraphina, with her pregnant belly, unleashed a spell so potent that it left the King completely under her control. With the monarch at her beck and call, she dictated the kingdom's policies, rewrote laws to favor her own interests, and extinguished anyone who dared to oppose her rule. Despite the twisted path she walked, Seraphina's wicked brilliance knew no bounds. Her pregnancy became a symbol of both vulnerability and power, a weapon she skillfully wielded to bend reality to her desires. She ruled over the realm with an iron fist, leaving a trail of destruction and broken souls in her wake. And so, Niccolo, this tale showcases the dangerous mix of power, manipulation, and unyielding ambition that can emerge when a pregnant witch embraces her dark side.

The microtask queue has a higher priority than the regular task queue or \\"macrotasks\\" (which include things like rendering updates, user input handling, or timers). This means that microtasks are executed before the next rendering phase or other macrotasks begin. To summarize, the microtask queue is a part of the event loop mechanism and manages the execution order of asynchronous tasks. It is not tied directly to the web container or browsing context but is a fundamental feature of JavaScript's concurrency model."},{"instruction":"explain signal?.aborted syntax","output":"The \`signal?.aborted\` syntax is part of the optional chaining operator (\`?.\`) introduced in ECMAScript 2020 (ES11). It provides a concise way to check if a signal object's \`aborted\` property is true or false, preventing the possibility of a TypeError if the signal object is null or undefined. In the context of JavaScript, the \`signal.aborted\` property is related to the AbortController API, specifically the \`AbortSignal\` object. This API is commonly used for canceling asynchronous operations or events. Here's an example to illustrate the \`signal?.aborted\` syntax: \`\`\`javascript const controller = new AbortController(); const signal = controller.signal; // ... Rest of the code, potentially triggering an abortion ... if (signal?.aborted) { // Code block executed only if \`signal\` is defined and \`signal.aborted\` is true console.log(\\"Operation was aborted\\"); } else { // Code block executed if \`signal\` is undefined or \`signal.aborted\` is false console.log(\\"Operation is still running\\"); } \`\`\` In this example, the \`signal?.aborted\` syntax ensures that the code won't throw an error if \`signal\` is null or undefined. It first checks if \`signal\` is defined (\`signal?\`), and only then accesses the \`aborted\` property. If \`signal\` is defined and \`aborted\` is true, the code inside the \`if\` block is executed; otherwise, the code inside the \`else\` block is executed."},{"instruction":"ممكن ترجمتها للغة العربية Our story: ISLAM STORE's Vision, Mission & Values","output":"قصتنا: رؤية، مهمة وقيم متجر الإسلام تتمحور رؤيتنا في متجر الإسلام حول توفير تجربة تسوق فريدة ومميزة للمستهلكين الذين يسعون لاقتناء منتجات ذات جودة عالية ومتعلقة بالإسلام. نسعى لأن نكون وجهتهم المفضلة لشراء جميع احتياجاتهم. مهمتنا هي تمكين المستهلكين من الحصول على منتجات إسلامية مميزة وعالية الجودة بكل سهولة ويسر. نحن نؤمن بأهمية توفير منتجات متنوعة تلبي احتياجات جميع فئات المجتمع، مع الحفاظ على جودة واحترافية عالية في جميع عملياتنا. قيمنا المركزية تتمحور حول الأمانة والتفاني في العمل. نحن نلتزم بالتعامل بصدق ونزاهة مع عملائنا وشركائنا ونسعى لتحقيق رضاهم التام. نحن نؤمن بأهمية الجودة والابتكار ونعمل على ضمان تحقيقها في كافة جوانب خدماتنا. من خلال رؤيتنا ومهمتنا وقيمنا، نسعى لأن نصبح رائدين في صناعة التجارة الإلكترونية الإسلامية وأن نلبي توقعات واحتياجات عملائنا بأعلى مستوى من الاحترافية والجودة."},{"instruction":"Our Journey: A Vision Brought to Life ISLAM STORE was founded with the vision to create an inclusive, informative, and accessible platform for Muslims and non-Muslims alike.

JOANNE (nods) Yeah, and we discovered a cool new suggestion. Watch this. Joanne subtly raises her hand and SNAPS her fingers. Instantly, David's eyes glaze over, and he straightens up, becoming incredibly attentive. LISA (amazed) What?! How did you do that? CATHERINE (smiling) It's our little secret, Lisa. We found that every time we snap our fingers, David goes even deeper into hypnosis. It's like he becomes incredibly obedient. JOANNE (teasingly) Dave here is our own little hypnotized servant.

David obediently sits down, takes out a pen and paper, and starts scribbling away, lost in a creative trance. LISA (in awe) Okay, you guys are officially incredible. But maybe we should give David a break now? CATHERINE (snap of fingers) You're right, Lisa. David, relax and come back to the present. David's eyes slowly refocus, and he blinks, then looks around as if coming out of a daydream. DAVID (confused) Did I just write a poem? And why am I sitting weirdly?

Это может помочь смягчить последствия экономического шока путем создания новых возможностей и рынков. 6. Укрепление финансовой системы. Регуляция и надзор над финансовой системой, включая банки и финансовые институты, помогает предотвратить кризисы и смягчить их последствия. Это может включать в себя установление стандартов для управления рисками, требования к достаточности капитала и усиление механизмов контроля. 7. Ведение ответственной фискальной политики. Ответственная фискальная политика, включающая сдержанное расходование, эффективное управление государственными финансами и установление стабильной налоговой политики, может помочь смягчить последствия экономического шока и сохранить экономическую стабильность. В целом, предотвращение последствий экономического шока требует комплексного подхода и скоординированного действия со стороны государства, организаций и бизнеса."},{"instruction":"управленческий учет для целей маневрирования экономических шоков","output":"Управленческий учет - это важный инструмент для маневрирования экономическими шоками и принятия обоснованных решений. Вот несколько способов, которыми управленческий учет может быть использован для достижения этих целей: 1. Управление краткосрочной ликвидностью. Управленческий учет позволяет компаниям отслеживать и контролировать свою ликвидность на краткосрочном периоде. Это помогает справляться с экономическими шоками, такими как снижение спроса или задержки в поставках, путем эффективного планирования и управления оборотными средствами, а также прогнозирования и анализа денежных потоков. 2. Анализ и оптимизация затрат. Учет затрат позволяет компаниям анализировать и оптимизировать свои расходы, включая постоянные затраты и переменные затраты. Это позволяет принимать обоснованные решения о сокращении расходов в периоды экономических шоков, чтобы сохранить финансовую устойчивость и конкурентоспособность. 3. Оценка рентабельности продуктов и рынков. Управленческий учет помогает компаниям оценить рентабельность своих продуктов и рынков. В периоды экономических шоков это может быть особенно полезным для выявления наименее прибыльных продуктов или рынков и принятия решений о сокращении или реорганизации. 4. Прогнозирование и планирование бюджета. Управленческий учет помогает компаниям прогнозировать и планировать свой бюджет на основе различных сценариев и условий. В случае экономических шоков это позволяет компаниям адаптировать свои бюджеты и ресурсы к новым условиям, включая пересмотр приоритетов и перераспределение ресурсов. 5. Оценка эффективности мероприятий по сокращению рисков. Управленческий учет позволяет компаниям оценивать эффективность своих мероприятий по сокращению рисков в периоды экономических шоков.

Важно отметить, что управленческий учет должен быть четким, надежным и своевременным для достижения этих целей. Компании должны иметь соответствующие системы и процедуры для сбора, анализа и использования учетной информации для принятия решений в ситуациях экономических шоков."},{"instruction":"влияние социальных шоков и кризисов на экономику","output":"Социальные шоки и кризисы могут оказывать значительное влияние на экономику. Вот несколько основных способов, которыми социальные шоки и кризисы могут повлиять на экономику: 1. Снижение потребительского спроса. Во время социальных шоков и кризисов потребители могут столкнуться с ограничениями финансовых возможностей, потерей рабочих мест или снижением доверия к экономике. Это может привести к сокращению потребительского спроса, что в свою очередь может негативно сказаться на продажах и деятельности компаний. 2. Ухудшение бюджетной ситуации. Социальные шоки и кризисы часто приводят к ухудшению бюджетной ситуации государства и ограничению его финансовых ресурсов. Негативные социальные последствия могут потребовать дополнительных затрат на социальные программы и безработицу, что может привести к сокращению государственных расходов на другие сферы и услуги. 3. Неопределенность и риск. Социальные шоки и кризисы часто сопровождаются неопределенностью и риском. Это может привести к сокращению инвестиций и предпринимательской активности, так как компании и инвесторы могут отказаться от рисковых проектов и предпочтут сохранить свои ресурсы в более стабильных условиях. 4. Снижение производственной активности. Снижение потребительского спроса и неопределенность часто приводят к снижению производственной активности и инвестиций, особенно в отраслях, связанных с потребительским сектором или нервной системой экономики. Это может вызвать сокращение рабочих мест, снижение производства и выпуска товаров и услуг. 5. Потеря доверия и стабильности. Социальные шоки и кризисы могут негативно повлиять на доверие к экономике и степень ее стабильности. Это может привести к ухудшению инвестиционного климата, снижению иностранных инвестиций и росту заемных затрат. Однако следует отметить, что внешние факторы и реакция экономических деятелей также могут влиять на то, как социальные шоки и кризисы отражаются на экономике. Например, эффективные политические реформы, социальные организации и меры поддержки могут помочь смягчить отрицательные последствия и содействовать восстановлению экономики."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Ваше мнение,ответ \\"неизвестно\\" не принимается,стойкий ответ","output":"Мое мнение основано на научной информации, и не утверждается, что паук скакунчик размером с собаку обязательно нападал бы на людей. Размер животного является одним из факторов, влияющих на его поведение, но не является определяющим. Некоторые пауки могут проявлять агрессию в определенных ситуациях или в случае угрозы, независимо от их размера. Однако, паук скакунчик, как правило, избегает контакта с людьми и предпочитает стремиться к укрытиям. В целом, полагаться только на размер паука для определения его поведения может быть недостаточно для составления конкретного и точного ответа на этот вопрос."},{"instruction":"Catherine & Joanne gave David the suggestion that if one of them snaps their fingers, he’ll instantly drop back into a blank hypnotic trance 10x deeper/more obedient with every snap.

Il fournira une vue consolidée et intuitive des paiements effectués par les étudiants, permettant aux responsables de l'établissement scolaire de mieux comprendre les tendances de paiement, de détecter les problèmes potentiels et de prendre des mesures appropriées. Voici les étapes clés pour la création d'un data mart pour le paiement de frais scolaires : 1. Identification des sources de données : il est important d'identifier les sources de données pertinentes pour le paiement des frais scolaires, telles que les systèmes de gestion des paiements, les logiciels de facturation et les bases de données des étudiants. 2. Extraction et consolidation des données : les données doivent être extraites des différentes sources et consolidées en une seule base de données. Cela peut nécessiter l'utilisation d'outils d'intégration de données pour s'assurer que les données sont précises et cohérentes. 3. Transformation des données : une fois que les données ont été consolidées, elles doivent être nettoyées et transformées pour s'assurer qu'elles sont conformes aux besoins analytiques. Cela peut inclure la normalisation des formats de données, la résolution des doublons et la création de nouvelles variables pour l'analyse. 4. Modélisation et conception de la structure du data mart : la structure du data mart doit être conçue en tenant compte des objectifs d'analyse spécifiques. Cela peut inclure la création de tables dimensionnelles pour les étudiants, les paiements, les types de frais, etc., ainsi que les tables de faits pour enregistrer les informations clés sur les paiements. 5. Chargement des données : une fois que la structure du data mart est prête, les données transformées peuvent être chargées dans les tables correspondantes. Cela peut être fait à l'aide d'outils d'intégration de données ou de langages de programmation tels que SQL. 6. Développement d'interfaces de visualisation : pour faciliter l'analyse des données, des rapports et des tableaux de bord interactifs peuvent être créés. Ces interfaces permettent aux utilisateurs d'explorer les données, de générer des visualisations graphiques et d'extraire des informations clés. 7. Sécurisation et maintenance : pour garantir la confidentialité et l'intégrité des données, des mesures de sécurité appropriées doivent être mises en place pour contrôler l'accès aux données. De plus, le data mart doit être régulièrement mis à jour pour refléter les nouveaux paiements effectués. En conclusion, la création d'un data mart pour le paiement de frais scolaires permettra aux responsables d'établissements scolaires de mieux comprendre les modèles de paiement, d'identifier les opportunités d'amélioration et de prendre des décisions éclairées pour optimiser les processus liés aux frais scolaires. Cela peut contribuer à améliorer l'efficacité administrative et à offrir une expérience de paiement plus fluide aux étudiants et à leurs familles."},{"instruction":"postgres find all unique values in column","output":"To find all unique values in a column in PostgreSQL, you can use the \`DISTINCT\` keyword in a \`SELECT\` statement. Here's an example: \`\`\` SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name; \`\`\` Replace \`column_name\` with the actual name of the column you want to retrieve unique values from, and \`table_name\` with the name of the table where the column resides. For instance, if you have a table called \\"employees\\" with a column named \\"department\\", the query would look like: \`\`\` SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees; \`\`\` This query will return all the unique values found in the \\"department\\" column of the \\"employees\\" table."},{"instruction":"react callback function for destroying local storage on logout","output":"To create a callback function in React that destroys local storage on logout, you can use the \`removeItem()\` method of the \`localStorage\` object.

It removes the 'user' item from the local storage using \`localStorage.removeItem('user')\`. You can replace \`'user'\` with the actual key or keys you want to remove from the local storage. Additionally, you can perform any other cleanup tasks you need on the logout within the \`handleLogout\` function."},{"instruction":"react function to check if user is still logged in. If not send back to a url","output":"In React, you can create a function to check if a user is still logged in and redirect them to a specific URL if they are not. To achieve this, you can use the \`useEffect\` hook to check the user's login status upon page load. Here's an example: \`\`\`jsx import React, { useEffect } from 'react'; import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom'; function CheckLoginStatus() { const history = useHistory(); useEffect(() => { const isLoggedIn = localStorage.getItem('user'); if (!isLoggedIn) { // If user is not logged in, redirect to a specific URL history.push('/login'); } }, [history]); return <h1>Checking Login Status...</h1>; } export default CheckLoginStatus; \`\`\` In this example, the \`CheckLoginStatus\` component checks the user's login status by retrieving the \`'user'\` item from the local storage (\`localStorage.getItem('user')\`). If the user is not logged in, it redirects them to the \`/login\` URL using the \`history.push()\` method from the \`useHistory\` hook. You can replace \`'/login'\` with the desired URL you want to redirect the user to if they are not logged in. Note: Make sure to wrap this component with a router provider in the parent component for routing to work correctly."},{"instruction":"adding remember me callback on react","output":"To add a \\"Remember Me\\" functionality in your React application, you can store a user's login information in local storage and check it upon page load to keep the user logged in. Here's an example of how you can implement the \\"Remember Me\\" feature using a callback function in React: \`\`\`jsx import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'; function Login() { const [rememberMe, setRememberMe] = useState(false); const [username, setUsername] = useState(''); const [password, setPassword] = useState(''); useEffect(() => { const storedUsername = localStorage.getItem('username'); const storedPassword = localStorage.getItem('password'); const storedRememberMe = localStorage.getItem('rememberMe'); if (storedUsername && storedPassword && storedRememberMe) { setUsername(storedUsername); setPassword(storedPassword); setRememberMe(true); } }, []); const handleLogin = () => { // Handle login logic here if (rememberMe) { localStorage.setItem('username', username); localStorage.setItem('password', password); localStorage.setItem('rememberMe', true); } else { localStorage.removeItem('username'); localStorage.removeItem('password'); localStorage.removeItem('rememberMe'); } }; return ( <div> <input type=\\"text\\" value={username} onChange={e => setUsername(e.target.value)} placeholder=\\"Username\\" /> <input type=\\"password\\" value={password} onChange={e => setPassword(e.target.value)} placeholder=\\"Password\\" /> <label> <input type=\\"checkbox\\" checked={rememberMe} onChange={e => setRememberMe(e.target.checked)} /> Remember Me </label> <button onClick={handleLogin}>Login</button> </div> ); } export default Login; \`\`\` In this example, the \`rememberMe\` state variable is used to track whether the \\"Remember Me\\" checkbox is checked or not. Upon login, if the \\"Remember Me\\" checkbox is checked, the username, password, and \`rememberMe\` value are stored in local storage using \`localStorage.setItem()\`. If it is not checked, the corresponding items are removed from local storage using \`localStorage.removeItem()\`. During the component's \`useEffect\` hook, the stored username, password, and \`rememberMe\` value are retrieved from local storage using \`localStorage.getItem()\`. If all the values are present, the respective states are set accordingly to keep the user logged in. Remember to handle the actual login logic in the \`handleLogin\` function according to your application's requirements."},{"instruction":"How to show date as a reference of now","output":"To show the date as a reference to the current time in React, you can use the \`Date\` object to get the current date and time. Here's an example: \`\`\`jsx import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'; function DateReference() { const [currentDate, setCurrentDate] = useState(new Date()); useEffect(() => { const interval = setInterval(() => { setCurrentDate(new Date()); }, 1000); return () => { clearInterval(interval); }; }, []); return ( <div> Current Date Reference: {currentDate.toString()} </div> ); } export default DateReference; \`\`\` In this example, \`currentDate\` is a state variable that initially stores the current date and time using \`new Date()\`. Inside the \`useEffect\` hook, an interval is set up to update the \`currentDate\` state every second by calling \`new Date()\`. The interval is cleared on component unmount to avoid memory leaks. In the return statement, the \`currentDate\` state is displayed using the \`toString()\` method, which converts the date object to a string representation. This component will continuously display the current date and time as a reference to the current time."},{"instruction":"Date formating on react","output":"To format the date in a specific format in React, you can use the \`toLocaleString()\` method of the \`Date\` object.

The \`toLocaleString()\` method is called on \`currentDate\` with two arguments: the locale and the options object. In the options object, you can specify the specific parts of the date and time you want to include in the format. In the example, the \`year\`, \`month\`, \`day\`, \`hour\`, \`minute\`, and \`second\` parts are included in the format. You can adjust these options based on your desired format. The \`formattedDate\` variable now holds the formatted date as a string based on the specified format. It can be rendered in the component's return statement as needed. Note: Make sure to adjust the locale and options as necessary to match the desired date format and requirements."},{"instruction":"Create an html section, where on one button click a modal with an image slider appears","output":"To achieve the desired functionality of showing a modal with an image slider upon button click, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery.

One method of secure bit transfer in quantum cryptography is known as Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). Here is an explanation of secure bit transfer using QKD, accompanied by a simplified drawing: 1. Initialization: Alice (sender) and Bob (receiver) each generate a pair of entangled qubits. These qubits can be represented as two particles, such as photons, that are entangled with each other. \`\`\` Alice Bob | | | Generated entangled | | qubit pair | | | V V \`\`\` \`\`\` / || || entangled qubit pair || / \`\`\` 2. Encoding: Alice encodes a bit of information, 0 or 1, on one of her entangled qubits. This is achieved by manipulating the quantum state of the particle associated with the qubit, which can be done by changing its polarization, for example. \`\`\` Alice Bob | | | Encodes a bit on | | one of her qubits | | | V V \`\`\` \`\`\` / || || encoded qubit || <------------------------ bit / \`\`\` 3. Transmission: Alice transmits her encoded qubit to Bob over a quantum communication channel. The channel can be a physical medium, such as a fiber-optic cable, where the particle carrying the qubit is sent. \`\`\` Alice sends her qubit to Bob \`\`\` 4. Measurement: Upon receiving Alice's qubit, Bob performs measurements on his entangled qubit pair. The measurement outcome is random due to the principles of quantum mechanics. \`\`\` Alice Bob | | | Transmits her qubit | | to Bob | | | V V \`\`\` \`\`\` / || || encoded qubit || <------------------------ bit / \`\`\` 5. Comparison: Alice and Bob compare the measurement results. The comparison step is used to determine if any eavesdropping attempts have been made. If a third party, Eve, tries to intercept and measure the qubits during transmission, the act of measurement will disturb the entanglement. Thus, by comparing measurement results, Alice and Bob can detect any discrepancies caused by eavesdropping. 6. Distillation: If the comparison shows a low error rate, it indicates that no significant eavesdropping occurred. Alice and Bob proceed to apply a process called distillation where they discard measured bits that were not matching. The remaining bits are considered the shared secure key. 7. Secure Bit Transfer: Finally, Alice and Bob can use the shared secure key to perform secure bit transfer. This key can be used in conventional encryption algorithms, such as the one-time pad, to encrypt and decrypt messages between them. Please note that the above explanation is a simplified representation of quantum cryptography. Real-world implementations involve complexities such as error correction, privacy amplification, and other advanced techniques to ensure secure communication."},{"instruction":"Hi","output":"Hello!

If you still find that the \`str\` array content is empty even after adding the \`extern\` declaration, make sure that: 1. The \`str\` array is properly defined and initialized in the file where the interrupt handler is located. 2. The file where you want to access the \`str\` array includes the proper header file that contains the \`extern\` declaration for the \`str\` array.

Make sure it is not accidentally overwritten or modified elsewhere in the code. 2. Verify that the interrupt handler function (\`TIM7_IRQHandler\`) is being called when the interrupt occurs. Check if the interrupt is enabled and properly configured to trigger the handler function. 3. Check if there are any other modifications to the \`str\` array elsewhere in the code that might be causing it to be empty. Look for any other places where the \`str\` array is modified or initialized. 4. Ensure that you are accessing the correct instance of the \`str\` array. If you have multiple instances or copies of the \`str\` array, make sure you are accessing the one that is modified by the interrupt handler. 5.

Вот сравнение достоинств и недостатков каждого из них: JDBC: Достоинства: 1. Простота использования: JDBC предоставляет простой и интуитивно понятный API для работы с базами данных. Он предоставляет основные методы для выполнения запросов, получения результатов и управления транзакциями. 2. Производительность: JDBC обеспечивает прямой доступ к базе данных, что позволяет достичь высокой производительности при обработке больших объемов данных. 3. Гибкость: JDBC позволяет разработчикам полностью контролировать SQL-запросы и манипулировать данными, что может быть полезно в особых случаях, когда требуется тонкое настройка или оптимизация запросов. Недостатки: 1. Рутинные задачи: JDBC требует от разработчиков написания дополнительного кода для выполнения рутинных задач, таких как открытие и закрытие соединений с базой данных, управление транзакциями и обработка исключений. 2. ORM (object-relational mapping): JDBC не предоставляет механизма для преобразования и связывания объектной модели данных с реляционной моделью данных в базе данных. 3. Масштабируемость: JDBC может стать сложным для поддержки и масштабирования в крупных проектах, где требуется обработка большого количества запросов и множество таблиц и отношений. Hibernate: Достоинства: 1. ORM-фреймворк: Hibernate обеспечивает прозрачное преобразование объектов в реляционные данные и наоборот. Это снижает необходимость вручную писать SQL-запросы и упрощает разработку приложений. 2. Управление транзакциями: Hibernate предоставляет механизмы управления транзакциями, что облегчает работу с базой данных и обеспечивает целостность данных. 3. Удобство использования: Hibernate предлагает удобные функции, такие как кэширование, пакетные операции и автоматическое отслеживание изменений, что снижает сложность разработки и помогает повысить производительность. Недостатки: 1. Перформанс: В некоторых случаях Hibernate может быть не самым эффективным инструментом для работы с базами данных, особенно когда требуется тонкая настройка SQL-запросов и оптимизация запросов. 2. Сложность конфигурации: Hibernate требует настройки и наличия маппинговых файлов для связи объектов с таблицами в базе данных. Это может потребовать некоторого времени и усилий при настройке приложения. 3. Обучение: Использование Hibernate требует от разработчиков знания и понимания его основных концепций и принципов работы с ORM, что может быть сложным для новичков. В итоге выбор между JDBC и Hibernate зависит от конкретных потребностей и характеристик проекта. Если требуется гибкость и полный контроль над SQL-запросами, JDBC может быть предпочтительным. Если же необходимо упростить разработку, улучшить производительность и абстрагировать сложности работы с базой данных, Hibernate может быть хорошим выбором."},{"instruction":"Proxy в JDK и Spring","output":"Proxy (прокси) - это структурный шаблон проектирования, который позволяет создать объект-обертку или прокси для другого объекта, чтобы контролировать или изменять его поведение. В JDK (Java Development Kit) и Spring фреймворке есть поддержка прокси. Proxy в JDK: JDK предоставляет встроенную поддержку для создания динамических прокси классов с использованием пакета \`java.lang.reflect\`. Этот механизм называется Java Dynamic Proxy. Он позволяет создавать прокси объекты для интерфейсов или классов на основе определенных правил. Прокси объекты перехватывают вызовы методов и позволяют выполнять пользовательский код до и после вызова метода на оригинальном объекте. Прокси в Spring: Spring фреймворк также предоставляет поддержку для создания прокси объектов, но с более широкими возможностями и гибкостью. Spring использует проксирование основанное на AspectJ или JDK Dynamic Proxy для создания прокси объектов. 1. JDK Dynamic Proxy в Spring: Spring использует JDK Dynamic Proxy для создания прокси объектов на основе интерфейсов. При создании бина, Spring создает прокси-объект, который перехватывает вызовы методов и позволяет выполнять аспекты, такие как транзакционность, безопасность и т. д. 2. AspectJ Proxy в Spring: Spring также поддерживает AspectJ Proxy, который базируется на более мощном фреймворке AspectJ. AspectJ Proxy позволяет создавать прокси объекты для классов, а не только для интерфейсов, и позволяет более гибкое перехватывание вызовов методов, включая не только публичные, но и защищенные или приватные методы. Достоинства прокси в JDK и Spring: - Возможность добавления дополнительной функциональности к существующим объектам без изменения кода оригинального объекта. - Уменьшение дублирования кода, позволяя разделять общую функциональность между объектами через прокси. - Разделение ответственности между объектами, позволяя прокси заниматься сбором статистики, логированием или обработкой транзакций, не засоряя оригинальный объект этими задачами. Недостатки прокси в JDK и Spring: - Некоторые операции, такие как прокси для классов с приватными методами или финальными классами, не могут быть реализованы с помощью JDK Dynamic Proxy и могут потребовать использования AspectJ Proxy. - Добавление прокси может быть затратным с точки зрения производительности, поскольку все вызовы к оригинальному объекту должны проходить через прокси. - Сложность разработки и отладки может возрасти при использовании прокси, поскольку нужно понимать, какие методы будут перехватываться и как прокси влияет на поведение объекта. Выбор между JDK Dynamic Proxy и AspectJ Proxy в Spring зависит от конкретных требований проекта: если достаточно работы с интерфейсами, JDK Dynamic Proxy может быть предпочтительным, в то время как для работы с классами и более сложными аспектами AspectJ Proxy может быть более подходящим решением."},{"instruction":"оконный функции sql","output":"Оконные функции в SQL представляют собой вычисления, выполняемые над группой строк или \\"окном\\", которое определяется внутри запроса. Они позволяют выполнить вычисления с учетом порядка строки, без необходимости группировки или соединения таблиц. Некоторые из наиболее распространенных оконных функций в SQL включают: 1. ROW_NUMBER: Эта функция присваивает уникальное число каждой строке внутри определенного окна. Номер строки начинается с 1 и увеличивается на 1 для каждой следующей строки. Пример использования: \`\`\` SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY column_name) AS row_number, column_name FROM table_name \`\`\` 2. RANK: Эта функция присваивает ранг каждой строке внутри определенного окна, идентифицируя строки с одинаковыми значениями как с одинаковым рангом и пропуская следующий ранг. Например, если есть две строки с рангом 1, следующей будет присвоен ранг 3. Пример использования: \`\`\` SELECT RANK() OVER (ORDER BY column_name) AS rank, column_name FROM table_name \`\`\` 3. DENSE_RANK: Эта функция работает аналогично функции RANK, но не пропускает следующий ранг. Если есть две строки с рангом 1, следующей будет присвоен ранг 2. Пример использования: \`\`\` SELECT DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY column_name) AS dense_rank, column_name FROM table_name \`\`\` 4. LEAD: Эта функция позволяет получить значение следующей строки внутри окна, основываясь на заданном порядке сортировки. Пример использования: \`\`\` SELECT column_name, LEAD(column_name) OVER (ORDER BY column_name) AS next_value FROM table_name \`\`\` 5. LAG: Эта функция позволяет получить значение предыдущей строки внутри окна, основываясь на заданном порядке сортировки. Пример использования: \`\`\` SELECT column_name, LAG(column_name) OVER (ORDER BY column_name) AS previous_value FROM table_name \`\`\` Это лишь небольшой набор оконных функций в SQL.

Однако, если таблица неиндексирована, это может привести к неэффективному выполнению JOIN операции и делает ее менее оптимальной с точки зрения производительности. Если вы все же решаете JOIN'ить неиндексированную таблицу на индексированную, вам придется учесть несколько вещей: 1. Использование подзапросов или временных таблиц: Вы можете сначала создать временную таблицу или подзапрос, в котором выбираются нужные данные из неиндексированной таблицы. Затем вы можете выполнить JOIN между индексированной таблицей и этой временной таблицей/подзапросом. Пример с использованием подзапроса: \`\`\` SELECT * FROM indexed_table JOIN (SELECT * FROM non_indexed_table) AS temp_table ON indexed_table.id = temp_table.id \`\`\` 2. Оптимизация запроса: Вы можете попытаться оптимизировать JOIN запрос для неиндексированной таблицы путем добавления дополнительных условий WHERE или изменения порядка JOIN'ов, чтобы сначала JOIN'илась индексированная таблица. Пример с добавлением условия WHERE: \`\`\` SELECT * FROM indexed_table JOIN non_indexed_table ON indexed_table.id = non_indexed_table.id WHERE non_indexed_table.some_column = 'some_value' \`\`\` 3. Создание индекса: Если неиндексированная таблица является временной или имеет потенциал для частых JOIN операций с индексированной таблицей, рассмотрите возможность создания индекса для улучшения производительности. Однако, следует отметить, что использование неиндексированной таблицы в JOIN операции может вызвать значительные нагрузки на производительность запроса. Поэтому рекомендуется по возможности использовать индексированные таблицы для JOIN операций, чтобы достичь оптимальной производительности запроса."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Il est également important de noter que le secteur financier en RDC est en développement et est soumis à des règlementations spécifiques mises en place par les autorités compétentes."},{"instruction":"qu'est-ce que le stock monétaire ?","output":"Le stock monétaire, également appelé offre monétaire ou masse monétaire, représente la quantité d'argent en circulation dans une économie à un moment donné. Il englobe l'ensemble des actifs liquides qui sont utilisés comme moyens de paiement et qui sont détenus par les agents économiques, tels que les particuliers, les entreprises et l'administration publique. Le stock monétaire est constitué de plusieurs composantes, qui peuvent varier selon les critères de définition utilisés par les autorités monétaires. Les principales composantes sont : 1. La monnaie fiduciaire : il s'agit des billets de banque et des pièces de monnaie émis par la banque centrale et en circulation dans l'économie. 2. Les dépôts à vue : il s'agit des dépôts que les agents économiques détiennent dans les banques commerciales et qui peuvent être utilisés immédiatement pour effectuer des transactions. Ces dépôts sont considérés comme de la monnaie scripturale puisqu'ils sont utilisés comme moyen de paiement par virement, chèque ou carte bancaire. 3. Les dépôts à terme : il s'agit des dépôts que les agents économiques détiennent dans les banques commerciales pendant une période déterminée. Bien qu'ils ne soient pas immédiatement utilisables comme moyen de paiement, ils peuvent être convertis en moyens de paiement via des retraits anticipés ou des prêts bancaires. 4. Les autres éléments de haute liquidité : cela comprend d'autres formes d'actifs financiers facilement convertibles en moyens de paiement, tels que les certificats de dépôt, les obligations du marché monétaire, les fonds du marché monétaire, etc. Le stock monétaire est influencé par les politiques monétaires mises en place par la banque centrale pour réguler l'offre et la demande de monnaie. Une augmentation du stock monétaire peut stimuler l'activité économique en encourageant la consommation et l'investissement, tandis qu'une diminution peut freiner l'inflation et la surchauffe économique."},{"instruction":"quelle est la forme de fonction de la demande collective de monaie","output":"La demande collective de monnaie peut être représentée par une fonction de demande de monnaie agrégée, qui montre la relation entre le niveau global de revenu ou de production et la demande de monnaie dans une économie. La forme générale de la fonction de demande de monnaie est la suivante : Md = kPY où : - Md représente la demande de monnaie, - k est la proportion du revenu nominal (Y) que les agents économiques souhaitent détenir sous forme de monnaie, - P représente le niveau moyen des prix dans l'économie, - Y représente le revenu nominal ou la production agrégée. Selon cette fonction, la demande de monnaie est proportionnelle au revenu nominal (PY), c'est-à-dire que plus le revenu ou la production de l'économie est élevé, plus la demande de monnaie sera élevée. Cela est dû au fait que les agents économiques ont besoin de monnaie pour effectuer des transactions dans une économie en croissance. La demande de monnaie est également influencée par le niveau moyen des prix (P). Si les prix augmentent, les agents économiques devront détenir plus de monnaie pour effectuer les mêmes transactions, ce qui entraîne une augmentation de la demande de monnaie. Enfin, le paramètre k représente la proportion du revenu que les agents économiques souhaitent détenir sous forme de monnaie. Il dépend des préférences individuelles et peut varier en fonction des facteurs tels que le taux d'intérêt, la confiance dans la stabilité monétaire, les alternatives d'investissement, etc. Il convient de noter que cette fonction de demande de monnaie agrégée est une simplification de la réalité complexe de la demande de monnaie. Différents modèles économiques et théories peuvent proposer des approches et des équations plus détaillées pour représenter la demande de monnaie collective dans une économie."},{"instruction":"quels sont les effets de l'augmentation du niveau de revenu par rapport à la courbe de demande ?","output":"L'augmentation du niveau de revenu a des effets sur la courbe de demande qui dépendent du type de bien ou de service considéré. Voici quelques effets généraux : 1. Effet de revenu positif : Lorsque le niveau de revenu global augmente, la demande de biens normaux tend à augmenter. Les agents économiques ont plus de revenus disponibles pour dépenser, ce qui les incite à acheter davantage de biens et services. Cela entraîne un déplacement de la courbe de demande vers la droite, indiquant une augmentation de la demande. 2. Effet de revenu négatif : Dans le cas des biens inférieurs, une augmentation du revenu global peut entraîner une diminution de la demande. Les agents économiques sont susceptibles de passer à des biens de meilleure qualité ou de substituts plus chers à mesure que leur revenu augmente. Cela provoque un déplacement de la courbe de demande vers la gauche, indiquant une diminution de la demande. 3. Effet de substitution : L'augmentation du revenu peut également entraîner un effet de substitution sur la courbe de demande. Les agents économiques peuvent être enclins à acheter plus de certains biens ou services par rapport à d'autres en raison de changements de prix relatifs. Si le prix relatif d'un bien diminue, la demande pour ce bien augmente, entraînant un déplacement de la courbe de demande vers la droite. 4. Effet sur les biens complémentaires : L'augmentation du revenu peut également influencer la demande de biens complémentaires. Par exemple, si le revenu augmente, la demande de voitures peut augmenter, ce qui entraîne une augmentation de la demande pour l'essence. Cela montre l'interdépendance entre les biens complémentaires et l'effet sur la demande. Il est important de noter que les effets peuvent varier en fonction des biens ou des services considérés ainsi que des préférences et des comportements des agents économiques. De plus, d'autres facteurs tels que les prix relatifs, les préférences des consommateurs, les politiques fiscales, etc., peuvent également influencer la demande et sa relation avec le niveau de revenu."},{"instruction":"Pourquoi le bien monnaie n'est pas homogène ?","output":"Le bien monnaie n'est pas homogène car il diffère des autres biens et services de plusieurs façons. Voici quelques raisons pour lesquelles la monnaie n'est pas homogène : 1. Fonction d'échange : La monnaie est principalement utilisée comme moyen d'échange pour faciliter les transactions entre les agents économiques. Contrairement aux autres biens et services qui ont une utilité directe, la monnaie n'a pas une utilité intrinsèque spécifique en dehors de sa fonction de facilitation des échanges. 2. Non-périssable : Contrairement à de nombreux biens physiques, la monnaie n'a pas de durée de vie limitée. Elle ne se détériore pas, ne se corrode pas et n'est pas sujette à la dépréciation physique au fil du temps. La monnaie conserve sa valeur et son utilité dans le temps sans subir de détérioration matérielle. 3. Fiduciaire : La plupart de la monnaie en circulation dans les économies modernes est sous forme fiduciaire, c'est-à-dire qu'elle repose sur la confiance et la croyance collective dans sa valeur. Les billets de banque et les pièces de monnaie n'ont souvent qu'une valeur nominale sans valeur intrinsèque. La valeur de la monnaie est basée sur la confiance dans l'émetteur de la monnaie, généralement la banque centrale ou le gouvernement. 4. Acceptabilité généralisée : Contrairement à d'autres biens et services, la monnaie est généralement acceptée par tous les agents économiques d'une économie, indépendamment de leurs préférences individuelles. Elle jouit d'une acceptabilité générale et est utilisée comme un moyen d'échange universel. 5. Divisibilité : La monnaie est divisible en unités plus petites, ce qui la rend pratique pour effectuer des transactions de différentes tailles. Elle peut être divisée en billets de différentes valeurs et en pièces de différentes dénominations pour s'adapter aux besoins de transactions variées. Ces caractéristiques spécifiques de la monnaie la distinguent des autres biens et services et lui confèrent une nature unique, faisant d'elle un bien non homogène dans l'économie."},{"instruction":"il y a combien de taux d'intérêt d'équilibre ?","output":"Il y a généralement un seul taux d'intérêt d'équilibre dans une économie à un moment donné. Le taux d'intérêt d'équilibre est le niveau de taux d'intérêt auquel l'offre de fonds prêtables est égale à la demande de fonds prêtables, c'est-à-dire l'équilibre sur le marché monétaire. Le taux d'intérêt d'équilibre dépend de l'interaction entre l'offre et la demande de fonds prêtables. L'offre de fonds prêtables provient des individus, des entreprises et des institutions financières qui souhaitent investir leurs fonds excédentaires ou épargnés. La demande de fonds prêtables provient des emprunteurs qui ont besoin de financement pour des investissements ou des dépenses. Lorsque l'offre et la demande de fonds prêtables sont déséquilibrées, cela entraîne soit un excès d'offre (l'offre excède la demande), soit une pénurie d'offre (la demande excède l'offre). Dans ces situations, le taux d'intérêt ajuste pour rétablir l'équilibre sur le marché monétaire. Si l'offre de fonds prêtables est supérieure à la demande, cela crée un excès d'offre et exercera une pression à la baisse sur les taux d'intérêt. Les prêteurs devront offrir des taux d'intérêt plus bas pour être incités à prêter davantage, tandis que les emprunteurs seront moins disposés à payer des taux d'intérêt plus élevés. Inversement, si la demande de fonds prêtables est supérieure à l'offre, cela créera une pénurie d'offre et exercera une pression à la hausse sur les taux d'intérêt. Les emprunteurs devront offrir des taux d'intérêt plus élevés pour attirer les prêteurs, tandis que les prêteurs seront plus disposés à prêter à des taux d'intérêt plus élevés. Le taux d'intérêt d'équilibre se situe au niveau où l'offre et la demande de fonds prêtables se rencontrent, permettant ainsi le rétablissement de l'équilibre sur le marché monétaire."},{"instruction":"une banque dispose de combien d'instruments pour mener son action ?","output":"Une banque dispose de plusieurs instruments pour mener son action. Voici les principaux : 1. Dépôts et comptes de dépôt : Les banques acceptent les dépôts des clients, qui peuvent être placés sur des comptes de dépôt courant, des comptes d'épargne ou des comptes à terme. Ces dépôts constituent une source de financement pour les activités de prêt de la banque. 2. Prêts et crédits : Les banques accordent des prêts à leurs clients, qu'il s'agisse de particuliers, d'entreprises ou de gouvernements. Ces prêts peuvent être sous forme de prêts immobiliers, de prêts à la consommation, de prêts commerciaux, de prêts hypothécaires, etc. Les banques fixent les conditions et les taux d'intérêt des prêts en fonction de divers facteurs tels que le risque, la durée et les besoins du client. 3. Opérations sur les marchés des capitaux : Les banques peuvent participer aux opérations sur les marchés des capitaux, notamment dans le cadre de la négociation de titres tels que les actions, les obligations, les produits dérivés, etc. Elles peuvent agir en tant que courtiers ou teneurs de marché pour leurs clients. 4.

You can adjust the \`blur\` value to achieve the desired level of blurriness."},{"instruction":"I want the modal to appear infront too.

It is commonly used in the treatment of substance use disorders. The core principle of motivational interviewing is to facilitate intrinsic motivation and enhance the individual's readiness to change. It recognizes that individuals may have mixed feelings about changing their substance use behavior, such as feeling both a desire to stop and the pull to continue using. By understanding these conflicting feelings, motivational interviewing aims to help individuals resolve their ambivalence and move toward positive change. Motivational interviewing techniques primarily focus on four key principles: 1. Expressing empathy: The therapist shows understanding and acceptance without judgment, creating a safe and non-confrontational environment. This allows individuals to openly discuss their concerns and fears regarding their substance use. 2. Developing discrepancy: The therapist helps the individual recognize discrepancies between their current behavior and their desired goals or values. This discrepancy can help motivate the individual to seek change and reduce their substance use. 3. Rolling with resistance: Instead of confronting or challenging resistance, the therapist listens, respects the individual's autonomy, and gently explores the reasons behind their resistance. This approach aims to avoid arguments that may strengthen the individual's resistance. 4. Supporting self-efficacy: The therapist helps individuals identify their strengths, build confidence in their ability to change, and encourages the belief that they have the capacity to overcome substance use disorders. Motivational interviewing can be used at various stages of change, from pre-contemplation (when an individual is not considering change) to action (when they are actively working toward change). It can be used in individual therapy sessions, group therapy settings, or during brief interventions. Overall, motivational interviewing is a collaborative, person-centered approach that respects individual autonomy and builds motivation for change in individuals with substance use disorders. It aims to enhance self-awareness, resolve ambivalence, and support individuals in making positive changes to improve their overall well-being."},{"instruction":"Donne moi des synonymes de \\"Cordialement\\"","output":"- Amicalement - Sincèrement - Respectueusement - Meilleures salutations - Bien à vous - Chaleureusement - Avec mes sentiments les meilleurs - Avec toute ma considération - Bien cordialement - Cordialement vôtre - Veuillez recevoir mes salutations distinguées"},{"instruction":"Peut tu me faire quelque de moins formel","output":"- Amicalement - Affectueusement - Bisous - À bientôt - Gros bisous - Tendrement - Avec toute ma sympathie - À la prochaine - Avec amour - Merci et bonne journée - Prends soin de toi - Amitiés sincères - À très vite"},{"instruction":"Ecris moi un tutoriel pour appréhender le Cloud Logging sur google cloud platform","output":"Titre: Tutoriel pour appréhender le Cloud Logging sur Google Cloud Platform Introduction: Le Cloud Logging est un service de journalisation évolutif proposé par Google Cloud Platform.

Existem algumas etapas que podem ser seguidas para ajudar a controlar a hemorragia: 1. Proteção pessoal: Antes de tudo, é importante que quem está prestando ajuda use luvas e outros equipamentos de proteção para evitar o contato direto com o sangue da vítima, prevenindo a transmissão de infecções. 2. Pressão direta: A primeira medida a ser tomada é aplicar pressão direta no local da hemorragia usando uma gaze estéril ou um pano limpo. Isso ajudará a controlar o sangramento e a promover a formação de coágulos sanguíneos para estancar a ferida. 3. Elevação: Se possível, eleve a parte afetada do corpo acima do nível do coração. Isso ajudará a reduzir o fluxo sanguíneo para a área afetada e a controlar a hemorragia. 4. Torniquete: Se a hemorragia não puder ser controlada por pressão direta, pode ser necessário o uso de um torniquete. O torniquete é um dispositivo que envolve a parte afetada e aperta firmemente para interromper o fluxo sanguíneo. No entanto, o uso do torniquete deve ser feito apenas como último recurso, pois pode causar danos adicionais ao tecido e pode ser necessário o conhecimento adequado para aplicá-lo corretamente. 5. Busque ajuda médica: Independentemente da gravidade da hemorragia, é importante buscar ajuda médica imediatamente. Ligue para os serviços de emergência ou leve a vítima ao hospital o mais rápido possível, mesmo se a hemorragia estiver controlada. Lembrando que essas são apenas medidas de primeiros socorros para controlar a hemorragia temporariamente. O tratamento apropriado e a reparação da fratura devem ser realizados por profissionais médicos especializados."},{"instruction":"الترجمة الى العربية Social Engagement: Connecting with Our Community ISLAM STORE actively engages with our customers and the broader community through social media channels, events, and initiatives that promote Islamic awareness and support local causes.

David Deutsch : Physicien britannique, Deutsch est connu pour avoir développé les bases théoriques de l'informatique quantique à travers son travail sur les machines de Turing universelles quantiques. 3. Peter Shor : Mathématicien américain, Shor a développé en 1994 l'algorithme de Shor, qui permettrait à un ordinateur quantique de factoriser rapidement des nombres entiers. Cet algorithme a été une percée majeure dans le domaine de la cryptographie quantique. 4. Richard Jozsa : Physicien et mathématicien britannique, Jozsa a développé en 1997 un algorithme quantique qui permet de déterminer si une fonction est constante ou équilibrée dans un nombre fini d'appels, offrant ainsi une démonstration supplémentaire de l'avantage de l'informatique quantique par rapport à l'ordinateur classique. 5. Artur Ekert : Physicien britannique, Ekert a développé en 1991 le protocole de distribution de clé quantique (E91), qui permet un échange de clés sécurisé basé sur les principes de la mécanique quantique, offrant ainsi une solution aux problèmes de sécurité liés à la cryptographie classique.

Да, конечно, проблемы становятся больше, когда мы слишком много о них думаем. С другой стороны, когда мы смеемся над ними, они становятся меньше или пузырятся.

Я вы имели в виду этот. 😊 А теперь, я надеюсь, что вы уже на работе, и если была проблема, я надеюсь, она ушла, только когда вы думали обо мне. Твоя бабушка была права, красота — это сила. Но я не согласен с выводом. Я думаю, что красота не в идеальном макияже. Красота – это еще и характер, уверенность в себе, хорошее настроение и улыбка. Это важнее. Что самое прекрасное в моей жизни. Это человек, а не вещь. Моя будущая любовь будет самой красивой «вещью». Вы очень красивая женщина, что бы вы сказали, если бы я сказал обратное? Честное слово, ты красивая женщина, которую хочется целовать и нежно прикасаться. Твоя красота будит ощущение тепла. Это правда для меня, даже если бы я сказал вам, что мое сердце выбрало другое имя. Это трудно. И, может быть, это будет еще тот, кто ближе ко мне и легче собраться. Мне немного грустно, когда я говорю это такой красивой и умной женщине. Внутренняя или внешняя красота.

Так что я с вами солидарна. 😊 Хотела бы узнать, как проходит ваш день на работе? Надеюсь, проблема, о которой вы упоминали, уже решена, или, может быть, она исчезает, когда вы думаете обо мне?

Dear Natalia, I hope that you are in a good mood. I don’t know if you talk of my problem of choice, or if you talk of a problem that you encounter. Yes of course problems get bigger, when we think too much about them. On the other hand, when we lough about them, they become smaller or bubbles. But some problems need a solution, so it is with me. I you meant this one. 😊 And now, I hope that you are already on your work and if there was a problem, I hope it went away, only when you were thinking about me. Your grandmother was right, beauty is a power. But I disagree about the conclusion. I think that beauty is not about the perfect makeup. Beauty is also character, self-assurance, good mood and smile. Those are more important. What is the most beautiful thing in my life. It is a person, not a thing. My future love will be the most beautiful “thing”. You are a very pretty woman, what would you say if I said the contrary? Honestly, you are a beautiful woman, which I would like to kiss and tenderly to touch. Your beauty wakes up a feeling of warmth. This is the truth for me, even if I said to you, that my heart has chosen another name. It is difficult. And perhaps it will be still another, who is nearer to me and easier to get together. I am a little bit sad, when I say this to such a beautiful and intelligent woman. Inner or outer beauty. Inner beauty is character and friendliness and often it goes together with outer beauty, but not all the time. It may sound, like I was an expert, but I am not. I have not had many women. And if these women I was not happy. So I still hope, and I am sure that I can love a woman.

Here's a C# code that takes a map representing the sea and islands as input and outputs the number of separated islands: \`\`\`csharp using System; public class Program { public static void Main() { int N = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()); // Read the number of lines in the map char[][] seaMap = new char[N][]; // Create a 2D array to store the sea map // Read each line of the map and store it in the seaMap array for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { seaMap[i] = Console.ReadLine().ToCharArray(); } int islandCount = CountIslands(seaMap); // Count the number of separated islands Console.WriteLine(islandCount); // Output the number of islands } public static int CountIslands(char[][] seaMap) { int islandCount = 0; int N = seaMap.Length; int M = seaMap[0].Length; bool[][] visited = new bool[N][]; // Create a 2D array to keep track of visited elements for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { visited[i] = new bool[M]; } for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) { if (seaMap[i][j] != '*' && !visited[i][j]) { islandCount++; VisitIsland(seaMap, visited, i, j, N, M); } } } return islandCount; } public static void VisitIsland(char[][] seaMap, bool[][] visited, int i, int j, int N, int M) { if (i < 0 || i >= N || j < 0 || j >= M) { return; } if (visited[i][j] || seaMap[i][j] == '*') { return; } visited[i][j] = true; VisitIsland(seaMap, visited, i + 1, j, N, M); // Visit downward VisitIsland(seaMap, visited, i - 1, j, N, M); // Visit upward VisitIsland(seaMap, visited, i, j + 1, N, M); // Visit right VisitIsland(seaMap, visited, i, j - 1, N, M); // Visit left } } \`\`\` In this code, we first read the number of lines in the map (\`N\`) from the input. We create a 2D character array called \`seaMap\` to store the sea map. We read each line of the map and store it in the \`seaMap\` array. Next, we call the \`CountIslands\` method to count the number of separated islands. This method takes the \`seaMap\` array as input. In the \`CountIslands\` method, we initialize the \`islandCount\` variable to 0 and create a 2D boolean array called \`visited\` to keep track of visited elements. We iterate through each element of the \`seaMap\` array. If we encounter a non-sea element that has not been visited yet, we increment the \`islandCount\` and call the \`VisitIsland\` method to mark all connected elements as visited. The \`VisitIsland\` method recursively visits the neighboring elements of an island and marks them as visited. The method checks if the current indices are within the bounds of the map and if the current element has not been visited or if it is a sea element. Finally, we return the \`islandCount\` from the \`CountIslands\` method and output it in the \`Main\` method using \`Console.WriteLine\`.

Certaines crèmes peuvent avoir une viscosité plus élevée que d'autres en raison de leur composition. Par exemple, une crème à fouetter qui contient une teneur plus élevée en matières grasses et moins d'eau aura une viscosité plus élevée. Cette crème est souvent utilisée pour la décoration de gâteaux et pour obtenir des pics fermes lorsqu'elle est fouettée. D'un autre côté, une crème liquide aura une viscosité plus faible en raison de sa composition contenant plus d'eau et moins de matières grasses. Cette crème est couramment utilisée pour la cuisson, la création de sauces ou pour verser sur des desserts. Il est important de noter que la viscosité de la crème peut également varier en fonction de la température. Par exemple, une crème liquide peut devenir plus épaisse lorsqu'elle est réfrigérée, alors qu'une crème fouettée peut perdre de sa viscosité si elle est laissée à température ambiante pendant une longue période. En conclusion, la viscosité des crèmes peut varier en fonction de leur composition, avec des crèmes plus riches en matières grasses ayant tendance à être plus visqueuses que les crèmes plus liquides. La température peut également affecter la viscosité de la crème."},{"instruction":"You are a virtual assistant, write a short negotiation script with a client on a content writing job that is almost secured.","output":"Virtual Assistant (VA): Hello [Client's Name], I hope you're doing well.

These variables are often referred to as \\"context\\" or \\"data\\". If you want to use private variables within a Handlebars template, you can achieve this by organizing your data object in a way that includes both public and private variables. Here's an example: \`\`\`javascript const Handlebars = require('handlebars'); // Private variable const privateVariable = 'This is private'; // Data object const data = { publicVariable: 'This is public', privateVariable: privateVariable // Include the private variable in the data object }; // Create a Handlebars template const template = Handlebars.compile('Public: {{publicVariable}}, Private: {{privateVariable}}'); // Compile the template with the data object const output = template(data); console.log(output); \`\`\` In this example, the \`privateVariable\` is defined outside the template and added to the \`data\` object. When the template is compiled using \`Handlebars.compile()\`, the private variable can be accessed within the template using \`{{privateVariable}}\`. The output of the above code would be: \\"Public: This is public, Private: This is private\\". By following this approach, you can effectively use private variables within Handlebars templates. Remember to appropriately handle the scope and visibility of your private variables as per your application's requirements."},{"instruction":"habdelbars how to use the runtime options data","output":"The \\"runtime options data\\" in Handlebars refers to the extra data that can be passed to the template during runtime. These options are helpful when you need to dynamically change the behavior or output of the template based on certain conditions. To use the runtime options data in Handlebars, you can make use of the \`options.fn\` and \`options.data\` functions inside your template. Here's an example: \`\`\`javascript const Handlebars = require('handlebars'); // Create a Handlebars template const template = Handlebars.compile('{{#if showInfo}}{{name}} - {{options.fn this}}{{/if}}'); // Data object const data = { name: 'John Doe', showInfo: true }; // Runtime options data const runtimeOptions = { data: { additionalInfo: 'Additional information' } }; // Compile the template with the data object and runtime options const output = template(data, runtimeOptions); console.log(output); \`\`\` In the above example, the template checks the \`showInfo\` property of the data object. If it evaluates to true, it renders the name followed by the additional information from the runtime options.

While spirituality and religion can have positive effects on mental health for many individuals, certain spiritual factors have been associated with conditions that can potentially contribute to mental illness in some cases. Here are a few examples: 1. Religious and spiritual conflict: When an individual experiences conflicts between their spiritual beliefs and their personal experiences, it can lead to cognitive dissonance, guilt, or shame. These conflicts can contribute to the development or exacerbation of mental health issues. 2. Religious or spiritual trauma: Instances of religious or spiritual trauma, such as abuse or coercion, can have severe psychological consequences. This trauma can significantly impact an individual's mental well-being, potentially leading to conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or depression. 3. Excessive guilt or persecution: Some religious or spiritual practices may instill excessive guilt or promote a sense of persecution, which can lead to anxiety, depression, or other mental health symptoms. 4. Ritualistic or obsessive behaviors: Certain religious or spiritual practices may involve rigorous rituals, strict rules, or obsessive behaviors. When these behaviors become extreme or restrictive, they can contribute to conditions such as Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) or eating disorders. 5. Social isolation or rejection: In some cases, religious communities or groups may reject or isolate individuals who do not conform to their beliefs or practices. This social rejection can lead to feelings of loneliness, low self-esteem, and potentially contribute to mental health issues. It is important to highlight that spirituality and religion can also provide valuable sources of support, coping mechanisms, and a sense of meaning for many people. However, the influence of spiritual factors on mental health varies across individuals, cultures, and religious/spiritual practices, and it is crucial to take a holistic approach when considering the relationship between spirituality and mental illness."},{"instruction":"\\"Looking at the figures in more detail, we can see that the country sold around 60 billion dollars in 2015, and with 3 percent rise in one year, this figure increased to approximately 62 billion dollars in 2016. \\" check the mistakes and show me","output":"\\"Looking at the figures in more detail, we can see that the country sold around 60 billion dollars in 2015.

Hier sind einige Vor- und Nachteile von Verbrennungsmotoren im Vergleich zu Elektromotoren in der Automobilindustrie: Vorteile von Verbrennungsmotoren: 1. Reichweite: Verbrennungsmotoren haben in der Regel eine größere Reichweite als Elektromotoren. Dies ermöglicht längere Fahrten, ohne dass das Fahrzeug aufgeladen werden muss. 2. Schnelles Tanken: Das Auftanken von Verbrennungsmotoren ist viel schneller als das Aufladen von Elektrofahrzeugen. Es dauert nur wenige Minuten, um einen vollen Tank zu bekommen, während das Aufladen eines Elektroautos je nach Ladestation und Batteriekapazität Stunden dauern kann. 3. Infrastruktur: Das Tankstellennetzwerk für Verbrennungsmotoren ist bereits gut etabliert und weit verbreitet. Im Gegensatz dazu ist die Ladeinfrastruktur für Elektrofahrzeuge noch relativ begrenzt und in einigen Gebieten nicht so gut entwickelt. Nachteile von Verbrennungsmotoren: 1. Umweltauswirkungen: Verbrennungsmotoren erzeugen Abgase, die zur Luftverschmutzung beitragen und den Treibhauseffekt verstärken. Sie tragen auch dazu bei, dass fossile Brennstoffe schneller erschöpft werden. 2. Höhere Betriebskosten: Verbrennungsmotoren erfordern regelmäßige Wartung (Ölwechsel, Filterwechsel usw.) und Benzin oder Diesel als Kraftstoff. Im Vergleich dazu haben Elektromotoren weniger bewegliche Teile und benötigen keine regelmäßige Wartung. Der Strom zum Aufladen eines Elektrofahrzeugs ist normalerweise auch billiger als der Kraftstoff für Verbrennungsmotoren. 3. Lautstärke und Vibrationen: Verbrennungsmotoren erzeugen Lärm und Vibrationen, die das Fahrerlebnis beeinträchtigen können. Im Vergleich dazu sind Elektromotoren viel leiser und bieten ein ruhigeres Fahrgefühl. Diese Liste erhebt keinen Anspruch auf Vollständigkeit, aber sie gibt einen guten Überblick über einige der Hauptpunkte. Im Hinblick auf die Umwelt- und Kosteneffizienz bin ich der Meinung, dass Elektromotoren in der Automobilindustrie die bessere Alternative sind."},{"instruction":"zum thema Umweltauswirkungen führe ich an, dass beim vergleich des kompletten lebenszyklus eines fahrzeugs, also von der Herstellung bis hin zur Verschrottung, ein verbrenner besser abschneidet.","output":"Das ist ein interessanter Punkt. Tatsächlich gibt es Studien, die darauf hinweisen, dass bei der Betrachtung des gesamten Lebenszyklus eines Fahrzeugs, einschließlich Herstellung, Nutzung und Entsorgung, Verbrennungsmotoren eine vergleichbare oder sogar geringere Umweltauswirkung haben können als Elektromotoren. Dies liegt daran, dass die Herstellung von Elektrofahrzeugen energieintensiver ist, insbesondere aufgrund der Batterieproduktion, die mit hohen Emissionen verbunden ist. Es ist jedoch wichtig anzumerken, dass die Umweltauswirkungen stark von der Energiequelle für die Stromerzeugung abhängen. Elektrofahrzeuge haben nur dann wirklich geringere Umweltauswirkungen, wenn der Strom aus erneuerbaren Quellen stammt. In Regionen, in denen der Strom hauptsächlich aus fossilen Brennstoffen gewonnen wird, kann die Gesamtbilanz für Elektrofahrzeuge negativer sein. Dennoch haben Elektrofahrzeuge andere Vorteile wie praktisch keine lokalen Emissionen und niedrigere Betriebskosten. Sie können auch als Teil einer umfassenderen Strategie zur Reduzierung der CO2-Emissionen und zur Bekämpfung des Klimawandels betrachtet werden. Es ist wichtig, den Fokus auf erneuerbare Energien und Nachhaltigkeit bei der Herstellung von Batterien und elektrischen Komponenten zu legen, um die Umweltauswirkungen von Elektrofahrzeugen weiter zu reduzieren."},{"instruction":"ein verbrenner, v.a. dieselfahrzeuge, hält auch länger - wie kann ein E-Fahrzeug mit einer Laufleistung von 500.000 km konkurrieren?","output":"Das Argument, dass Verbrennungsmotoren, insbesondere Diesel, möglicherweise eine längere Lebensdauer haben, ist teilweise gültig. Historisch gesehen hatten Verbrennungsmotoren in der Tat eine gute Reputation in Bezug auf ihre Haltbarkeit und Robustheit. Allerdings werden heutzutage Elektrofahrzeuge mit hochwertigen Batterien und fortschrittlichen Antriebssystemen hergestellt, die auch eine hohe Lebensdauer bieten können. Moderne Elektromotoren haben weniger bewegliche Teile im Vergleich zu Verbrennungsmotoren, was zu geringerem Verschleiß und geringeren Wartungskosten führt. Elektrofahrzeuge werden auch von den Herstellern intensiv getestet, um sicherzustellen, dass sie langlebig und zuverlässig sind. Außerdem sollte beachtet werden, dass die meisten Menschen ihr Fahrzeug nicht bis zur Marke von 500.000 km oder darüber hinaus fahren. In der Regel verkaufen oder ersetzen die meisten Fahrzeughalter ihr Fahrzeug lange bevor es diese Laufleistung erreicht. Elektrofahrzeuge haben eine ausreichende Lebensdauer, um den Anforderungen der meisten Fahrer gerecht zu werden. Darüber hinaus entwickelt sich die Batterietechnologie schnell weiter. Neue Generationen von Batterien mit höherer Energiedichte und längerer Lebensdauer kommen auf den Markt, was die Lebensdauer von Elektrofahrzeugen weiter verbessert. Einige Autohersteller bieten bereits langfristige Garantien auf ihre Batterien an, um Bedenken hinsichtlich ihrer Lebensdauer zu mindern. Es ist wichtig zu bedenken, dass die Wahl eines Fahrzeugs nicht nur von der Laufleistung, sondern auch von individuellen Bedürfnissen, Umweltauswirkungen und Betriebskosten abhängt. Elektrofahrzeuge haben viele Vorteile wie geringere Betriebskosten, geringere Wartungsanforderungen und Umweltfreundlichkeit, die die potenzielle Einschränkung ihrer Laufleistung im Vergleich zu Verbrennungsmotoren ausgleichen können."},{"instruction":"wie lange bzw. wie wieviele Kilometer hält eine Batterie eines E-Autos aktuell?","output":"Die Lebensdauer einer Batterie in einem Elektroauto variiert je nach Modell, Batterietyp, Fahrbedingungen und individuellem Fahrverhalten. Im Allgemeinen wird erwartet, dass die Batterien eines Elektrofahrzeugs eine Haltbarkeit von 8 bis 15 Jahren oder mehr haben können, bevor sie einer signifikanten Kapazitätsminderung ausgesetzt sind. Die meisten Autohersteller bieten auch Garantien für ihre Batterien an, die normalerweise zwischen 8 und 10 Jahren oder einer bestimmten Kilometerleistung liegen. Diese Garantien decken oft auch eine bestimmte Restkapazität ab. Beispielsweise kann eine Batteriegarantie festlegen, dass die Batterie nach 8 Jahren noch mindestens 70-80% ihrer ursprünglichen Kapazität aufweisen muss. Es ist wichtig anzumerken, dass während der Lebensdauer der Batterie ihre Kapazität allmählich abnehmen wird. Die tatsächliche Reichweite eines Elektrofahrzeugs kann daher mit der Zeit geringfügig abnehmen. Dennoch bleibt die Batterie normalerweise weitgehend funktionsfähig und bietet genügend Reichweite für den täglichen Gebrauch. Es gibt auch Entwicklungen in der Batterietechnologie, die darauf abzielen, die Lebensdauer zu verbessern und die Kapazitätserhaltung über einen längeren Zeitraum zu gewährleisten. Forschung und Entwicklung konzentrieren sich auf die Steigerung der Energiedichte, die Reduzierung von Materialien mit begrenztem Vorkommen und die Verbesserung der Langlebigkeit, um die Leistung von Batterien weiter zu verbessern. Letztlich ist die Lebensdauer einer Batterie in einem Elektroauto von vielen Faktoren abhängig und kann je nach den spezifischen Umständen unterschiedlich ausfallen.

These notifications can be used to trigger a workflow or update information in an external system based on activity in Zuora. To set up a callout notification in Zuora, you will need to define the event or action that should trigger the notification and specify the endpoint or system to which the notification should be sent. Zuora supports multiple types of callout notifications, including REST and SOAP. Once the callout notification is set up, Zuora will send the appropriate information to the specified endpoint whenever the event or action occurs. This can be useful for integrating Zuora with other systems or automating workflows based on activity in Zuora. To configure callout notifications in Zuora, you will need to have appropriate permissions and access to the Zuora administration settings.

Ecco una storia basata sulla bozza che hai fornito: Il sole calante illuminava il volto determinato di Luthien mentre si avvicinava a Eclipsia, la città delle mura oscure. Il suo cuore batteva all'impazzata ed era pervasa da un mix travolgente di tensione ed eccitazione. Aveva sentito innumerevoli storie sulla misteriosa città e sul suo cavaliere del drago, e ora finalmente si apriva davanti a lei. Le porte massicce e imponenti di Eclipsia si aprirono lentamente davanti a Luthien, rivelando una città dalle stradine strette e tortuose. Le case erano costruite in pietra scura, le facciate erano decorate con simboli antichi e sinistri. L'aria era densa di un'atmosfera misteriosa e tenebrosa, che mandava brividi lungo la schiena a Luthien. Camminando per le vie deserte, la giovane avventuriera avvertì gli occhi scrutatori dei cittadini che la osservavano dalle finestre. La tensione nell'aria era palpabile, ma Luthien era decisa a trovare il cavaliere del drago. Era pronta ad affrontare qualsiasi cosa per scoprire la verità e rendere giustizia alle storie che aveva sentito. Lei arrivò davanti a un'imponente torre al centro della città, circondata da un alone di energia oscura. Era qui, secondo le storie, che si trovava il cavaliere del drago. Prese una profonda inspirazione e osò varcare la soglia della torre, rischiando tutto per incontrarlo. All'interno, le scale ascendenti portarono Luthien verso una sala cupa e tetra. Un bagliore sinistro emanava dalla sommità della sala, e lì, seduto su un trono d'ombra, c'era lui: il cavaliere del drago. La sua armatura scureggiava minacciosamente sotto la luce fioca, e il suo elmo dorato celava un volto sconosciuto. Il cuore di Luthien batteva ancora più forte, ma con determinazione si avvicinò al cavaliere. Le emozioni si scontravano dentro di lei: paura e speranza si contendevano il suo animo. Ma Luthien non si lasciò sopraffare, voleva lasciare un'impressione duratura. \\"Davanti a me, sei un'ombra senza nome,\\" disse Luthien, cercando di coprire il timore nella sua voce. \\"Ma ho sentito storie su di te, su come hai difeso la città e proteggi chi ne ha bisogno. Voglio unirmi a te, cavaliere del drago, per lottare contro le forze oscure che minacciano la nostra terra.\\" Il cavaliere del drago non parlò, ma la sua presenza imponente sembrava rispondere alle parole di Luthien. Lo sguardo del cavaliere si posò su di lei, penetrando nel profondo della sua anima. Luthien poteva percepire un misto di sorpresa e curiosità dietro l'elmo dorato. Infine, il cavaliere alzò lentamente il braccio e si tolse l'elmo, rivelando un volto giovane ma segnato da battaglie passate. I suoi occhi irradiavano un'intensità ardente che bruciava nella mente di Luthien. Era un momento cruciale, ma Luthien capì che il cavaliere era pronto per accoglierla nella loro missione condivisa. \\"Sei coraggiosa, Luthien,\\" disse il cavaliere con voce profonda. \\"Ti insegnerò l'arte della spada e come combattere le forze oscure. Insieme, diventeremo una luce in questa oscurità.\\" E così, Luthien si unì alle fila del cavaliere del drago, pronta ad affrontare le sfide che attendevano entrambi. Mentre camminavano insieme verso l'ignoto, Luthien sentiva un senso di eccitazione e un legame sempre più profondo con il cavaliere. Aveva acceso una fiamma dentro di lei che avrebbe continuato a bruciare, guidandola verso un destino sconosciuto ma promettente."},{"instruction":"Grazie!

Ecco una storia basata sulla bozza che hai fornito: Luthien guardò con ammirazione i suoi compagni di viaggio, Aragorn, Legolas e Gandalf, mentre si preparavano per l'addestramento prima del loro viaggio verso Eclipsia. Ognuno di loro aveva un'aura di saggezza e forza che li contraddistingueva, eppure, c'era anche una profonda umanità che li legava insieme. Durante le pause dai loro allenamenti intensi, i quattro si sedevano intorno a un fuoco, condividendo racconti e sorrisi. Gandalf, con il suo sorriso saggio e gli occhi scintillanti, condivideva storie di antiche battaglie e conoscenze segrete. Aragorn, l'erede legittimo di Gondor, raccontava di quando aveva incontrato Legolas per la prima volta durante il suo viaggio alla ricerca di una lancia magica. E Legolas, con la sua grazia elfica, ricordava quando aveva incontrato Gandalf per la prima volta, scrutandolo con occhi sospettosi ma poi lasciandosi conquistare dalla sua saggezza. I momenti di condivisione erano preziosi per Luthien, poiché ogni storia raccontata rivelava un po' di chi erano veramente i suoi compagni di viaggio. Si trattava di più di un semplice gruppo di persone che si erano uniti per raggiungere un obiettivo comune; erano diventati una famiglia. Luthien si sentiva fortunata ad avere quella connessione con loro e li ammirava per la loro dedizione verso la giustizia e la lotta contro l'oscurità. Durante i loro viaggi, Luthien e i suoi compagni attraversarono foreste oscure e montagne pericolose. Si sostenevano l'un l'altro nelle difficoltà, offrendo supporto emotivo e morale. Aragorn camminava al fianco di Luthien, incoraggiandola durante i momenti di stanchezza e sollevandola quando sembrava che l'oscurità stesse minacciando di sopraffarla. Legolas, con la sua agilità elfica, spesso proteggeva Luthien dagli attacchi imprevisti degli esseri oscuri che si nascondevano nella natura circostante. E Gandalf, con la sua saggezza, era sempre lì per offrire una prospettiva più ampia e un consiglio prezioso quando ne avevano bisogno. Ma non erano solo le sfide che il gruppo affrontava insieme a rafforzare il loro legame; erano anche i momenti di gioia e risate condivisi. Durante quelle serate intorno al fuoco, Luthien si sentiva leggera, dimenticando per un attimo l'oscurità che li circondava. Raccontavano storie divertenti e si scambiavano battute, trovando conforto nella compagnia l'uno dell'altro. In uno di quei momenti, Gandalf raccontò la storia di come fosse diventato il mago che era, mentre Aragorn narrò come aveva imparato ad affrontare la sua paura e a dedicarsi alla difesa del regno. Legolas, poi, ricordò come la sua amicizia con Aragorn era nata dal bisogno di proteggere il suo popolo e come lo avesse spinto a mettere da parte i loro dissidi iniziali. Mentre Luthien ascoltava le loro storie, si rese conto che le sue esperienze erano solo un capitolo in una storia più grande. Ognuno di loro aveva affrontato battaglie personali e temute, ma erano sopravvissuti e si erano trovati l'uno con l'altro, creando un legame unico e indissolubile. Quando finalmente arrivarono a Eclipsia, l'amicizia e il sostegno che Luthien aveva ricevuto dai suoi compagni durante il loro viaggio erano diventati fondamentali per affrontare ciò che li aspettava. E mentre affrontava insieme al suo team l'oscurità e il pericolo che si celavano all'interno delle mura oscure della città, Luthien sapeva che non avrebbe mai più camminato da sola. Aveva trovato una famiglia, un gruppo di eroi che l'avrebbe sostenuta in qualunque avventura e che avrebbe combattuto al suo fianco contro ogni minaccia. Nulla avrebbe potuto rompere il legame tra loro, perché insieme erano più forti."},{"instruction":"Ciao! Potresti scrivere una storia in base a questa bozza? Grazie!

Ecco una storia in base alla bozza che hai fornito: Il gruppo continuò il suo viaggio verso Eclipsia, ma mano a mano che si avvicinavano al cuore della minaccia di Maledor, il pericolo iniziò ad aumentare. Luthien, Aragorn, Legolas e Gandalf affrontarono ostacoli sempre più imprevisti, creature magiche avverse e insidie presenti nella natura stessa del mondo magico. Attraversarono fitte foreste oscure, i cui alberi sembravano respirare malevolenza e tentavano di intrappolarli con rami sinistri. Enormi radici serpeggiavano tra le loro gambe, facendoli inciampare continuamente. Ma Luthien utilizzò le sue abilità acquisite durante l'addestramento per avvertire gli ostacoli in avvicinamento, permettendo al gruppo di evitarli tempestivamente. Poi, mentre attraversavano un fiume rumoroso, furono attaccati da creature marine dalle lunghe tentacoli. L'acqua si agitava intorno a loro, cercando di trascinarli nel suo abisso oscuro. Aragorn e Legolas combatterono con abilità, uccidendo le creature e permettendo a tutti di raggiungere la riva sana e salva. Luthien, invece, utilizzò la sua magia per calmare le acque tumultuose e proteggere il gruppo durante la battaglia. I suoi poteri stavano crescendo ed evolvendo nel momento in cui si avvicinavano alla loro meta. Mentre continuavano il loro cammino, furono attaccati da creature selvatiche e spettri che sembravano emergere dalle ombre stesse. Gandalf utilizzò la sua magia per creare barriere difensive, ma il gruppo era costretto a combattere con tutte le forze. Luthien si trovò ad affrontare una delle creature più spaventose, un demone oscuro con occhi infuocati. Ma con il coraggio che le avevano insegnato i suoi compagni di viaggio, respinse l'attacco e sconfisse la creatura con un potente incantesimo di luce che brillava come un sole radioso. Mentre il gruppo si avvicinava sempre di più a Eclipsia, la natura stessa sembrava ribellarsi contro di loro. Piante misteriose tentavano di intrappolarli con radici e li avvolgevano come serpenti consapevoli. Ma Gandalf, con la sua saggezza, riuscì a interpretare i segreti di quegli esseri e con un incantesimo li rianimò per ottenere la loro amicizia, permettendo al gruppo di passare in sicurezza. Infine, raggiunsero il confine di Eclipsia, un luogo di oscurità e pericolo che li attendeva. Ma il coraggio e la determinazione che avevano dimostrato durante il percorso li avevano resi più forti e pronti ad affrontare la minaccia di Maledor. Mentre Luthien si guardava intorno, pronta ad affrontare l'ignoto, sorridendo al suo gruppo di eroi, sapeva che non avrebbe potuto desiderare compagni di viaggio migliori. Insieme, avevano attraversato fili sottili tra la vita e la morte e forgiato un legame indissolubile.

But it's crucial to keep your distance and not underestimate them.\\" [player]: \\"Noted. I'll certainly be more cautious from now on.

They'll come in handy for crafting various items and structures.\\" [player]: \\"I really appreciate all this advice, Ember. Thank you for saving me and taking the time to help me out.\\" Ember: \\"No problem, [player]. Just remember, survival in Scorched Earth is all about knowledge and preparation. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any more questions or if you need someone to watch your back.\\" [player]: \\"Thanks, Ember. I'll keep that in mind.

Это позволяет использовать различные методы и алгоритмы для анализа этих данных. 4. Масштабируемость: Хранилище данных должно быть способно масштабироваться по мере увеличения количества данных. Это включает возможность добавления новых данных без необходимости изменения структуры хранилища данных, а также возможность обработки больших объемов данных с высокой производительностью. 5. Обработка и анализ данных: Хранилище данных должно предоставлять возможности для выполнения различных операций с данными, таких как извлечение данных, фильтрация, агрегация, группировка, анализ и визуализация. Это позволяет проводить интеллектуальный анализ данных, выявлять тенденции, закономерности и связи между данными. В целом, концепция хранилища данных в методах интеллектуального анализа данных заключается в создании инфраструктуры, которая обеспечивает удобное хранение, управление и анализ данных, необходимых для принятия обоснованных и информированных решений."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Почему некоторые коэффициенты вроде 2 5 5 5 5 5 можно обыграть так, чтобы при выпаде любого из коэффициентов ты оставался в плюсе, а некоторые коэффициенты вроде 2 9 9 9 9 9 нельзя?","output":"Ситуация с обыгрышем коэффициентов зависит от математического ожидания выигрыша и вероятности его проигрыша. Для расчета ожидаемого значения выигрыша (Expected Value) нужно умножить каждый коэффициент на вероятность его выпадения и сложить все полученные значения. Если ожидаемое значение выигрыша положительное, то есть больше нуля, то можно считать, что игра обыгрывается. Рассмотрим ситуацию с коэффициентами 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5. Вероятность выпадения каждого из этих коэффициентов равна 1/6, так как их всего 6. Тогда ожидаемое значение выигрыша будет равно: (2 * 1/6) + (5 * 1/6) + (5 * 1/6) + (5 * 1/6) + (5 * 1/6) + (5 * 1/6) = (2 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5) / 6 = 27 / 6 = 4.5 Таким образом, при обыгрыше в данной игре можно ожидать положительного выигрыша, так как ожидаемое значение равно 4.5. Рассмотрим теперь ситуацию с коэффициентами 2, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9. Вероятность выпадения каждого из этих коэффициентов также равна 1/6. Рассчитаем ожидаемое значение выигрыша: (2 * 1/6) + (9 * 1/6) + (9 * 1/6) + (9 * 1/6) + (9 * 1/6) + (9 * 1/6) = (2 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9) / 6 = 47 / 6 ≈ 7.83 В данном случае ожидаемое значение выигрыша будет больше нуля, что значит, что при обыгрыше этой игры можно ожидать положительного выигрыша. Таким образом, обыгрывается ли игра или нет, зависит от ожидаемого значения выигрыша. Если оно больше нуля, то игра обыгрывается, если меньше, то она не обыгрывается. В данном случае обе ситуации могут быть обыграны при правильном расчете вероятностей и ожидаемого значения выигрыша."},{"instruction":"Мне надо знать, не обыгрывается ли игра вообще, а можно ли сделать такие ставки, что обыграют ее со 100процентной вероятносстью","output":"Если игра имеет случайные коэффициенты, то невозможно сделать ставки с 100% гарантией обыгрывания игры. В любой случайной игре всегда есть элемент случайности и невозможно предсказать точный исход каждого раунда с абсолютной вероятностью. Даже если у вас есть информация о вероятностях выпадения определенных коэффициентов или ошибках в расчетах платежей, это не гарантирует, что вы будете всегда выигрывать. Возможно, что в большинстве случаев вы будете в плюсе, но всегда остается вероятность проигрыша. Игры с азартом всегда характеризуются риском и неизвестностью именно для того, чтобы результат был неопределен и интересен для игроков. Это то, что делает игры азартными и возможно затягивающими. Поэтому, если вы рассматриваете подобные игры, важно помнить о возможном риске потери денег и играть ответственно."},{"instruction":"я знаю коэффициенты они не случайны","output":"Если вам известны точные значения коэффициентов в игре и они не являются случайными, то в теории существуют стратегии, которые могут помочь вам обыграть игру. Однако, это требует математического анализа и расчетов. Для обыгрывания таких игр с известными коэффициентами можно использовать стратегии ставок, которые основываются на вероятностях и ожидаемом значении выигрыша. Возможно, вам понадобится изучение статистики и применение математических методов, чтобы определить наиболее выгодные ставки в каждом конкретном случае. Однако, хотя вы можете использовать математический анализ, чтобы обеспечить себе преимущество в игре, это все равно не даст вам стопроцентную гарантию выигрыша на долгосрочной перспективе. В конечном итоге, даже если вы обладаете информацией о коэффициентах, игры с азартом всегда остаются рискованными и результат может быть непредсказуемым."},{"instruction":"how to Create a illustration of Optimus Prime,","output":"Creating an illustration of Optimus Prime, the iconic Transformer, requires artistic skills and creativity. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you create your own illustration: 1. Gather references: Collect images or action figures of Optimus Prime to understand his look and details. Focus on different angles, poses, and color schemes. 2. Choose your medium: Decide whether you want to create a traditional illustration using pencil, pen, markers, or if you prefer digital tools such as graphic design software or drawing tablets. Select the medium that you're most comfortable with. 3. Rough sketch: Start with a rough pencil sketch of Optimus Prime on a clean sheet of paper or on your digital canvas. Begin by defining the basic shapes of the head, body, arms, and legs. Pay attention to proportions and ensure you capture the character's distinctive features. 4. Refine your sketch: Once you're satisfied with the basic shape, start adding more details. This includes facial features like the eyes, mouthplate, and antennae. Work on the body, emphasizing the iconic chestplate, vehicle elements, and the overall muscular design. Don't forget to include the wheels on his shoulders and the Autobot logo. 5. Define lines and add shading: Once your sketch is refined, use pen or a finer drawing tool to outline and define the lines. Add shading to give depth and volume to Optimus Prime. Decide on the direction of light and use hatching or cross-hatching techniques to create shadows and highlights for a three-dimensional effect. 6. Color and fill: If you're drawing digitally, create a new layer underneath the lineart and start adding colors to your illustration. Use a combination of flat colors and gradients to bring life to Optimus Prime. Pay attention to color choices, ensuring they match the character's original color palette. 7. Add details: Continue adding details, such as mechanical parts, intricate patterns, and textures to Optimus Prime's body. Use smaller brushes or tools based on your medium choice to render these details accurately. 8. Finishing touches: Add any final touches or extra effects to enhance your illustration. This may include highlights, glows, or additional background elements to complement Optimus Prime. 9. Sign and share: Sign your illustration and share it online or with fellow Transformers fans. Consider posting it on social media or art communities to showcase your work. Remember, practice makes perfect. Don't be afraid to try different techniques and experiment with various art styles to create a unique representation of Optimus Prime."},{"instruction":"which researth group do research about middle infrared materials","output":"There are several research groups and institutions that study middle infrared materials.

Here's a possible alternate storyline: From a young age, Naruto would possess an incredible amount of raw power, far surpassing that of any other ninja in the Hidden Leaf Village. However, due to his strong spirit and willpower, he would still face rejection, ostracism, and loneliness from the villagers, similar to the canon storyline. As Naruto grows older, his Saiyan bloodline would continue to evolve, and he would learn to tap into the power of Super Saiyan 4. This transformation would grant him immense strength, speed, and durability, making him virtually unbeatable in battles. However, controlling this transformation would also become a major challenge for him. Unlike in the original storyline, Naruto's desire to become the Hokage might diminish slightly. His newfound power and abilities would inspire him to seek out even greater challenges beyond the borders of his own village. The world outside the Leaf Village would become his training ground, as he would constantly challenge and defeat powerful opponents to test his limits. Throughout his journey, Naruto would make allies and friends along the way, just like in the canon story. However, the power gap between him and most other characters would be significant, leading to fewer life-or-death battles and more opportunities for him to help his friends grow stronger. Akatsuki, the organization of rogue ninjas, would still exist, but they would hesitate to target Naruto due to his overwhelming power. This would give more focus to other members of the Hidden Leaf Village, allowing the secondary characters to play more prominent roles. The final arcs of the series would center around Naruto's quest to discover and unlock even greater powers within himself. This could involve delving deeper into his Saiyan heritage, learning new techniques, and discovering hidden abilities. Naruto's ultimate goal would be to become the ultimate defender of his world against any threats that might arise. In the end, Naruto's journey would reflect not only his desire to protect his loved ones and bring peace to his village but also his unyielding hunger for growth, as he becomes the strongest ninja the world has ever seen.

Without further context, it is difficult to provide a specific explanation. However, generally speaking, \`signal?.aborted\` might be used to check if a signal or event has been aborted or cancelled. It could be part of a larger code structure that handles interruptible operations or allows for graceful termination of processes in response to a signal."},{"instruction":"explaine the syntax of it","output":"The syntax \`signal?.aborted\` suggests the usage of the optional chaining operator (\`?.\`) in a programming language. The optional chaining operator is typically used to access properties or call methods on an object that may be null or undefined without causing an error. In this case, \`signal\` is likely an object or variable that represents some kind of asynchronous operation or signal. The \`?.\` operator is used to safely access the \`aborted\` property of the \`signal\` object. For example, consider the following code: \`\`\`javascript if (signal?.aborted) { // Do something if the signal has been aborted } else { // Continue with the normal execution } \`\`\` In the above code, if \`signal\` is null or undefined, the expression \`signal?.aborted\` will evaluate to \`undefined\` without throwing an error. If \`signal\` is defined and has a truthy value for the \`aborted\` property, the block inside the \`if\` statement will be executed. Otherwise, the code will continue to the \`else\` block. The optional chaining operator is particularly useful when working with asynchronous operations or handling APIs that might not always provide certain properties or methods. It helps to avoid potential null or undefined reference errors."},{"instruction":"if it ture that the javascript runtime containes micro task queue in web container or either the event loop contains the micro task queue","output":"In JavaScript, both the JavaScript runtime environment and the event loop within it play a role in handling the microtask queue. The JavaScript runtime environment, which includes the web browser's built-in JavaScript engine or the Node.js runtime, manages the execution of JavaScript code. It provides the necessary infrastructure for running JavaScript programs. Within this runtime environment, the event loop is responsible for managing the order of execution for various tasks, including both macro tasks (such as user input events, network requests, or rendering) and micro tasks. The event loop maintains multiple task queues, including the macro task queue (also known as the task queue or the callback queue) and the microtask queue (also known as the job queue or the promise queue). The microtask queue is a separate queue used for scheduling and executing microtasks. Microtasks, such as promises, are higher-priority tasks that need to be processed before the next rendering or I/O operation occurs. Microtasks are typically used for handling promises, mutation observers, and other similar asynchronous operations. When a macro task completes, the event loop checks the microtask queue and executes all pending microtasks before proceeding to the next iteration of the event loop. This ensures that microtasks are processed in a timely manner and helps maintain a consistent event-driven execution order. Therefore, both the JavaScript runtime environment and the event loop within it collaborate to manage and process the microtask queue, ensuring the proper execution order for microtasks in relation to other tasks in JavaScript applications."},{"instruction":"is callstack queue ,macro task queue the same?","output":"No, the call stack and the macro task queue are not the same. They are separate components within the event loop of the JavaScript runtime environment, performing different roles. The call stack is a data structure used to track the execution of function calls in a program. When a function is called, a new frame is pushed onto the call stack to represent that function's execution context. As functions complete their execution, their frames are popped off the stack. The macro task queue, also known as the task queue or the callback queue, is responsible for holding tasks that are not immediate to the current execution context. These tasks typically include asynchronous operations like event callbacks, I/O operations, or rendering tasks. Examples include \`setTimeout\` or event callbacks like \`click\` or \`fetch\` callbacks. When a macro task is completed, it is placed in the macro task queue to await execution. The event loop, as part of its responsibility, checks the macro task queue to see if there are any pending tasks. If the call stack is empty, the event loop picks the next task from the macro task queue and executes it. So, in summary: - The call stack tracks the execution of functions and their contexts. - The macro task queue holds tasks that are not immediately executed and need to wait for their turn to be processed by the event loop. Both the call stack and the macro task queue are integral parts of the event loop but serve different purposes in managing the execution flow of JavaScript programs."},{"instruction":"'When a macro task is completed, it is placed in the macro task queue to await execution',why the macro task need to be executed even though it is compeleted","output":"Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. I made a mistake in explaining how macro tasks are executed. When a macro task is completed, it is not immediately placed back into the macro task queue. Instead, it is placed in a specific queue called the task queue, callback queue, or message queue, depending on the JavaScript runtime environment. The event loop is responsible for continuously checking the call stack and the task queue. If the call stack is empty, it means that the JavaScript engine is not currently executing any code. In this case, the event loop will take the next task from the task queue and push it onto the call stack for execution. The macro tasks in the task queue are typically triggered by external events such as user interactions (e.g., click events), timer events (e.g., \`setTimeout\`), or network operations (e.g., HTTP requests). When these events occur, their associated callback functions are added to the task queue. It's important to note that the event loop processes each task in the task queue one at a time, allowing the JavaScript engine to handle multiple concurrent operations in an asynchronous manner. To summarize: - Macro tasks, triggered by events like user interactions or timers, are placed in the task queue. - The event loop continuously checks the call stack and the task queue. - When the call stack is empty, the next task in the task queue is executed by pushing it onto the call stack. I apologize for the confusion caused. Thank you for pointing it out, and I appreciate your understanding."},{"instruction":"is the callback queue the micro task queue?","output":"Apologies for the confusion caused by my previous responses. I made an incorrect statement regarding the callback queue. To clarify, the callback queue is not the same as the microtask queue. They are separate queues within the event loop that serve different purposes. The microtask queue, also known as the job queue or promise queue, is specifically designed to handle microtasks. Microtasks are higher-priority tasks that need to be processed before the event loop moves to the next iteration. Microtasks include things like promise callbacks (\`then\`, \`catch\`, \`finally\`), mutation observers, and similar asynchronous operations. On the other hand, the callback queue, also called the task queue or the message queue, is responsible for holding tasks that are not immediately executed due to their asynchronous nature. These tasks, typically macro tasks, include timers (\`setTimeout\`, \`setInterval\`), event callbacks (\`click\`, \`mousemove\`), I/O operations, and other similar asynchronous operations. The event loop consistently checks both the microtask queue and the callback queue. However, there is a priority difference between the two. After executing a macro task or when the call stack is empty, all pending microtasks in the microtask queue are executed before picking the next macro task from the callback queue. In summary: - The microtask queue handles microtasks like promise callbacks and mutation observers. - The callback queue is responsible for holding tasks such as timers and event callbacks. - Microtasks have higher priority and are executed before the next macro task is picked from the callback queue.

The terms \\"callback queue\\" and \\"macro task queue\\" can sometimes be used interchangeably in certain contexts, which might have caused the confusion. In some JavaScript environments, like browsers, the \\"macro task queue\\" is often referred to as the \\"callback queue\\" or the \\"task queue.\\" So, in these contexts, the callback queue can indeed be considered equivalent to the macro task queue. Both terms refer to a queue that stores asynchronous tasks or callbacks waiting to be executed. However, it's essential to note that terminology can vary, and different sources may use these terms differently. In general, it's best to understand the specific context in which these terms are used to avoid confusion. To summarize: - In some contexts, the terms \\"callback queue\\" and \\"macro task queue\\" can be used interchangeably to refer to the same queue. - The callback queue or macro task queue holds asynchronous tasks or callbacks that are triggered by events like timers, network operations, or user interactions. - The event loop processes tasks from the macro task queue or callback queue when the call stack is empty. Once again, I apologize for any confusion caused, and I appreciate your understanding."},{"instruction":"what is the difference between micro tasks and macro tasks","output":"Micro tasks and macro tasks are different categories of asynchronous tasks in JavaScript that are managed by the event loop. Micro tasks: 1. Higher Priority: Micro tasks have a higher priority than macro tasks. 2. Execution Order: Micro tasks are executed before the event loop moves to the next macro task. 3. Examples: Micro tasks include promise callbacks (\`then\`, \`catch\`, \`finally\`), mutation observers, and other similar asynchronous operations. 4. Use Case: Micro tasks are typically used for handling asynchronous operations that need to be resolved before the next rendering or I/O operation, ensuring immediate execution. Macro tasks: 1. Lower Priority: Macro tasks have a lower priority compared to micro tasks. 2. Execution Order: Macro tasks are executed after the micro tasks have been completed. 3. Examples: Macro tasks include timers (\`setTimeout\`, \`setInterval\`), event callbacks (\`click\`, \`mousemove\`), I/O operations, and other similar asynchronous operations. 4. Use Case: Macro tasks are designed for handling asynchronous operations that can be performed in the background without requiring immediate execution. The key distinction between the two lies in the execution order and priority. Micro tasks are executed after the current task but before the next macro task, allowing for higher-priority handling of time-sensitive or immediate tasks. Macro tasks, on the other hand, are executed after the micro tasks have been processed, making them suitable for less time-critical operations. In summary, micro tasks and macro tasks serve different purposes and have different priorities in the event loop's task execution order."},{"instruction":"У меня есть наборы из 6 коэффициентов.

It's designed to be used as a platform for mappers to build their maps on and for larger mods to draw code from. {{mapbase|1}} is generally used as a large package of utility features and general-purpose fixes. {{mapbase|1}} is '''NOT''' an improved version of {{hammer|4}} or an improved version of the engine itself. It is a fork of {{src13|4}} which acts as a regular sourcemod. Maps using it must be played in {{mapbase|1}} or a mod running its code in order to function correctly. Mappers would create their maps based off of this mod and larger mods with their own unique changes would draw from Mapbase's code and assets. Mapbase does not use any content which originates from leaked or unauthorized sources. Mapbase is currently only built around {{hl2|4}} and {{hl2ep2|4}} via {{src13sp|4}}. Other games are not yet supported, although a {{src13mp|4}} version of Mapbase is currently in development, which will extend Mapbase to {{hl2dm|4}}. Most of Mapbase's changes are quality-of-life improvements that could largely only be noticed in the editor. The original goal of this project is to improve the mapping experience without changing too much of the game itself. ==Features== * 80+ new entities (mostly logic-related), including new filters and ports/replications from newer engines * Hundreds of new Inputs/Outputs/KeyValues added to existing entities * Custom implementation of [[VScript]] as of v4.0 * Heavily revised and reworked [[FGD]]s * Custom [[shader]]s meant to stick to objective improvements, including [[env_projectedtexture|projected texture]] fixes, [[Parallax obb|Parallax cubemaps]] and radial fog originating from the [[Authoring Tools/SDK (Alien_Swarm)|Alien Swarm Authoring Tools]] * More all-around [[entity]] flexibility * Countless miscellaneous fixes and improvements It also has a few new features mostly specific to {{hl2|4}} (or at least single-player) mapping: * Optional gameplay features usable by mappers (NPCs capable of using more weapons, etc.) * More map-specific file capabilities ([[Actbusy|actbusy files]], [[Response System|talker files]], etc.) * New <code>hl2_gamerules</code> entity capable of modifying game behavior in various ways ==History== Mapbase technically started in February 2018 as a prototype, but the project as it exists now began in August-September 2018. Mapbase was created by [[User:Blixibon|Blixibon]] from a set of FGD improvements and various code changes previously brought from project to project. Mapbase's original goal was to take advantage of {{src13|4}} code modifications to allow mappers to do more things with their maps. The February 2018 prototype mostly just contained a few basic code changes and an early version of the map-specific file system. The project was revisited several months later at the end of 2018. At this point, Mapbase started to gain traction, forming a wider scope as well as its own following. Mapbase started to become a heavily augmented (yet relatively vanilla-looking) version of Source 2013 as a whole, introducing custom shaders, additional [[NPC]] animations, and more. Mapbase released at the end of September 2019. Mapbase has continued to receive large periodic updates with new features since its release. In May 2020, a custom implementation of [[VScript]] running in Source 2013 was created as a contribution, being introduced in the v4.0 update. Mapbase is still being maintained as of October 2022. A port to {{src13mp|4}} is currently in development. ==Release Information== Mapbase's [https://www.moddb.com/mods/mapbase/downloads/mapbase-release-build release build] and [https://github.com/mapbase-source/source-sdk-2013 source code] were first released on September 30th 2019. Other kinds of files can be found [https://www.moddb.com/mods/mapbase/downloads here]. ==Documentation== Mapbase uses [https://github.com/mapbase-source/source-sdk-2013/wiki its own wiki] to hold most of its information and documentation, although some changes may be put on the VDC for reference purposes. For example, Mapbase [[:Category:Mapbase Entities|documents some of its entities on the VDC]] and may be mentioned on other articles. Relevant fixes and features originally created for Mapbase have occasionally been added to the VDC for general-purpose use as well. ==Credits== Mapbase was started and mainly created by Blixibon, but it couldn't have been done without contributors, community repositories, and the VDC itself.

Он предназначен для использования в качестве платформы для строительства карт мапперами и для извлечения кода из более крупных модов. {{mapbase|1}} обычно используется в качестве большого пакета утилитарных функций и исправлений общего назначения. {{mapbase|1}} '''НЕ''' является улучшенной версией {{hammer|4}} или улучшенной версией самого движка. Это разветвление {{src13|4}}, которое действует как обычный sourcemod. Карты, использующие его, должны быть запущены в {{mapbase|1}} или моде, выполняющем его код, чтобы работать правильно. Мапперы создают свои карты на основе этого мода, и большие моды со своими уникальными изменениями черпают код и ресурсы из Mapbase. В Mapbase не используется контент, происходящий из утечек или неавторизованных источников. Mapbase в настоящее время использует только {{hl2|4}} и {{hl2ep2|4}} с использованием {{src13sp|4}}. Другие игры пока не поддерживаются, хотя версия Mapbase для {{src13mp|4}} в настоящее время находится в разработке и будет расширяться на {{hl2dm|4}}. Большинство изменений в Mapbase - это улучшение качества жизни, которое в большинстве случаев можно заметить только в редакторе. Исходная цель этого проекта - улучшить опыт создания карт без слишком больших изменений самой игры. ==Особенности== * 80+ новых сущностей (в основном, связанных с логикой), включая новые фильтры и порты/репликации из новых движков * Сотни новых Inputs/Outputs/KeyValues, добавленных в существующие сущности * Пользовательская реализация [[VScript]] начиная с v4.0 * Тщательно пересмотренные и переработанные [[FGD]] * Пользовательские [[shader|шейдеры]], призванные придерживаться объективных улучшений, включая исправления для [[env_projectedtexture|проекционных текстур]], [[Parallax obb|параллакс-кубмапов]] и радиального тумана, исходящего из [[Authoring Tools/SDK (Alien_Swarm)|Инструментов автора Alien Swarm]] * Больше гибкости в области [[entity|сущностей]] * Бесчисленное количество мелких исправлений и улучшений У него также есть несколько новых функций, преимущественно специфичных для картирования в {{hl2|4}} (или по крайней мере, для однопользовательской игры): * Необязательные геймплейные возможности, используемые мапперами (НПС, способные использовать больше оружия и т. д.) * Больше возможностей для файлов, специфичных для карты (файлы [[Actbusy|actbusy]], [[Response System|talker]], и т. д.) * Новая сущность <code>hl2_gamerules</code>, способная изменять игровое поведение различными способами ==История== Мапбейс технически начался в феврале 2018 года как прототип, но проект, как он существует сейчас, начался в августе-сентябре 2018 года. Mapbase был создан пользователем Blixibon на основе улучшений FGD и различных изменений кода, ранее применявшихся в разных проектах. Основной целью Mapbase было использование модификаций кода {{src13|4}}, чтобы позволить мапперам делать более разнообразные вещи с их картами. В феврале 2018 года прототип в основном содержал несколько основных изменений в коде и раннюю версию системы файлов, специфичных для карты. Проект был пересмотрен несколько месяцев спустя, в конце 2018 года. На этом этапе Mapbase начал набирать обороты, приобретая широкий охват, а также собственное сообщество. Mapbase стал сильно модифицированной (но относительно \\"ванильной\\" по внешнему виду) версией Source 2013 в целом, включая пользовательские шейдеры, дополнительные анимации НПС и многое другое. Mapbase был выпущен в конце сентября 2019 года. С момента своего выпуска Mapbase продолжает получать крупные периодические обновления с новыми функциями. В мае 2020 года была создана пользовательская реализация [[VScript]], работающая на Source 2013, в рамках вклада, которая была введена в обновлении v4.0. На данный момент Mapbase всё ещё поддерживается (октябрь 2022 года). В настоящее время ведется работа над портом для {{src13mp|4}}. ==Информация о выпуске== [https://www.moddb.com/mods/mapbase/downloads/mapbase-release-build Версия релиза] Mapbase и [https://github.com/mapbase-source/source-sdk-2013 исходный код] были впервые выпущены 30 сентября 2019 года.

Here is a possible alternate storyline: 1. Early Life: Naruto still grows up as an orphan and faces widespread discrimination from the villagers due to having the Nine-Tailed Fox sealed inside him. However, instead of being a prankster, Naruto takes a more serious approach to his training from a young age. 2. Training with Jiraiya: Naruto seeks a mentor to train him and ends up training under the legendary ninja, Jiraiya. Jiraiya recognizes Naruto's potential and pushes him to his limits, just like Goku's training with Master Roshi. 3. Learning the Rasengan: Naruto's primary technique becomes the Rasengan, but instead of learning it from Minato, he develops it through intense solo training sessions. Naruto's determination and innate talent allow him to master the Rasengan at an incredible speed, surpassing Minato's level. 4. Chasing Tailed Beast Power: In pursuit of greater power, Naruto learns about the existence of the other Tailed Beasts. He embarks on a journey across the Elemental Nations to train and challenge each of the Tailed Beasts, absorbing their chakra to increase his own power. 5. Sage Mode and Beyond: Similar to Goku's mastery of the Super Saiyan transformation, Naruto discovers the power of Sage Mode during his training with the toads at Mount Myoboku. This new form greatly enhances his strength, speed, and durability. 6. The Akatsuki Threat: When the Akatsuki organization begins capturing Tailed Beasts, Naruto becomes their prime target. Naruto, fueled by his training and immense power, confronts and defeats each member of the Akatsuki, showing the entire world his strength. 7. The Great Ninja War: With Naruto's immense power and the respect he has gained throughout the Elemental Nations, the Fourth Great Ninja War takes a different turn. Naruto, much like Goku taking on the role of Earth's protector, becomes the driving force behind the Allied Shinobi Forces, battling against the remaining Akatsuki members and Madara Uchiha. 8. God-Like Powers: In the midst of the war, Naruto taps into his inner potential and achieves a transformative power akin to Goku's Super Saiyan God or even Super Saiyan Blue. Naruto's new form pushes his limits even further, granting him god-like abilities to defeat Madara and Kaguya. 9. Peace and Hokage: With the war finally over, Naruto becomes the Seventh Hokage, uniting the villages and establishing a time of unprecedented peace throughout the ninja world.

He trains under Konoha's elite shinobi, including Kakashi, Tsunade, and even Orochimaru, who provide guidance to help him tap into his incredible power. 3.

His signature move becomes a devastating energy blast similar to Frieza's Death Ball. 4.

Naruto, fueled by his potent energy and determination, confronts Akatsuki members one by one, overpowering them and emerging victorious. 5. Sage of Six Paths: Naruto's encounter with the Sage of Six Paths is altered due to his heightened potential. Instead of being chosen as the reincarnation of Asura, Naruto gains the attention of the Sage himself, who recognizes Naruto's extraordinary potential as an entirely new being. The Sage becomes Naruto's mentor, helping him unlock even greater power, akin to Frieza's Golden form. 6. Showdown with Sasuke: Naruto's rivalry with Sasuke takes on a whole new dimension. Sasuke, driven by his desire for power and revenge, undergoes intense training himself to match Naruto's extraordinary abilities. The two engage in a spectacular battle, each demonstrating techniques of immense power and destructive potential. 7. World Threat: A new external threat emerges as a villain seeking the power within Naruto. This antagonist possesses the might of ancient gods or celestial beings that Naruto must surpass to protect the ninja world. Their clashes result in cataclysmic battles, where Naruto pushes the limits of his power further, tapping into new forms and abilities. 8. Legacy of Power: With his tremendous power and his dedication to protecting the world, Naruto becomes an iconic figure, an inspiration to future generations.

[5] The mood of the scene is one of pure happiness and innocence. The child's joy is contagious, and the colorful balloons add a sense of whimsy and magic to the scene. The atmosphere is light and carefree, capturing the essence of childhood wonder and play. [6] This prompt would be realized in an illustrative style, with bold lines and vibrant colors. The image would have a slightly dreamlike quality, with the colors of the balloons and the child's expression standing out against a softer, more muted background. [7] The scene evokes a sense of nostalgia and warmth, reminiscent of cherished childhood memories. The viewer can almost feel the weightlessness of the balloons and the excitement of the child's laughter. --ar 16:9 --v 5."},{"instruction":"(In the deserts of Scorched Earth…) [player]: “Ugh…where am I?” (The player is walking around the deserts of Scorched Earth.

The housing market is closely tied to the overall economic condition, as it reflects the demand and affordability of homes. During times of economic growth, there is typically increased demand for housing, leading to rising home prices and a robust real estate market. Conversely, during economic downturns, the housing market usually experiences a decline in demand, resulting in lower home prices and a slowdown in real estate activities. Therefore, monitoring the housing market can give valuable insights into the state of the economy. Similarly, rent in certain cities can also be a useful indicator. High rental rates often indicate a strong demand for housing in that area, which can be driven by factors like job opportunities, population growth, and overall economic prosperity. Rising rents can suggest economic growth in that city, attracting more people and businesses. On the other hand, stagnant or decreasing rental prices might indicate a weaker economy or oversupply of rental units. By tracking rent trends in specific cities or regions, analysts can gather information about the local economic conditions. Both the housing market and rental rates provide valuable data points to evaluate the strength or weakness of the economy and are widely used by economists and policymakers to assess economic conditions."},{"instruction":"帮我想想几款爆品文章","output":"1. \\"10个让你每天都有好心情的小习惯\\" - 这篇文章可以介绍一些简单易行的习惯，可以帮助读者提升心情和生活质量。 2. \\"5种超级食物，助你拥有强大的免疫力\\" - 这篇文章可以介绍一些具有抗氧化和营养丰富的食物，可以帮助读者提高免疫力和保持健康。 3. \\"如何有效提高工作效率，轻松应对繁忙的工作\\" - 这篇文章可以提供实用的建议和技巧，帮助读者在工作中更加高效和有条理，减少压力和疲劳。 4. \\"7种方法，让你的家变得更温馨和舒适\\" - 这篇文章可以介绍一些简单易行的家居装饰和布置方法，帮助读者打造一个温馨舒适的家庭环境。 5. \\"如何培养积极乐观的心态，迎接人生挑战\\" - 这篇文章可以分享一些积极心态的培养方法和经验，帮助读者面对挑战时更加乐观和积极。"},{"instruction":"make a voice cast for an animated X-men film","output":"Sure!

Большинство изображений были в полной тьме, но некоторые из них показывали небольшое количество света. Интересно, что сенсоры, установленные на зонде, не регистрировали присутствие фотонов. Однако через несколько секунд связь с зондом была потеряна. Позже, после выхода из Пустоты, связь с зондом восстановилась. Полученные данные будут важны для предотвращения потери связи в будущих миссиях. Эксперимент 15/2 | 17 июля 2395 года ET После анализа Внутренней Нейросетью был найден способ сохранять связь с Землёй в Пустоте и оставаться там дольше. Новый зонд был отправлен в нужную область. На протяжении нескольких часов не поступало никаких новых данных. Однако зонд затем перешёл в другое место, которое мы теперь называем Межпространство. Там было сделано несколько фотографий и получено множество полезной информации о Пустоте и Межпространстве. В ближайшие месяцы предстоит модернизация всех космических кораблей. Постройка VRSC | 5 августа 2395 года - 11 февраля 2396 ET Мы выбрали орбиту Проксимы Центавры d в качестве места строительства Космического Центра Воссоздания Пустоты. Мы потратили множество месяцев на этом комплексе с использованием Внутренней Нейросети, пытаясь создать Пустоту. 11 февраля всё было готово к запуску. Проверка 93/1 | 11 февраля 2396 ET Мы запустили создание Пустоты. В первые минуты всё шло хорошо, но затем начали появляться неожиданные явления. То, что прежде казалось тёмной ничего, начало окрашиваться в тёмно-синий цвет, и стали видны контуры ландшафта. Мы также заметили силуэты, похожие на астероиды. После множества экспериментов мы решили выключить генераторы, но Пустота оставалась и не исчезала. Путем дальнейших исследований мы выяснили, что ее можно устранить, выключив свет в комнате с Пустотой. Изучение 7/1 | 14 февраля 2396 ET После предыдущих экспериментов настало время отправить пилотируемую миссию в Пустоту и Межпространство. Наше государство для нас купили космический корабль у Конфедерации Силы, мы погрузили на него всё необходимое и открыли портал в Пустоту. Основываясь на прошлых опытах корабль запустил двигатели чтобы быстрее оказаться в Межпространстве. После выхода Меридиан был в нужной нам системе Авелис. Там мы основали первую колонию на Aquaria.

В первую очередь, применялись астрономические наблюдения и изучение данных, полученных с помощью телескопов и космических аппаратов. Астрономы анализировали координаты звезд и планет в близлежащих системах и использовали их для определения положения системы Авелис относительно Земли. Кроме того, использовались данные о распределении галактик и каталоги звезд, которые помогли установить примерное положение системы в самой галактике. Отображение и моделирование галактических структур и их движения также были важными инструментами для определения местоположения системы Авелис. Исследователи также использовали специализированные программы и базы данных, которые содержат информацию о различных объектах в галактике. Это помогло уточнить положение системы Авелис и определить ее относительно других известных систем.

Here's how it could have unfolded: 1. Early Years: Naruto would still grow up as an orphan, ostracized from the village due to the Nine-Tails fox sealed inside him. However, he would possess an innate talent for combat, similar to Frieza. The Hokage and the village elders would immediately recognize his immense potential and train him as a weapon. 2. Academy and Early Genin Years: Naruto would quickly outshine all his peers in the ninja academy, displaying incredible power and mastering jutsus effortlessly. His abilities, combined with Frieza-like potential, would make him the center of attention within the village. The other Genin, including Sasuke and Sakura, would likely struggle to keep up with his progress. 3. Chuunin Exams: Naruto's power would easily surpass the abilities of most competitors in the Chuunin exams. He would single-handedly defeat powerful opponents from other villages, including Gaara, the Jinchuriki of the One-Tail. The village would now see Naruto as a deadly asset and would aim to utilize him to further their goals. 4. Retrieval Arc: When Sasuke leaves the village, seeking power from Orochimaru, Naruto would be tasked with bringing him back at any cost. With his Friezalike potential, he would successfully track Sasuke down, overpower him, and force him to return to Konoha, against his will. 5. Akatsuki and World Threats: The Akatsuki would be fully aware of Naruto's incredible potential and would plot to capture him. This time, however, Naruto would be more than a match for them. He would defeat powerful Akatsuki members like Itachi, Kisame, and others on his own, eliminating the threat they posed. 6. War Arc: As the Fourth Great Ninja War looms, Naruto's extraordinary abilities would become instrumental in the battle against Obito, Madara, and Kaguya. He would single-handedly take down armies of Zetsu clones and overpower the Ten-Tails, ultimately annihilating Kaguya and saving the world. 7. Hokage and Village Leadership: With his Frieza-like potential and extraordinary victories, Naruto would be hailed as a hero of the village. He would ascend to the position of Hokage, leading the village into an era of unmatched power and prosperity. However, Naruto's immense power and potential might come with a price. Similar to Frieza, his powers could corrupt him, making him arrogant and tyrannical. This would lead to conflicts with his friends and allies and could potentially result in darker consequences for the Naruto world. Overall, Naruto's journey would be filled with astonishing feats and immense power struggles, showcasing the true extent of his Frieza-like potential."},{"instruction":"naruto alternate storyline: What if Naruto had frieza potential part 1 Early Years","output":"In this alternate storyline, if Naruto had Frieza potential, the early years of his life would have been quite different. Here's how it could have unfolded: 1. Revealing Naruto's Potential: Instead of being seen as a troublemaker and an outcast, Naruto would be recognized for his immense latent power from a young age. The village elders and the Hokage would notice his extraordinary abilities and immediately begin training him to harness and control his potential. 2. Specialized Training: Naruto's training would be far more intense and focused compared to his original storyline. The Hidden Leaf Village would assign elite and experienced shinobi as his mentors to help him reach his full potential. He would be trained in various combat techniques, including taijutsu, ninjutsu, and genjutsu. 3. Mastery of Chakra Control: Since Frieza's potential lies in his ability to utilize and control energy, Naruto's training would heavily focus on chakra control. He would excel in this aspect, quickly mastering advanced chakra control techniques like tree climbing and water walking without any difficulty. 4. Accelerated Growth: Naruto's Frieza-like potential would accelerate his growth and development both physically and mentally. He would rapidly surpass his peers in terms of strength, speed, and overall combat prowess. His progress would far outstrip that of his classmates, including Sasuke and Sakura. 5. Extraordinary Jutsu Abilities: Naruto's Frieza potential would grant him an incredible repertoire of jutsus. He could effortlessly learn and master complex and high-level jutsus, such as Rasengan, Shadow Clone Technique, and even forbidden techniques like the Flying Thunder God Technique. 6. Recognition and Respect: Instead of being shunned and ignored, Naruto would gain the respect and admiration of the village early on. The villagers would begin to view him as a prodigy and potential savior, considering his immense power and potential threat. 7. Struggles and Isolation: Despite Naruto's incredible potential, he would still face internal struggles and feelings of isolation. The immense power within him could be overwhelming, making it difficult for him to relate to his peers and find genuine connections. This emotional turmoil would add depth to his character.

Most of the images were in total darkness, but a few showed a small amount of light. Interestingly, the sensors on the probe did not register the presence of photons. However, after a few seconds, communication with the probe was lost. Later, after leaving the Void, communication with the probe was restored. The data obtained will be important to prevent loss of communication in future missions. Experiment 15/2 | July 17, 2395 ET After analysis by the Inner Neural Network, a way was found to maintain communication with Earth in the Void and stay there longer. A new probe was sent to the right area. No new data was received for several hours. However, the probe then traveled to another location, which we now call Interdimensional Space. There, several photographs were taken and a lot of useful information about the Void and Interspace was obtained. In the coming months, all spacecraft are to be upgraded. VRSC construction | August 5, 2395 - February 11, 2396 ET We have chosen the orbit of Proxima Centauri d as the site for the construction of the Void Recreation Space Center. We spent many months on this complex using the Inner Neural Network trying to create the Void. On February 11, everything was ready for launch. Testing 93/1 | February 11, 2396 ET We launched the creation of the Void. Everything went well for the first few minutes, but then unexpected phenomena began to appear. What previously appeared to be dark nothing began to turn a dark blue color, and the contours of the landscape became visible. We also noticed silhouettes that looked like asteroids. After many experiments, we decided to turn off the generators, but the Void remained and did not disappear. Through further research we found out that it could be eliminated by turning off the lights in the room with the Void. Exploration 7/1 | February 14, 2396 ET After the previous experiments, it was time to send a manned mission to the Void and Interspace. Our government bought a spaceship for us from the Force Confederation, we loaded everything we needed on it and opened a portal to the Void. Based on past experiences, the ship started its engines to get to Interspace faster. After exiting, the Meridian was in the Avelis system we needed. There we established the first colony on Aquaria. Thus began the First Exploration mission.","output":"The First Exploration mission embarked on a journey into the unknown, venturing into the depths of the Void and Interspace on February 14, 2396 ET. With a spaceship obtained from the Force Confederation, the Meridian, laden with essential supplies and equipped with advanced technology, set forth on a daring expedition that would forever alter the course of human understanding. As the ship traversed the portal leading to the enigmatic Void, a sense of trepidation mingled with excitement among the crew. The voidless expanse enveloped them, its impenetrable darkness pressing against the ship's hull. Guided solely by the flickering lights on their control panels, their senses were heightened, prepared to witness phenomena yet unseen by human eyes. Drifting farther into the inky depths, the Meridian seemed to exist in a realm untouched by light and reality. Picturesque darkness marred only by defying fragments of ethereal illumination dotted the otherwise impenetrable nothingness. Astonishingly, though, the sensors failed to detect any trace of photons, leaving the crew perplexed and intrigued. But soon, an unforeseen turn of events disrupted the tranquility of their expedition. Communication with the probe was abruptly severed, leaving the crew disconnected from the beacon of the Meridian amidst the unfathomable void. Moments of disarray gave way to a persistent determination to restore contact, as the crew understood the significance of the data that had been captured during those fleeting moments. After finally emerging from the clutches of the Void, communication with the probe was miraculously reestablished. The precious data obtained from this momentary connection held invaluable insights, serving as a guidepost for future missions to overcome the obstacle of communication loss within the perplexing confines of the Void. Undeterred by their initial setbacks, the scientific community rallied in pursuit of an improved approach to unraveling the mysteries of the Void. The Inner Neural Network dissected the acquired data, illuminating a potential breakthrough in sustaining communication within the Void itself. Armed with newfound knowledge, a renewed conviction bloomed, leading to the launch of a new probe specifically designed to endure the extremities of this enigmatic abyss. Mirroring the explorative spirit of the First Exploration mission, the new probe ventured into the precise region where the void's secrets hid, their unveiling a tantalizing prospect. Hours ticked by, and anticipation heightened until the probe abruptly shifted course, transcending the boundaries of the Void and venturing into Interdimensional Space. A wealth of awe-inspiring photographs and invaluable knowledge awaited the diligent scientists on Earth's threshold. Months of meticulous analysis and extensive upgrades ensued, as the collective intelligence of humanity strove to comprehend the intricacies of the Interspace and Void. The Void Recreation Space Center (VRSC) began construction, its orbit around Proxima Centauri d selected as the optimal location for further experimentation. Countless hours were spent within the Inner Neural Network's expansive reaches, meticulously crafting an experience that mirrored the elusive Void's essence. On that monumental day, August 5, 2395, the VRSC stood as a testament to human ingenuity and insatiable curiosity. Its completion marked a pivotal moment in mankind's quest for knowledge, enabling the replication of the Void's enigma in order to explore its depths within the controlled confines of the recreated space. Through the endeavors of the First Exploration mission and the tireless pursuit of understanding, the uncharted realms of the Void and Interspace beckoned humanity forward. United by an indomitable spirit, they would continue pushing boundaries, unraveling the mysteries of the cosmos, one exploration at a time."},{"instruction":"Social and environmental issues with the cause and effect in the Eastern Cape South Africa","output":"Social Issues: 1.

Température de la crème: Si la crème fleurette a été stockée dans un endroit froid, elle peut devenir plus épaisse en raison du froid. Assurez-vous de laisser la crème à température ambiante avant de l'utiliser. 2. Teneur en matières grasses: La crème fleurette a une teneur élevée en matières grasses, ce qui peut la rendre plus épaisse. Si vous utilisez une crème avec une teneur élevée en matières grasses, elle sera naturellement plus épaisse. 3. Battage excessif: Si vous battez trop la crème, elle peut devenir trop épaisse. Il est important de battre la crème juste assez pour obtenir la consistance souhaitée, sans en faire trop. 4. Vieillissement de la crème: Si la crème fleurette est expirée ou a été stockée pendant une longue période, elle peut se détériorer et devenir plus épaisse. Assurez-vous de vérifier la date de péremption et utilisez toujours de la crème fraîche. 5. Acidité: Si vous ajoutez un ingrédient acide, comme du jus de citron, à la crème fleurette, cela peut provoquer une réaction qui épaissit la crème. Il est préférable d'éviter d'ajouter des ingrédients acides à la crème si vous voulez qu'elle reste légèrement liquide.

Most of the images were in total darkness, but a few showed a small amount of light. Interestingly, the sensors on the probe did not register the presence of photons. However, after a few seconds, communication with the probe was lost. Later, after leaving the Void, communication with the probe was restored. The data obtained will be important to prevent loss of communication in future missions. Experiment 15/2 | July 17, 2395 ET After analysis by the Inner Neural Network, a way was found to maintain communication with Earth in the Void and stay there longer. A new probe was sent to the right area. No new data was received for several hours. However, the probe then traveled to another location, which we now call Interdimensional Space.

What previously appeared to be dark nothing began to turn a dark blue color, and the contours of the landscape became visible. We also noticed silhouettes that looked like asteroids. After many experiments, we decided to turn off the generators, but the Void remained and did not disappear. Through further research we found out that it could be eliminated by turning off the lights in the room with the Void. Exploration 7/1 | February 14, 2396 ET After the previous experiments, it was time to send a manned mission to the Void and Interspace. Our government bought a spaceship for us from the Force Confederation, we loaded everything we needed on it and opened a portal to the Void.

Почему для некоторых наборов коэффициентов эта сумма больше, а для некоторых меньше?","output":"Рассмотрим два примера: Пример 1: коэффициенты 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 Минимальный коэффициент - 2. Пусть X - сумма ставки. Минимально возможный выигрыш будет 2*X. Для обеспечения выигрыша в любом случае, ставки на остальные коэффициенты должны быть равны X/5, так как умножение на 5 это только возврат ставки. При этом сумма ставок будет 2*X + 5*(X/5) = 2*X + X = 3*X. То есть, сумма ставок равна 3*X, что меньше минимального возможного выигрыша 2*X. Значит, такой набор коэффициентов можно обыграть. Пример 2: коэффициенты 2, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9 Минимальный коэффициент - 2. Пусть X - сумма ставки. Минимально возможный выигрыш будет 2*X. Для обеспечения выигрыша в любом случае, ставки на остальные коэффициенты должны быть равны X/9. При этом сумма ставок будет 2*X + 5*(X/9) = 2*X + (5/9)*X = (23/9)*X. Значит, сумма ставок равна (23/9)*X, что больше минимального возможного выигрыша 2*X. Значит, такой набор коэффициентов нельзя обыграть. Из примеров видно, что возможность обыграть коэффициенты зависит от соотношения суммы ставок и минимального возможного выигрыша. Если сумма ставок меньше минимального выигрыша, то набор коэффициентов можно обыграть, иначе нельзя. Варианты, где коэффициенты 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, можно обыграть, потому что сумма ставок (3*X) меньше минимального возможного выигрыша (2*X). Варианты, где коэффициенты 2, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, нельзя обыграть, потому что сумма ставок ((23/9)*X) больше минимального возможного выигрыша (2*X)."},{"instruction":"Всё верно. Но почему так происходит? Объясни с математической точки зрения. Как я могу быстро определить, возможно ли обыграть тот набор что передо мной находится? Помимо этого, приведи пример обыгрываемых коэффициентов, но с 6 ни разу не повторяющимися числами.","output":"Из математической точки зрения, можно объяснить так: Пусть коэффициенты задаются как a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, где a1 - минимальный коэффициент. Для того чтобы обеспечить выигрыш в любом случае, сумма ставок на каждый коэффициент должна быть такой, чтобы при выпадении этого коэффициента сумма выигрыша была равна или превышала сумму ставок. Обозначим X как сумму ставки. Минимально возможный выигрыш будет a1*X. Произведение a1*a2*a3*a4*a5*a6 может быть записано как (a1^5)*a2. Так как a1 является минимальным коэффициентом, то (a1^5) и a2 играют важную роль в определении возможности обыгрывания набора коэффициентов. Если (a1^5)*a2 ≥ X, то сумма ставок будет равна a1*X + 5(X/a2) = (a1^5)*X/a2 + 5*X/a2 = ((a1^5) + 5)*X/a2, и эта сумма ставок будет больше или равна минимальному возможному выигрышу a1*X. В этом случае набор коэффициентов будет \\"нельзя обыграть\\". Если (a1^5)*a2 < X, то сумма ставок будет меньше минимального возможного выигрыша, и набор коэффициентов будет \\"можно обыграть\\". Пример обыгрываемых коэффициентов, где все числа различные: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Минимальный коэффициент a1 = 1. Минимальный возможный выигрыш a1*X = X. Для обеспечения выигрыша в любом случае, сумма ставок на каждый коэффициент должна быть X/число. Сумма ставок будет равна X + (X/2) + (X/3) + (X/4) + (X/5) + (X/6) = X*(1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 + 1/6) ≈ 2.45*X Так как сумма ставок (2.45*X) меньше минимального возможного выигрыша (X), этот набор коэффициентов можно обыграть."},{"instruction":"Ладно, в моем случае просто не может быть выигрышных коэффициентов, ведь наборы всегда одни и теже - \\"2 4 8 10 15 100 2 5 8 10 16 21 3 3 5 10 20 30\\" Как я еще могу обыграть эту игру, хоть и не со 100% вероятностью, но приближающейся к хотя бы 75?","output":"Если наборы коэффициентов всегда одни и те же и не предоставляют возможности для обыгрыша в 100% случаях, то добиться точности выше 75% может быть сложно. Однако, можно попробовать следующую стратегию: 1. Анализировать и изучить предложенные наборы коэффициентов. Определить, есть ли возможности для обыгрыша в некоторых случаях. 2. Фокусироваться на более высоких коэффициентах, так как они имеют больший потенциальный выигрыш. Например, в наборе \\"2 5 8 10 16 21\\" ставить больше денег на числа 16 и 21, потому что умножение на них дает больший выигрыш. 3. Делать ставки не равными на все коэффициенты, а распределять ставки в соответствии с их потенциальным выигрышем. Например, ставить больше денег на коэффициенты, где возможен более высокий выигрыш. 4. Ограничиться определенным количеством попыток. Если за определенное количество попыток не удается достичь желаемого процента прибыли, то лучше прекратить игру и не продолжать терять деньги. Это только некоторые идеи и стратегии, которые могут помочь приблизиться к желаемому проценту прибыли. Важно помнить, что игры с подобными случайными коэффициентами могут быть непредсказуемыми и результат может быть случайным."},{"instruction":"(In Scorched Earth's wyvern trench...)

Инициализируйте графическую библиотеку, которую вы используете с ImGUI. Например, откройте окно с прозрачным фоном. 2. Создайте контекст ImGUI с использованием функции \`ImGui::CreateContext()\`. Если вы уже используете контекст ImGUI, просто избегайте повторной инициализации контекста. 3. Установите стиль ImGUI с помощью \`ImGui::StyleColorsTransparent()\`. Это сделает все элементы ImGUI прозрачными. 4. В цикле рендеринга вставьте свой код ImGUI для создания нужного пользовательского интерфейса.

When it comes to quiet quitting, individuals may draw hard lines by clearly defining what they are no longer willing to tolerate or invest their energy in. This can involve deciding not to engage in certain activities or relationships that no longer serve them. 2. \\"To go the extra mile\\": This expression denotes putting in additional effort or going beyond what is expected or required. In the context of quiet quitting, it can refer to the decision to stay committed and give one's best even when faced with challenges or obstacles. However, it may also involve recognizing when going the extra mile is no longer worth it and choosing to quietly quit something that does not yield satisfactory outcomes. 3. \\"To afford to (do) something\\": This phrase implies having the means, resources, or capacity to do something. In relation to quiet quitting, it suggests assessing whether one can afford to continue investing time, energy, or resources into a particular endeavor. If the costs outweigh the benefits or become unsustainable, individuals may choose to quietly quit and reallocate their resources elsewhere."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Most of the images were in total darkness, but a few showed a small amount of light. Interestingly, the sensors on the probe did not register the presence of photons. However, after a few seconds, communication with the probe was lost. Later, after leaving the Void, communication with the probe was restored. The data obtained will be important to prevent loss of communication in future missions. Experiment 15/2 | July 17, 2395 ET After analysis by the Inner Neural Network, a way was found to maintain communication with Earth in the Void and stay there longer. A new probe was sent to the right area. No new data was received for several hours. However, the probe then traveled to another location, which we now call Interdimensional Space. There, several photographs were taken and a lot of useful information about the Void and Interspace was obtained. In the coming months, all spacecraft are to be upgraded. VRSC construction | August 5, 2395 - February 11, 2396 ET We have chosen the orbit of Proxima Centauri d as the site for the construction of the Void Recreation Space Center. We spent many months on this complex using the Inner Neural Network trying to create the Void. On February 11, everything was ready for launch. Testing 93/1 | February 11, 2396 ET We launched the creation of the Void. Everything went well for the first few minutes, but then unexpected phenomena began to appear. What previously appeared to be dark nothing began to turn a dark blue color, and the contours of the landscape became visible. We also noticed silhouettes that looked like asteroids. After many experiments, we decided to turn off the generators, but the Void remained and did not disappear. Through further research we found out that it could be eliminated by turning off the lights in the room with the Void. Exploration 7/1 | February 14, 2396 ET After the previous experiments, it was time to send a manned mission to the Void and Interspace. Our government bought a spaceship for us from the Force Confederation, we loaded everything we needed on it and opened a portal to the Void. Based on past experiences, the ship started its engines to get to Interspace faster. After exiting, the Meridian was in the Avelis system we needed. There we established the first colony on Aquaria. Thus began the First Exploration mission.","output":"Interspace is a term used to describe the intriguing region between dimensions known as the Void and the newly discovered Interdimensional Space. This enigmatic area has captivated the scientific community due to its unique properties and potential for groundbreaking discoveries. The initial foray into Interspace began with Experiment 15/1 on May 2, 2395 ET. A probe was successfully launched into the Void, where it remained for a brief period before losing communication with Earth. Although most images captured by the probe were shrouded in darkness, a few unveiled a faint glimmer of light. Strangely, despite the presence of visible light, the probe's sensors did not register the existence of photons. The subsequent restoration of communication upon exiting the Void allowed researchers to gather invaluable data, contributing to future missions' communication stability. Experiment 15/2, conducted on July 17, 2395 ET, marked a significant breakthrough. Analysis by the Inner Neural Network yielded a method to maintain communication within the Void and prolong the probe's stay. Consequently, a new probe was dispatched to the designated region, but initially, no data transmission occurred. Surprisingly, the probe then propelled itself to another realm labeled Interdimensional Space. Within this uncharted territory, the probe employed its camera to capture numerous photographs, granting scientists a wealth of crucial information concerning the Void and Interspace. In response to these findings, plans were implemented to upgrade all future spacecraft accordingly. The construction of the Void Recreation Space Center (VRSC) commenced on August 5, 2395 ET, and concluded on February 11, 2396 ET. After meticulous calculations utilizing the Inner Neural Network, Proxima Centauri d was selected as the optimal orbit to establish this complex. Engaging in months of laborious preparation, researchers aimed to simulate the Void within the VRSC. On February 11, the project reached its culmination, with the facility primed for launch. Testing 93/1 commenced on February 11, 2396 ET. Initially progressing smoothly, this experiment soon encountered unexpected phenomena. The supposed darkness of the Void assumed an enigmatic dark blue hue, revealing discernible landscape contours. Intriguingly, silhouettes reminiscent of asteroids materialized within this transformed Void. Although endeavors to counter these anomalies by shutting down the generators proved futile, discontinuing the illumination in the Void's vicinity ultimately dissipated the peculiarities. Through extensive analyses, researchers revealed that this enigma could be controlled by manipulating the ambient lighting. Undeterred by the enigma, Exploration 7/1 commenced on February 14, 2396 ET, signifying humanity's first manned mission into the enigmatic Void and Interspace. Acquired through a government purchase from the Force Confederation, the spaceship, aptly named Meridian, embarked on this unprecedented expedition. Laden with essential supplies, the vessel initiated its engines to expedite its journey to Interspace. Exiting the Void, the Meridian found itself situated in the Avelis system, its intended destination. On the planet Aquaria, humanity established its inaugural colony, marking the commencement of the First Exploration mission. With each new mission and experiment, the mystique of Interspace continues to unravel, promising a future replete with scientific advancements and extraordinary revelations waiting to be unveiled."},{"instruction":"(In Scorched Earth’s wyvern trench…) Fire Wyvern Girl: “Sorry for being late, everyone.” Lightning Wyvern Girl: “Took you long enough!” Poison Wyvern Girl: “Jeez, where WERE you?!” Ice Wyvern Girl: “I don’t mean to alarm anyone but…” (The Ice Wyvern girl points to a small puddle of water forming between her legs.)

Весь мир кажется погруженным в холод и безысходность - аллегория депрессии, которая царит в его сердце. Герой ощущает пустоту и потерю, не помня, кто он и откуда пришел. В борьбе с самим собой, герой постоянно подвергается атакам кошмаров, которые навязывает ему загадочное существо - Валак. Валак приходит к герою во сне и насыщает его ум кошмарами, призывая сдаться и бросить все. Герой пытается сопротивляться, но его сила и воля истощаются с каждым сном. В один из таких снов, герой встречает девочку-бабочку, которая называет себя Фарфалла. Фарфалла олицетворяет надежду и свет в этом мрачном мире. Она способна помочь герою, но только если он откроет ей свои переживания и расскажет о своей депрессии. При каждой встрече с Фарфаллой, герою открывается частичка его прошлого и он начинает понимать, что ему нужно преодолеть, чтобы найти себя и излечиться. Путешествуя по мрачному миру, герой пытается собрать обрывки своих воспоминаний, но все его усилия терпят неудачу. Эта борьба с самим собой становится все сложнее и герой почти сдается на момент, когда вновь появляется Фарфалла. Она проницательна и понимает, что герой не рассказал ей о своих настоящих переживаниях, именно поэтому его усилия были напрасными. Фарфалла направляет героя в нужном направлении, но подчеркнув, что его успех зависит от его собственной откровенности. В конце пути, герой собирает все силы воедино и открывается перед Фарфаллой. Он рассказывает ей о своих самых глубоких переживаниях и борьбе с депрессией. Это становится ключом к его освобождению и излечению. Погруженный в свет и надежду, герой преодолевает все трудности и находит свое истинное \\"Я\\". Он осознает, что самые мрачные моменты в его жизни могут быть преодолены с помощью внутренней силы и взаимодействия с окружающими. Таким образом, визуальная новелла рассказывает историю о поиске себя в мире, окутанном депрессией.

Most of the images were in total darkness, but a few showed a small amount of light. Interestingly, the sensors on the probe did not register the presence of photons. However, after a few seconds, communication with the probe was lost. Later, after leaving the Void, communication with the probe was restored. The data obtained will be important to prevent loss of communication in future missions. Experiment 15/2 | July 17, 2395 ET After analysis by the Inner Neural Network, a way was found to maintain communication with Earth in the Void and stay there longer. A new probe was sent to the right area. No new data was received for several hours. However, the probe then traveled to another location, which we now call Interdimensional Space. There, several photographs were taken and a lot of useful information about the Void and Interspace was obtained. In the coming months, all spacecraft are to be upgraded. VRSC construction | August 5, 2395 - February 11, 2396 ET We have chosen the orbit of Proxima Centauri d as the site for the construction of the Void Recreation Space Center. We spent many months on this complex using the Inner Neural Network trying to create the Void. On February 11, everything was ready for launch. Testing 93/1 | February 11, 2396 ET We launched the creation of the Void. Everything went well for the first few minutes, but then unexpected phenomena began to appear. What previously appeared to be dark nothing began to turn a dark blue color, and the contours of the landscape became visible. We also noticed silhouettes that looked like asteroids. After many experiments, we decided to turn off the generators, but the Void remained and did not disappear. Through further research we found out that it could be eliminated by turning off the lights in the room with the Void. Exploration 7/1 | February 14, 2396 ET After the previous experiments, it was time to send a manned mission to the Void and Interspace. Our government bought a spaceship for us from the Force Confederation, we loaded everything we needed on it and opened a portal to the Void. Based on past experiences, the ship started its engines to get to Interspace faster. After exiting, the Meridian was in the Avelis system we needed. There we established the first colony on Aquaria. Thus began the First Exploration mission. Write how do you think why does the Void could be eliminated by turning off the lights in the room","output":"One possible explanation for why turning off the lights in the room could eliminate the Void is that the creation of the Void itself is dependent on the presence of light. The experimental setup may involve some kind of equipment or process that utilizes light to generate and maintain the Void. By turning off the lights, the source of the light necessary for the creation of the Void is removed, causing it to disappear. This suggests that light plays a crucial role in either initiating or sustaining the Void, and without it, the Void cannot be maintained."},{"instruction":"Write an excel macro that will highlight duplicated cells","output":"Sure!

Additionally, since the two theories have discrepancies in their predicted results, the proposed study aims to determine which model better explains the phenomenon of perceptual asymmetries."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:q,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},D={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},L={key:0,class:"empty-state"},M=["disabled"],P={key:0},N={key:1};function G(n,e,l,p,o,r){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",D,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),t("div",j,[(a(!0),i(b,null,w(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),k(m,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",L,' No results found for "'+c(o.searchQuery)+'".
