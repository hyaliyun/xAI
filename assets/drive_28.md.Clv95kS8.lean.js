Norman Sterns and Leela Sterns are newlyweds who are driving from their home in New York City to Los Angeles. They become lost and run out of gas, stranding them in the rural Ozark countryside. They meet a friendly paleontologist named Wayne Thomas. Wayne suggests that they visit the nearest farm that could provide gas. The farm is run by a strange man named Greely, who tells them that the gasoline truck was supposed to arrive the previous day, but since it didn't, he expects it there any minute. Greely suggests that they go inside to the parlor, where it's cooler. On the way up to the house, he asks if they know anybody out here, in case they may be waiting for them. They say no, and when they get inside, Greely goes off to tell his \\"housekeeper\\", Bella to make some iced tea. She argues with him on what he will \\"do with them\\", but Greely smacks her, and threatens that she will \\"take their place\\" if she doesn't serve them some tea. Thomas arrives and Greely goes outside. He tells them that their car won't start. Wayne decides to take a look at the engine and tells Greely to go back to his truck and get a tool. Greely instead beats him on the back of the head with it and drags his body off. Meanwhile, Leela appears to be worried about Greely, because he is acting strange and his eyes don't look right. She then compares his eyes to a stuffed lizard across the room. Greely comes back inside and tells them that he had to do a chore. Leela wants to go back outside, but Greely tells them that they could check out his \\"collection\\" while waiting for the truck.

USA TODAY      Red Sox right fielder Mookie Betts battles fans in the right field seats for a ball hit by the Astros' Jose Altuve. Umpires ruled the fans interfered with Betts and Altuve was called out. (Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports)      HOUSTON -- He won’t hide in anonymity like Steve Bartman, or be famous like Jeffrey Maier, but Troy Caldwell certainly will be forever known in Houston if the Astros don’t reach the World Series.      The Boston Red Sox made Caldwell infamous overnight Wednesday by knocking off the Astros, 8-6, and taking a commanding 3-1 lead in the American League Championship Series, with a replay review that may be debated forever in Texas.      Caldwell was just an anonymous Astros fan sitting in the first row of Section 152 in the right-field seats at Minute Maid Park. Jose Altuve hit a drive deep to right field. Caldwell jumped up and stuck out his hand, hoping to catch the ball. Red Sox right fielder Mookie Betts jumped high, trying to catch it himself. Caldwell’s hand knocked against Betts’ glove. No one caught the ball.      The sellout crowd of 43,277 went wild, believing it was a homer, and Caldwell started cheering himself.      Only for the stadium to watch in disbelief as right-field umpire Joe West shot his arm up in the air.      Out!      Caldwell stood in horror, screaming along with everyone else as they waited 3 minutes, 13 seconds - which seemed like an eternity - for the replay review.      The decision came. The call was confirmed: Spectator interference. Out.      Here’s Troy Caldwell. He was the fan who was ruled to have interfered with the Astros potential home run ball. “I’m going to need security to escort me out of here if the Astros don’t come back to win this.” pic.twitter.com/IXE2uEzSoW — Matt Young (@Chron_MattYoung) October 18, 2018      Replay after replay was shown on the huge scoreboard, and on TV sets across America, but it was virtually impossible to tell if the ball was over the fence or just short.      There was no conclusive evidence. The call stood, and the sellout crowd went berserk.      “After viewing all relevant angles,’’ MLB said in a statement, “the replay official could not definitely determine that the spectator failed to reach out of the stands and over the playing field, clearly preventing the fielder from catching the ball.      “The call stands, the batter is out.’’      The Astros were livid, with George Springer, who had been standing on first base, slamming his helmet to the ground.      “I’m not sure if Mookie makes that catch,’’ Astros manager A.J. Hinch said during an in-game interview on TBS. “He’s a great athlete, but how it’s an assumed out is unbelievable. …      “Jose paid kind of (the) ultimate price for something out of his control.’’      Caldwell, who did round after round of interviews for the next few innings, spent the rest of the game praying.      “I’ll need security to escort me out of here,’’ Caldwell told reporters, “if the Astros don’t come back to win this. … I promise you I didn’t do anything wrong.’’      MORE MLB:      Dodgers learn valuable lesson - they can win big without long ball      Clayton Kershaw dominates as Dodgers move to brink of World Series      Then again, neither did Bartman, who simply was trying to catch a foul ball in the stands in the eighth inning of Game 6 of the 2003 NLCS between the Cubs and Marlins, only to keep left fielder Moises Alou from catching the ball. The Cubs blew the lead, lost the game, and the series. Bartman, who was escorted from Wrigley Field and received death threats, was never again seen publicly, living his life in anonymity.      Maier, just a 12-year-old in 1996, reached over the wall in right field at Yankee Stadium in Game 1 of the ALCS. He snared Derek Jeter’s fly ball just as Baltimore Orioles right fielder Tony Tarasco waited at the wall to catch it.      There was no replay then, and right-field umpire Richie Garcia called it a homer. The Yankees won the game, the ALCS, and the World Series.      It was the start of a Yankees dynasty, and Maier became a hero in the Bronx.      The Astros did everything possible to make sure that Caldwell was neither hero nor goat in their zany back-and-forth game. The teams scored in every inning, and three times in the same inning, trading jabs like pugilists in a prize fight, with five different lead changes and ties.      The Red Sox know they will be facing Cy Young candidate Justin Verlander on Thursday for Game 5, while the Red Sox have no idea who they’ll be starting. They were scheduled to start ace Chris Sale, but he’s still weak, having lost weight after being hospitalized with stomach problems.      “He’s feeling better compared to [Tuesday],’’ manager Alex Cora said, “but physically he’s not there yet. So I think if necessary, he’ll pitch Game 6. He feels that he’ll be ready for that one.’’      And for Game 5?      “I’m learning very, very quick that in the playoffs,’’ Cora said, “you live for today.’’      Then again, the Red Sox may not even need Sale to pitch again until Tuesday, Oct. 23: Game 1 of the World Series, at Fenway Park, against the National League champions.

Then, he noticed that crew chief Joe West, who was manning the right-field line in Wednesday's critical Game 4 of the American League Championship Series, had called fan interference and ruled Altuve out.      COLUMNIST: Astros wronged by call on fan interference, only on HoustonChronicle.com      As a lengthy review dragged on, Caldwell had a sinking feeling that he might be in trouble.      The review upheld West's original call that Caldwell interfered with Red Sox rightfielder Mookie Betts. Just like that, a potential game-tying home run was ruled an out. Two batters later, the Red Sox got out of the inning without suffering any damage except for what Caldwell was experiencing in the front row of Section 152.      \\"I'm going to need security to escort me out of here if the Astros don't come back to win this,\\" said Caldwell, who grew up in Houston but currently lives in Atlanta and flew to town just for this game.      NOT ESPIONAGE: Astros were doing surveillance against Indians, Red Sox, MLB says      West said neither the ball nor Betts' glove had crossed the railing when the interference took place.      \\"Here's the whole play,\\" West said. \\"They hit the ball to right field, he (Betts) jumped up to try to make a catch, a fan interfered with him over the playing field. That is why I called spectator interference.\\"      Caldwell disagreed.      \\"I didn't reach over the wall; I was on this side of the line,\\" Caldwell said. \\"I don't understand what happened. I know the rules, and I didn't reach over the line.\\"      Rule 3.16 states that: \\"No interference shall be allowed when a fielder reaches over a fence\\" unless \\"it is clearly intentional.\\" West says that rule isn't applicable, because - in his view - Betts didn't reach into the stands.      \\"I think you know what I think of Joe West right about now,\\" Caldwell said.      At least early in Wednesday's game, Caldwell had the support of Astros fans sitting around him, who were busier yelling at West than they were bothering Caldwell.      Pinkerton's Barbecue sent out a tweet during the game urging fans around Caldwell to buy him a beer and offered him free barbecue.      \\"I promise you I didn't do anything wrong,\\" Caldwell said. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"In a baseball game, there was a play where a player named Jose Altuve hit a ball really high and far.

What is the best way to: What can I use to help hold LEDs in place when soldering them to jewelry?","output":"The best way to hold LEDs in place when soldering them to jewelry involves the following steps: 1. Gather necessary tools and materials: Before beginning the soldering process, gather all the required tools and materials, such as a soldering iron, solder, helping hands or a third hand tool, heat shrink tubing or electrical tape, wire strippers, small pliers, and a clean, heat-resistant workspace. 2. Determine LED placement: Decide where you would like to place the LEDs on the jewelry piece. Consider the overall design and aesthetic of the jewelry, as well as the functionality of the LEDs. 3. Secure the LED: To hold the LED in place during the soldering process, use a helping hand or third-hand tool. This tool typically features adjustable clamps and a weighted base, which allows for precise positioning and stability while soldering. If you do not have a helping hand, you can use other methods like placing the LED on a flat surface with a small piece of heat resistant tape to keep it stable. 4. Prepare the wires: Strip the ends of the wires that will be soldered to the LED terminals. If necessary, tin the stripped wire ends by applying a small amount of solder, which will make the soldering process easier and more efficient. 5. Apply heat shrink tubing or electrical tape: Cut small pieces of heat shrink tubing or electrical tape to insulate and protect the soldered connections. Slide the tubing or tape over the stripped wire ends before soldering. 6. Solder the wires to the LED: Using a soldering iron and solder, carefully connect the wires to the LED terminals. Be sure to follow proper soldering techniques, such as heating the joint to be soldered and not the solder itself, and allowing the solder to cool and solidify before moving or adjusting the connection. 7. Secure and insulate the connections: Once the solder has cooled and solidified, slide the heat shrink tubing or electrical tape over the soldered connections. Use a heat source, such as a heat gun or lighter, to shrink the tubing and create a secure, insulated connection. If using electrical tape, wrap it tightly around the soldered joint. 8. Test the LED: With the soldered connections secured and insulated, test the LED by connecting it to a power source. Ensure the LED lights up and functions properly. 9. Attach the LED to the jewelry: Once the LED is soldered and tested, attach it to the desired location on the jewelry piece. Use super glue or epoxy to secure the LED and wires discreetly, ensuring they do not compromise the overall design of the jewelry. By following these steps, you can securely solder and position LEDs on your jewelry while maintaining a clean and professional appearance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How does this change dogma?\\" is in \\"The papal bull defining the dogma, Ineffabilis Deus, mentioned in particular the patrististic interpretation of Genesis 3:15 as referring to a woman, Mary, who would be eternally at enmity with the evil serpent and completely triumphing over him.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence: \\"My heart is pounding.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","output":"A linguist would most likely rate the sentence, \\"My heart is pounding,\\" as acceptable linguistically, considering various factors such as grammaticality, semantics, pragmatics, and the sentence's place within a communicative context. Let's analyze each aspect in detail: 1. Grammaticality: Grammaticality refers to the adherence of a sentence to the rules of syntax, morphology, and phonology in a given language. In this case, the sentence follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure common in English sentences. It also conforms to morphological and phonological rules, as each word is easily identifiable and the sentence flows smoothly when spoken or read.  Subject: \\"My heart\\" – a noun phrase referring to the possession of the heart by the speaker Verb: \\"is pounding\\" – the verb \\"to pound\\" in the present continuous tense, showing ongoing action Object: There is no direct object in this sentence, but it is still considered a complete thought and is grammatically correct in the context of expressing a feeling or sensation. 2. Semantics: Semantics is the study of meaning in language and how language conveys meaning. In this sentence, the meaning is quite clear – the speaker is expressing that their heart is beating rapidly and forcefully, often implying strong emotions or physical exertion. The words and their arrangement in the sentence make logical sense and convey a concept that is easy to understand. 3. Pragmatics: Pragmatics studies how context influences language use and interpretation. Although the sentence can be read in isolation and still be considered linguistically acceptable, additional context would help the reader or listener understand the reason behind the speaker's pounding heart. For example, the speaker might be nervous, excited, or physically strained, which caused their heart to pound. Nevertheless, the sentence stands on its own and can be feasibly used in various contexts. 4. Communicative context: The sentence \\"My heart is pounding\\" might appear in different communicative contexts such as spoken or written language, in both formal and informal settings. As a stand-alone sentence, it is more likely to be found in less formal contexts like casual conversations, personal narratives, or social media posts. That said, the sentence could still be integrated into more formal contexts, such as a character's dialogue in a literary work or an individual's personal testimony or report. In conclusion, a linguist would likely find the sentence \\"My heart is pounding\\" to be acceptable linguistically, as it adheres to grammatical rules, has a clear meaning, functions well in a variety of contexts, and can be utilized in diverse communicative situations. However, understanding the specific context in which the sentence is used would undoubtedly enrich the interpretation and provide deeper insights into the speaker's intended message."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Born in Cherryvale, Kansas, Louise Brooks was the daughter of Leonard Porter Brooks, a lawyer, who was usually too busy with his practice to discipline his children, and Myra Rude, an artistic mother who determined that any \\"squalling brats she produced could take care of themselves\\". Rude was a talented pianist who played the latest Debussy and Ravel for her children, inspiring them with a love of books and music. When she was nine years old, a neighborhood predator sexually abused Louise. This event had a major influence on Brooks' life and career, causing her to say in later years that she was incapable of real love, and that this man \\"must have had a great deal to do with forming my attitude toward sexual pleasure.... Brooks made her screen debut in the silent The Street of Forgotten Men, in an uncredited role in 1925. Soon, however, she was playing the female lead in a number of silent light comedies and flapper films over the next few years, starring with Adolphe Menjou and W. C. Fields, among others.  She was noticed in Europe for her pivotal vamp role in the Howard Hawks directed silent \\"buddy film\\", A Girl in Every Port in 1928.  In an early sound film drama, Beggars of Life (1928), Brooks played an abused country girl who kills her foster father in a moment of desperation. A hobo, Richard Arlen, happens on the murder scene and convinces Brooks to disguise herself as a young boy and escape the law by \\"riding the rails\\" with him. In a hobo encampment, or \\"jungle,\\" they meet another hobo, Wallace Beery. Brooks's disguise is soon uncovered and she finds herself the only female in a world of brutal, sex-hungry men. Much of this film was shot on location, and the boom microphone was invented for this film by the director William Wellman, who needed it for one of the first experimental talking scenes in the movies.  By this time in her life, she was mixing with the rich and famous, and was a regular guest of William Randolph Hearst and his mistress, Marion Davies, at San Simeon, being close friends with Davies' niece, Pepi Lederer. Her distinctive bob haircut helped start a trend; many women styled their hair in imitation of her and fellow film star Colleen Moore. Soon after the film Beggars Of Life was made, Brooks, who loathed the Hollywood \\"scene\\", refused to stay on at Paramount after being denied a promised raise, and left for Europe to make films for G. W. Pabst, the prominent Austrian Expressionist director.  Paramount attempted to use the coming of sound films to pressure the actress, but she called the studio's bluff. It was not until 30 years later that this rebellious move would come to be seen as arguably the most savvy of her career, securing her immortality as a silent film legend and independent spirit. Unfortunately, while her initial snubbing of Paramount alone would not have finished her in Hollywood altogether, her refusal after returning from Germany to come back to Paramount for sound retakes of The Canary Murder Case (1929) irrevocably placed her on an unofficial blacklist. Actress Margaret Livingston was hired to dub Brooks's voice for the film, as the studio claimed that Brooks' voice was unsuitable for sound pictures.

Paragraph: Inflammation in arteries has been associated with an increased risk of stroke. Inflammation and emboli, or small blood clots, were significantly reduced in patients treated with 80 milligrams of Lipitor compared with those who received 10 mg of the drug each day for 12 weeks, said researchers, who presented the data at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting on Monday. The study divided 40 patients with diseased carotid arteries into the two groups. The artery was examined for changes in inflammation at six weeks and 12 weeks using a unique contrast agent with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While the 80 mg Lipitor, known generically as atorvastatin, reduced inflammation, researchers appeared even more enthusiastic about the technique used to measure the results. The arteries were viewed using Ultra Small Particles of Iron Oxide, or USPIO-enhanced, high-resolution MRI. “The real star of this study is this new way of imaging, which allows you to zero in on what is actually going on in these arteries,” said Dr Jonathan Gillard, one of the study’s lead researchers. The study demonstrates that if you treat patients who have inflammation of the carotid artery with “a high dose of atorvastatin, you substantially reduce the amount of inflammation and risk of stroke, whereas low dose atorvastatin does not reduce risk,” Gillard said. “Thanks to this imaging technique, we can now figure out which patients need the aggressive treatment before we begin our therapy,” he added. Lipitor, which lowers levels of LDL, or bad, cholesterol in the blood, is the world’s top-selling prescription medicine with some 12 billion in annual sales. Claim: High dose Lipitor reduces artery inflammation: study.","output":"The study shows that high dose Lipitor (80 mg), also known as atorvastatin, reduces artery inflammation as compared to the lower dose (10 mg) of the drug.

In the group treated with 80 mg of Lipitor, inflammation and emboli, or small blood clots, were significantly reduced, subsequently lowering the risk of stroke. The study's lead researcher, Dr. Jonathan Gillard, confirmed that a high dose of atorvastatin effectively reduced the inflammation and stroke risk, while a low dose did not exhibit the same risk-reducing effect. The new imaging technique using Ultra Small Particles of Iron Oxide (USPIO)-enhanced high-resolution MRI allowed researchers to closely observe arterial inflammation and thus determine the best treatment course for each patient."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let us do this step by step. Step 1: Simplify the equation Combine the terms with t: (41*t + 316*t) + (8007 + 1632) = 0 (357*t) + (9639) = 0 Now, the simplified equation looks like this: 357*t + 9639 = 0 Step 2: Rewrite the equation in the form of At^2 + Bt + C = 0 to apply the quadratic formula The given equation is linear (no t^2 term), so the equation can be rewritten as: 0*t^2 + 357*t + 9639 = 0 Now, we have the equation in the form At^2 + Bt + C = 0, with A = 0, B = 357, and C = 9639. Solution: We can solve the linear equation since it is not a quadratic.  Step 3: Solve for t 357*t + 9639 = 0 Isolate t by moving the constant term (9639) to the other side of the equation: 357*t = -9639 Now, divide both sides by the coefficient of t (357): t = -9639 / 357 Step 4: Simplify the answer Dividing -9639 by 357, we find: t = -27 So, the solution for the given equation 41*t + 316*t + 8007 + 1632 = 0 is: t = -27"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week.  The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey.  The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles.  Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book.  Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump...

A traditional conditioner is applied every time you shower, just after you rinse out your shampoo. This type of conditioner works to repair the damage done by hot tools, chemicals, and general wear-and-tear that your hair experiences on a daily basis. Choose a type of conditioner that is advertised for your specific hair needs; whether you have curly and frizzy hair, dry and damaged hair, colored hair, fine hair, relaxed hair, or limp and lank hair, there is a specific conditioner that can help with each. Hop in the shower, and go along with your regular washing routine. You’ll condition your hair after you wash it, so give your scalp and strands a good scrubbing with your favorite shampoo. Focus most of your washing power on the scalp, being careful not to tug at your wet hair as you wash as this can damage the ends and cause more breakage. Use warm water to wash out the shampoo. Warm water is safer on your hair than hot water is. Be careful not to tug on the strands if you run your fingers through it. When your hair feels ‘squeaky’, you’ve rinsed out all the shampoo. If your hair is sopping wet, any conditioner you try to apply will run right off and won’t stick long enough to affect your hair. If your hair is very short, you probably won’t have to do much wringing. If, however, you have long hair, spend a bit of time getting as much water out of it as you can. Pour a bit of conditioner into the palm of your hand; the amount you need will vary depending on the length of your hair. A dime-sized amount is usually recommended for professional conditioners, while drug store brands may require more because they can be diluted. If your hair is very long, you may need a whole palm-full of conditioner. Run this through the ends of your hair, trying to apply it to every strand that you’re able. Your conditioner should be applied only to the ends of your hair, as this is the part that is damaged (it’s the oldest). Putting conditioner near your scalp and roots can actually clog your follicles, and slow hair growth/increase oil production. This step is slightly optional; the longer you wait and allow your conditioner to set, the more it will be able to do to improve the health of your hair. If you’re in a rush, you can rinse it out nearly immediately after, but it won’t make your hair as soft and shiny as it normally would. Try applying your conditioner, and then washing the rest of your body/face while it sets. Then when you’re finished (normally a minute or two later), you can rinse out your conditioner for maximum effect. Assuming you’ve turned the water temperature back up for comfort’s sake, turn it back down as cold as you can handle it. As aforementioned, the cold water is healthier for your hair. Spend a few minutes rinsing out the conditioner; if your hair still feels ‘slimy’, then you haven’t gotten it all out. When your hair is smooth and no longer feels super slippery, then you’re set! Wring out your hair and you’re done conditioning.","output":"This article explains how to properly use traditional conditioner by applying it to the ends of damp, shampooed hair, letting it set, and rinsing it out, aiming to help repair daily damage, provide specific hair care, and maintain overall hair health."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Michael Jai White stars in the new spoof \\"Black Dynamite.\\" \\"The problem I have with the word is that it seems to encompass movies that don't fall under that category,\\" White said. \\"As soon as you hear the title 'Shaft' people think 'blaxploitation' and that is absolutely unfair because that film was made before the term even existed.\\" White, the star and co-writer of the new movie \\"Black Dynamite,\\" would rather people focus on what he views as the positives of the genre of 1970s urban action films starring African-American actors. His new movie, which opened in limited release last weekend and will start going wider, follows the exploits of Black Dynamite, a former CIA agent who takes to the streets after his brother is killed by the mafia, orphanages are flooded with drugs and some bad malt liquor finds its way into the 'hood. It is both a spoof of, and homage to, the genre whose films like \\"Black Caesar,\\" \\"The Mac,\\" \\"Foxy Brown,\\" and \\"Superfly\\" have developed a cult following over the years. \\"Black Dynamite\\" caught the eye of Sony Pictures at the Sundance Film Festival and the studio acquired the rights to distribute the film. A viral marketing campaign helped whip up anticipation for the movie, which also features former late-night talk show host Arsenio Hall and \\"In Living Color\\" cast member Tommy Davidson as pimps. Director Scott Sanders said he has always been fascinated by the fact that while blaxploitation really only grabbed hold of the industry for about five years during the early 1970s, it was so influential. \\"It was such an extreme genre with the look and the music and there were really no boundaries or rules,\\" he said. \\"It's always been a fascination for me given how much it influenced hip-hop, black culture and culture as a whole, given the brevity.\\" White, best known for his roles in the films \\"Spawn\\" and Tyler Perry's \\"Why Did I Get Married,\\" said he is a huge fan of blaxploitation films and views his movie as a loving send-up. While he is aware that some of the films were unintentionally funny with their low-budget gaffes -- such as the appearance of mic booms in some scenes -- and their stereotypes, White said the genre is a valued part of the movie industry's history. \\"These movies really saved Hollywood because the studio system was in trouble and they learned that they had a cash cow with these films,\\" he said. \\"Later they exploited it by making any movie and throwing the term 'black' in front of it and that's what made it exploitive.\\" They also gave African-American actors a chance to work and reflected a people's pride following the gains of the civil rights era. Laurence Washington, managing editor and co-publisher of Blackflix.com, said the movies helped young, black fans like him realize that \\"when we grow up we don't have to be train porters, busboys and waiters.\\" The films instead portrayed handsome, brave and suave black heroes who always got the girl, Washington said. \\"When the blaxploitation films came out in the '70s, black audiences had never had action film heroes they could identify with,\\" he said. \\"[The movies] also opened the door for today's black actors and directors to enter the mainstream.\\" Darius James, author of \\"That's Blaxploitation!: Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury),\\" said blaxploitation films were like any other film that appeal to a specific audience, such as the indie movies of Roger Corman and Russ Meyer. James said he grew up seeing civil rights workers beaten and hosed on television and the movies came out time when there was a sense of defiance and resistance against the marginalization of African-Americans. \\"These films, black exploitation films, reflected that spirit,\\" James said. White said he wishes there were more action films starring black actors these days. The films of the past were fearless and about true emotion, he said. \\"The 'black is beautiful' movement had taken off and there was so much pride,\\" White said. \\"When they called each other 'brother' they meant it.\\" \\"The heroes were strong, sexy and they kicked ass.\\" \\"I ask 'Where is that now?' I would like people to look at our film and say: 'Where are the black actors like that now?' \\" Jay Potts, the cartoonist behind World of Hurt -- which bills itself as \\"The Internet's #1 Blaxploitation Webcomic\\" -- said he hopes \\"Black Dynamite\\" furthers interest in the genre. And while \\"blaxploitation\\" is a convenient moniker to lump in films that may not have always had the best production value, Potts said they were a testament to an era. \\"The films came out at a time when black people were learning about themselves and flexing their creative muscles,\\" Potts said. \\"To me, there was a lot of fun, had a lot of energy and while it always wasn't perfect by any means there was so much life in it that I hope people take another look.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Actor Michael Jai White's new movie \\"Black Dynamite\\" is a tribute to the blaxploitation genre of the 1970s, which features African-American actors in urban action films. White thinks that the term \\"blaxploitation\\" has a negative connotation and that people should focus on the positive aspects. He believes these movies gave African-American actors a chance to work, reflected people's pride after the civil rights era, and showed strong, brave, and suave black heroes who always got the girl.

Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to.

Please briefly summarize this news article: British tabloid names Diana 'killer' In a front-page splash on the day Britain opened an inquest into Diana's death,Â The MirrorÂ named the person she had claimed was \\"planning an accident\\" in a chilling prediction of her own death in a car crash in August 1997. She made the allegation in a letter she gave to her butler and confidant, Paul Burrell, before she died. The former wife of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles died at the age of 36, along with her lover Dodi al-Fayed and their chauffeur Henri Paul in a Paris road tunnel. The Mirror appeared to be risking an aggressive legal response from Buckingham Palace to its story on Tuesday. The rest of the normally competitive British media omitted the name, apparently to avoid legal action under Britain's tough defamation laws.Â TheÂ tabloid printed a copy of the letter Diana wrote just 10 months before her death on its inside pages. Although it identified the person in its own story, the name was blanked out in the reproduction of the handwritten letter. \\"This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous,\\" it quoted the letter as saying. \\"(...) is planning 'an accident' in my car, brake failure and serious head injury.\\" \\"This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous... (...) is planning 'an accident' in my car, brake failure and serious head injury\\"Excerpt from Princess Diana's letter to her butlerÂ Sensational headlines \\"This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous... (...) is planning 'an accident' in my car, brake failure and serious head injury\\"Excerpt from Princess Diana's letter to her butlerÂ Burrell, who gave The Mirror access to the letter as part of a serialisation of excerpts of his book which was published late last year, reacted angrily to news the name had been revealed. \\"I am not very happy about it... I only learnt about it late last night. And it was always my intention never to publish that name,\\" he told reporters on Tuesday. Britain's tabloid newspapers have been engaged in an almost daily battle in the years since Diana's death to produce the most sensational headlines about Diana, Charles and other members of her family and former household. Tuesday's revelation came as Royal Coroner Michael Burgess was due to open and adjourn inquests into the deaths of Diana and Dodi. Hundreds of journalists from around the world gathered for the start of the inquests in central London - the first official public hearings into the crash to be held on British soil. An inquiry by French authorities in 1999 ruled the accident was caused by Diana'sÂ chauffeur being drunk and driving too fast. The Mirror said Burrell was prepared to hand over the Diana letter to the coroner as part of the inquest. It said that in doing so, he would be \\"honouring a long-standing promise to cooperate fully with the inquiries\\". After a 15-year marriage, Charles and Diana divorced in 1996 after both had admitted to having adulterous affairs. Summary:","output":"Okay, sweetie, imagine there's a very famous princess named Diana. A long time ago, she had a very scary car accident that she didn't survive. Recently, a big newspaper in Britain, The Mirror, wrote on its front page that they think they know who Princess Diana said might cause her an accident. She had written this in a letter to her really close friend, Mr. Burrell, before she died. The newspaper even printed some of her letter, but they covered the name when they showed it.  Mr. Burrell was surprised and upset when he found out they revealed the name because he didn't want that to happen. He did promise to share the letter with people trying to find out what really happened to Princess Diana. This big news came out just when some people were about to start their own investigation about her and her boyfriend's deaths. Many newspapers in Britain write stories about Princess Diana and her family a lot trying to make attention-grabbing headlines. And even though she and her husband, Prince Charles, were not together anymore when she died, what happened to her still makes people very sad and curious."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Invincible Context: Zishe Breitbart (Jouko Ahola) is the son of an Orthodox Jewish blacksmith in rural Poland. He is fantastically strong, largely from working at hard labor all day. A talent agent sees how strong Breitbart is in his Jewish shtetl home and convinces him to move to Berlin, where he can find work as a strongman. Hanussen (Tim Roth), an epic con-man and supposed mystic, runs a cabaret variety show. Hanussen gives Breitbart a blonde wig and a Nordic helmet and calls him \\"Siegfried\\" so as to identify him with the Aryan notion of physical superiority. This appeals to the largely Nazi clientele, and he is a big hit. This is a dark comedy but is as much so a deeply dramatic story, involving the mainly secular Jews of Berlin. Included is interaction between Breitbart, an attractive stage musician Marta, their boss Hanussen, who abuses her, and some very top level Nazis. Ultimately Breitbart becomes disgusted and dismayed. A visit from Breitbart's young brother, Benjamin (Jacob Benjamin Wein), convinces Breitbart to be proud of his Jewish heritage, and so, without warning, he takes off the blonde wig in the middle of his act to announce that he is not an \\"Aryan\\", and calls himself a new Jewish Samson. This has the effect of making him a hero to the local Jews, who flock to the cabaret to see their new Samson. The Nazis aren't as pleased, and Hanussen tries to discredit Breitbart. He tries to make it seem that it was his mystic powers that were the true strength behind the strongman, and makes it look as though even his frail female pianist Marta can break chains and lift weights if under his power. Hanussen knows the Nazis dabble in the occult and hopes to become a part of Hitler's future government. He therefore hobnobs with the likes of Himmler and Goebbels. In the end, however, he is exposed as a Czech Jewish con artist named Herschel Steinschneider. As a result, Hanussen is kidnapped and murdered by the Brownshirts. Breitbart foresees what will be known as the Holocaust and returns to Poland to warn the Jewish people...

FRIDAY, AUGUST 26, 2005. On moonless nights the men and boys of Jableh, a dusty fishing town on the coast of Syria, would gather their lanterns and set out in their quietest boats. Five or six small craft, two or three fishermen in each. A mile out, they would arrange the boats in a circle on the black sea, drop their nets, and, holding their lanterns over the water, they would approximate the moon. The fish, sardines, would begin gathering soon after, a slow mass of silver rising from below. The fish were attracted to plankton, and the plankton were attracted to the light. They would begin to circle, a chain linked loosely, and over the next hour their numbers would grow. The black gaps between silver links would close until the fishermen could see, below, a solid mass of silver spinning. Abdulrahman Zeitoun was only thirteen when he began fishing for sardines this way, a method called lampara, borrowed from the Italians. He had waited years to join the men and teenagers on the night boats, and he'd spent those years asking questions. Why only on moonless nights? Because, his brother Ahmad said, on moon-filled nights the plankton would be visible everywhere, spread out all over the sea, and the sardines could see and eat the glowing organisms with ease. But without a moon the men could make their own, and could bring the sardines to the surface in stunning concentrations. You have to see it, Ahmad told his little brother. You've never seen anything like this. And when Abdulrahman first witnessed the sardines circling in the black he could not believe the sight, the beauty of the undulating silver orb below the white and gold lantern light. He said nothing, and the other fishermen were careful to be quiet, too, paddling without motors, lest they scare away the catch. They would whisper over the sea, telling jokes and talking about women and girls as they watched the fish rise and spin beneath them. A few hours later, once the sardines were ready, tens of thousands of them glistening in the refracted light, the fishermen would cinch the net and haul them in. They would motor back to the shore and bring the sardines to the fish broker in the market before dawn. He would pay the men and boys, and would then sell the fish all over western Syria -- Lattakia, Baniyas, Damascus. The fishermen would split the money, with Abdulrahman and Ahmad bringing their share home. Their father had passed away the year before and their mother was of fragile health and mind, so all funds they earned fishing went toward the welfare of the house they shared with ten siblings. Abdulrahman and Ahmad didn't care much about the money, though. They would have done it for free. Thirty-four years later and thousands of miles west, Abdulrahman Zeitoun was in bed on a Friday morning, slowly leaving the moonless Jableh night, a tattered memory of it caught in a morning dream. He was in his home in New Orleans and beside him he could hear his wife Kathy breathing, her exhalations not unlike the shushing of water against the hull of a wooden boat. Otherwise the house was silent. He knew it was near six o'clock, and the peace would not last. The morning light usually woke the kids once it reached their second-story windows. One of the four would open his or her eyes, and from there the movements were brisk, the house quickly growing loud. With one child awake, it was impossible to keep the other three in bed. Kathy woke to a thump upstairs, coming from one of the kids' rooms. She listened closely, praying silently for rest. Each morning there was a delicate period, between six and six-thirty, when there was a chance, however remote, that they could steal another ten or fifteen minutes of sleep. But now there was another thump, and the dog barked, and another thump followed. What was happening in this house? Kathy looked to her husband. He was staring at the ceiling. The day had roared to life. The phone began ringing, today as always, before their feet hit the floor. Kathy and Zeitoun -- most people called him by his last name because they couldn't pronounce his first -- ran a company, Zeitoun A. Painting Contractor LLC, and every day their crews, their clients, everyone with a phone and their number, seemed to think that once the clock struck six-thirty, it was appropriate to call. And they called. Usually there were so many calls at the stroke of six-thirty that the overlap would send half of them straight to voicemail. Kathy took the first one, from a client across town, while Zeitoun shuffled into the shower. Fridays were always busy, but this one promised madness, given the rough weather on the way. There had been rumblings all week about a tropical storm crossing the Florida Keys, a chance it might head north. Though this kind of possibility presented itself every August and didn't raise eyebrows for most, Kathy and Zeitoun's more cautious clients and friends often made preparations. Throughout the morning the callers would want to know if Zeitoun could board up their windows and doors, if he would be clearing his equipment off their property before the winds came. Workers would want to know if they'd be expected to come in that day or the next. \\"Zeitoun Painting Contractors,\\" Kathy said, trying to sound alert. It was an elderly client, a woman living alone in a Garden District mansion, asking if Zeitoun's crew could come over and board up her windows. \\"Sure, of course,\\" Kathy said, letting her feet drop heavily to the floor. She was up. Kathy was the business's secretary, bookkeeper, credit department, public-relations manager -- she did everything in the office, while her husband handled the building and painting. The two of them balanced each other well: Zeitoun's English had its limits, so when bills had to be negotiated, hearing Kathy's Louisiana drawl put clients at ease. This was part of the job, helping clients prepare their homes for coming winds. Kathy hadn't given much thought to the storm this client was talking about. It took a lot more than a few downed trees in south Florida to get her attention. \\"We'll have a crew over this afternoon,\\" Kathy told the woman. Kathy and Zeitoun had been married for eleven years. Zeitoun had come to New Orleans in 1994, by way of Houston and Baton Rouge and a half-dozen other American cities he'd explored as a young man. Kathy had grown up in Baton Rouge and was used to the hurricane routine: the litany of preparations, the waiting and watching, the power outages, the candles and flashlights and buckets catching rain. There seemed to be a half-dozen named storms every August, and they were rarely worth the trouble. This one, named Katrina, would be no different.

The Domestic Violence Legal Assistance Program fills the gap of legal resources for domestic violence survivors who can't afford an attorney. Domestic violence survivors in Jackson, Vicksburg, Hattiesburg, Oxford and Pascagoula can all get help. Julia Crockett, deputy director of Central Southwest Mississippi Legal Services Corp., said the program expects to help nearly 1,000 domestic violence victims. Crockett said legal help gives domestic abuse survivors a way to rebuild their lives. \\"They have been made to feel by the abuser that no one is going to help them do anything, so when they come to us they are desperate,\\" she said. \\"Those who need legal help and don't get it feel totally lost. Because then they feel like they are forced to stay in that situation.\\" Crockett said the program, funded by a 300,000 grant from the U.S. Justice Department, has no economic restrictions on who can get help. Legal services typically helps the poor. Gladys Bunzy, who said she was in an abusive relationship with a boyfriend for eight years, said such a program is long overdue and could be a lifeline for those escaping violent relationships. \\"When I finally made up my mind to leave, I had a restraining order put against him and that was 50 but that was 50 well spent to me,\\" said Bunzy, 40. \\"For people who can't afford it, this will be a godsend ... If a woman knows she is going to get some help that will be a burden off her mind, if the law will help her keep that person away from her.\\" Gwen Bouie-Haynes, project director of the Domestic Violence Services Center for Catholic Charities Inc., said often domestic violence survivors do not have the money to seek legal representation. \\"Legal assistance is a major issue for women fleeing a domestic violence situation,\\" she said. \\"Often times women are in need of immediate legal assistance services for the protection of the mother and the child. To get a protective order you need to be represented by an attorney.\\" Crockett said the pilot program was launched in 1998 at the Haven House Family Shelter Inc., a domestic violence shelter for women and children in Vicksburg. The program has helped victims in 90 court cases, and 150 legal counseling sessions have been held there.

The moment I installed the app, I expected it to help me optimize my device's performance. I was under the impression that it would provide more control over my kernel settings and enhance my phone's overall functionality. Nonetheless, I was gravely mistaken. First and foremost, there is the matter of the user interface (UI). The design is unpolished, cluttered, and unintuitive. As a user, I had to navigate through confusing menus, try to decipher ambiguous icons, and figure out various unknown functions. The app constantly bombards you with convoluted data and options without providing any insights on how to utilize them effectively. To make matters worse, there is a severe lack of documentation. As a somewhat tech-savvy person, I tried to fumble my way through the settings, hoping for some guidance along the way. Alas, the app did not offer any helpful tooltips, explanations, or even a tutorial. A newbie or someone with minimal technical knowledge would be hopelessly lost and probably end up causing undesirable effects on their device. Another issue, which I consider to be extremely alarming, is the impact this app has had on my device's stability. Since installing com.grarak.kerneladiutor, my phone has become more prone to random reboots, crashes, and even sluggishness. I feel like it is crucial to mention that my device (a flagship model!) was perfectly stable before I installed this app. Furthermore, and quite ironically, battery life – an aspect that this app claims to improve – saw a significant downfall. Instead of optimizing my device's performance, the application only managed to deteriorate essential aspects of its functionality. The developer's support leaves much to be desired. When I encountered issues, I tried to get in touch with their customer service through the provided email, expecting at least a semblance of assistance. Alas, my email was met with radio silence – not even an automated response acknowledging my concerns. Finally, I cannot, in good conscience, ignore the apparent security risks associated with entrusting such an intrusive app. With its lack of transparency and professionalism, it is alarming to grant this application unfettered access and control over critical aspects of my device. In conclusion, I can only award a 1-star rating to com.grarak.kerneladiutor. Save yourself the trouble, and avoid this app like the plague. Not only does it fail to deliver on its promises, but it can also potentially harm your device. I have since uninstalled the application and restored my phone to its original state, and I sincerely implore you to do the same or simply avoid it altogether."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The phrase \\"genuinely inspirational\\" highlights the reviewer's admiration for the real-life story depicted in the film. However, the brevity of the statement and lack of direct commentary on the movie's execution, acting, or other specific elements prevent a more comprehensive assessment. A truly inspirational real-life story can refer to the movie's captivating and compelling plot that is based on true events. This kind of story usually evokes strong emotions and feelings of admiration in the audience. When a movie manages to capture an inspirational real-life story accurately and convey the emotions effectively, it often results in a powerful cinematic experience that leaves a lasting impression on the viewers. However, it is crucial to note that the success of a movie is not solely determined by its plot, even if it is based on an incredible true story. Other essential factors contribute to a film's overall reception, such as direction, cinematography, acting, music, and pacing. A strong real-life story can sometimes overshadow weaker aspects of a film, making it essential to consider other elements for a more complete evaluation. In conclusion, while this brief review seems to convey a positive opinion of the movie based on the inspirational real-life story it portrays, it does not provide enough details to evaluate the movie's execution and craftsmanship thoroughly.

Step 1: Combine like terms -5*l and -5*l are like terms, so we can combine them.  0 = (-5*l - 5*l) + 40 0 = -10*l + 40 Step 2: Isolate the term with the variable (l) Now, we need to isolate the term containing the variable l on one side of the equation.  To do this, we can subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 40 = -10*l + 40 - 40 -40 = -10*l Step 3: Solve for l Now, we can solve for l by dividing both sides of the equation by -10: -40 / -10 = (-10*l) / -10 4 = l So the solution to the equation 0 = -5*l - 5*l + 40 is l = 4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His wife, Mildred Pierce-Beragon (Joan Crawford), soon arrives at the police station and acts suspiciously nervous, though denies killing her husband. When the police reveal the man they believe to be the culprit- Mildred's first husband, Bert Pierce (Bruce Bennett), who was the owner of the murder weapon- Mildred proclaims his innocence with emotion. Realizing that she knows more than she lets on, the detectives gather information from Mildred.Several years earlier, Mildred was married to Bert and spent her days as a housewife in their middle-class home. Her chief concern was providing all she could for their two daughters, Veda (Ann Blyth) and Kay (Jo Ann Marlowe). Bert loses his job, and reveals his frustration with Mildred's treatment of their children; namely showering them with expenses they cannot afford. Mildred sells baked goods to the neighbors to afford gifts for Veda in particular, but Bert chastises her for spoiling the girl. It is suggested that Bert has been unfaithful, and the two agree to separate. Mildred reveals the news to her daughters that afternoon when they return from school and witness Bert packing the car and driving off. Kay, the younger tomboyish daughter, is deeply saddened that her father had left, but snobbish teenage Veda is more concerned that they will no longer be able to afford any luxuries. Veda's status hunger and greed is shown when she tries on a dress that Mildred had scrimped to buy her, and calls it nothing more than a rag.Desperate for money, Mildred takes a job as a waitress at a local restaurant.

Question: what is peat moss good for growing?? Would \\"The top of the plant, or capitulum, has compact clusters of young branches.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"Peat moss is good for growing plants that require acidic and moist growing conditions. It is commonly used for growing acidic-loving plants like blueberries, azaleas, and rhododendrons, as well as moisture-loving plants like ferns and some types of orchids. Peat moss can also be added to general-purpose potting mixes to increase water retention and air porosity in the soil. However, the sentence \\"The top of the plant, or capitulum, has compact clusters of young branches.\\" does not seem to be a reasonable answer to the question, as it describes a morphological feature of a plant rather than explaining the benefits of peat moss in plant growth. A more appropriate answer would focus on the characteristics of peat moss and how it supports the growth of plants, such as its ability to retain water, provide aeration, and its acidic nature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The goal is to classify the review as \\"POS\\" if the overall sentiment of the review is positive or as \\"NEG\\" if the overall sentiment of the review is negative. Input: Still a Lot of \\"Country\\" on this Crossover Album . In the 1990s, the Country Music began to go through some transitions. Country music which had for the most part stayed in a vacuum began to go mainstream and embrace other genres of music. As a result, the sound started to change. One artist that led this transition was Faith Hill.   Faith Hill had previously released two albums, but it was her 1998 breakthrough album \\"Faith\\" that helped her break into mainstream music.  Surprisingly, while \\"Faith\\" did cross-over into the mainstream, there still is a strong country element on this album.     By no means do I consider myself a Country Music expert.  The nice thing about \\"Faith\\" is that I believe it caters to a fan like myself that may not be deep into Country Music, but can appreciate many of the elements Country Music can bring to the table.   While \\"Faith\\" could be directed to a more casual fan like myself, I think the collection does an admirable job at addressing the fan who is deeper when it comes to the Country Music genre.   Faith Hill brings an interesting formula to this album.  Faith's role on the collection is primarily of vocalist.  Since she is focused on vocals, she is dependent on a solid cast of characters (musicians and songwriters) to support her effort.  On \\"Faith\\", this doesn't appear to be a problem.  She is surrounded by many top notch studio musicians and is given an oustanding slate of songs to work with.  Given this solid infrastructure, Faith is able to provide stellar vocals and produce a great product.   The interesting twist to this formula is that Faith Hill is a co-producer on all 12 songs.   Therefore she just isn't a \\"vocalist for hire\\".  She ultimately is deciding what the songs should be and how the final product should sound.  This is why \\"Faith\\" is a solid collection.    \\"This Kiss\\" was the song that made Faith Hill a household name on the mainstream music scene.   This was also the song that was my first introduction to Faith Hill.  In 1998, I first heard this song on the radio and it completely blew me away.   One reason why this song made it into the mainstream arena is that it does have qualities that make it sound like a \\"pop\\" song.  However, there is a true country element to this song - complete with Steel Guitar and Fiddle (played by Glen Duncan).    This instrumentation gives the song a most unique flavor.  The song features some very clever and catchy lyrics such as \\"It's a centrifugal motion; It's perpetual bliss; It's that pivotal moment\\".  The vocals are delivered with a very up-tempo pace (with little rests between the words) and that also contribute to the unique flavor.  This song features some great background vocals by Chris Rodriguez (who provides background vocals on several other songs on the album) and Beth Nielson Chapman (who is a co-writer for this song).    At first, upon purchasing \\"Faith\\", I expected it would basically be \\"This Kiss\\" and not much else.  However, after my first listen to this collection - I realized that this was not the case.   There were many other terrific songs that are included on this collection.   The second song \\"You Give Me Love\\" is also pretty catchy.  This has much more of a country element on this song.  This song is highlighted by some terrific drums and more Fiddle by Glen Duncan.     Although not as catchy a song, \\"Let Me Let Go\\" is worth mentioning.  The highlight of this particular song is background vocals by Vince Gill.  Gill is a master in the domain of steering Country Music toward the mainstream, but not abandoning the Country Music element.  This song clearly has a Country Element and it works.  This song also features a string section of viola players.  The Country Music element is alive and well in the song \\"Better Days\\".   This song was co-written by former Fleetwood Mac vocalist Billy Burnette.  This song also features Duncan's Fiddle.      The Country Music element is also present in the song \\"My Wild Frontier\\".   This is a powerful and sad song about a woman, who with her family moves into the Canadian Prairie.  Tragedy then strikes when the woman's baby son dies in his sleep.  This song is a great example of some of how a very well written song is made even better by some very emotional and powerful vocals by Faith.    The best song on the album is \\"The Secret of Life\\".   This song was co-written by Gretchen Peters, who is a songwriter that worked with Bryan Adams on \\"On a Day Like Today\\" and his \\"Unplugged\\" album.   The song is about exactly what the title says - telling little bits on what \\"the secret of life is\\".   No loss of a solid country feel in this song - including more great fiddle by Duncan.  Simple lyrics like \\"The Secret of Life is in Sam's Martini\\" (Sam is a character that is referred to in the song) or \\"The Secret of Life is a Good Cup of Coffee\\" give this song a very special quality.    Two other country element songs are that are solid are \\"Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me\\" and \\"The Hard Way\\".  In \\"Just to Hear You Say You Love Me\\", Faith does a terrific duet with her husband Tim McGraw.   As for \\"The Hard Way\\", this is very powerful song (more great Fiddle) and is best described by the lyrics \\"I Keep Livin and Lovin and Learnin The Hard Way\\".  Finally, \\"Me\\" is another good song - this song has more of a pop element and deals with a woman changing who she is.    On a side note, Sheryl Crow is a co-writer of \\"Somebody Stand By Me\\".  Not a great song, but worth mentioning.    All of the lyrics, studio musicians, songwriting and production credits are listed in the liner notes.  This album should appeal to Country Music and Mainstream fans.  Highly Recommended Output:","output":"POS"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Coves usually have narrow, restricted entrances, are often circular or oval, and are often situated within a larger bay. Small, narrow, sheltered bays, inlets, creeks, or recesses in a coast are often considered coves. Colloquially, the term can be used to describe a sheltered bay. Geomorphology describes coves as precipitously-walled and rounded cirque-like openings as in a valley extending into or down a mountainside, or in a hollow or nook of a cliff or steep mountainside.    What is the relationship between 'la jolla cove' and 'landform'? The answer is:","output":"La Jolla Cove is a specific example of a landform. A landform is a natural feature of the Earth's surface, such as a coastline, bay, or inlet.

It has been proposed that the reduced exposure to bacteria and viruses is due, in part, to increased cleanliness and decreased family size in modern societies. Exposure to bacterial endotoxin in early childhood may prevent the development of asthma, but exposure at an older age may provoke bronchoconstriction. Evidence supporting the hygiene hypothesis includes lower rates of asthma on farms and in households with pets.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Based on the context provided, the illness that is more prevalent in modern society is asthma.

Its most striking feature is the great Norman screen, running up without buttresses or projections to the parapet and hiding the bases of the square, richly decorated towers of the west front. The plain centre of the screen is the work of Remigius, the first bishop. The rest of it is relieved with rich arcading of Late Norman and Early English periods. The wooden spires which crowned the towers were removed in 1807. In 1192 Hugh of Avalon determined to rebuild the Norman building of Remigius, which an earthquake had shaken. To him we owe the choir and eastern transept. His successors completed the western transept and began the west end of the nave. So much money had to be spent in rebuilding the central tower, which fell in 1239, that the canons could not rebuild the nave entirely, but had to incorporate the Norman end by Remigius. Unfortunately the axis of the west front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too wide for its height. The low vaulting is a serious defect in the choir built by St. Hugh, but of the superb beauty of the Angel Choir, which encloses his shrine, there can be no doubt. In its richness of sculpture it is one of the masterpieces of Gothic architecture in England. The interior of the cathedral is remarkable for the harmony of its style, which is Lancet-Gothic, and the dim lighting of the nave only adds to its impressiveness.

Possible answers: a thoughtless person, guilty and ashamed, remorseful and sad A:","output":"Jesse can be described as a thoughtless person, guilty and ashamed, as well as remorseful and sad. As the individual responsible for creating the disaster that put Taylor in such a bad situation, it is evident that Jesse made decisions without fully considering the consequences or the impact they might have on others. First and foremost, Jesse's actions were thoughtless. This implies that they did not think about how their actions would affect Taylor, and likely did not take the necessary precautions to mitigate risks or prevent harm. Thoughtlessness can stem from carelessness, selfishness, or simply a lack of awareness. Regardless of the reason, this aspect of Jesse's personality created the conditions for disaster and caused Taylor to face challenging circumstances. However, it is also possible that Jesse is guilty and ashamed of what they have done. Guilt and shame suggest that Jesse is not a completely heartless individual; rather, they possess the capacity to acknowledge and feel regret for their actions. This could mean that Jesse was unaware of the potential consequences at the time but has since recognized the error of their ways. Being consumed by guilt suggests that Jesse may be searching for a way to rectify the situation or make amends with Taylor. Finally, it is very likely that Jesse feels remorseful and sad about the disaster they have caused. Remorse indicates that Jesse understands the pain and hardship they have inflicted upon Taylor and wishes they could undo their actions. This emotional response reflects a genuine desire to make things right and salvage their relationship with Taylor. The sadness that Jesse might be experiencing can stem from witnessing the unfavorable outcomes or the realization that their actions have potentially jeopardized their relationship with Taylor. Overall, Jesse's character can be best defined by their thoughtlessness, guilt and shame, as well as their remorse and sadness. While their actions have caused harm to Taylor, their subsequent emotional responses suggest that they have the capacity for self-reflection and empathy, offering a glimmer of hope for eventual redemption and reconciliation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Interpret the meaning of the sentence in the context of a movie review. - As a movie review should discuss the quality of a film, we can assume that this sentence is commenting on the actor's impact on the movie. - Using the negative term \\"burdened\\" implies that the actor's performance or presence detracted from the film's quality.

Banks are holding more than 200 million in insurance payments meant for victims of Superstorm Sandy, nearly four months after the storm made landfall, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday. The Cuomo administration said it has delivered letters to various banks and mortgage service providers asking they \\"use maximum discretion and effort to speed the release of funds.\\" \\"Families need to be able to return to their homes and the state economy, which took a hit from Superstorm Sandy, needs the boost from spending on repairs,\\" Cuomo said in a written statement. \\"After insurance companies have sent homeowners checks to pay for repairs, the money should not be sitting with the bank because of red tape.\\" A month of outrage later, Senate passes Sandy relief. The state's Department of Financial Services found that four of the biggest U.S. banks -- Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citibank and JP Morgan Chase -- are holding more than 4,100 checks worth more 130 million. The banks were not immediately available for comment, though have maintained that they were socked with a massive amount in payouts that require processing in the wake of the storm. Thousands of storm-battered residents are still awaiting a total of 208 million in insurance checks. Cuomo said the payouts are often issued jointly to the homeowner and their bank or mortgage servicer, which then requires the \\"bank's endorsement of the check before the homeowner may access the funds.\\" Delays can follow when banks request proof of repairs or servicing required by federal mortgage agencies. But many residents have complained that they haven't received the funds they need to start the repairs.

Located on the banks of the Bagmati River in the eastern part of Kathmandu, Pashupatinath Temple is the oldest Hindu temple in Kathmandu. It served as the seat of national deity, Lord Pashupatinath, until Nepal was secularized. However, a significant part of the temple was destroyed by Mughal invaders in the 14th century and little or nothing remains of the original 5th-century temple exterior. The temple as it stands today was built in the 19th century, although the image of the bull and the black four-headed image of Pashupati are at least 300 years old. The temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Shivaratri, or the night of Lord Shiva, is the most important festival that takes place here, attracting thousands of devotees and sadhus.[citation needed] When was the Pashupatinath Temple built?","output":"The Pashupatinath Temple was built in the 5th century.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star .","output":"The phrase \\"tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star\\" can be considered a mixed statement, containing both positive and negative elements. However, it predominantly leans towards the positive spectrum. To understand this better, let's break down the phrase into its components and analyze each part. 1. \\"Tunney\\" - This is likely referring to an actor or actress with the surname Tunney. The focus of the statement is on their performance and characteristics. 2. \\"Brimming with coltish, neurotic energy\\" - This is a mixed description. The word \\"coltish\\" refers to playful or frisky behavior, usually associated with young animals like colts. It conveys enthusiasm, energy, and a sense of youth. In this context, it could be considered positive, as it suggests the actor's performance is lively and spirited. On the other hand, \\"neurotic energy\\" implies a degree of tension, anxiety, or instability in the actor's performance. This could be interpreted as a subtle criticism, although not a strong negative remark. It could also be argued that neurotic energy, when channeled effectively, can add complexity to a performance and enhance its overall appeal. 3. \\"Holds the screen like a true star\\" - This is undeniably a positive statement, suggesting that the actor has a strong screen presence. It implies that they command attention when they are on screen and have the charisma and talent expected from a true star. In conclusion, while the phrase contains both positive and negative elements, it is more inclined towards positivity due to the powerful screen presence and lively energy conveyed in the description. The choice of wording suggests that the actor's performance is captivating and stands out, despite any potential anxiety or tension that might be present in their performance style."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

He believes that world change begins with educated children.Today,the programme can be found in10 countries across Asia and Africa. Wood believes the key to the program's success is local support.While Room to Read gives away money and provides books,communities offer land and parents help build the school.Agnes,a Room to Read teacher in Zambia who also runs the library,is proud to say the literacy' at her school has improved. Room to Read's biggest challenge is the huge need. Hundreds of communities have asked for literacy prograrnmes.One way of Room to Read's success is that it will achieve Wood's goal of reaching 10 million kids by 2015,five years earlier than it is planned.

During Travis's first class, his teacher talks about how Cooper and his church had their town ridiculed for his racial actions and beliefs. Later, Jared (Kyle Gallner), a friend of Travis, reveals he received an invitation from a woman he met on a sex site for group sex with himself, Travis and Billy Ray (Nicholas Braun). They borrow Travis's parents' car and travel out into the country to meet with the woman.Along the way, they accidentally sideswipe the vehicle of Sheriff Wynan (Stephen Root), while he was engaged in a homosexual affair in his car. Afraid, the boys drive off. Sheriff Wynan returns to the station and tells his deputy Pete (Matt L. Jones) to go and look for the vehicle (but doesn't tell him about what he was doing out on the back road).Meanwhile, the boys arrive at the trailer of the woman who sent out the invitation, Sarah Cooper (Melissa Leo). She encourages them to drink, and after being drugged by the beer, they pass out while undressing. Jared wakes up while being moved in a covered cage. He realizes he is in the sanctuary at Five Points after he identifies Cooper. Here, Cooper begins a long, hate-filled sermon/monologue before his warped followers about sin reeks in the world and that all evil must be eradicated before the end of the world comes which is their one-way ticket into Heaven. Cooper then identifies another captive, a homosexual young man they lured in through an internet chat room.

Semantic similarity: - Both sentences express the same core meaning – a deer jumping over a fence. - The difference between \\"the fence\\" and \\"a cyclone fence\\" is only a small detail regarding the type of fence. - Verb tenses (past vs. present) are also a minor difference in meaning.

This is according to recent work by archaeologists--history experts who investigate how human beings lived in the past. Archaeologists digging near Stonehenge last year discovered the remains of a large prehistoric village where they think the builders of the mysterious stone circle used to live. The village is about 4,600 years old, the same age as Stonehenge and as old as the Pyramids in Egypt. It is less than two miles from the famous ancient landmark and lies inside a massive man-made circular dirt wall, or \\"henge\\", known as the Durrington Walls. Remains found at the site included jewellry, stone arrowheads, tools made of deer antlers, wooden spears and huge amounts of animal bones and broken pottery. \\"These finds suggest Stone Age people went to the village at special times of the year to feast and party\\", says Mike Parker-Pearson from Sheffield University in England. He said many of the pig bones they found had been thrown away half-eaten. He also said the partygoers appeared to have shot some of the farm pigs with arrows, possibly as a kind of sport before barbecuing them. An ancient road which led from the village to the River Avon was also found. Here, the experts think, people came after their parties to throw dead  s in the water so the bodies would be washed downstream to Stonehenge. Parker-Pearson believes Stonehenge was like a cemetery where ancient Britons buried the dead and remembered their ancestors. The theory is that Stonehenge is a kind of spirit home to the ancestors. The recent discovery of the village within the Durrington Walls shows that Stonehenge didn't stand alone but was part of a much bigger religious site, according to Parker-Pearson.People still come to worship and celebrate at Stonehenge today.

The negative sentiment surrounding this movie is largely attributable to its lackluster plot, misguided character development, and the shortcomings in maintaining the audience's engagement. Amidst the sea of directorial debacles, Grayson's attempt at creating a thrilling adventure undoubtedly sinks without a trace. To begin with, the plot unfolds like an exhaustingly predictable tale. The central storyline revolves around the protagonist's journey to find closure after the grisly demise of his loved ones. Rather than challenging stereotypes and testing the boundaries of narrative complexity, Grayson chooses to underwhelm the audience with a frustratingly linear progression. The glaring absence of unexpected twists and turns leaves the viewers uninterested and exasperated. Additionally, the character development in Fading Dreams is abysmally inadequate. Grayson's reliance upon clichéd tropes and one-dimensional personalities hinders the audience's ability to empathize or connect with the characters on a deeper level. The protagonist’s journey of self-discovery comes off as contrived, while the supporting cast exists merely as cardboard cutouts without any semblance of genuine motivation or purpose. This lack of emotional depth further disengages the audience, ultimately detracting from the overall impact of the film. Perhaps one of the most disappointing aspects of Fading Dreams is its inability to captivate the viewer's attention. Throughout the movie, dawdling scenes and needlessly prolonged dialogue lead to a jarring pacing issue. The unrelenting sluggishness of the plot contrasts with Grayson's previous efforts, which were known for their riveting momentum and captivating intensity. In fact, this sluggishness is so pervasive that it undermines even the film’s few redeeming elements. Despite boasting a star-studded cast and an ample budget, Fading Dreams falls woefully short in creating a memorable cinematic experience. Its lack of innovation, coupled with an uninspired script and disengaging execution, ultimately results in a profoundly negative impression. Grayson and his ensemble might have reached for the stars in an attempt to create a heart-rending tale of loss and redemption. Unfortunately, they only manage to underscore the very depths from which they set out to escape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The name Gilberto should be used instead. - MLS refers to Major League Soccer, which is the league and not an individual player.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Gigot Movie plot: Gigot (Gleason) is a mute Frenchman living in a cellar in the MÃ©nilmontant district of Paris in the 1920s. He ekes out a hand-to-mouth existence as a janitor at his landlady's apartment building. He is routinely treated with condescension by neighbors and often is made the butt of practical jokes. However, he is a decent and kindhearted fellow, traits not unnoticed by children and the animals he often feeds. Gigot has one unusual predilection: he is attracted by funeral processions and finds himself attending, whether or not he ever knew the departed. He can't help but cry along with all the other mourners. After being abused by locals at a pub, he chances upon a woman, Colette (Katherine Kath), and her 6-year-old daughter Nicole (Diane Gardner), huddled in a doorway trying to stay dry. He takes them to his dingy basement abode, gives them what food and drink he has, a bed to sleep in, and shelter from the rain. Colette is suspicious but is so exhausted that she accepts. Gigot gleefully dotes upon Nicole. Gigot is astonished to discover she is ignorant of what a church is, completely unaware of God. Nicole points to a crucifix and asks about it. The mute attempts to act out the story of Christ, beginning with Mary cradling the baby Jesus, from childhood through to the horror of crucifixion. Gigot rails at this Christ who has seemingly left him so inadequate. Nicole cries a single tear for him, then blows a reassuring kiss of love to the Christ upon the Cross. Gigot entertains the little girl by dancing to his old gramophone, and by dressing as a waiter to feed his pet mouse. He is very protective, running alongside her on a merry-go-round to make sure she doesn't fall off. He also intervenes to protect Colette's honor while she is in the act of soliciting a john on a park bench near the merry-go-round. Gigot is trounced by the frustrated man for his trouble. Furious over his interference with her \\"activities,\\" Colette threatens to bolt with Nicole unless Gigot can provide her a life with a \\"man of means.\\"... My question: what is he attracted by?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it possible to draw the conclusion that \\"Dan is very cruel.\\" if \\"Dan had to stop Bill from toying with the injured bird. He is very cruel.\\"?","output":"Based on the given information, it is not possible to definitively conclude that Dan is very cruel. The statement \\"Dan had to stop Bill from toying with the injured bird. He is very cruel.\\" is ambiguous, and the pronoun \\"he\\" could potentially refer to either Dan or Bill. To draw a conclusion, we need further information and context about the situation and the characters involved. There are different ways to interpret this statement, and we will discuss two possible scenarios that can help in understanding the situation: 1. If \\"he\\" refers to Bill: In this scenario, the statement implies that Dan stepped in to stop Bill from harming the injured bird. Bill was the one displaying cruelty by toying with the bird, and Dan took action to protect it. In this case, we could potentially conclude that Bill is the cruel one, and Dan showed some level of empathy or compassion for the bird by intervening. 2. If \\"he\\" refers to Dan: If, in the context, \\"he\\" refers to Dan, then it might be implied that Dan had to stop Bill from toying with the injured bird because Dan wanted to be the one inflicting harm or wanted to display cruelty towards the bird himself. In this scenario, we could conclude that Dan is cruel. However, even in this interpretation, there is not enough information to ascertain Dan's intentions or motivations, and additional context would be required to confirm this conclusion. Given the ambiguity in the statement, it is important to gather more information and context in order to accurately draw any conclusions about Dan's character. For example, in situations where Dan consistently displays cruel behavior towards animals or other individuals, one might be more inclined to believe that Dan is cruel. On the contrary, if this is an isolated incident and Dan has generally been compassionate or empathetic towards others, it could be an exception or might be misinterpreted. In conclusion, based on the given statement, we cannot definitively conclude that Dan is very cruel. The statement is ambiguous, and the pronoun \\"he\\" could either refer to Dan or Bill. Drawing conclusions about an individual's character requires more context and a comprehensive understanding of their behavior and actions in different situations."},{"instruction":"Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s longtime personal lawyer who is under investigation for his business dealings, has provided legal advice to Fox News host Sean Hannity, one of Trump’s most prominent media supporters. The dramatic revelation came Monday during a court hearing in New York where lawyers for Cohen and Trump argued for permission to determine whether thousands of pages of documents FBI agents seized from Cohen last week should be subject to attorney-client privilege. U.S. District Court Judge Kimba Wood appeared to reject the idea, saying that a “taint team” created by prosecutors to set aside privileged documents is a “viable option,” while a court-appointed outside lawyer known as a “special master” may also play a role in determining which records can and cannot be viewed by prosecutors. The disclosure about Hannity, who also hosts a nationally syndicated talk radio show, came after prosecutors indicated that Cohen performed “little to no legal work” and had just one client: Trump. In response, Cohen’s lawyers said that Cohen has represented three clients in the past year — Trump, GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy and a third “publicly prominent individual” who wished to remain anonymous. Cohen's lawyers identified Hannity as the third unnamed client only after Judge Wood ruled that it must be made public. In a statement, Hannity sought to minimize his relationship with Cohen, saying he had never retained him as a lawyer. “Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter,” Hannity said. “I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective.\\" “I assumed those conversations were confidential, but to be absolutely clear they never involved any matter between me and a third-party,” Hannity said.

The reviewer starts off by mentioning their initial disappointment of not staying at their preferred choice, the Four Seasons hotel. They try to give credit when it's due by pointing out the nice, big, recently upgraded suite they were provided. However, the rest of the review is riddled with complaints regarding their overall experience during the stay. Firstly, the guest complains about the terrible acoustics, which caused significant disturbances due to the loud noise from the neighboring room. Secondly, they express their dissatisfaction with the housekeeping service, highlighting that their requests were not met, and the cleaning staff was inattentive to their needs. They also mention being disturbed by the cleaning staff during their baby's nap time, even with the do not disturb sign on. Lastly, the added cost of the crib for the baby further adds to their dissatisfaction.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).  and the situation: Two neighboring dairy farms produced milk for half the state.  Berry farm produced conventional milk, while Rose farm produced organic milk.  Answer the following question: Which farm had milk production which reduced leaching of phosphates?","output":"Based on the given background, Rose farm, which produced organic milk, had milk production practices that reduced the leaching of phosphates (PO4−). Organic milk production typically utilizes lower fertilizer application rates compared to conventional milk production, such as that employed by Berry farm. As a result, this leads to lower levels of nitrate (NO3−) and phosphate (PO4−) leaching from the farmland and ultimately lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland. The reduction in leaching is due to organic farming practices that focus on maintaining the natural balance of the soil ecosystem, promoting sustainable agriculture, and avoiding the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. While this approach can result in increased land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare, it does have environmental benefits such as mitigating water pollution and soil degradation, as well as promoting biodiversity. Despite the differences in conventional and organic milk production methods, it is important to note that animal welfare issues are not solely determined by the farm's production type. Factors such as management, housing, and the handling of cows can contribute to the overall well-being of the animals, whether they are on an organic or conventional farm. In the given situation, it is not possible to compare Berry farm and Rose farm regarding animal welfare issues without more specific information. In summary, Rose farm, which produces organic milk, would have milk production practices that reduce leaching of phosphates due to lower fertilizer application rates as a part of its organic farming approach. While there are differences in environmental impacts and production efficiency between conventional and organic milk production, animal welfare concerns are not solely exclusive to either method and depend on the specific conditions on each farm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

My specific task was to work with the rather over-excited father-to-be. He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve the given equation, -158*y + 167*y + 18 = 0, for y, we first need to simplify the equation by combining the terms with the variable y. 1. Combine the y terms: -158*y and 167*y are like terms, so we can add them together: -158*y + 167*y = 9*y Now, our equation becomes: 9*y + 18 = 0 2. Isolate the variable y: To do this, we need to get y by itself on one side of the equation. First, we will subtract 18 from both sides of the equation: 9*y + 18 - 18 = 0 - 18 This simplifies to: 9*y = -18 3. Solve for y: Now, we just need to isolate y by dividing both sides of the equation by 9: (9*y) / 9 = -18 / 9 This simplifies to: y = -2 So, the solution for the given equation, -158*y + 167*y + 18 = 0, is y = -2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Spirited Away Movie plot: Ten-year-old Chihiro (voice: Daveigh Chase in the 2002 English dub) and her parents (voices: Lauren Holly and Michael Chiklis) drive to their new home. Chihiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, especially when she notices that the bouquet her friend gave her as a good-bye gift is wilting. In sight of their new house, they take a wrong turn and follow a bumpy, decayed old road through the woods; Chihiro sees an odd old statue through the trees as they drive by. The road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park. It gives Chihiro the creeps, but her parents persuade her to go in with them and look around.After wandering across a grassy landscape and a dry riverbed, they climb a stone staircase and come to a street lined with restaurants and shops. Most are deserted, but the aroma of cooking leads them to the one restaurant that's well stocked with food -- though it's mysteriously deserted. Mom and Dad are hungry and start eating, despite Chihiro's objections. The food is delicious, and Chihiro wanders away to explore while they eat. She finds a towering, ornate building that she recognizes as a bathhouse (a spa resort); there's a train track running under it. She meets a boy (voice: Jason Marsden) in traditional dress who is alarmed to see her; he tells her to leave and get back across the river before it gets dark.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Who discovers the jewels in the gunpoweder kegs?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  That lovable know-it-all knucklehead Ernest P. Worrell, who is working as a janitor at a local college, meets a history professor named Dr. Abner Melon. After discovering an antique metal plate near a construction site, Ernest shows it to Dr. Melon who believes that it came from a giant Revolutionary War cannon called \\"Goliath\\", (named after the legendary biblical giant). Dr. Melon had previously been ridiculed by his peers for theorizing that the real Crown Jewels of England were stolen during the Revolutionary War and were actually hidden inside the long-lost cannon.  They begin to search for the artifact near the construction site and eventually locate it inside an abandoned mine. They are ambushed by historical antiquity collector and Dr. Melon's colleague Dr. Glencliff whom they then lead on an action-packed chase through the countryside. Things become more complicated for them when British authorities hear about the incident and send a team of secret agents after them to retrieve the jewels. Dr. Melon's wife, Nan, on the other hand is only after him and Ernest for the jewels. While everyone is hot on their trail, Ernest develops a deep friendship with Dr. Melon. After crashing the cannon into a forest, Ernest locates the jewels, not in its barrel as the legend describes but in the gunpowder kegs. After putting the crown on his head, he finds himself unable to get it off. Dr. Glencliff shows up, abducts him, and takes him to his clinic in an attempt to surgically remove it and kill him at the same time. Dr. Melon meets up with Nan and convinces her to help him save Ernest. Answer:","output":"Ernest P. Worrell discovers the jewels in the gunpowder kegs after crashing the cannon \\"Goliath\\" into a forest.

Unearthing deep-seated questions surrounding death, abandonment, and the sanctity of life, this grim revelation has sent shockwaves throughout the community and sparked strong reactions from residents, local officials, and law enforcement alike. This tragic incident not only highlights a shocking lapse in concern for the welfare of these lost young ones but also raises concerns over the pervasive disregard for human life in our growing world. The Harrowing Discovery The storage locker, located in the U-Haul facility in the McPhillips Street area, housed a gruesome secret that would only be unveiled as the staff began to clean out a delinquent account. In compliance with their abandoned property policy, workers were following standard procedures when they came across the unimaginable – the remains of at least three to four infants, shrouded by the darkness of the locker. The decomposing corpses were immediately reported to the local authorities, thus beginning a complex investigation into an unspeakable act. Investigation and Autopsy Results As the police work tirelessly to unravel the mystery shrouding these abandoned souls, autopsy reports have yet to reveal the cause of death or whether the infants were alive at the time of being placed in the locker. While experts in forensic pathology are striving to uncover the answers the community so desperately seeks, investigators have stated that the bodies were in a very advanced state of decomposition, a fact that has complicated their efforts in seeking the truth. Criminal Charges and the Hunt for Answers A primary consideration in the investigation is the identification of the individuals responsible for this heinous act. Determining if the deaths were a result of foul play or accidental in nature is crucial in assessing the appropriate criminal charges. Should this grim event be a result of criminal actions, it could deeply impact the community's trust in law enforcement and bring the effectiveness of Canada's justice system into question. As the investigation progresses, authorities remain focused on delivering justice for these innocent lives and ensuring that the person or persons responsible for this abomination are held accountable. Public Reaction and the Impact on Winnipeg The news of this gruesome discovery spread like wildfire throughout the city, sparking outrage, sadness, and disbelief. The tragedy has left the community in shock, with many questioning how such a horrifying event could have taken place in their city. It has also brought the topic of child abandonment and abuse to the forefront, with countless individuals expressing their concerns over the welfare of children and demanding that more significant measures be taken to prevent such occurrences in the future.  In response to the outcry, community leaders, law enforcement officials, and social service agencies are expected to work collaboratively to address these concerns and reinforce a stronger sense of safety and protection for the vulnerable in Winnipeg. Conclusion The grisly discovery of four infant bodies in a Winnipeg storage locker serves as a harrowing reminder of the fragility of human lives and the persistent presence of evil in our world. While the authorities tirelessly work to unravel the mystery surrounding this heinous event, the community wrestles with a mix of shock, grief, and anger. This tragedy stands as a testament to the increasing necessity for improved child protection measures, heightened community awareness, and stronger prevention efforts. In the end, only by remaining vigilant and fostering a more profound sense of empathy and responsibility for one another can we hope to construct a world where senseless acts like these no longer exist."},{"instruction":"Q: Deciding to go on a diet is easy, but sticking to a diet is not easy! So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . .  the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle.

News article: This article is over 2 years old      Lady Gaga has reportedly been added to a list of hostile foreign forces banned by China’s Communist party after she met with the Dalai Lama to discuss yoga.            The American pop singer, who has sold more than 27m albums, met the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader on Sunday before a conference in Indianapolis.      China cracks down on aggrieved party cadres in Xinjiang and Tibet Read more      A video of the 19-minute encounter – in which the pair pondered issues such as meditation, mental health and how to detoxify humanity – was posted on the singer’s Facebook account.      The meeting sparked an angry reaction from Beijing, which has attacked the spiritual leader as a “wolf in monk’s robes”.      The Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in March 1959, insists he is merely seeking greater autonomy from Chinese rule for Tibetans.      But China’s rulers consider him a separatist who they claim is conspiring to split the Himalayan region from China in order to establish theocratic rule there.      Following Lady Gaga’s meeting, the Communist party’s mysterious propaganda department issued “an important instruction” banning her entire repertoire from mainland China, Hong Kong’s pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily reported on Monday.      Chinese websites and media organisations were ordered to stop uploading or distributing her songs in a sign of Beijing’s irritation, the newspaper said.      The propaganda department also issued orders for party-controlled news outlets such as state broadcaster CCTV and newspapers the People’s Daily and the Global Times to condemn the meeting.      Asked by a foreign reporter whether the tête-à-tête would create a “bad romance” between Beijing and Lady Gaga, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry initially hinted that he was not familiar with the pop star’s Grammy-winning back catalogue. “Who?” Hong Lei said when asked for Beijing’s view on the singer’s meeting.      Benjamin Haas 本雅明 (@haasbenjamin) Me: will @ladygaga meeting with @DalaiLama lead to a bad romance with China?            China Foreign Ministry spokesman: who?      Hong went on to condemn the Dalai Lama’s global campaigning.      “The purpose of his visits and activities in other countries is just to promote his proposal for Tibetan independence,” the spokesperson said, according to AP. “We hope that people from the international community can be fully aware of his true colours and nature.”      All mention of the Lady Gaga controversy appeared to have been purged from the official transcript of that press conference.      On Tuesday afternoon it was still possible to download Poker Face and Bad Romance on China’s QQ Music and NetEase Cloud Music players. But a report about the Dalai Lama’s meeting with Lady Gaga appeared to have been deleted from the NetEase website.      China has previously banned artists and groups such as Maroon 5, Bjork and Oasis from performing in the country after they met with the Dalai Lama or spoke out in favour of him or Tibetan independence.      Experts suggested the American singer would have gone into her meeting with the spiritual leader with her eyes wide open as to the consequences.      “Lady Gaga knew how Beijing would react,” Bill Bishop, who runs the Sinocism newsletter, wrote on Twitter. “Good for her to show some courage, unlike most celebrities who are scared of bullying Beijing now.”      Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) Thank you for this special day. Science tells us kindness improves health, let's take care of the body of our nation pic.twitter.com/jsvlTy5pTH      Lady Gaga, whose career has survived previous bans in China, has yet to respond to China’s reported ban of her work.      During her meeting with the Dalai Lama she said: “We have to cool the system down. It’s about less heat, more cooling, more relaxation but also [being] thoughtful and strategic.” ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Lady Gaga speaking at the US Conference of Mayors where she met the Dalai Lama      Chinese fans have reacted with outrage to Lady Gaga's meeting with the Dalai Lama over the weekend.      Her social media posts about meeting with the Tibetan spiritual leader on Sunday have led to online speculation over whether she will still be allowed to perform in the country.      Lady Gaga is one of, if not the most, popular western musician in mainland China.      Yet she has irked mainland fans by showing her support for the Dalai Lama, who many feel is a figurehead for Tibetan separatism.      The Dalai Lama says he now advocates a \\"middle way\\" with China, seeking autonomy but not independence for Tibet.      'Has not considered Chinese fans'      Lady Gaga's popularity in mainland China means that she is often a major talking point for entertainment and mainstream media there.      However, such media have been notably quiet on her 26 June meeting, meaning that it largely went unnoticed.      Image copyright Free Weibo Image caption Censorship-monitoring website Free Weibo said posts mentioning the meeting were censored      Some Weibo users have had their posts censored for sharing pictures of the singer's Instagram post.      But fans have been determined to talk about it. More than 2,000 users have reacted to one prominent user MusicWars's post about the story, calling for \\"rational views on the matter\\".      Many have been quick to condemn Lady Gaga, asking whether she is \\"stupid\\" or \\"ignorant\\" on the subject of Chinese political sensitivity.      \\"She has not considered Chinese fans,\\" says -GeorgeLee-, receiving over 1,000 likes.      DIZzyF says \\"she has given up on the Chinese market\\" and Svaniscono7 accuses her of causing controversy to stay relevant in a waning market. \\"The political depths this turtle will go to, to stay ashore,\\" she says.      Yet lotusb defends her, saying \\"she should not be ashamed\\" and adding that some of her fans had \\"gone over the Chinese firewall\\" to find out why she met the Dalai Lama, and then tried to \\"painstakingly explain her reasons to other Chinese fans\\".      \\"We should respect all of her choices,\\" he added. His comment received over 400 likes.      Other concerts cancelled      Many Weibo users are also speculating over whether Lady Gaga's meeting will mean she is banned from performing in China in the future.      A number of western acts have had their gigs cancelled in the last year, purportedly because of their links to the Dalai Lama.      Image copyright Reuters Image caption Selena Gomez's gig was cancelled, reportedly because of pictures of her with the Dalai Lama      In April, pop singer Selena Gomez cancelled her August 2016 tour dates in Guangzhou and Shanghai, and rumours circulated that she had been forced to do so because of photos she shared on social media with the Dalai Lama.      Last September, Bon Jovi concerts in Shanghai and Beijing were also cancelled at the last minute, reportedly because the band featured the Dalai Lama in previous gigs.      And in July, a Dalai Lama tweet by one member of Maroon 5 was widely believed to be the reason for the American band's cancelled Shanghai September tour.

They talked about things like yoga, meditation and being kind to each other. China's government didn't like this meeting, because they think the Dalai Lama wants Tibet to be separate from China. So, they got mad at Lady Gaga and stopped people in China from listening to her music. Some of her fans in China were also unhappy about the meeting. In the past, China has done similar things to other singers who talked to the Dalai Lama."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

First question: How did AngularJS get so popular when it is so horribly designed? Second question: How did AngularJS become popular for corporate software development? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"Completing this task requires two distinct actions:  1. Analyzing and comparing the two user questions. 2. Providing a detailed and well-thought-out answer based on my understanding of the domain. First, I'll begin by analyzing the two questions: Question 1: \\"How did AngularJS get so popular when it is so horribly designed?\\" Question 2: \\"How did AngularJS become popular for corporate software development?\\" Although the two questions are similar, as they both ask about the popularity of AngularJS, they are not the same. The first question takes into consideration the perspective of the design of AngularJS and implies a judgement about its quality (assumed negative). Meanwhile, the second question is more specific, focusing on the popularity of AngularJS within the context of corporate software development. It does not imply any judgement about AngularJS's design. So, while they both revolve around the same subject (the popularity of AngularJS), the context and point of view from each question varies, making them different questions. Now, I’ll provide an answer to both questions: 1. Despite person's perspective that AngularJS is 'horribly designed', its popularity could be attributed to various factors. AngularJS was one of the first JavaScript frameworks that proposed an efficient way to develop single-page applications (SPAs). It implemented two-way data binding and dependency Injection which became popular at its time. Furthermore, AngularJS is backed by Google, which lends it credibility and visibility in the competitive landscape of JavaScript frameworks. 2. AngularJS became popular for corporate software development for many of the reasons mentioned above, along with a few additional factors. Its strong testing capabilities made it an attractive choice for large-scale projects. Its structure and pattern encourage control and organization – an important aspect when working in a team or on large-scale applications. Its community support, comprehensive documentation and being backed by a large corporation like Google made it more trusted in a corporate setting.  In conclusion, the questions are different as they are looking at the popularity of AngularJS from two different angles, one from design perspective and second from a specific application in a corporate setting. The detailed answers above provide more nuanced answers that address those specific contexts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: If I have a forgiving attitude toward someone, what do they receive? Possible A: redemption, isolation, absolution, great relief, feel better  Why is \\"redemption\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"Redemption\\" as an answer aligned with human common sense in the context of having a forgiving attitude towards someone mainly because the term reflects the emotional and psychological aspects of making amends or being forgiven. When one person forgives another, they essentially allow the individual who has made a mistake or hurt them to redeem themselves. Redemption involves a change or improvement in a person's actions or character, leading them to become a better version of themselves. When someone forgives another person, it provides the opportunity for personal growth and transformation. This often leads to a restored sense of worth and a renewed sense of purpose, which is why redemption is considered an outcome that aligns with human common sense in a forgiveness context. The other answers provided might also be related but are less direct outcomes than redemption: - Isolation: This may happen if forgiveness is not extended, and instead a person chooses to distance themselves from the person who hurt them. - Absolution: This term is more related to a formal pardon or release from guilt, which could be seen as a consequence of forgiveness. However, it does not necessarily convey the personal improvement or transformation aspect that redemption does. - Great relief and feel better: These are emotional states that the person being forgiven might experience. Relief and feeling better are valid reactions to being forgiven, but they don't represent the broader concept of redemption."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare. The place looked pretty much the same as he remembered it, only three years worse off. The strip of grass outside the back door was parched yellow and paint peeled around the blown-out windows.

It helps you grow big and strong, makes you feel fresh and happy when you wake up, and helps your brain remember all those exciting things you learn every day. You know, sometimes, people find it hard to fall asleep and may not sleep soundly. In this article, I'll teach you some cool tips to have an awesome sleep every night! 1. Get enough sleep Sleeping is like fuel for your body. Just like a car needs to fill up with fuel to go vroom-vroom, your body needs sleep to feel energetic and ready to play all day long. When you're little, you need more sleep than grown-ups! Try to get around 10-13 hours of sleep every night. It may sound like a lot, but your body will thank you for it! 2. Sleep on your side Sometimes, the way we sleep can affect how well we sleep. Lying on your side can make it easier for your body to stay comfortable all night long. Think of it like this, if you were a teddy bear and you wanted to be cozy in bed, you'd snuggle up on your side too! So, when you're getting ready for bed, try rolling onto one side, and see if you sleep better. 3. Prop your head on a pillow Pillows are like soft, fluffy clouds for your head! They can help you sleep better by making you more comfy. When you lay down in bed, place a pillow under your head so it's slightly raised. This helps your neck and head stay in a good position while you sleep. It's kind of like you're building a cozy nest for your head to rest in. How cool is that? 4. Relax once you get into bed Close your eyes and think about your favorite things. Take deep, slow breaths and imagine you're in a place where you feel safe, happy, and calm, like a magical forest or your favorite playground. Pretend that all your worries and thoughts are balloons, and let them float away into the sky. Doing this can help your body know it's time to sleep. You'll be off to dreamland before you know it! 5. Tell your doctor if you have sleep apnea Sleep apnea may sound like a really big word, but it just means someone has trouble breathing while they sleep. This can make it harder for the body to get all the rest it needs. If you or your parents notice that you snore a lot, have a hard time breathing, or wake up often at night, let your doctor know. They can help you find ways to sleep better and stay healthy. Conclusion: Sleep is really important for growing up healthy, happy, and smart. The next time you're getting ready for bed, remember these tips: get enough sleep, sleep on your side, use a pillow, relax, and tell the doctor if you have sleep apnea.

Speed is a familiar rate that expresses the distance traveled by an object in a given amount of time. Wage is a rate that represents the amount of money earned by a person working for a given amount of time. Likewise, the rate of a chemical reaction is a measure of how much reactant is consumed, or how much product is produced, by the reaction in a given amount of time. The rate of reaction is the change in the amount of a reactant or product per unit time. Reaction rates are therefore determined by measuring the time dependence of some property that can be related to reactant or product amounts. Rates of reactions that consume or produce gaseous substances, for example, are conveniently determined by measuring changes in volume or pressure. For reactions involving one or more colored substances, rates may be monitored via measurements of light absorption. For reactions involving aqueous electrolytes, rates may be measured via changes in a solution’s conductivity. For reactants and products in solution, their relative amounts (concentrations) are conveniently used for purposes of expressing reaction rates. If we measure the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, in an aqueous solution, we find that it changes slowly over time as the H2O2 decomposes, according to the equation: 2H 2 O 2(aq) ⟶ 2H 2 O(l) + O 2(g) The rate at which the hydrogen peroxide decomposes can be expressed in terms of the rate of change of its concentration, as shown here: change in concentration of reactant time interval ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ − ⎣H 2 O 2⎦ t ⎣H 2 O 2⎦ t 1 2 = − t2 − t1.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Everything You Need to Know Every year, TIME names the person (or people) who wielded the most influence in the previous 12 months. This year, TIME’s editors decided on President-elect Donald Trump. Each year, readers have questions about how the Person of the Year was chosen. Here’s what you need to know about the process. When did Person of the Year start? Though the issue has become a signature feature for TIME, it started as a whim. Over the week of New Year’s Day in 1928, the editors of the magazine struggled to find someone to write about during a slow news period—so they decided to feature one person who had been influential the year before. “This was an easy choice,” wrote then-publisher P.I. Prentice in a 1945, issue looking back on the decision. “Charles Augustus Lindbergh, who had soloed the Atlantic in only 33 hours and 39 minutes, was the hero of 1927.” As a bonus, he hadn’t appeared on the cover before, and this rectified that oversight. The cover line dubbed him “The Man of the Year” and a tradition was born. Though Wallis Simpson became the first “Woman of the Year” in 1937, the title did not become gender neutral until 1999. What does it mean to be Person of the Year? The title goes to “the person or persons who most affected the news and our lives, for good or ill, and embodied what was important about the year, for better or for worse,” as former Managing Editor Walter Isaacson wrote in the 1998 issue. That means the person is not necessarily a hero—Adolf Hitler, for example, was Person of the Year in 1938, with a cover showing him playing a ghastly organ and a cover line touting, “From the unholy organist, a hymn of hate.” Stalin got the nod twice, while the selection of Iran’s Ayatullah Khomeini in 1979, when the magazine called him “the mystic who lit the fires of hatred.” And some choices have been ambiguous; take Newt Gingrich, who was a hero to some and a menace to others. How secretive is the process? Even within the newsroom, very few people know who the Person of the Year or runners-up will be. The announcement is made publicly before the issue goes to the printers, to make sure no leaks ruin the surprise. What’s the deal with the reader’s choice poll? While TIME’s editors make the final decision about who is the Person of the Year, the magazine also invites readers to weigh in on who they think has earned the title. The online poll is a valuable way to see who Internet denizens think has most affected their lives. In early years, before the Internet, readers were invited to weigh in by mail, with their suggestions often filling the letters-to-the-editor page in the weeks before the announcement. Is it always an actual person? Sometimes, TIME has chosen to highlight the influence of an object (like the personal computer in 1982) or an archetype (like the protester in 2011). In hindsight, 1982 might have been a good time to name Steve Jobs Person of the Year, a title he never won; but ideally these non-conventional choices are meant to capture a movement that’s bigger than any one individual. Why have most of the winners been men? Last year, Angela Merkel became only the fourth woman to hold the Person of the Year cover alone. (Women who have made the cover as part of a group include Madame Chiang Kai-shek and her husband as “Man and Wife of the Year” in 1937, Melinda Gates alongside her husband and Bono in 2005, and “American Women,” collectively, in 1975.) “It seems like too few women, over the course of nearly nine decades,” former Deputy Editor Radhika Jones wrote in 2013. “You can count them on two hands. But it’s a fair reminder that for much of TIME’s history, women seldom held the kinds of positions of power that would set them up for Man of the Year status … The flip side of that observation—that men have tended to hold positions of power—is that franchises like Person of the Year have tended to privilege roles traditionally held by men.”","output":"Time Magazine has a special edition every year, called \\"Person of the Year.\\" They choose someone who had a really big influence on the world in the last 12 months. This year, they chose Donald Trump, who will be the next President of the United States. The first \\"Person of the Year\\" was in 1927, and it was a man named Charles Lindbergh who flew an airplane across the Atlantic Ocean all by himself. Sometimes, the person they choose might not be a hero, but someone who had a big impact, either good or bad. And, sometimes, they pick an object or an idea instead of a person. The editors of Time Magazine secretly pick the \\"Person of the Year,\\" and even let readers share their thoughts too."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You are given a new situation: Greg is studying the environmental impact of agriculture. He noticed that in his own state a lake near agricultural lands has been declared as a dead zone. For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A. Then he found near a national park in his state a lake is not declared as a dead zone. To further his study he labeled this zone as zone B.  and a hint : Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  Please answer this question : Which zone is a result of algae overgrowth, zone A or zone B? A:","output":"To determine which zone is a result of algae overgrowth, let's consider the given information step by step. 1. Zone A is near agricultural lands and has been declared a dead zone. 2. Zone B is near a national park and has not been declared a dead zone. Considering the hint provided: 1. Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil and runoff carries it away. 2. The fertilizer (nitrogen) ends up in bodies of water. 3. The excess nitrogen causes algae to grow out of control. 4. Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water and then die. 5. Decomposers break down the dead algae and use up the oxygen in the process. 6. This creates a dead zone where nothing can grow due to the lack of oxygen. Based on this information, Zone A, which is near agricultural lands and has been declared a dead zone, is likely a result of algae overgrowth due to excess nitrogen from the nearby agricultural activities causing the conditions described in the hint. Zone B, near a national park and not declared as a dead zone, is less likely to be affected by agricultural activities and is therefore less likely to experience the same impacts from algae overgrowth. So, Zone A is a result of algae overgrowth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

To determine whether the second sentence is true if we assume the first sentence is true, let's analyze each sentence closely. Sentence 1 states: \\"But I can tell you this much – it was not in Miss Howard's favour.\\" This sentence conveys that whatever situation or event the speaker is referring to was not advantageous for Miss Howard. The speaker also claims confidence in their knowledge about the matter, even if the listener might be skeptical. Sentence 2 claims: \\"The it WAS in fact in Miss Howard's favour.\\" This sentence directly contradicts the first one, stating that the situation or event was, in reality, advantageous for Miss Howard. Now, let's evaluate the truth of the second sentence based on the assumption that the first sentence is true. If the first sentence is true, the situation or event was not in Miss Howard's favour. In this case, the second sentence, which claims that it was in Miss Howard's favour, would be false. Therefore, if we assume the truth of the first sentence, the second sentence is false. Based on our analysis, the correct choice is: (c). no.

The Banner A:","output":"Title: \\"The Banner's Tale: Ink of Influence\\" In the bustling city of New York, amidst the glamour and bustle, there lies a powerful entity - \\"The Banner,\\" a renowned newspaper company that stands at the heart of our story. Our protagonist, Ellsworth Toohey, an enigmatic and sophisticated man, writes for The Banner. Passionate about architecture, Toohey is the newspaper's chief architectural critic and wields tremendous influence over public opinion. As we begin our narrative, Toohey is seen as an honest critic, using his platform in The Banner for the good of architecture and design. His life takes an unexpected turn when he comes across a young, ambitious, and talented architect, Henry Roark. Roark’s designs challenge traditional architectural norms, and Toohey finds himself in awe of Roark's work. However, Toohey feels threatened by Roark’s fresh perspectives, suspecting it could disrupt the status quo of architectural thinking that he has guided for years. Simultaneously, Toohey’s influence at The Banner is growing. He begins to leverage his standing not only to shape architectural discourse but to sway socio-political debates as well, delving into issues of corruption, wealth disparity, and gentrification. Through his words, he instigates change and becomes a celebrity in his own right. One day, Toohey discovers a scandal involving the Mayor, incriminating construction mafia, and substandard materials related to a city infrastructure project. Roark, being the architect for this project, emerges as a whistle-blower, threatening the peace of the city officials. Toohey, driven by his fear of losing influence and his envy toward Roark, manipulates information and frames Roark as the culprit in his column. Roark, misunderstood and persecuted, fights back with the truth. This initiates a cat-and-mouse game of public opinion, bias, and truth between Toohey, Roark, and The Banner. At the same time, an investigative journalist, Dominique Francon, who has been silently in love with Roark and his work, discerns Toohey’s misconduct. Despite threats to her own career, she decides to expose Toohey. The climax unfolds as Francon manages to obtain proof of Toohey's manipulation and the corrupt Mayor's deeds. On the big day, Roark’s designs for a revolutionary social housing project are set to be unveiled, Toohey plans to utilize this event to finally tarnish Roark’s career once and for all. However, Francon intervenes, revealing the true mastermind behind the scandal, vindicating Roark and exposing Toohey's manipulative character. As a result, Toohey loses his credibility, and his reign over The Banner comes to an end. Roark, once ostracized, becomes a symbol of hope and integrity for the city, and Francon's brave journalism renews faith in The Banner. In the denouement, The Banner pledges to uphold its mission of truthful journalism, ushering in a new era of journalism that values integrity over influence."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: China’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that a U.S. decision to disinvite China from a major international maritime exercise is “unconstructive.” A ministry statement said despite the decision, China will continue playing a role in “maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The United States announced its move Wednesday, saying Beijing’s “destabilizing behavior” in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the principles of the U.S.-led drill. “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” read a statement from Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii.

Spielberg, Austria (CNN) -- Inside the Red Bull Ring -- home to the returning Austrian Grand Prix -- Mercedes toreadors Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton were effectively left to slog it out by their peers in Sunday's race.  Hamilton flew from ninth to fourth by the end of the first lap to once again put himself into a fight with his teammate and chief world title rival.  The two Mercedes circled each other like silver sharks in the final 20 laps around the undulating circuit but each time Hamilton bit into Rosberg's lead, the German responded.

With Dylan piecing together the song's sections, and the chorus that gives the song its title only emerging on take five, the session stretched through the night and into the next morning. It was not until the fifteenth take that a full version was recorded. Dylan and the band persisted until they recorded take 24 which closed the session and made it onto the album four months later. Critic Jonathan Singer credits Griffin's piano for binding the song together: \\"At the chorus, Griffin unleashes a symphony; hammering his way up and down the keyboard, half Gershwin, half gospel, all heart. The follow-up, a killer left hand figure that links the chorus to the verse, releases none of the song's tension.\\"\\"One of Us Must Know\\" is a straightforward account of a burned-out relationship. Dissecting what went wrong, the narrator takes a defensive attitude in a one-sided conversation with his former lover.

Article: Two American scientists told the people in industrial nations that they would be much healthier if they ate more of the same kind of foods eaten by humans living more than 10,000 years ago. The scientists say that the human body has changed very little since human first appeared on earth, but the way we live has changed greatly. Our body has not been able to deal with these changes in life style and this has led to new kinds of sicknesses. These new sicknesses were not known in ancient times. So they are called \\"diseases of civilization\\". Many cancers and diseases of the blood system, including heart attacks and strokes  are examples of such diseases. Scientists noted that early stone-age people used very little alcohol or tobacco, probably none. Ancient people also got a great deal of physical exercise, but a change in food is one of the main differences between life in ancient times and life today. Stone-age people hunted wild animals for their meat, which had much less fat than farm animals. They also ate a lot of fresh wild vegetables, and fruits. They did not use milk and other dairy products, and they made very little use of grains. But today, we eat a large amount of dairy products and grain foods. We eat six times more salt than stone-age people. We eat more sugar. We eat twice as much fat but only one third as much protein and much less vitamin C. People today probably do not want to live as people thousands of years ago did, but scientists say that we would be much healthier if we ate as those ancient people did, cutting the amount of fatty, salty and sweet foods. Question: What is the main cause mentioned in the article why people suffer from a lot of new sicknesses? Answer: OPT: a). Ancient people did a great deal of physical exercise.; b).

Answer:","output":"Yes, this product review is negative. The review highlights the initial appeal and performance of the DVD player, but ultimately emphasizes the poor quality and subsequent failure of the product after a limited amount of usage.  The reviewer mentions that the DVD player appears to be a good option when looking at its features and capabilities on paper. The phrase \\"nice out of box\\" implies that the initial experience with the product was satisfactory and met expectations upon set up and first use. However, the review takes a negative turn as the writer explains that the DVD player stopped working after being used for only about 20 videos. This highlights a significant issue with the product, specifically its durability and reliability, as a properly functioning device should be expected to last longer with consistent use.  Moreover, the reviewer supports their negative experience by stating that they have read several other user reviews (mainly on CNET.com) that also report product failure. By mentioning these additional negative experiences, the writer indicates that the problem may not be isolated to their specific unit and could potentially be a widespread issue affecting many users of this particular DVD player. The closing remark, \\"Think twice before choosing this poor quality machine,\\" acts as a warning to potential buyers of the product. This statement suggests that the reviewer does not recommend the DVD player due to its poor performance and disappointing longevity.

Please answer the following question: It was not entirely true that Patch knew there was food in the mountains. He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

Based on the premise \\"In the other factor, the federal CIO tends to be constrained by organizational attributes typical of the federal sector.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The federal CIO tends to be constrained by organizational attributes\\" is true?","output":"Based on the provided premise, \\"In the other factor, the federal CIO tends to be constrained by organizational attributes typical of the federal sector,\\" it seems reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis \\"The federal CIO tends to be constrained by organizational attributes\\" is true. However, it is essential to consider the context and analyze the factors in detail to provide a comprehensive understanding of the constraints faced by the federal CIO. The federal CIO (Chief Information Officer) typically operates within a uniquely complex organizational environment, characterized by various features of the federal sector. These features may include bureaucratic structures, strict regulations, budget limitations, political pressures, and a diverse array of stakeholders. All of these factors significantly influence the decision-making process and the scope of responsibilities of the federal CIO. 1. Bureaucratic structures: The federal sector is known for its hierarchical organizational structures, which can sometimes slow down decision-making and implementation processes. The CIO, being part of this system, may find it challenging to introduce innovative methods or new technologies due to bureaucratic red tape. 2. Strict regulations: In the federal sector, adherence to laws, rules, and regulations is usually a top priority. The CIO, therefore, has to ensure that any new technology, system, or process complies with all relevant government regulations and policies. This stringent requirement for compliance may limit the CIO's flexibility in implementing innovative solutions. 3. Budget limitations: The federal CIO is often subject to budget constraints and funding allocations, directly influencing their ability to invest in new technologies or initiatives. Lack of adequate funding can significantly impede the CIO's efforts in driving transformation and modernization projects. 4. Political pressures: The federal sector is influenced by political dynamics, which extend to the CIO's role. The priorities and policies of a particular administration or decision-makers can significantly impact the CIO's ability to pursue specific objectives, initiatives, or projects. 5. Multiple stakeholders: The federal CIO is responsible for managing the information technology needs of various stakeholders, both internal and external. Balancing the competing priorities and requirements of these diverse groups can be challenging, potentially limiting the CIO's capacity to drive strategic transformation and innovation.

Heading: Start with your name, contact details (address, phone number, and email address), and the date at the top left corner of the letter. 2. Addressee: Write the name of the school principal, the school's name, and its address. If you know the specific person to whom you are addressing the letter, include their name and designation. 3. Subject Line: Write a brief and clear subject line that mentions the main purpose of the letter, such as \\"Excused Absence for [Child's Name]\\" or \\"Request to Excuse Absence for [Child's Name].\\" 4. Salutation: Greet the recipient with a formal salutation, such as \\"Dear Principal [Last Name]\\" or \\"Dear [Designation/Title].\\" 5. Introduction: With a clear and concise tone, clarify who you are and your main reason for writing the letter. Mention your child's name, grade, and class (if applicable). Briefly state the reason for the absence and the dates your child was/will be absent from school. 6. Reason for Absence: Explain the reason for your child's absence in more detail. If the absence is due to illness, mention the doctor's visit or recommendations, without going into too many specific medical details. If the absence is due to a family event or travel plans, explain the importance of the event or trip. Always maintain a respectful tone. 7. Offer Support: Offer assistance to the school by ensuring your child will complete any missed assignments, homework, or exams. Request information on any additional work or materials your child needs to catch up on. 8. Express Gratitude: Thank the school staff and teachers for their cooperation and understanding. Also, request that they notify you if there are any specific actions required for your child's absence to be officially excused. 9. Closing: End the letter with a formal closing, such as \\"Sincerely,\\" \\"Kind Regards,\\" or \\"Yours Faithfully,\\" followed by your full name and signature. 10. Proofread: Double-check the letter for grammar, punctuation, and spelling mistakes. Make sure the information is accurate and clear. Here is an example of a well-structured absence letter: [Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State, ZIP Code] [Phone Number] [Email Address] [Date] [Principal's Name] [School Name] [School Address] [City, State, ZIP Code] Subject: Excused Absence for [Child's Name] – [Dates of Absence] Dear Principal [Principal's Last Name], I am writing to inform you about my child, [Child's Full Name], who is in Grade [Grade], Class [Class], that he/she will be absent from school on [Dates of Absence].

In this case, \\"Her cats show her plenty of affection.\\" is the fourth sentence. We need to write the fifth sentence.  Part #2: The last sentence should not connect with the rest of the story. Usage: Despite the story being about Angela and her cats, the last sentence should not extend or build on the existing narrative. For example, \\"Angela decided to get a pet iguana.\\" is not connected to the story, as the focus in this sentence is not on her cats.

Usage: The new sentence should still relate to the story in some way, even if it doesn't connect to the previous narrative. For example, \\"Angela's favorite color is purple.\\", while not connected to the narrative about her cats, is still somewhat relevant because it's about Angela. This meets the criteria because it's still about the story's main character without extending the narrative about cats.

Article: Don’t assume that all employees have a universal sense of what’s right and wrong. Compile an exhaustive list of workplace standards, from acceptable language to ethical business practices. Post written standards in common areas and publish them in the employee handbook. Keep standards as specific as possible. Instead of “Be respectful,” specify that “Employees should not comment on physical appearance or make unwanted sexual advances of any kind.” Legality is important, but it doesn’t define workplace ethics. Educate employees about industry-specific regulations, but don’t limit your ethical standards to legal codes. For example, ensure that all employees know the safety standards for the products you manufacture and repair. However, set your standards beyond safety codes. If a product needs to be repaired, terminate or discipline employees if they overcharge for services by repairing parts that weren’t broken. Written ethical standards are useless if the organization’s leadership doesn’t follow them. Executives, board members, and department heads must act as role models for the rest of the organization. Furthermore, standards must be enforced consistently; a senior manager should face the same consequences as a mailroom clerk. “Do as I say, not as I do,” and “They’re breaking the rules, so I can, too,” mentalities can lead to a toxic company culture. If the head of sales fudges numbers and misleads customers to exceed quotas, your entire sales team will follow their example. The resulting company-wide ethics breakdown is a lot more difficult to handle than individual cases of misconduct. When you interview prospective employees, include specific questions that gauge their values. Hire a candidate who demonstrates strong ethical reasoning over one with dubious ethics, even if the latter has a strong professional record. For example, ask industry-specific interview questions such as, “Is it more important to meet a deadline or to ensure a product exceeds safety standards?” or “What would you do if you knew a coworker took bribes?” What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of establishing clear and specific workplace ethical standards that go beyond legal requirements. It advises companies to compile a comprehensive list of workplace standards, including acceptable language and ethical business practices, which should be posted in common areas and included in employee handbooks. Organizational leaders must be role models and enforce these standards consistently among all employees, regardless of their position. The article also recommends incorporating questions that gauge ethical values during interviews, prioritizing strong ethical reasoning over professional records in hiring decisions.

Years later, Thomas is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. Two angels fall to Earth: one, Simon, enters Thomas' home and warns him of coming events, before disappearing. The second, Uziel, a lieutenant of the angel Gabriel, is killed in an altercation with Simon. Investigating the disturbance, Thomas finds in Simon's apartment the obituary of a recently deceased Korean War veteran named Colonel Arnold Hawthorne and the theology thesis about angels which Thomas himself wrote in seminary. Meanwhile, in Chimney Rock, Arizona, Simon finds the dead veteran awaiting burial and sucks the evil soul out of the body. The medical examiner informs Thomas that Uziel's body is like nothing he has seen before: it has no eyes, no signs of bone growth, hermaphroditism, and the same blood chemistry as an aborted fetus. Among the personal effects found on the body is an ancient, hand-written Bible, which includes an extra chapter of the Book of Revelation that describes a second war in heaven and prophecy that a \\"dark soul\\" will be found on Earth and used as a weapon. Unknown to Thomas, Gabriel arrives on Earth. Needing a human helper, Gabriel catches Jerry, a suicide, in the moment of his death and keeps him in a state of limbo.

Mitt Romney speaks at the University of Warsaw Library in Warsaw, Poland, Tuesday, July 31, 2012. / AP Photo/Charles Dharapak      Updated: 11:37 a.m. ET            (CBS News) Under fire from Palestinian leaders for recent comments suggesting that Israel's economic success is borne out of its \\"culture,\\" Mitt Romney on Tuesday attempted to clarify his remarks, telling Fox News that he had not talked about \\"the Palestinian culture or the decisions made in their economy.\\"      \\"I'm not speaking about it, did not speak about the Palestinian culture,\\" Romney told Fox's Carl Cameron, in an interview taped before the candidate's departure from Poland. \\"That's an interesting topic that perhaps could deserve scholarly analysis but I actually didn't address that. I certainly don't intend to address that during my campaign. Instead I will point out that the choices a society makes have a profound impact on the economy and the vitality of that society.\\"      At a fundraiser in Israel on Monday, Romney, speaking to Jewish-American donors, compared Israel's economy to that of the Palestinians, noting a \\"dramatically stark difference in economic vitality.\\"      (Romney delivers speech in Warsaw, Poland on Tuesday.)      \\"As you come here and you see the GDP per capita, for instance, in Israel which is about 21,000 dollars, and compare that with the GDP per capita just across the areas managed by the Palestinian Authority, which is more like 10,000 per capita, you notice such a dramatically stark difference in economic vitality,\\" he said.      He drew parallels between other neighboring countries with such economic disparities, such as Chile and Ecuador and Mexico and the United States, and noted his interest, as a former businessman, in determining the source of those gaps. He also referred to the book \\"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations,\\" which concludes that culture plays key role in success of nations.      \\"Culture makes all the difference,\\" Romney told donors on Monday. \\"And as I come here and I look out over this city and consider the accomplishments of the people of this nation, I recognize the power of at least culture and a few other things.\\"      Romney did not specifically mention Palestinian culture in his remarks, but the comparison between the Israeli and Palestinian economies, and his comments about culture, seem to suggest an implicit judgment.      Romney was swiftly upbraided for the comments by Palestinian leaders, including Saeb Erekat, a senior aide to President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, who told the Associated Press the remarks were racist, and failed to note the potential impact that Israel's occupation of the West Bank have had on the nation's economy. Others have also pointed out that Israel has strict trade restrictions on Palestine, which Romney did not mention.      \\"It is a racist statement and this man doesn't realize that the Palestinian economy cannot reach its potential because there is an Israeli occupation,\\" Erekat told the AP. \\"It seems to me this man lacks information, knowledge, vision and understanding of this region and its people.\\"      (Audio of the Romney aide's altercation with the press.)      The controversy marks just one in a series of gaffes that have marked the Republican candidate's brief trip abroad. Most recently, Romney's traveling press secretary was forced to apologize after telling reporters to \\"shove it\\" and \\"kiss my a**\\" during a tense exchange in Poland.      Romney dismissed the notion that his trip to Europe had been characterized by missteps, suggesting the press is focusing on the incidents in an attempt to distract voters from the real issues.      \\"And I realize that there will be some in the fourth estate or whichever estate who are far more interested in finding something to write about that is unrelated to the economy to geopolitics to the threat of war to the reality of conflict in Afghanistan today to a nuclearization of Iran,\\" Romney told Cameron. \\"They'll instead try and find anything else to divert from the fact that these last four years have been tough years for our country.\\"      Speaking to reporters Tuesday, top Romney strategist Stu Stevens characterized the trip as a \\"great success\\" and argued American voters aren't concerned about gaffes.            \\"I think people understand that big elections are about big things. And I think that one thing we've learned about this race is only that which is important matters,\\" he said. \\"This is not a race that has been affected by small things at all. I think it means absolutely nothing to the people at home because it has no relevance to their life. It doesn't matter.\\"       ||||| Mitt Romney, in an interview with Fox News, accused the media of attempting to \\"divert\\" attention from more substantive issues by harping on his so-called gaffes overseas.      \\"I realize that there will be some that in the fourth estate ... who are far more interested in finding something to write about that is unrelated to the economy, to geo-politics, to the threat of war, to the reality of conflict in Afghanistan today, to nuclearization of Iran,\\" Romney told Fox News' Carl Cameron, after wrapping up his final event in Warsaw, Poland.      With the candidate heading home after a weeklong tour across three countries, the Republican presidential candidate expressed frustration with the way some of his remarks have been portrayed by both the media and Democratic campaign operatives. Delivering the most outright criticism of the Obama administration since he landed on foreign soil, Romney said: \\"They'll instead try to find anything else to divert from the fact that these last four years have been tough for our country. They've been years of tumult and war and we need to see a better direction taken on the part of our nation.\\"      Romney also specifically responded for the first time to remarks he made at a fundraiser in Israel Monday implying that Israel's economy is stronger than Palestine's because of culture. The comments were branded as \\"racist\\" by some Palestinian leaders, but Romney denied he was being culturally insensitive.      \\"I'm not speaking about it, did not speak about the Palestinian culture or the decisions made in their economy.\\" Instead, he said he's pointing out \\"that the choices that a society makes has a profound impact on the economy and the vitality of that society.\\"      The fallout from the remarks spilled over into Tuesday as he was finishing a tour of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and a memorial for Pope John Paul II in Warsaw. Despite the somber nature of the moment, U.S. reporters shouted questions at him and were told in colorful language by a Romney aide to show respect.      In the interview with Fox News, the GOP candidate maintained that he was \\"very pleased\\" with his trip -- which spanned six days and made stops in Great Britain, Israel and Poland -- despite the reports of foreign fumbles.      He sat down with at least a dozen foreign leaders in all three nations, yet his official meetings seemed overshadowed by media reports of missteps.      On his first day in Great Britain he became something of the British press' whipping boy when he questioned the readiness of the U.K. to host the Olympic Games. Headlines read, \\"Who invited you?\\" and \\"Mitt, the party-pooper.\\"      Romney left Warsaw Tuesday afternoon Boston-bound. He will return to the States campaigning in high gear and to speculation of an impending vice presidential pick announcement.

While overseas, Romney kept largely to his word and refrained from criticizing the president directly, yet he told Cameron that he will not be so restrained when he gets back home.      \\"I can assure you that when I land tonight, I will be back to my old and direct contrasts,\\" he said.      Fox News' Nicole Busch and Carl Cameron contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","output":"During Mitt Romney's foreign trip, he made comments at a fundraiser in Israel suggesting that Israel's economic success compared to the Palestinians' is due to its culture. This statement faced backlash from Palestinian leaders who denounced the comments as racist and lacking understanding of the region. Romney attempted to clarify his remarks in a Fox News interview, claiming that he did not specifically discuss Palestinian culture. Despite the controversy, Romney's top strategist, Stu Stevens, deemed the foreign trip a \\"great success\\" and stated that the American voters are not concerned about such gaffes, as they recognize the significance of larger issues."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices:  +negative  +positive","output":"The sentiment of a tweet focusing on working on Father's Day can be interpreted in various ways, as it largely depends on the context and the language used in the tweet itself. However, to provide a detailed analysis, let's consider two possible scenarios and the sentiment that may be associated with each. Scenario 1: Negative Sentiment In this case, if the tweet carries a tone of disappointment or frustration, such as lamenting having to work on Father's Day instead of spending quality time with family, the sentiment can be described as negative. An example of such a tweet might be: \\"Can't believe I'm stuck at work on Father's Day. Really wish I could be at home celebrating with my kids 😔 #MissingOut\\" The negative sentiment here arises from the missed opportunity to enjoy Father's Day with family, leading to feelings of sadness and dissatisfaction. The use of an unhappy emoji and a hashtag like \\"#MissingOut\\" further emphasizes the negative nature of the sentiment in this case. Scenario 2: Positive Sentiment On the other hand, if the tweet has an encouraging or grateful tone, such as expressing appreciation for having a job or acknowledging the sacrifices fathers often make to support their families, the sentiment can be characterized as positive. An example of such a tweet might be: \\"Working on Father's Day, just like my dad used to do for our family. Proud to continue the tradition of hard work and dedication 💪 #Grateful #HappyFathersDay\\" In this example, there is an underlying tone of appreciation and recognition of the sacrifices fathers make for their families. The use of an uplifting emoji, as well as positive hashtags like \\"#Grateful\\" and \\"#HappyFathersDay,\\" highlight the gratitude and positivity in the tweet. In conclusion, the sentiment of a tweet about working on Father's Day can be either positive or negative, depending on the context, language, and tone employed. A thorough examination of the tweet's content, along with the use of emojis and hashtags, can provide valuable insight into the expressed sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Just as there are good-quality grasses for putting greens, there are good-quality grasses for the fairway and rough. The quality of grass influences the roll of the ball as well as the ability of the player to \\"take a divot\\" (effectively, the ability to hit down into the ball, hitting the ball first, then hitting the turf and removing a portion of it as the club continues its arc). Fairways on prestigious tours, like the PGA Tour, are cut low. Mowing heights influence the play of the course. For example, the grass heights at U.S. Open events are alternated from one hole to the next in order to make the course more difficult. One example of this is the infamous roughs at U.S. Opens, which are often 3 to 5 inches high, depending on how close to the fairway or green the section of grass will be. This makes it difficult for a player to recover after a bad shot.  Now, I have a new situation: The golf course at the Aurora Country Club cuts their grass to  2 1/2 inches high.

Putin told Obama that their positions on Syria do not 'coincide'","output":"Title: Russian and U.S. Presidents Discuss Syria at G8 Summit: Positions on the Crisis Remain Divided On Monday, the G8 Summit held in Northern Ireland witnessed a crucial bilateral meeting between the presidents of Russia and the United States. Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Barack Obama engaged in a dialogue concerning the ongoing crisis in Syria. Both leaders expressed their respective countries' positions on the matter, which, according to Putin, do not 'coincide.' The G8 Summit, which took place in Northern Ireland, brought together the leaders of the most prominent and influential countries in the world. These nations include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This annual event provides an opportunity for the G8 leaders to address a wide range of pressing international issues, including global economic policies, environmental concerns, and matters of international security. The Syrian crisis has been one of the critical topics discussed at this year's summit due to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences and geopolitical ramifications of the ongoing conflict. During the meeting, both presidents acknowledged the escalating violence in Syria as a pressing concern that needs to be addressed immediately. The United States, along with its European allies, has been vocal in their support for the Syrian opposition. On the other hand, Russia has maintained its stance of backing the current government in Syria, led by President Bashar al-Assad. Consequently, President Putin's statement that their positions on Syria do not 'coincide' underscores the apparent disagreement between the two nations over the ideal solution to the crisis. Despite the differing viewpoints, both leaders have repeatedly emphasized the importance of finding a political and diplomatic resolution to the Syrian crisis. President Obama has noted the urgency of ensuring that the Assad regime complies with international law and respects human rights, while also considering the potential threat of extremist groups in the region. On the other hand, President Putin has emphasized the need to uphold the principles of international law and state sovereignty, expressing concerns over external intervention in Syria's internal affairs. The divide between Russia and the United States on the Syrian crisis has led to a complex diplomatic landscape, involving relationships between not only the two major powers but also other nations and non-state actors that are directly or indirectly involved in the conflict. While the United States and its allies have been calling for increased support to the Syrian opposition, Russia remains committed to engaging with the Assad government through dialogue and negotiations. Despite the discord between the Russian and U.S. positions, the meeting at the G8 Summit has underscored the importance of continued dialogue and cooperation in addressing the Syrian crisis. Both Presidents have emphasized a shared commitment to minimizing human suffering and ensuring regional stability in the Middle East. As the international community continues to grapple with the complexities of the Syrian situation, it is crucial that all parties involved, including Russia and the United States, collaborate to achieve a political solution to the crisis that respects human rights, state sovereignty, and international law. In conclusion, the recent bilateral meeting between Russian and U.S. presidents at the G8 Summit has highlighted their differing positions on the Syria crisis. While both nations have recognized the importance of finding a political solution to the issue, their approach to the central aspects of the conflict remains distinct. The dialogue between the two leaders emphasizes the necessity for continued collaboration and negotiation between all parties involved in the Syrian crisis, underpinned by a mutual commitment to finding a resolution that adheres to international law and protects human rights."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

No. Given those answer options, answer the question: If I tell you that Electron microscopes can make cells appear larger, and ask you the question \\"what can make cells appear bigger?\\", is the correct answer \\"prolactin release\\"? A:","output":"Based on the provided answer options (i) Yes and (ii) No, neither of these directly answers the question \\"what can make cells appear bigger?\\" when given the context that Electron microscopes can make cells appear larger. However, I will provide a detailed explanation of the topic. Electron microscopes use a beam of electrons to magnify an image of a sample, allowing researchers to study cellular structures and details at much higher resolutions compared to traditional light microscopes. This makes cells appear larger because it provides a significantly higher magnification and resolution. Consequently, the correct answer that relates to what can make cells appear larger in the context provided is the electron microscope. On the other hand, prolactin release is not the right answer for this question. Prolactin is a hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland, primarily associated with lactation and breast development in mammals. It can also influence cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation in various tissues but does not play a direct role in the visual magnification or enlargement of cells as observed through a microscope. In summary, the correct answer for what can make cells appear bigger, given the context that Electron microscopes can make cells appear larger, is not \\"prolactin release.\\" Instead, it is the electron microscope that enables the magnification and visualization of cells at a much higher resolution, making them appear larger."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today, I am here to tell you about a fun and delicious recipe called \\"Oven-Roasted Squash.\\" It is a super tasty and healthy side dish that you can enjoy with your family at mealtime. Let's learn how to make it! Before we start cooking, we need to get our oven nice and warm so our squash cooks perfectly. To do this, we need to preheat, or heat up the oven to 425 °F (218 °C). This might be something you need an adult's help with because the oven can be very hot!  Next step is to prepare our baking pan. A baking pan is a flat tray where we will place our squash to cook in the oven. We need to grease, or put some oil on the pan, so our squash won't stick to it while it cooks. Ask an adult to help you with the oil to make sure your pan is nice and ready. Now it's time to get our squash ready. Squash is a yummy vegetable that comes in many shapes and colors, but for this recipe, you can choose any kind of squash you like! We need to put the squash in the baking pan and mix it with some oil. This will make sure our squash gets a beautiful golden color when it cooks. Once our squash is all mixed with oil, we can put the pan in the oven that we preheated before. Remember, ovens are hot, so always ask for the help of an adult. We need to let the squash cook inside the oven for about 10 to 15 minutes. We can use this time to do a little dance, sing a song, or draw a picture to make the waiting fun! After the squash finishes cooking, we're almost ready to eat! We need to take the pan out of the oven very carefully (with an adult's help, of course!) and let it cool down for a bit. Then, we have a special ingredient to add: minced parsley! Minced means the parsley has been chopped into teeny tiny pieces. All we need is 1 tablespoon (4 g) of this minced parsley, sprinkled all over the cooked squash like magical fairy dust. This will add a yummy flavor and make our dish look extra pretty! And there you go, my little chef friends! Your Oven-Roasted Squash is now ready to be enjoyed by you and your family. This healthy and delicious side dish is sure to bring big smiles to everyone's faces.

The exact location was to be selected by President George Washington, who signed the bill into law on July 16. Formed from land donated by the states of Maryland and Virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles (16 km) on each side, totaling 100 square miles (259 km2).Two pre-existing settlements were included in the territory: the port of Georgetown, Maryland, founded in 1751, and the city of Alexandria, Virginia, founded in 1749. During 1791–92, Andrew Ellicott and several assistants, including a free African American astronomer named Benjamin Banneker, surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point. Many of the stones are still standing.A new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the Potomac, to the east of Georgetown. On September 9, 1791, the three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of President Washington. The federal district was named Columbia (a feminine form of \\"Columbus\\"), which was a poetic name for the United States commonly in use at that time. Congress held its first session in Washington on November 17, 1800.Congress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 that officially organized the District and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government. Further, the unincorporated area within the District was organized into two counties: the County of Washington to the east of the Potomac and the County of Alexandria to the west. After the passage of this Act, citizens living in the District were no longer considered residents of Maryland or Virginia, which therefore ended their representation in Congress., what would be the answer ?

Jerusalem (CNN) -- The Indian nanny who saved the life of an Israeli boy during the Mumbai terror attacks in 2008 has been granted honorary citizenship and temporary residency in Israel.  At a ceremony Monday, the Israeli interior ministry in Jerusalem handed Sandra Samuel her identity card.  \\"I hope I will honor the citizenship and love Israel. I would give my heart and soul for Israel,\\" she said.  Samuel has been caring for the boy, Moshe Holtzberg, since his parents died in the terror attacks on a Jewish cultural center, Chabad House, and several luxury hotels in India's financial capital.  They were among six people who were killed at Chabad House. Altogether, more than 160 people died in the attacks.  During the raids, 10 men also attacked buildings including the luxury Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi-Trident hotels and the city's Chhatrapati Shivaji train station.  The only surviving gunman, Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani, was convicted of murder, conspiracy, and waging war.  Moshe's father, Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg, and his pregnant wife, Rivka, ran the Mumbai headquarters of the Chabad community -- a Hasidic Jewish movement.  Samuel, who worked as a cook and nanny at the Chabad House, found Moshe -- who turned 2 just after the attacks -- standing between the bodies of his slain parents.  She returned to Israel and has continued to care for the boy, helping his grandparents to raise him.  \\"Sandra Samuel stepped into the fire and abyss and did not think of herself,\\" said Rabbi Shimon Rosenberg, Moshe's grandfather, at the ceremony. \\"She saved Moshe from the fire and we as Jews must thank and respect her.\\"  1.

How would the previous sentence be correctly capitalized?","output":"The previous sentence is correctly capitalized if written as follows: \\"It would be a long time before the dust from the books of old was removed.\\" In English grammar, the first letter of the first word in a sentence should be capitalized. In this sentence, the word \\"it\\" is the first word and it should be capitalized, as is done above. The rest of the sentence does not require capitalization as it does not contain any proper nouns, acronyms, initialisms, or any other word that usually needs capitalization. Capitalization in English is used at the beginning of sentences, for proper nouns (like names and places), and for important words in titles. It is also used for the pronoun \\"I\\", and for acronyms and initialisms (like \\"NASA\\" or \\"FBI\\"). The sentence given as an example is quite straightforward and doesn't contain special cases. Capitalization can become a bit more complex when dealing with titles, direct speech, certain types of nouns (proper nouns), or the pronoun \\"I\\".  In titles, most style guides suggest capitalizing the first and last word of the title, and all nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives. Articles, conjunctions, and prepositions are usually in lower case, unless they are the first or last word of the title. In direct speech, every separate speech starts with a capital letter, no matter where in the sentence it appears. And finally, the English language has a unique rule for capitalizing the pronoun \\"I\\", probably because of its visual impact and readability concerns. This is almost unique among languages, as most other languages do not capitalize the first-person singular pronoun. In your sentence, none of these special cases occurs, making the correct capitalization relatively simple."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hoagland Howard \\"Hoagy\\" Carmichael (November 22, 1899 - December 27, 1981) was an American composer, pianist, singer, actor, and bandleader. American composer and author Alec Wilder described Carmichael as the \\"most talented, inventive, sophisticated and jazz-oriented of all the great craftsmen\\" of pop songs in the first half of the twentieth century. Carmichael was one of the most successful Tin Pan Alley songwriters of the 1930s, and was among the first singer-songwriters in the age of mass media to utilize new communication technologies, such as television and the use of electronic microphones and sound recordings. Carmichael composed several hundred songs, including fifty that achieved hit record status. Carmichael and lyricist Johnny Mercer received an Academy Award for Best Music, Song, for \\"In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening,\\" which was featured in the 1951 film Here Comes the Groom. \\"Ole Buttermilk Sky\\" received an Oscar nomination for Best Music, Song, of 1946, but it was not the winner. Carmichael's recording of \\"Star Dust\\" in 1927 at the Gennett Records studio that includes him playing the piano solo was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In addition, it was selected for inclusion in the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress in 2004.  Carmichael was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 8, 1960. (His sidewalk star tribute is located at 1720 Vine Street in Hollywood.) In 1971 Carmichael was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame as one of its initial ten inductees. In 2007 Carmichael was inducted into the Gennett Records Walk of Fame in Richmond, Indiana. Bronze and ceramic medallions, one for each of the inductees, have been placed near the location of the Starr Piano Company's manufacturing complex, the site of the Gennett Records studio where he first recorded \\"Star Dust\\" in 1927. On July 5, 2008, a mural with his portrait was dedicated to him on the south wall of the Readmore building in Richmond, Indiana.  Carmichael is memorialized with an Indiana state historical marker, installed in 2007 in front of the former Book Nook (one of Carmichael's favorite local hangouts) on South Indiana Avenue, near the corner of Kirkwood and Indiana Streets in Bloomington. The marker is located across the street from the heart of the Indiana University campus. In 2008 the bronze Hoagy Carmichael Landmark Sculpture by artist Michael McAuley was installed at the northeast corner of the IU Auditorium on IU's Bloomington campus.  On June 27, 1979, the Newport Jazz Festival honored Carmichael with a tribute concert, \\"The Star Dust Road: A Hoagy Carmichael Jubilee\\", at New York City's Carnegie Hall.  \\"Georgia On My Mind\\", composed by Carmichael with lyrics by Stuart Gorrell, is the U.S. state of Georgia's official song.","output":"This text is about Hoagland Howard \\"Hoagy\\" Carmichael, an American composer, pianist, singer, actor, and bandleader who was born on November 22, 1899 and passed away on December 27, 1981.

Most commonly, glasses get stuck together when they are stacked immediately after they are washed. Glass expands when heated, and contracts as it cools, and this is sufficient to stick glasses together in some cases.","output":"To separate the stuck glasses effectively, it is essential to carefully manipulate their temperature to cause this expansion and contraction. Begin by filling the stuck glasses with cold water for the inner glass, and then submerge the outer glass in a container of warm water. The cold water in the inner glass will cause it to contract, while the warm water on the outside will expand the outer glass. This temperature difference will help to loosen the bond between the two glasses. You may need to gently twist and wiggle the glasses as the temperatures affect them in order to fully disengage the connection. Practice patience in the process, as rushing or using excessive force might result in the glasses breaking or suffering damage. Once they are successfully separated, you can safely dry and store the glasses individually, ensuring that they cool down before stacking them again in the future.

Step 1: Identify the relevant answer choices Since the phenomenon we are trying to explain involves light and water droplets, we can eliminate any answer choices that do not involve light or water in some form: - rain and coal - Chemical energy - Physical weathering - heat energy - energy of moving objects - snow and wind - sunlight and rain - ice and leaves We are left with these answer choices: - rain and coal - sunlight and rain - snow and wind - ice and leaves Step 2: Choose the best answer based on the explanation From the remaining choices, we know that a rainbow is caused by sunlight interacting with rain, so the best answer is: A: sunlight and rain"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The story is interesting and deals with time traveling. A virus killed a lot of people back in 1997 and a guy named Cole (Bruce Willis) is send back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990 he is arrested and put in a mental hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who probably has something to do with the virus. He also meets psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) who doesn't believe him in 1990. When Cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and re-appears in 1996 Kathryn starts believing Cole's stories. The movie constantly plays with time. Cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996, it is picked up in the future and \\"they\\" send someone. For Cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call. Things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you must keep attention. You could ask some questions but since you can't have an answer yourself it is better to agree with the movie. 'Twelve Monkeys' works as sci-fi, with some great images and a dark atmosphere, and it works as a thriller. You are never certain of what will happen next and that helps the movie. May be it has some flaws in the story, but since it is about a fictional thing like time traveling, you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy. That was the easy part for me. Now, what is this review like? Pick your answer from: (1). negative. (2). positive.","output":"This review is like the number (2). Positive.

Answer:","output":"William de Chesney (dates unknown, died in 1174) was a significant figure in medieval England, known for his service as the sheriff of Suffolk and Norfolk. He held this office on two occasions - first, between 1146 and 1149, and later between 1156 and 1162 - during which he would have been responsible for maintaining law and order and collecting taxes on behalf of the king. William married a woman named Gilla, with whom he had three children: Margaret, Clemence, and Sara. His family life would have played a crucial role in his social standing and influence within the community. As the sheriff of both Suffolk and Norfolk, William de Chesney had considerable responsibility and jurisdiction over a large area in Eastern England. He would have been responsible for overseeing the administration of justice, enforcing royal policies, and ensuring that taxes and other forms of revenue were properly collected and submitted to the crown. He was appointed to this position for his first term, which began between 1146 and 1149, and seems to have performed well, as he was reappointed for the second term in 1156. During his tenure as sheriff, William may have faced various challenges, such as implementing new laws, dealing with disputes between landowners, and curbing violence or unrest within the region. However, he must have been effective in overcoming these problems, as he managed to retain his position until the end of his second term in 1162. William de Chesney passed away in 1174, leaving behind a legacy as a dedicated and competent administrator who had successfully managed the complex tasks involved in being a sheriff of two major English counties. His descendants would likely have continued to enjoy the social and political influence he had gained during his lifetime."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Danes are celebrating the completion of the Hall, and theyre really boozing it up and partying quite loudly. Booziest of all is Hrothgar himself quite inebriated, half-naked, slurring his words and barely able to keep his balance. He's somewhat repulsive and a bit of an embarrassment to his young wife, Queen Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn).The revelers begin to chant, pounding the ground in time with the chanting. The camera pulls away from the Hall, to the snowy hills surrounding the kingdom, where the chanting and thumping have died out and all is silent. Finally, we pull into a cave miles away, where the chanting and thumping are suddenly heard at an almost unbearably loud level. We hear something in the cave screaming in pain, as if the noise is too much for it to bear.Back to Heorot, where after-hours are still rocking full-blast. The large wooden entrance doors are blasted off their hinges, the halls torches blow out, and the hearth in the middle of the hall erupts in eerie blue flames. People start wigging, as we hear same the something from the cave screaming right outside Heorot's doorway. As the Danes gird their loins and take up arms, the creature enters.It's huge, about 15 feet tall and vaguely humanoid in appearance, but clearly not all human. Its misshapen, deformed, and appears to have, instead of ears, some highly sensitive pads that serve as hearing organs. The screaming of the Danes seems to hurt the creatures ears and, enraged, he begins to tear the revelers apart, literally.Eventually, the creature makes his way to Hrothgar, who, to his credit, didn't run away in a drunken panic, but held his ground. The King demands that the monster fight him, but the creature is unafraid. It simply takes a long almost quizzical look at Hrothgar and abruptly withdraws.Back at his cave, the monster is chastised by his mother for killing men. We don't see his mother, though we catch...

Please answer the following question: It was September of 2003 and I was struggling to find work after experiencing downsizing  . I had fallen on some of the grandest challenges of my life. I found myself sitting in my house constantly worried. I decided to force myself to find some volunteer work to occupy my thoughts. The first place I sought out was the Arizona Humane Society. It offered me a program, \\"Equestrian Therapy Program\\" ,whose mission is to build self-esteem and confidence in children who have been through difficult times in their lives. Being with animals was the only time I truly felt 1 had a place in the world. But I had never been around a horse in my life. I found myself a little apprehensive during my first day--being around such large strong animals was much harder than the three cats I'm accustomed to caring for. I found that I wasn't different during my first day around these fantastic creatures from the kids who came into the program. But there is a strange transformation when one is around horses. I found myself playing the role of student, observer, teacher, mentor, worker, friend, and companion; not only to the kids,but to the horses and staff! Before long, I was good at handling the horses and kids and having a grand time working with human and animal elements equally. I realize this experience has helped me to develop my horizons in ways I never thought likely. I started this wanting to give others help and realized in doing so I was the one who really benefited the most. 1 believe the companionship and peace that comes from working with our animal brothers is something that can and will make the world a better place!

Discussion Auparavant, on soutenait que la prophylaxie réduirait la demande de soins de santé. Translate this to English?","output":"Previously, it was argued that prophylaxis would reduce the demand for health care. In the past, there was a belief that the implementation of prophylactic measures and preventive healthcare approaches would lead to a decrease in the overall demand for health care services. The underlying assumption of this argument was that preventing diseases and illnesses, particularly through early interventions and public health measures, would result in fewer people needing medical treatments and care, ultimately making the healthcare system more efficient and less burdened. Prophylaxis, in medicine, refers to any measure or intervention taken to prevent the onset or spread of diseases, infections, or other health-related conditions. These preventive measures can range from vaccinations and immunizations to lifestyle changes such as promoting good hygiene, a balanced diet, and regular exercise. Additionally, it can encompass early diagnostic screenings, pre-emptive drug therapies, and even education on the signs and symptoms of various diseases and conditions. One of the primary reasons for advocating for increased prophylactic measures is that many illnesses and diseases can be avoided or at least lessened in severity if they are detected and addressed early on. For instance, vaccinations have led to near-extermination or control of several serious infectious diseases, and regular screenings for other conditions like cancer have resulted in early detection and improved treatment outcomes. However, while prophylactic measures and preventive healthcare may indeed reduce the demand for healthcare services pertaining to specific conditions or diseases, they might not necessarily lead to an overall decrease in the demand for health care. Here are a few reasons why: 1. Aging population: As people live longer, they are more likely to develop age-related health conditions and chronic diseases. Prophylactic measures alone cannot prevent these increases in healthcare demand entirely. 2. Technological advancements: With the constant improvement of medical technology and knowledge, we can now diagnose and treat a wider range of health issues than before, resulting in an increased demand for healthcare services. 3. Rising expectations: As health care standards continue to improve, people's expectations for maintaining good health also increase, leading to a persistently higher demand for healthcare services. 4. Greater access to information: The rise of the internet has provided widespread access to an abundance of information about various diseases, medical treatments, and healthcare options, enabling people to be more proactive about their health and seek care when needed. In conclusion, although prophylaxis and other preventive healthcare measures aim to reduce the prevalence of diseases and illnesses, it remains uncertain whether they would lead to a comprehensive reduction in the demand for health care. Factors such as aging populations, technological advancements, rising expectations, and greater access to information contribute to the ever-evolving complexity of the health care landscape."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Context: Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

Article: Apple a day may poison children Children who eat an apple or pear a day may be exceeding  the pesticide  safety limit because of remains on the fruit,according to research. Using data of the British Department of Environment on pesticides on fruit collected from supermarkets,scientists thought that each day some children would get a poisonous level of pesticides. The research,published on Sunday,says the government repeatedly claims that the levels of pesticide are safe because,instead of measuring individual apples, researchers buy 10,crush them and take an average reading to see if they are safe. This is the internationally agreed method of checking remains. But government figures show that the pesticide is not averagely spread across the batch ,and one or two apples could contain 90% or more of the pesticide in the batch. It used mathematical modeling to measure exposure  to pesticides for children aged between 18 months and four years old. The pesticides involved can destroy children's hormones and some are suspected  of causing cancer. The good news for British fruit growers is that samples grown in this country had lower _ level than imported fruit,so buying home-produced fruit will reduce the danger,said Emily Diamand,one of the Earth's senior food researchers and one of the authors of the report.

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"A prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison\\" correctly answer the question \\"What was the coordinated strategy against the women's movement?\\"? Select from:  (A). no.  (B). yes.","output":"Based on the paragraph, the response \\"A prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison\\" does show an instance of the coordinated strategy against the women's movement in Iran.

Answer the following question: Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: Works well as long as you don't wash the top. Even using RaggTopp's cleaner, a soft brush or cloth, it removes the protectant from the top requiring a weekly or more reapplication to repel rain or morning dew. That gets expensive at 20 per container. Answer: Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in this review, it can be inferred that the user would not strongly recommend this product. Although the product works well in its primary function, there are certain caveats that might deter potential buyers from considering it as their go-to choice.  Firstly, the inability to wash the top without removing the protectant considerably limits the product's usefulness. The user has mentioned that, even when using RaggTopp's recommended cleaner and a soft brush or cloth, the protectant is removed from the top. This indicates that the product isn't long-lasting, which could be a significant drawback for potential customers. Washing is an essential part of maintaining items, and if it negates the product's purpose, it prevents users from optimally benefitting from the protectant. Secondly, the need for frequent reapplication adds to the product's overall cost. The user mentioned that this protectant requires weekly or even more frequent applications to maintain its efficacy against rain or morning dew. As the product is priced at 20 per container, frequent reapplication for continuous protection could make this product prohibitively expensive for some users. This creates another hurdle in recommending this product, as cost efficiency is an important factor for many consumers. The review does acknowledge that the protectant works well as long as the top isn't washed. However, given that the aforementioned factors greatly impact the product's usability and effectiveness, it can be concluded that the user would not likely recommend this product wholeheartedly. They might suggest its use only in specific cases or encourage potential buyers to consider alternatives that do not have the same drawbacks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The 5th Wave, a science fiction novel written by Rick Yancey and published in 2013, has been compared to a 2006 novel by American writer Cormac McCarthy, titled The Road. The comparison between the two novels can be attributed to the shared theme of survival amidst a dystopian and post-apocalyptic world. Both authors effectively create a sense of urgency and despair through their respective narratives. The protagonists in both novels must navigate harsh, desolate environments as they face countless dangers and challenges that threaten their lives and what remains of humanity. The Road, a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, tells the story of a father and his son as they journey through a world that has been ravaged by an unspecified cataclysm that has destroyed most of civilization, annihilating entire ecosystems and blotting out the sun. Along the way, the father and son strive to maintain their humanity and morality as they encounter other survivors, some of whom have resorted to cannibalism and other atrocious acts to survive. McCarthy's haunting and evocative prose captures the stark reality of a world where life hangs by a thread, and the bond between the father and son becomes the heart of their determination to persevere in the face of unimaginable odds. Similarly, The 5th Wave follows the story of a young girl named Cassie Sullivan who is trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world that has been devastated by a series of alien invasions, referred to as \\"waves.\\" These waves have led to the near-destruction of the Earth's human population, with billions of people lost. Cassie must navigate this desolate landscape in search of her younger brother, who has been forcibly enlisted in a military group created to fight against the alien invaders. The novel explores themes of trust, deception, and the strength of human resilience in the face of catastrophe. While the two novels differ in their specific premises – one dealing with the aftermath of a cataclysmic event and the other with an alien invasion – they both present an engrossing portrayal of the human will to survive in a world that is no longer recognizable. The comparisons between The 5th Wave and The Road are well-founded, as the novels both tackle themes of struggle, hardship, and resilience through the lens of their respective protagonists, who are determined to find hope and carry on despite the dire circumstances they face."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sgt. 1st Class Trey Scott Atwater was let out on a 50,000 bond into the custody of his supervisor at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Two members of the Army picked up Atwater after a Friday court hearing to escort him back to the base. Atwater, 30, was arrested Saturday after Transportation Security Administration screeners found an undisclosed amount of C-4 in his carry-on bag. According to a news release issued by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Texas, prosecutors have \\"uncovered no information that would suggest that Sgt.

Q: The velocity at the beginning of the time interval is called what?   A: Choose from: a. growing velocity. b. internal velocity. c. previous velocity. d. initial velocity.","output":"The velocity at the beginning of the time interval, as given in the paragraph, is called initial velocity. So the correct answer is d. initial velocity.  To further explain, initial velocity is denoted by the symbol \\"u\\" and it is the starting point for measuring any change in velocity as the object experiences acceleration over a specific time interval. The provided information highlights that uniform or constant acceleration refers to an unchanging acceleration value through that given time period, and that this relationship can be represented on a velocity versus time graph. In this case, the slope of the line depicts the acceleration, with the equation describing the curve being  where \\"v\\" is the final velocity, \\"a\\" is the acceleration, \\"t\\" is the time interval, and \\"u\\" is the initial velocity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sarah told Peyton that he rocked and Peyton was later seen during his concert with Eddie . OPT: (1). no (2). yes","output":"(1). No The two sentences appear similar, but there is a subtle difference in meaning between them. The distinction arises from the usage of \\"at his concert\\" in the first sentence and \\"during his concert\\" in the second sentence. In the first sentence - \\"Sarah told Peyton that he rocked and Peyton was later seen at his concert with Eddie,\\" the phrase \\"at his concert\\" indicates that Peyton attended a concert, suggesting that he was simply an audience member who went on to be seen with Eddie at the said event. On the other hand, the second sentence - \\"Sarah told Peyton that he rocked and Peyton was later seen during his concert with Eddie,\\" the phrase \\"during his concert\\" implies that Peyton could be the one performing at the concert, as opposed to merely attending it. In this case, he is not only an audience member but also a participant in the concert. The presence of Eddie is mentioned in both scenarios and could indicate that Eddie was attending or participating in the concert as well. To summarize, while both sentences convey that Sarah praised Peyton and he subsequently appeared with Eddie in the context of a concert, the first sentence suggests that Peyton was simply an attendee, whereas the second sentence leans towards the idea that he might have been performing.

Benjamin had some mold removal in his house unlike Samuel because  OPTIONS: A. Benjamin lived in a dry area. B. Samuel lived in a dry area.","output":"Benjamin had some mold removal in his house unlike Samuel because B. Samuel lived in a dry area. This meant that Benjamin's house had higher humidity levels, which facilitated mold growth. Samuel, on the other hand, didn't need to worry about mold, since the dry climate in his area didn't provide a suitable environment for it to thrive. In order to address the mold issue in his house, Benjamin took several steps. First, he contacted a professional mold removal service to assess the extent of the problem and provide recommendations for treatment. This was an essential step because, depending on the severity of the mold infestation, different methods and treatments might be needed. Next, the mold removal service took samples of the affected areas to determine the specific types of mold present. This step was crucial as certain species of mold can produce harmful toxins and pose serious health risks to the occupants of the house. Identifying the specific mold species would help the service properly address and remove the problem. Once the mold species had been identified, the mold removal service proceeded with a thorough cleanup and treatment process. They removed all mold-infested materials and sanitized the affected areas to kill any remaining mold spores. Additionally, they used air scrubbers and HEPA-filtered vacuums to remove mold spores from the air and prevent any potential cross-contamination. After the mold removal process had been completed, Benjamin took preventive measures to control the moisture levels in his house and minimize the chance of future mold growth. He installed a dehumidifier to help regulate humidity levels, as well as proper ventilation systems to improve air circulation. In contrast, Samuel enjoyed a mold-free living environment due to the dry climate of his area. He didn't need to invest in mold removal or humidity control measures, which saved him both time and money. However, he still needed to ensure proper ventilation for good indoor air quality and cleanliness.

Start the braid where you part your hair, pulling the front section into a French or Dutch braid as you go along your hairline. Start finishing the braid once you near your ear, using a bobby pin to secure it.  Clip the curls using a bobby pin, either pinning them to the side of your head or lifting a section of your curls and hiding the bobby pin underneath. Instead of trying to separate your curls as you braid, which can result in frizz, pull in the entire curl as you braid if necessary. Select the section of hair that you'd like to pull back and twist it a several times. Use bobby pins to pin the strand to the side of your head, or hide the bobby pinned section by securing it under a section of curls. This works well for both long and short curly hair. Put the headband on over your hair so that it rests at the curve in the back of your head. Tuck your hair into the band in 1-2 inch (2.5-5 cm) sections, starting from behind your ears. After passing a section through, you'll then re-tuck it so that it gradually forms a roll. Work your way towards the back of your head, until all the hair is tucked.  Secure the roll with a few bobby pins if needed. The band will be exposed at the top of your head. Pull together the middle-front section of your hair, twisting it into a small bun that sits on the top of your head. Secure the bun using bobby pins or small hair clips.  You can loosen the bun before pinning it so that it lays flat on your head. For longer hair, try pulling up the rest of your hair into a ponytail once the bun is secured on top of your head. Braid a 1-2 inch (2.5-5 cm) section of hair starting from above your left ear. Angle the braid to wrap back around your head and secure it with a small, clear elastic. Repeat this same process using a strand from above your right ear. Once both strands are braided and secured, cross them behind each other before pinning.

Article: Tigers are among the most admired and most feared animals in the world . When we think of a tiger, we think of danger. We think of the big teeth and large feet of it. We also think of beauty. The tiger is a hunter that hunts alone. In fact , tigers are probably better than any other land mammal  at catching large animals without help. Even so, the life of this big-game hunter isn't easy. Finding food can be difficult, especially for a tiger that is old or weak. Most of the animals it tries to attack get away. A tiger sometimes goes weeks without eating. When that happens, it may hunt animals that can be dangerous even for a tiger. When they are in a bad situation, some tigers may even attack humans. But in fact, tigers kill very few people each year. Most tigers run away when they see people. What tigers have done to people can't compare to what people have done to tigers. Over the last 200 years, we have almost killed tigers in the wild . Today, the tiger is one of the most endangered animals on Earth. A tiger may live 20 years or more, if it is not disturbed by humans. Female  tigers usually live longer than male tigers, because the males live more dangerously. It isn't easy for people to tell a male from a female unless the female happens to be with her babies.Only females take care of the young. The big difference between males and females is size. Male tigers are much bigger. Tigers are big eaters. In a single year, one tiger must eat about 70 deer or other large animals. That is one reason why tigers hunt alone. If they lived in big groups, they could never find enough animals to feed them all. Question: According to the passage, why do tigers hunt alone? Options: A: They can run faster hunting alone.

Write an article based on this \\"Air accident investigators have said a reduction in airspeed that caused the fatal crash of a helicopter off Shetland was not noticed by the pilots.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Investigator's Report Reveals Overlooked Speed Reduction Led to Fatal Shetland Helicopter Crash Introduction: A recent air accident investigation report revealed that the pilots failed to notice a significant reduction in their helicopter's airspeed during a flight off the coast of Shetland. This oversight ultimately resulted in a tragic crash, leaving a deep impact on the aviation community. In this article, we will explore the details of the incident, the findings of the investigators, and the importance of pilot vigilance in ensuring flight safety. Paragraph 1: The Incident The catastrophic event unfolded when a helicopter carrying passengers and crew took off from the Shetland Islands, an archipelago situated to the north-east of Scotland. Shortly into the flight, a sudden yet critical loss of airspeed occurred, which the pilots on board failed to detect. Consequently, the helicopter plummeted into the sea, resulting in the loss of life and significant damage to the aircraft. Step 1: Briefly introduce the incident. Step 2: Establish the location of the incident. Step 3: Mention the consequences of the airspeed reduction. Paragraph 2: Investigator's Findings Upon investigation, the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) noted that while the helicopter's autopilot system was engaged at the time of the incident, the required airspeed input was not maintained. This significant reduction in speed eventually resulted in the helicopter's loss of altitude and eventual crash. Regrettably, neither pilot on the flight deck took notice of the speed anomaly before it was too late to revive their aircraft's stability. Step 1: Introduce the Air Accident Investigation Branch as the investigating organization. Step 2: Describe the autopilot engagement and its failure in maintaining airspeed. Step 3: Mention that investigators found that pilots did not notice the decline in speed. Paragraph 3: Importance of Pilot Vigilance This tragic incident serves as a vital reminder of the critical role of pilot vigilance in ensuring flight safety. Although modern-day aircraft are equipped with advanced technology and autopilot systems designed to enhance safety and facilitate flight, the responsibility ultimately falls on human pilots to monitor the systems and make appropriate decisions. Continual training, awareness of potential hazards, and regular review of aircraft performance data are all essential aspects of maintaining pilot vigilance. Step 1: Use the incident as a lesson, emphasizing the importance of pilot vigilance. Step 2: Acknowledge technological advancements but clarify the need for human monitoring. Step 3: Suggest methods for maintaining and improving pilot vigilance. Conclusion: The sobering findings of the AAIB investigation into the Shetland helicopter crash bring the issue of pilot vigilance to the forefront. While autonomous systems continue to gain prominence in aviation, it remains the duty of pilots to stay vigilant and maintain a comprehensive awareness of their aircraft's performance. By doing so, pilots can continue to deliver safe, secure, and reliable air travel for passengers and crew members alike. Step 1: Recap the significance of the findings in the investigation. Step 2: Reinforce the importance of pilot vigilance in the age of advanced technology. Step 3: Emphasize the intended outcome: safe and reliable air travel for passengers and crew."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Plymouth Colony lost close to eight percent of its adult male population and a smaller percentage of women and children to Indian warfare or other causes associated with the war.:332 Indian losses were much greater, with about 2,000 men killed or who died of injuries in the war, more than 3,000 dying of sickness or starvation, and another 1,000 Indians sold into slavery and transported to other areas, such as the British-controlled islands in the Caribbean. About 2,000 Indians escaped to other tribes to the north or west; they joined continued Indian attacks from those bases well into the next century. Historians estimate that, as a result of King Philip's War, the Indian population of southern New England was reduced by about 40 to 80 percent. The war escalated from a local conflict to involve most of southern New England and reached to other east coast areas as well. The war killed nearly as high a percentage of the Indian population as the plagues of 1616-19. It is estimated that the Indians of New England made up almost 30 percent of the total regional population, but the Indian population had dropped to less than 15 percent by 1680, five years after the war began.:345 The settlers incurred an enormous tax burden to pay for the war, which held back the economy of the entire region for many years.:346 Based on the above article, answer a question. What killed more Indians, sickness and starvation, or war?","output":"Sickness and starvation killed more Indians than the war. In the article, it says that about 2,000 men were killed or died of injuries in the war, while more than 3,000 died of sickness or starvation. So, more Indians died from sickness and starvation than from the war."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What moves through grooves?\\"  Context: \\"Towards the center, at the end of the groove, there is another wide-pitched section known as the lead-out. At the very end of this section the groove joins itself to form a complete circle, called the lock groove; when the stylus reaches this point, it circles repeatedly until lifted from the record. On some recordings (for example Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles, Super Trouper by Abba and Atom Heart Mother by Pink Floyd), the sound continues on the lock groove, which gives a strange repeating effect. Automatic turntables rely on the position or angular velocity of the arm, as it reaches the wider spacing in the groove, to trigger a mechanism that lifts the arm off the record. Precisely because of this mechanism, most automatic turntables are incapable of playing any audio in the lock groove, since they will lift the arm before it reaches that groove.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"A stylus moves through the grooves of a vinyl record."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Now, James's monthly house notes have dropped from 796 - more than twice her monthly income - to an affordable 247. Some of the people who took advantage of her through a questionable loan program were sent to jail. \\"I don't know what I would have done without Legal Services,\\" said James. \\"They solved a lot of my problems.\\" James is one of more than 3,000 clients served last year by MALS, which provides assistance for civil matters, such as domestic abuse and family-related problems, Social Security and Supplemental Security Income, veterans, housing and consumer fraud cases.

Solve 16*m + 67 = 19 for m.","output":"Step 1: In order to find the value of 'm' in the arithmetic equation 16*m + 67 = 19, we need to isolate 'm' on one side of the equation. This involves two main steps - first, deal with the addition or subtraction, and then deal with the multiplication or division. Step 2: To isolate 'm', we need to get rid of '+ 67' on the left-hand side of the equation. Doing so involves performing subtraction on both sides of the equation to maintain equality - if we subtract 67 from the left side, we must also subtract 67 from the right side. Thus, we rewrite the equation as follows:    16*m + 67 - 67 = 19 - 67 The resulting equation becomes:    16*m = 19 - 67 Step 3: Evaluate the expression on the right-hand side (19 - 67). This results in:    16*m = -48 Step 4: Now, to isolate 'm', we need to get rid of the '16 *' part. Similar to what we did before, this involves doing the exact opposite operation on both sides of the equation. Multiplication becomes division in this case. Thus, we divide both sides by 16. The equation becomes:     m = -48 / 16 Step 5: Evaluate the expression on the right-hand side (-48 / 16) to find the value of 'm'. The final solution is:     m = -3 So, the solution to the equation 16*m + 67 = 19 is m = -3."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Before solving for t, we should first combine like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side of the equation, we have -1492*t - 303*t. Since both terms have t as the variable, we can combine them by adding their coefficients: -1492*t + (-303)*t = (-1492 - 303) * t = -1795 * t On the right side of the equation, we have -75107 + 9903 - 4801. We can simplify this by adding the constants together: -75107 + 9903 - 4801 = (-75107 + 9903) - 4801 = -65204 - 4801 = -70005 Now, our simplified equation is: -1795 * t = -70005 Step 2: Solve for t. Now that we have simplified the equation, it's time to solve for t. We have a single term with the variable t on the left side, and a constant on the right side. To isolate t, we can divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of t, which is -1795: -1795 * t / -1795 = -70005 / -1795 t = 39 So, the value for t is 39."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

OPTIONS: 1). yes; 2). no;","output":"2). no; A more detailed and accurate long answer to the question would be: Regional languages, also known as dialects, have been an integral part of Italy's linguistic and cultural heritage. Each region in Italy has its own specific dialect, which is often tied to local history, traditions, and pride. However, not all Italians might feel comfortable speaking these dialects outside of their region or in various social scenarios. One of the primary reasons behind this is the prevalence of Standard Italian, which emerged as the official language of Italy when the country was unified in the 19th century. Some Italians might avoid speaking their regional language in formal settings such as the workplace, educational institutions, or governmental offices. In such contexts, they might prefer using Standard Italian to portray a sense of professionalism, unity, and adherence to the norms. It is generally considered appropriate and expected to communicate in the official language when dealing with representatives of other regions or countries, particularly in diplomatic and international relations. Another aspect to consider is the social connotations tied to regional languages. In some cases, certain dialects may be perceived as lower-class, uneducated, or rural, which might make some individuals hesitant to speak their regional language when interacting with people from different parts of Italy or in cosmopolitan cities. Lastly, communication barriers might be another reason for avoiding regional languages in certain scenarios. Italians from diverse regions might face difficulties understanding each other's dialects due to the variations in pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. In such instances, utilizing Standard Italian facilitates communication and mutual understanding. While regional languages remain an essential part of Italy's rich cultural fabric, some Italians might choose to avoid speaking them in formal settings, with people outside their region, or where they perceive a possible social stigma.

Please answer the following question: This article: The central square in Covent Garden is simply called \\"Covent Garden\\", often marketed as \\"Covent Garden Piazza\\" to distinguish it from the eponymous surrounding area. Designed and laid out in 1630, it was the first modern square in London—originally a flat, open space or piazza with low railings. From about 1635 onwards there were many private residents of note, including the nobility, living in the Great Piazza. A casual market started on the south side, and by 1830 the present market hall had been built. The space is popular with street performers, who audition with the site's owners for an allocated slot. The square was originally laid out when the 4th Earl of Bedford, Francis Russell, commissioned Inigo Jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around the site of a former walled garden belonging to Westminster Abbey. Jones's design was informed by his knowledge of modern town planning in Europe, particularly Piazza d'Arme, in Leghorn, Tuscany, Piazza San Marco in Venice, Piazza Santissima Annunziata in Florence, and the Place des Vosges in Paris. The centrepiece of the project was the large square, the concept of which was new to London, and this had a significant influence on modern town planning as the metropolis grew, acting as the prototype for the design of new estates, such as the Ladbroke Estate and the Grosvenor Estate. Isaac de Caus, the French Huguenot architect, designed the individual houses under Jones's overall design.The church of St Paul's was the first building, and was begun in July 1631 on the western side of the square. The last house was completed in 1637. Seventeen of the houses had arcaded portico walks organised in groups of four and six either side of James Street on the north side, and three and four either side of Russell Street. These arcades, rather than the square itself, took the name Piazza; the group from James Street to Russell Street became known as the \\"Great Piazza\\" and that to the south of Russell Street as the \\"Little Piazza\\".

Write a summary based on this article: Image caption The device did not contain metal, which would make it difficult to detect in an airport security check      The man who foiled a Yemen-based al-Qaeda \\"underwear bomb\\" plot was a British man of Middle Eastern origin, according to US media.      UK officials declined to comment on the reports, but earlier this week the US said foreign agencies were involved in the operation.      The agent was sent by al-Qaeda to attack a US-bound plane, but left Yemen and gave the device to US intelligence.      The US insists the bomb never posed a threat to the public.      Western passport-holders have long been seen as prime targets for militant groups seeking to plan attacks.      However, as well as reporting that the secret agent was a British citizen, NBC News in the US also says UK intelligence agencies were \\"heavily involved\\" in his recruitment.      The BBC's Paul Adams, in Washington, says it is unorthodox for intelligence agencies to disclose details about each others' operations.      If true, the revelations about the undercover agent could raise eyebrows in UK intelligence agencies, he adds.      The US is conducting an inquiry into the leak of information, which Defence Secretary Leon Panetta said could hamper intelligence gathering.      \\"When these leaks take place, I can't tell you how much they damage our ability to be able to pursue our intelligence efforts,\\" Mr Panetta told reporters at the Pentagon.      'Custom fit'      Details of the operation have emerged over the course of this week.      US intelligence learned in April of a plot by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), based in Yemen.      The group planned to attack a US-bound plane with a sophisticated bomb hidden in a passenger's underwear, an updated version of a 2009 device that evaded airport security.      Officials have described the bomb as a \\"custom fit\\" device that would have been hard to detect in airport security checks.      It was said to have two forms of detonator and no metal parts, making it more sophisticated than the device that failed to explode on Christmas Day 2009.      It then emerged that the would-be bomber was an undercover agent who had been recruited to infiltrate the group.      When he was dispatched by al-Qaeda to undertake the suicide mission, the agent left Yemen with the bomb and delivered it to the CIA.      The agent is now reported to be safe in Saudi Arabia while FBI analysts in the US are studying the device.      USS Cole link killed      Experts quoted in the US media say both the 2012 and 2009 bombs bear the hallmarks of AQAP master bomb-maker Ibrahim Hassan Tali al-Asiri.      His name has also been linked to a plot in October 2010 to bomb a Chicago-bound plane using a device disguised as a printer cartridge. That plan, which AQAP claimed as its own, was also foiled with the help of the Saudi authorities.      The undercover agent is also reported to have provided intelligence that led the CIA to conduct a drone strike in Yemen on Sunday that killed AQAP leader Fahd al-Quso.      Quso was wanted in connection with the bombing of the American destroyer USS Cole in Yemen 12 years ago. The US was offering a 5m (£3.1m) reward for information leading to his capture or death.      In a separate development on Tuesday the Pentagon said the US had restarted military training with security forces in Yemen, which had been put on hold because of political unrest. ||||| NBC's Robert Windrem reports that al-Qaida's would-be suicide bomber was actually a British national, working through British intelligence to infiltrate the terror organization in Yemen.      The spy who helped Western intelligence agencies thwart a plot to bomb a U.S.-bound airliner was a British national of Middle Eastern origin, sources tell NBC News.      The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, also say that British intelligence was \\"heavily involved\\" in recruiting the spy, who has not yet been identified publicly, and penetrating the plot by al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula to detonate a new, more sophisticated underwear bomb aboard a U.S. jetliner.      A senior U.S. counterterrorism official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, would say only that multiple friendly security services were involved in the operation. Saudi Arabia's counterterrorism operation also were involved, other U.S. officials have told NBC News.      U.S. and British officials have long reported that AQAP has wanted to recruit Muslims with Western passports to carry out attacks like the one revealed this week. As an example, the officials cited AQAP’s recruitment of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who failed in the Christmas Day 2009 attempt to bring down Northwest Airlines Flight 253 over Detroit.      Related stories      Yemen Terror group may have made more underwear bombs, US officials say      Lawmakers vow investigation of bomb plot leak      Insider who thwarted bomb plot was supposed to carry it out      U.S. officials have said previously that the bomb -- a refined version of an “underwear bomb” used in two previous failed terror plots -- was driven out of Yemen by the insider into Saudi Arabia. It is now in the hands of U.S. bomb experts at the FBI labs in Quantico, Va., where experts have been examining it for a week, the officials said. The infiltrator also is safely out of Yemen.      The insider also provided information that allowed the U.S. to launch a Predator drone strike that killed AQAP's operations chief, Fahd al-Quso, senior U.S. officials told NBC News on Tuesday.      Evan Kohlmann, NBC counterterrorism analyst, said he found earlier reports that the spy was a Saudi national not very credible.      “AQAP was going to give a suicide bomb to someone with a Saudi passport?” Kohlmann asked rhetorically. “AQAP has been looking for bombers with Western passports, not those who would raise suspicions.”      He noted that Abdulmutallab, who tried to detonate an earlier version of the underwear bomb aboard the Northwest flight, better fit the profile AQAP was looking at: a young upper class college student with a Nigerian passport and a multiple-entry U.S. visa. A British national would attract even less attention, he said.

The agent is of Arabic origin but holds a British passport, according to Mustafa Alani, director of security studies at the Gulf Research Center. Alani was briefed on the operation by Saudi counterterrorism officials.      The agent, whom another source said had Saudi roots, lived for a long time in the UK and at some point fell in with jihadist sympathizers, Alani told CNN. That made him an attractive target for Saudi counterterrorism agencies, which recruited him about a year ago, Alani said.      His background gave him the credibility to infiltrate AQAP, the Yemeni-based branch of the terrorist organization, which is exceptionally careful about whom it accepts and trusts. At the same time, his possession of a British passport enhanced his appeal to the terror group -- because he could travel without a visa to the United States.      According to Alani, the agent was sent into Yemen as a potential suicide bomber after the Saudis heard from other informants that a new AQAP plot was in the works. The agent enrolled in an Arabic language school in Yemen in the hope of being talent-spotted by the group.      JUST WATCHED Saudi agent in plot had UK passport Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH Are fliers safe from new al Qaeda bomb? 02:44 PLAY VIDEO      AQAP fell for the bait and the mole connected with the group. After he joined them he had to handle the tremendous pressure of what discovery by al Qaeda would entail, said Alani.      Two or three months ago, the agent learned that the group was working on a new device to bomb a U.S.-bound airplane, and he contacted Saudi counterterrorism officials from Yemen. At this point they informed the Americans of the potential threat, and that they had a mole inside the group, according to Alani.      The agent was later provided training in how to use the explosive device in a training facility in Yemen, possibly inside a safe house, according to Alani.      \\"He received instruction how to how to avoid detection at the airport, how to behave,\\" Alani told CNN. \\"Apparently he was able to convince al Qaeda that he is genuinely ready to carry out the mission.\\"      Alani said his understanding was that AQAP intended the would-be suicide bomber to fly through a Gulf country to connect to a U.S. bound flight.      The Saudi operation culminated with the agent and another Saudi informant -- likely his handler -- being whisked out of Yemen, Alani said. The Saudis knew they would never be able to use the agent again, and they and smuggled him through a number of Middle Eastern countries to protect him from al Qaeda retaliation, Alani told CNN.      \\"My information that he was pulled out after the device was handed to him, and they ordered the green light to carry out the operation. I don't think he was pulled out prematurely,\\" Alani told CNN.      \\"The family is secure, and the man is outside the Middle East,\\" Alani told CNN. The device that AQAP bomb-makers had built for the mole was flown from Yemen to Saudi Arabia by Saudi counter-terrorism agents and handed over -- around April 20th -- to U.S. intelligence officials. They subsequently took it to the United States for forensic analysis, Alani told CNN.      He also said the intelligence community remained deeply worried that similar devices might be unaccounted for and that AQAP may be planning a similar operation. The details collected from the device brought out of Yemen could allow for important counter-measures to thwart al Qaeda's next operation.      The recovered device had two triggering mechanisms -- one involving a chemical reaction and one designed to be set off manually -- to maximize the chances that the device would work, said Alani. It contained 250-300 grams of the high explosive PETN, a slightly smaller amount than that used in two printer cartridges for an October 2010 plot aimed at blowing up cargo planes en route to the United States.      Those devices were intercepted after a tip by Saudi counterterrorism, and had the potential to bring down a plane, according to British and U.S. officials. The underwear device used in the attempt to bring down a U.S. airliner on Christmas Day 2009 contained about 200 grams of the same explosive.      Saudi counter-terrorism officials believe the device was likely constructed by a team working under the supervision of Ibrahim al-Asiri, AQAP's chief bomb-maker. When the device used in the Christmas Day plot was examined, a set of fingerprints matched those of al-Asiri held in a Saudi database.      Alani said al-Asiri was the target of a drone strike last year after Yemeni and Saudi intelligence developed information about his possible location. The Yemenis, he said, subsequently established that another member of the group and not al-Asiri was killed in the strike.      Meanwhile, a source working closely with U.S. intelligence agencies and the military told CNN that al Qaeda's Yemeni affilliate now has \\"a whole outfit designated to target the U.S. homeland.\\" The United States believes AQAP is working on \\"several types of bombs\\" that could get past airport X-ray screening machines.      Counterterrorism officials in the Gulf and the United States say that AQAP's expansion in Yemen over the past two to three years has given it greater breathing room and resources to plot attacks against the United States.      \\"This is going to give them a major advantage in future operations,\\" Alani told CNN.      The group operates out of rudimentary training camps in southern Yemen. Thought it has not yet succeeded in any bomb plot targeting Americans, observers say there are several bombmakers and a group of would-be suicide bombers working inside the group.      \\"What I think is concerning to myself and other people is that it seems the talent of the organization is getting better,\\" said Gregory Johnsen, a Near East studies scholar at Princeton University. \\"That is, they are much more capable of carrying out attacks. So when something fails, like the Christmas Day plot in 2009 or again, the cartridge plot in 2010, the organization is able to adapt. And the next time they come back, they present a better and more lethal threat. I think that's what has a lot of people in U.S. and Saudi intelligence quite concerned.\\"      CNN has previously reported that al-Asiri has been involved in training both bombmakers and suicide bombers. The U.S.-affilliated source said al-Asiri is now not making all the components himself, giving the group extra security and the advantage of having multiple manufacturing capabilities if al-Asiri were to be killed.      The source also confirmed that the device the mole turned over had no metallic parts and an advanced detonation system to improve the chances the entire bomb would explode. AQAP bomb designs are aimed at hiding explosives in clothing, camera lenses and animals, according to the source.      And the fundamental growth in AQAP's ability to control territory has made them tougher to target since the 2009 incident, Johnsen said.      \\"AQAP at that time was about two to three hundred members, and it controlled no territory in Yemen. Now, two and a half years later, the terror group has more than tripled in strength to over a thousand members and it controls a great amount of territory in southern Yemen,\\" Johnsen said. He said the group controls towns, is running its own police department and in some places has established court systems.      \\"It's providing services -- electricity and water -- to some of the citizens, and really it sees itself in parts of southern Yemen as a government,\\" he said. |||||","output":"A British citizen of Middle Eastern origin was reportedly the agent who foiled an al-Qaeda \\"underwear bomb\\" plot in Yemen.

Special receivers were mounted in He 111s, with a radio mast on the bomber's fuselage. The system worked on a higher frequency (66–77 MHz, compared to Knickebein's 30–33 MHz). Transmitters on the ground sent pulses at a rate of 180 per minute. X-Gerät received and analysed the pulses, giving the pilot both visual and aural \\"on course\\" signals. Three beams intersected the beam along the He 111's flight path. The first cross-beam acted as a warning for the bomb-aimer to start the bombing-clock which he would activate only when the second cross-beam was reached. When the third cross-beam was reached the bomb aimer activated a third trigger, which stopped the first hand of the equipment's clock, with the second hand continuing. When the second hand re-aligned with the first, the bombs were released.

Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.

Combine the like terms (86*c and 54*c) on the left side of the equation: (86*c + 54*c) + 617 - 1425 = 2552 2. Add 86*c and 54*c together: 140*c + 617 - 1425 = 2552 3. Combine the constants (617 and -1425) on the left side of the equation: 140*c + (-808) = 2552 4. Simplify the equation to show subtraction: 140*c - 808 = 2552 5. Now, isolate the variable (c) by adding 808 to both sides of the equation: 140*c = 3360 6. Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 140 to solve for c: c = 3360 / 140 7.

Do these sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Yes, these sentences essentially mean the same thing but have slightly different structures. Both sentences provide the same information about John Ikin, stating that he was born in 1957 in Lower Hutt, New Zealand, and that he is a furniture designer from New Zealand. Here's a breakdown of the similarities and differences between the two sentences: 1. In the first sentence, \\"John Ikin (born 1957 in Lower Hutt) is a furniture designer from New Zealand,\\" the writer starts with the full name, John Ikin, and immediately provides parenthetical information about his birth year and location. The main thrust of the sentence is that John Ikin is a furniture designer from New Zealand. 2. In the second sentence, \\"Humphrey John Ikin (born 1957 in Lower Hutt) is a New Zealand furniture designer,\\" the writer uses the full name, Humphrey John Ikin, to start the sentence and gives the same parenthetical information about his birth year and location. The primary focus of the sentence is that Ikin is a New Zealand furniture designer. The main structural difference between the two sentences is the order of information presented. The first sentence emphasizes Ikin's occupation as a furniture designer from New Zealand, while the second sentence gives a slight preference to his nationality by stating he is a \\"New Zealand furniture designer.\\" Another minor difference is that the second sentence includes Ikin's first name, Humphrey, which was omitted in the first sentence. This additional detail doesn't change the sentences' overall meaning, but it provides a more comprehensive view of Ikin's full name. In summary, the two sentences convey the same message, indicating that John Ikin is a furniture designer from New Zealand who was born in 1957 in Lower Hutt. They differ minutely in structure and detail, with the second sentence placing slightly more emphasis on Ikin's nationality and providing his complete first name."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I would not have known about this film if not for its \\"surprise\\" Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature film. Thankfully, it came to pass that I was able to watch this animated little treasure. The story is about the child Brendan who was the nephew of the imposing and overprotective Abbot of the township of Kells. The main pre-occupation of the Abbot is to build a wall to protect Kells from the attacking Vikings. One day, Aiden, the renowned illustrator from Iona, sought refuge with them. Aiden opens Brendan's eyes to the art of illustration and the lure of the outside world. Along the way, Brendan befriended the white forest sprite Aisling, as he sought to recover an ancient crystal invaluable to the meticulous art of book illustration. \\"The Secret of Kells\\" is unlike most of the animation released these days. It is a throwback of sorts as the illustrations are done in stark geometric lines and design without much care for realism, as much as symbolism. The movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simplistic yet fluid animation style used at the beginning sequence of \\"Kung Fu Panda.\\" However, it is the magnificent use of color that is the main source of wonderment for the audience. The reds used in the Viking invasion sequence is unforgettably haunting. Try to catch this quiet gem of a film. It is a welcome respite from all the senseless bombast of current animated fare such as \\"Monsters vs. Aliens\\" and the like. The sparse Celtic musical score is effective in evoking the sense of fantasy that imbues the film. OK, the story might be a little shallow and the ending a bit wanting. I would have liked to know more about the Book that Brendan and Aiden was working on. But the clear star of this film is clearly its amazing stylized artwork, said to be based on the artwork in the real Book of Kells. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","output":"This review is predominantly positive. The reviewer appreciates the unique animation style, the magnificent use of color, and the effective sparse Celtic musical score.

Today, we will dive into the specifics of what you need to consider when picking out a shirt and how to measure your neck and sleeve length accurately. 1. Pick the Color of Your Shirt: The first step in selecting a shirt is choosing the color that best suits your tastes and preferences. Keep in mind that various colors can evoke different emotions and impressions. Whether you prefer a more conservative or bold approach, the appropriate color will help you make a statement and create a polished look. To make the decision easier, it may be helpful to think about the purpose of the shirt – whether it's for work, casual attire, or something more formal. Step-by-step guide:  1.1. Identify the purpose of the shirt.  1.2. Decide on a color palette (neutral, bold, or mix-and-match) given the occasion.  1.3. Choose a specific hue from that palette to fit your personal style.  2. Pick the Pattern of Your Shirt:  Along with color, the pattern of your shirt adds visual interest and defines your own sense of style. Some popular choices include solids, stripes, checks, and plaids. Like color, the pattern should also be chosen based on the occasion and your personal preference.  Step-by-step guide:  2.1. Assess the compatibility of various patterns with your chosen color.  2.2. Consider the formality of the occasion.  2.3. Select a pattern that speaks to your personality and complements the other components of your outfit. 3. Pick the Collar of Your Shirt:  The collar serves as the focal point of any shirt. Various collar styles are available, from classic to casual, including spread, button-down, and cutaway, among others. Each collar style adds a different touch to your overall look, so choose wisely.  Step-by-step guide:  3.1. Consider your face shape and how each collar style will frame it.  3.2. Think about the tie knot you will wear if the occasion calls for one.  3.3. Choose a collar style that complements both your face and the intended outfit. 4. Pick the Fit of Your Shirt:  The fit of your shirt determines its comfort and how it flatters your body shape. Common fit options include slim, regular, and relaxed. Depending on your build and preferred style, choose the fit that suits you best.  Step-by-step guide: 4.1. Assess your body type and decide which fit will best compliment it.  4.2. Consider your comfort preferences: loose, form-fitting, or somewhere in between.  4.3. Select a fit accordingly. 5. Pick the Weave of Your Shirt:  The weave plays a significant role in the appearance, weight, and feel of a shirt. It can impact breathability, durability, and the overall aesthetic. Some common weaves are Oxford, twill, and poplin. Choose a weave that suits the chosen fabric and intended use. Step-by-step guide: 5.1. Learn about the characteristics of different weaves.  5.2. Match the weave to the formality of the occasion and your personal preferences.  5.3. Choose a weave based on its benefits and how it complements the other shirt elements. 6. Pick the Fabric of Your Shirt:  Fabrics vary widely in terms of quality, durability, and comfort. Popular options include cotton, linen, and synthetic blends. Consider factors such as climate, personal comfort, and required care when making your choice. Step-by-step guide: 6.1. Familiarize yourself with the properties of different fabrics.  6.2. Consider your intended use of the shirt and any climate-related concerns.  6.3. Choose a fabric based on its breathability, care requirements, and comfort.  7. Measure and Determine Your Neck Size and Sleeve Length: To ensure a perfect fit, accurate neck and sleeve measurements are crucial. Before buying a shirt, make sure to take your measurements using a flexible tape measure. Step-by-step guide: 7.1. Wrap the tape measure around the widest part of your neck, leaving enough space for two fingers to slide between the tape and your neck comfortably.  7.2. Write down the measurement, rounding up to the nearest half-inch.  7.3. To measure sleeve length, start from the center back of your neck and extend the tape to your shoulder, following the natural curve of your arm down to your wrist bone.  7.4. Note down the final measurement and round up to the nearest whole number if needed. Conclusion: In summary, choosing the perfect shirt involves considerations about color, pattern, collar, fit, weave, and fabric. Additionally, measuring your neck size and sleeve length can ensure a better fit and overall look. By taking the time to pick out the ideal attributes for your shirt, you'll be well on your way to achieving a polished and fashionable appearance, no matter the occasion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Pieter was a printmaker because his father was.","output":"Based on the provided information, one can infer that Pieter de Jode II (or Pieter de Jode the Younger) indeed came from a significant dynasty of printmakers in Antwerp, suggesting that the family's involvement in the profession likely influenced or facilitated his career choice.

Moreover, given that Pieter was known as \\"the Younger,\\" it can be assumed that there was an earlier figure in his family - perhaps his father or another close relative - who was also named Pieter de Jode and was involved in the profession. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the sentence \\"Pieter was a printmaker because his father was\\" is possibly true, as his father or other family members were likely involved in the printmaking trade, and this family background probably played a significant role in shaping his career path.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Dan studied multicellular organisms that presented mutations. Group A presented gemline mutations, while group B presented somatic mutations. He was fascinated by these organisms.  and a hint : Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Which person studied less about the North American Cordillera?  Pam and Alice studied Earth's climate and vegetation. Pam studied more about high latitudes (70 to 50°N), while Alice studied about lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S).  Hint: Alpine tundra occurs at high enough altitude at any latitude. Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N.

Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all.

Avoid consuming alcohol, caffeine, excessive sugar, or acidity. Avoid yelling and screaming. Don’t clear your throat. Humidify your home. Don’t smoke.\\" Article:","output":"The Importance of Hydrating and Lifestyle Choices for Vocal Health A voice is an imperative tool for communication; a medium that evokes emotion, creates connections, and firms relationships. Nevertheless, it is often subjected to strain and sometimes compromised by factors such as the environment or our lifestyle choices. These factors can cause harm, creating scratches, hoarseness, and even loss of voice. Fortunately, you can prevent these by drinking a lot of water, eating hydrating snacks, avoiding alcohol, caffeine, excessive sugar, and acidity, abstaining from yelling and screaming, not clearing your throat, humidifying your home, and refraining from smoking. This article delves into the importance of these actions for vocal health and how you can incorporate these measures into your daily life.  Hydration: Your Body's Best Friend  The first step to vocal health is hydration. Remembering to drink ample water daily is essential (the 8 glasses mandate is a good place to start), as this helps maintain the thin layer of mucus on your vocal cords, essential for their proper function. Without this mucus layer, your risk of vocal damage increases significantly.  In addition to plentiful water intake, hydrating snacks, such as fruits and vegetables like cucumbers, watermelons, oranges, and carrots, can further boost your water consumption. Their high water content not only aids in hydration but also provides necessary nutrients, vitreous to enhance overall vocal health. Avoid Alcohol, Caffeine, Excessive Sugar, and Acidity  Diet plays an indispensable role in vocal health as well. Steer clear of consuming too much alcohol and caffeine since they dehydrate your body, including the throat and vocal cords. Simultaneously, excessive sugar intake can lead to inflammation and acidity in the body, which might cause damage to the vocal cords.  Yelling, Screaming, and Clearing Your Throat: The Unfriendly Trio  It's also crucial to watch how you use your voice. Strained vocal behaviors such as yelling and screaming are akin to running a marathon without prior practice - bound to cause damage. Clearing your throat, a seemingly benign act, is like a minor abrasion on your vocal cords. Consistent clearing can result in redness and swelling, leading to hoarse voice or loss of voice.  Humidifying Your Home for Vocal Comfort Dry air can significantly affect your vocal health. Humidifying your home, especially during the colder months, can prevent your throat and vocal cords from drying out. Utilizing a humidifier to maintain an environment that preserves the moisture in your vocal cords can work wonders for your vocal quality. Kick the Butt: Say No to Smoking  Finally, smoking is a red flag for vocal health. Tobacco smoke irritates the throat and can cause substantial damage to your vocal cords over time. The smoke's heat dries out your throat and leads to an accumulation of unhealthy chemicals on your vocal cords. In conclusion, maintaining the health of your vocal cords requires a multifaceted approach that includes hydrating frequently, making conscious dietary choices, and being mindful of vocal strain. It may also necessitate lifestyle adjustments, such as incorporating a humidifier into your home or quitting smoking. Implementing these measures will contribute significantly to your vocal health and longevity, ensuring that your voice—your primary tool for communication—stays clear, resilient, and vibrant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The plot makes very little sense, but from what I gathered it's supposed to be about this scientist who develops the ability to turn people's personal items into tiny steel balls that then fly into their mouths and turn them into zombies (or blow their heads up, whichever). And the effects are lousy, too. Most of the movie consists of bad music, with the actors dancing equally as badly to the bad music, interspersed with multiple boring sex scenes. This should be one of the worst things ever made, but for one thing. One element of shear brilliance that makes \\"Nightmare Weekend\\" stand above all others. And that special quality is the presence of George. George is the lovable interface device between the scientist's daughter, Jessica, and the home computer security system. With his green hair and nose, balding scalp, and heart-shaped mouth, George is the guardian angel/confidant to Jessica, who asks him for advice on how to meet guys in one of the most dramatic pieces of dialogue ever captured on celluloid. With his monotone synthesized voice, George tells Jessica what percentages of males prefer women in white dresses, and also that hitch-hiking is the third best way to meet guys after discos and bars. Of course, little Jessica just can't seem to stay out of trouble, causing George to execute \\"Emergency Program Code: Protection Jessica\\", which results in the violent death of Jessica's would-be assailant via one of the aforementioned steel balls.

Due to economic sanctions and trade embargoes, Cuban citizens primarily use cars designed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These cars contain engines that were designed before the introduction of the catalytic converter. Meanwhile trade relations between nearby Panama and Japan have enabled the citizens of Panama to drive cars with the most up to date catalytic converter technology possible.  Hint: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. Answer:","output":"Cuba's cars will emit more nitrogen oxides compared to Panama's cars. This is because Cuban cars are primarily from the late 1940s and early 1950s, before the introduction of catalytic converters. In contrast, due to trade relations with Japan, Panamanian cars have the most up-to-date catalytic converter technology. Catalytic converters help reduce harmful emissions, including nitrogen oxides, by converting them into less harmful products. Since Cuban cars lack this technology, they will emit more nitrogen oxides than Panamanian cars with advanced catalytic converters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ken Rosenthal of Fox Sports is reporting that Terry Francona and the Boston Red Sox will part ways after eight seasons -- and one of the worst September collapses in baseball history. DAILY PITCH: Team assesses flop Francona, who won two World Series titles with Boston, is not expected to be fired but the Red Sox will simply decline their club options on him for 2012 and '13. VOTE: Should Francona be out in Boston? Among the teams that might be interested in Francona: Both the White Sox and Cubs. He worked in the White Sox farm system in the 1990s and played one season for the Cubs. White Sox manager Ozzie Guillen has taken the same job with the Marlins, but the Cubs currently don't have an opening. GALLERY: A grim and historic night for Red Sox Boston GM Theo Epstein said that the blame for the Red Sox collapse this season will not be laid at the manager's door. \\"That would be totally irresponsible and shortsighted,\\" Epstein said. \\"...I know we don't believe in scapegoats, particularly blaming Tito for what happened in September. We all failed collectively. We're all together in this; we've got to live with that. We're not pointing fingers at any one person in particular.\\" Thursday, Epstein and Francona assessed the Boston flop, acknowledging backward steps in terms of players' health, the clubhouse chemistry and attitude. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Terry Francona and the Boston Red Sox have decided to part ways after eight seasons, including a historic September collapse in 2011.

It is a subsidiary of Diageo, and headquartered at UB Tower in Bangalore, Karnataka. USL exports its products to over 37 countries. Hypothesis: USL doesn't make much alcohol.","output":"After analyzing the given paragraph, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"USL doesn't make much alcohol\\" is false. There are several reasons for this conclusion: 1. United Spirits Limited (USL) is identified as the world's second-largest spirits company by volume. This indicates that the production of alcohol by USL is substantial as it holds a prestigious position in the global spirits industry. 2. USL is a subsidiary of Diageo, which is a prominent multinational company dealing with alcoholic beverages. Diageo's status and global presence further imply that USL, as its subsidiary, must be producing a significant amount of alcoholic products to maintain and reinforce its market position. 3. The company exports its products to over 37 countries, which indicates that the demand for USL's alcoholic beverages is high. This high demand across numerous countries also means that the company indeed produces a large quantity of alcohol to meet the needs of such a diverse range of markets.

This Classical period saw the annexation of much of modern-day Greece by the Persian Empire and its subsequent independence. Classical Greece had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire and on the foundations of western civilization. Much of modern Western politics, artistic thought (architecture, sculpture), scientific thought, theatre, literature, and philosophy derives from this period of Greek history. In the context of the art, architecture, and culture of Ancient Greece, the Classical period, sometimes called the Hellenic period, corresponds to most of the 5th and 4th centuries BC (the most common dates being the fall of the last Athenian tyrant in 510 BC and the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC). The Classical period in this sense follows the Archaic period and is in turn succeeded by the Hellenistic period.  - Not to be confused with Olympiodorus the Elder Olympiodorus the Younger ( Greek :    ; c. 495 -- 570 ) was a Neoplatonist philosopher , astrologer and teacher who lived in the early years of the Byzantine Empire , after Justinian 's Decree of 529 AD which closed Plato 's Academy in Athens and other pagan schools . Olympiodorus was the last pagan to maintain the Platonist tradition in Alexandria ( see Alexandrian School ) ; after his death the School passed into the hands of Christian Aristotelians , and was eventually moved to Constantinople .  - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.  - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek.  - Constantinople  was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD.  - Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423  348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.  - The Nile ( \\"en-Nl\\",  \\"an-Nl\\" \\"P(h)iaro\\"; Ancient Egyptian: \\"'p\\" and \\"Iteru\\"; Biblical Hebrew: , \\"Ha-Ye'or\\") is a major north-flowing river in northeastern Africa. It is generally regarded as the longest river in the world, however other conflicting sources cite a 2007 study that gave the title to the Amazon River in South America. The Nile, which is 6,853 km (4,258 miles) long, is an \\"international\\" river as its water resources are shared by eleven countries, namely, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Sudan and Egypt. In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt and Sudan.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \\"Byzantine Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \\"Roman Empire\\" (tr. ), or \\"Romania\\", and to themselves as \\"Romans\\".  - An empire is defined as \\"an aggregate of nations or people ruled over by an emperor or other powerful sovereign or government, usually a territory of greater extent than a kingdom, as the former British Empire, French Empire, Brazilian Empire, Russian Empire, Ottoman Empire, Byzantine Empire or Roman Empire.\\" An empire can be made solely of contiguous territories such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or of territories far remote from the homeland, such as a colonial empire.  - Biblical Hebrew (\\"Ivrit Miqra'it\\" or \\"Leshon ha-Miqra\\"), also called Classical Hebrew, is an archaic form of Hebrew, a Canaanite Semitic language spoken by the Israelites in the area known as Israel, roughly west of the Jordan River and east of the Mediterranean Sea. The term \\"Hebrew\\" was not used for the language in the Bible, which was referred to as Canaanite or Judahite, but the name was used in Greek and Mishnaic Hebrew texts. Biblical Hebrew is attested from about the 10th century BCE, and persisted through and beyond the Second Temple period, which ended in the siege of Jerusalem (AD 70).  - A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC).  - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?    What entity does 'olympiodorus the younger' has the relation 'languages spoken or written' with?

Then, have someone sing “five” at G while the other 2 hold a C and E, respectively. After practicing C-E-G, try other combinations, such as G-B-D and F-A-C. If you’re practicing with 1 other person, just work on 2-part harmonies. perfectly to avoid getting distracted by other singers. It’s easy to get distracted by other singers when you’re harmonizing. The key to sticking to the harmony is to learn your part inside and out. Work measure by measure to commit each of your part’s notes to memory.  If you’re in a choir, don’t rely on others in your section (such as other altos or baritones) to stay on track. Additionally, don’t assume that you’ll always be surrounded by other members of your section when you perform. If you have trouble sticking to your part, practice singing with a recording of the melody. Play it softly at first, then gradually increase the volume. The best way to learn how to harmonize is to sing with others in a group. Look for a choir or chorus group at your school or place of worship, or look online for one in your community. If you’re a soprano and want to harmonize better, try to join a choir as an alto. Sopranos usually sing the melody, while alto, tenor, and baritone sections sing harmonies. While apps and other resources can be super helpful, nothing beats working one-on-one with an experienced voice teacher. In addition to harmonizing, a voice teacher can help you with other singing techniques, such as breath control and vocal health. Additionally, consider taking classes in music theory to learn more about how harmonizing works.

Catwoman is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with the superhero Batman. Created by Bill Finger and Bob Kane, the character made her debut as \\"the Cat\\" in Batman #1 (June 1940). Catwoman, whose real name is Selina Kyle, has been Batman's most enduring love interest and is known for her complex love-hate relationship with him. As a Gotham City burglar, Catwoman typically wears a tight, one-piece outfit and uses a bullwhip for a weapon. In June 2016, the DC Rebirth event relaunched DC Comics' entire line of comic book titles, in which Catwoman has a prominent role in the third volume of Batman. In December 2017, DC Comics ended the Rebirth branding, opting to include everything under a larger \\"DC Universe\\" banner and naming, and Catwoman continues to be featured in the third volume Batman. The series reveals Selina's origin through a series of flashbacks and letters exchanged between Bruce and Selina. Her parents died when she was young, and she hardly remembers them. She is sent in the Thomas and Martha Wayne Home for the Boys and Girls of Gotham, and even after being placed in various foster, she would escape to return to the orphanage.  Eventually, Selina becomes Catwoman. During one of her heists, she is approached by the Kite Man to aide the Joker in a gang war against the Riddler, which she refuses. She later aides Batman, with whom she already has a romantic relationship, to spy on the Joker. She is shot from a window, but is unharmed. At some point in the future, her childhood orphanage is bombed by a terrorist group called the Dogs of War. Batman reluctantly arrests Catwoman after all 237 of them are killed, despite Catwoman's insistence on her guilt.  Her first appearance is in Batman #9, where she is revealed to be imprisoned in Arkham Asylum for the alleged murders of the Dogs of War. Batman is determined to prove her innocence, and makes a deal with Amanda Waller to get her off death row in exchange for her help on a mission to Santa Prisca. The mission to find Psycho Pirate is a success, and Batman and Catwoman return to Gotham City. Before Batman can return her to custody, she escapes. Batman investigates the murders of the terrorists that she has been charged with, and deduces that it was in fact Holly Robinson who committed the murders after the terrorists burned down the orphanage she and Selina were raised in. After being attacked by Holly Robinson, Batman is rescued by Catwoman.  Bruce proposes to Selina in Batman #24.

Write an article based on this summary: – An oral history project about the South African town of Dududu has turned up a dark secret from the past: the discovery of about 100 bodies in unmarked graves in what is now a sugarcane farm. The investigation is continuing, but the best guess is that they were prison laborers who worked at the farm decades ago, reports AFP. The farm is now run by the sugarcane conglomerate Illovo, which bought it in 1989. As the Independent of South Africa reports, old-timers say that the previous farm owner, now deceased, is believed to have had the prisoners trucked in from nearby Durban, though the exact circumstances are unclear. “Growing up, we knew there were prisoners working there,\\" says one woman. \\"They served their sentences there and when it was over, they would be dealt with and buried there.” Stories differ on whether the prisoners were buried in their old age or whether they were killed well before then, and authorities hope that the investigation of the three mass graves will yield answers. They came to light when a witchdoctor being interviewed for an oral history project spoke of \\"restless spirits\\" at the site, and a dig commenced.","output":"Title: The Dark Secret of Dududu's Sugarcane Farm: Uncovering the Past through an Oral History Project Introduction An oral history project focused on the town of Dududu in South Africa has uncovered a chilling secret from decades ago, shedding light on a dark period of the community's past. The discovery of approximately 100 bodies in unmarked graves at a sugarcane farm currently operated by Illovo has ignited a quest to uncover the truth behind this mass burial site. The investigation is ongoing, but initial findings suggest that these remains belong to prison laborers who worked on the farm in the past. The Role of the Oral History Project The oral history project aimed at preserving the stories of Dududu's community members and their experiences over the years. It was during one of these interviews that a local witchdoctor spoke of \\"restless spirits\\" haunting the site of the sugarcane farm. This revelation prompted authorities to investigate, which led to the unearthing of the three mass graves. Reports from residents in the area, as recounted by the Independent of South Africa, suggest that prisoners were brought from nearby Durban by the previous, now-deceased farm owner. These prisoners served their sentences by working on the farm. However, accounts differ as to whether the prisoners were buried upon reaching old age or were killed well before their time. Authorities hope that their investigation will provide answers to these lingering questions. Illovo's Role and Responsibility The sugarcane conglomerate Illovo, which purchased the farm in 1989, now finds itself in the center of this historical investigation. While the mass burial seems to predate Illovo's ownership, the company may still have a responsibility to the community and the families of the deceased to assist in uncovering the truth about the events that took place on the farm. Furthermore, the discovery of unmarked graves on Illovo's property raises questions about the ethical implications of using prison labor in agricultural settings. Although the practice has a long history dating back to the colonial era, the conditions in which these workers lived and died need to be examined in order to understand and address potential human rights abuses. Searching for Closure The continuing investigation into the mass graves not only seeks to provide answers for the families of the deceased but also aims to offer closure to the Dududu community. In understanding the history and the circumstances that led to these burials, the community can begin the process of healing and reconciliation. Uncovering historical injustice serves as a reminder of the importance of preserving and recording the past. Oral history projects such as this one play a crucial role in giving a voice to the marginalized and illuminating hidden narratives that would otherwise remain buried, much like the bodies discovered at the sugarcane farm. Conclusion The dark secret unearthed in Dududu offers a unique opportunity to confront past human rights abuses and spark conversation about the ethical implications of prison labor. As investigators work to piece together the events that transpired on the sugarcane farm, the community of Dududu, as well as Illovo and other businesses, must reckon with the consequences of this troubling history. Through collaborative efforts, the town might find answers, share untold stories, and pave the way for healing and understanding."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The striker popularly known as 'Chucho' passed away in the Qatari capital Doha, one day after playing his first game for new side El Jaish.  Having played at the 2006 World Cup as a youngster, Benitez had developed into an important component of an Ecuadorian side bidding to reach next year's finals in Brazil.  His 24 international goals make him the third highest scorer overall for Ecuador's national team.  Jose Chamorro, the player's agent, told an Ecuadorian television station that Benitez had suffered a heart attack and died in hospital, where he had been taken after complaining of abdominal pains.  Manchester United star Antonio Valencia, an international colleague of Benitez who played with the striker at leading Ecuadorian side El Nacional a decade ago, was among those struggling to come to terms with the loss.  \\"This pain (is) very strong my brother but we love you,\\" the winger wrote on Twitter, where he also posted several pictures of the diminutive forward.  Despite being a footballer who failed to hit the heights in Europe, news of Benitez's death trended on Twitter.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How did the early paints work?\\" is in \\"The painters of the early Renaissance used two traditional lake pigments, made from mixing dye with either chalk or alum, kermes lake, made from kermes insects, and madder lake, made from the rubia tinctorum plant. With the arrival of cochineal, they had a third, carmine, which made a very fine crimson, though it had a tendency to change color if not used carefully. It was used by almost all the great painters of the 15th and 16th centuries, including Rembrandt, Vermeer, Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Diego Velázquez and Tintoretto. Later it was used by Thomas Gainsborough, Seurat and J.M.W. Turner.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The early paints worked through the use of natural pigments derived from various sources, which were combined with binders to create usable paint. In the early Renaissance, two key lake pigments were used by painters, which were created by mixing dye with either chalk or alum. These pigments included kermes lake, made from the kermes insect, and madder lake, made from the rubia tinctorum plant.  Upon the arrival of cochineal, a new pigment known as carmine was introduced. This pigment produced a vibrant crimson color, although it needed to be used carefully due to its propensity to change color over time. This new pigment was embraced by many of the most celebrated painters across the 15th and 16th centuries, such as Rembrandt, Vermeer, Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Diego Velázquez, and Tintoretto. Later, it was also employed by other renowned artists like Thomas Gainsborough, Seurat, and J.M.W. Turner. In summary, early paints functioned through the use of natural pigments, which were often derived from plants and insects. These pigments were then mixed with binders to create a stable, workable medium that artists could use to create their masterpieces. Over time, new pigments were discovered, like carmine, which enabled painters to expand their color palettes and create even more striking, vivid works of art. This emphasis on natural pigments and evolving color options played a crucial role in the development of painting during the Renaissance period and beyond."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- There is one man who will be pacing around the Hazeltine National Golf Club in Minnesota this week hoping to make it three majors in a row -- but you won't find his name when you trail your finger down the list of starters at the 91st PGA Championship. Tiger Woods possesses a mental toughness that none of his competitors can match. Though his presence may be unnoticed by spectators lining the fairways, his influence on the players he coaches is becoming far more conspicuous. That is because sports psychologist Dr. Morris Pickens, or \\"Dr Mo\\" as his players like to call him, is fast gaining a reputation for being one of the best mental coaches in golf. During practice rounds,","output":"Dr. Mo can be seen meticulously observing his players, analyzing their swings, and offering invaluable advice to help them hone their mental game. His clients, which include some of the biggest names in professional golf, speak highly of his unique ability to tap into their mindset and bring out their peak performance. He believes that the mental side of the game is just as, if not more, important than the physical, and he has made it his mission to help golfers build their confidence, focus, and resilience under pressure. Being part of their entourage, Dr. Mo moves discreetly in the background, absorbing every detail, every nuance of his players' actions, and reactions. His years of experience and expertise allow him to understand the troubles that affect their performance, address them, and provide effective coping strategies. While his players may be swinging their clubs, he is swinging their minds towards victory. Over the years, Dr. Mo has developed a steadfast process for mental preparation, which includes visualization techniques, positive self-talk, and setting specific yet achievable goals before each shot, each hole, and each round. His method is tailored to the individual golfer's strengths and weaknesses. This year's PGA Championship will be a stage where Dr. Mo's skills will be put to the test on the highest level, and the world's best golfers will be vying for the coveted title. As the event unfolds, it is becoming increasingly evident that his players are reaping the benefits of his guidance, showing remarkable consistency, poise, and determination that set them apart from the rest. In the final round of the 91st PGA Championship, the Hazeltine National Golf Club witnesses a dramatic turn of events. One of Dr. Mo's players – an underdog at the start of the tournament – surges forward, dominating the leaderboard. The crowd, initially oblivious to Dr. Mo's presence, becomes aware of the invisible hand that has guided the player throughout the competition. The tension mounts as the golfers enter the closing holes. Intently watching his player from the gallery, Dr. Mo knows better than anyone the importance of mental resilience at this crucial stage. He sends silent affirmations, assuring the golfer that he has the inner strength to succeed. As the final putt drops, sealing a nail-biting victory, the player raises his arms in triumph, and the crowd erupts in deafening applause. In that moment, as the Cinderella story unfolds, Dr. Mo's work is vindicated: He has turned an unlikely contender into a major champion by harnessing the power of the mind. Though he may not be the one to hold the trophy, his role in the victory is undeniable. The sports world can no longer ignore the impact of a steadfast mental coach like Dr. Morris Pickens, who has ushered in a new era for golf psychology. The 91st PGA Championship will be remembered not only for the underdog's extraordinary win but also for the crucial contribution of the man pacing around the Hazeltine National Golf Club – Dr. Mo, the unsung hero behind the scenes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Age of Enlightenment: Across continental Europe, but in France especially, booksellers and publishers had to negotiate censorship laws of varying strictness. The Encyclopédie, for example, narrowly escaped seizure and had to be saved by Malesherbes, the man in charge of the French censure. Indeed, many publishing companies were conveniently located outside France so as to avoid overzealous French censors. They would smuggle their merchandise across the border, where it would then be transported to clandestine booksellers or small-time peddlers. The records of clandestine booksellers may give a better representation of what literate Frenchmen might have truly read, since their clandestine nature provided a less restrictive product choice. In one case, political books were the most popular category, primarily libels and pamphlets. Readers were more interested in sensationalist stories about criminals and political corruption than they were in political theory itself. The second most popular category, \\"general works\\" (those books \\"that did not have a dominant motif and that contained something to offend almost everyone in authority\\") demonstrated a high demand for generally low-brow subversive literature.

Movie title: The Hound of the Baskervilles Context: The film begins in a theater, where a pianist (Moore) begins to play a piano accompaniment to the actual film being shown in the theater. Holmes (Cook) has just restored a stolen artifact to three French nuns, and is later called on a case by Dr. Mortimer (Terry-Thomas) concerning Sir Henry Baskerville (Kenneth Williams) and a legendary hound that curses the Baskerville estate. Tired and worn out by so many cases, Holmes passes the case onto Dr. Watson (Moore), who is portrayed as a Welsh eccentric. Upon arriving at the station, Sir Henry, Dr. Mortimer, Watson and Perkins (their driver) are halted by a policeman (Spike Milligan), who warns them of a murderer stalking the moors, before sending the group on their way. While out in the moor collecting specimens, Watson has a curious encounter in a hut with the raving Mr. Frankland (Hugh Griffith) and Frankland's exceedingly strong daughter, Mary (Dana Gillespie ). In the next scene, we see Holmes still in London, visiting Ada, his mother (also played by Dudley Moore), who, as a bogus spiritualist aided by her housekeeper, Iris, scams older ladies of their money in false seances. Holmes' mother is concerned that \\"Watty\\" (Watson) may need help, and that \\"Sherl\\" (as she calls her son), should rush to his aid. In next scene, Holmes interviews the one-legged Mr. Spiggot (also played by Dudley Moore) to act as a runner on the moor. In the next scene, while wandering on the moors, Watson happens upon Mr. Stapleton (Denholm Elliott), who mistakes him for Sir Henry. Stapleton's sister (Joan Greenwood) describes dramatically her encounter with the Hound on the moor, suggesting that it ravished her, whereupon she attempts to force herself upon the reluctant Watson, with Miss Stapleton undergoing supernatural transformations reminiscent of The Exorcist.

Coming off their easy home win over the Bears, the Vikings flew to the desert for a Week 13 Sunday Night duel with the defending NFC champion Arizona Cardinals. In the first quarter, Minnesota got on the board with quarterback Brett Favre completing a 3-yard TD pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. It was originally ruled an incomplete pass as Shiancoe stepped out of bounds, but Minnesota challenged and won based on the fact that Shiancoe had both feet in bounds and the referee counted Shiancoe's third step, thereby making the original ruling on the field to be overturned. The Cardinals then responded with quarterback Kurt Warner finding wide receiver Anquan Boldin on a 2-yard TD pass. In the second quarter, Arizona took the lead with Warner finding Boldin again on a 39-yard TD pass. The Vikings responded with kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 25-yard field goal.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Individuals with a history of being physically or emotionally abused, especially as children, are more prone to suffer from IED, as are those suffering from a personality disorder or other serious mental illnesses. IED may also be linked with repeated traumatic experiences of violence or stress, such as the traumas experienced by active-duty military personnel.  Other mental illnesses are sometimes linked to IED include personality disorders, such as antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, and disorders associated with disruptive behavior, such as attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder. Just because an individual displays one or more of these risk factors does not mean they suffer from IED. However, the presence of risk factors in addition to the characteristic symptoms of IED, explosive episodes of rage, should be cause for concern. Everyone finds themselves feeling or expressing anger from time to time, and it's perfectly healthy to do so. Rage, on the other hand, is a destructive emotion that can cause us to act in ways we normally would never think to. While anger may influence the way we behave while experiencing it, rage seems to utterly command our behavior and thought, leaving no room for anything else. Explosive episodes seem to come out of nowhere. An IED sufferer may find themselves in a steady, or even pleasant mood, conducting their daily business when, without warning, they find themselves overwhelmingly angry, displaying uncontrollable, violent behavior. While explosive episodes are most likely to occur in private, often after dark, their unpredictable nature means that they may sometimes occur in places where loud or highly visible expressions of anger are inappropriate, such as at work or in public places. Sufferers of IED often become extremely violent, or even abusive, during their explosive episodes. Seemingly tiny arguments or frustrations can lead, in the blink of an eye, to extraordinary and uncharacteristic displays of physical and emotional cruelty. These displays are usually very sudden in their onset, making them unpredictable and dangerous for everyone involved. Common examples of violent behaviors linked to IED include:  Shouting or screaming, even though the person being spoken to is not raising their voice. Invading personal space, often by stepping close and getting \\"in the face\\" of those nearby. Throwing, hitting, or breaking objects. Shoving, grabbing, or hitting others. Intentionally hurting oneself, such as by slapping or punching, beating one's head against a wall, etc. Name-calling, or use of language intended to hurt or insult others. Threatening others with violence. While the specific behaviors displayed by an IED sufferer during an explosive episode may vary, they are always characterized by being disproportionate, or \\"way over the top\\", relative to the circumstances or events triggering the episode. A true explosive episode can last for several hours before it dissipates naturally.  After an extended episode of rage, the sufferer is likely to feel exhausted, and relieved that the episode has ended. Later, the sufferer may feel intense remorse, shame, and unease while thinking about the things they said and did while experiencing their explosive episode. These feelings can lead the sufferer to become depressed, irritable and removed  An IED sufferer will also often experience much shorter episodes, during which they might momentarily \\"snap\\" at someone in conversation, becoming suddenly verbally or physically hostile before returning to normal. Episodes occur irregularly, with gaps of days, weeks or even months in between. Only a medical expert can diagnose someone with IED, or any other mental illness. Your first step, if you suspect that you or someone you know is suffering from IED, should be to consult with a psychiatrist, councilor or medical doctor about the symptoms and risk factors which are bothering you. Once any anger issues have been diagnosed, you and your doctor can begin exploring options for treatment.","output":"The article discusses the causes, symptoms, and potential treatments of Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED), a mental health condition characterized by explosive episodes of rage, which may be linked to past trauma, other mental illnesses, and can have serious consequences for the individual and their relationships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The term \\"Milky Way\\" is a translation of the Latin ', from the Greek (', \\"milky circle\\"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.  - The Galactic Center is the rotational center of the Milky Way. The estimates for its location range from 7.6 to 8.7 kiloparsecs (about 25,000 to 28,000 lightyears) from Earth in the direction of the constellations Sagittarius, Ophiuchus, and Scorpius where the Milky Way appears brightest. There is strong evidence consistent with the existence of a supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center of the Milky Way.  - WR 102ka , also known as the Peony star , is a Wolf - Rayet star that is one of several candidates for the most luminous known star in the Milky Way . An even more luminous yet closer star , WR 25 , appears to be most likely to the title . Another nearer star Eta Carinae , which was the second brightest star in the sky for a few years in the 19th century , appears to be slightly more luminous than WR 102ka , but is known to be a binary star system . There is also the more recently discovered Pistol star that , like the Peony star , derives its name from the shape of the nebula in which it is embedded , and which it has probably created through heavy mass loss via fierce stellar winds and perhaps also major \`\` mini-supernova - like '' eruptions as happened to Eta Carinae around the 1830s - 1840s creating the lobes observed by the Hubble Space Telescope . The luminosities of the Pistol Star , Eta Carinae , and WR 102ka are all rendered somewhat uncertain due to heavy obscuration by galactic dust in the foreground , the effects of which must be corrected for before their apparent brightness can be reduced to estimate their total radiated power or bolometric luminosity . Both Eta Carinae and WR 102ka are believed likely to explode as supernovas or hypernovas within the next few million years . As is typical of such extremely massive and luminous stars , both have expelled a considerable portion of their initial mass , when originally formed , in dense , massive stellar winds . As WR 102ka lies near the Galactic Center , it is the more distant and heavily obscured of the two , and is essentially totally obscured in visible wavelengths . Thus it must be observed in longer wavelength infrared light , which is able to penetrate the dust . The Spitzer Space Telescope observed WR 102ka at wavelengths of 3.6 µm , 8 µm , and 24 µm on April 20 , 2005 . The observations were carried out by L. Oskinova , W. - R. Hamann , and A. Barniske of Potsdam University , Germany . WR 102ka was previously observed by the Two Micron All...  - Eta Carinae (abbreviated to  Carinae or  Car), formerly known as Eta Argus, is a stellar system containing at least two stars with a combined luminosity over five million times that of the Sun, located around 7500 light-years (2300 parsecs) distant in the constellation Carina. First recorded as a 4th-magnitude star, it brightened considerably over the period 1837 to 1856 in an event known as the Great Eruption. Eta Carinae became the second-brightest star in the sky between 11 and 14 March 1843 before fading well below naked eye visibility. It has brightened consistently since about 1940, peaking above magnitude 4.5 in 2014. Eta Carinae is circumpolar south of latitude 30°S, so it is never visible north of latitude 30°N.  - The Pistol Star is a blue hypergiant star, one of the most luminous known in the Milky Way. It is one of many massive young stars in the Quintuplet cluster in the Galactic Center region. The star owes its name to the shape of the Pistol Nebula, which it illuminates. It is located approximately 25,000 light years from Earth in the direction of Sagittarius. It would be visible to the naked eye as a fourth magnitude star if it were not for the interstellar dust that completely hides it from view in visible light.  - The Pistol Nebula is located in the constellation Sagittarius. It surrounds one of the most luminous stars known, the Pistol Star. Both are located 25,000 light years away from Earth in the Quintuplet cluster, near the center of the Milky Way galaxy. The nebula contains approximately 9.3 solar masses worth of ionized gas that was ejected by the star several thousand years ago. The nebula was named in the 1980s for its shape as seen in low resolution images that were available at the time. The Pistol Star, a luminous blue variable is 1.6 million times brighter than the Sun making it one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way.  - A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang.  - A low Earth orbit (LEO) is an orbit around Earth with an altitude between (orbital period of about 88 minutes), and (about 127 minutes). Objects below approximately will experience very rapid orbital decay and altitude loss.

A battle-hardened Huntley-Brinkley reporter later said that no military action he had witnessed had ever frightened or disturbed him as much as what he saw in Birmingham. Two out-of-town photographers in Birmingham that day were Charles Moore, who had previously worked with the Montgomery Advertiser and was now working for Life magazine, and Bill Hudson, with the Associated Press.  Moore was a Marine combat photographer who was \\"jarred\\" and \\"sickened\\" by the use of children and what the Birmingham police and fire departments did to them.  Moore was hit in the ankle by a brick meant for the police. He took several photos that were printed in Life.  The first photo Moore shot that day showed three teenagers being hit by a water jet from a high-pressure firehose. It was titled \\"They Fight a Fire That Won't Go Out\\".  A shorter version of the caption was later used as the title for Fred Shuttlesworth's biography.  The Life photo became an \\"era-defining picture\\" and was compared to the photo of Marines raising the U.S. flag on Iwo Jima.  Moore suspected that the film he shot \\"was likely to obliterate in the national psyche any notion of a 'good southerner'.\\" Hudson remarked later that his only priorities that day were \\"making pictures and staying alive\\" and \\"not getting bit by a dog.\\"Right in front of Hudson stepped Parker High School senior Walter Gadsden when a police officer grabbed the young man's sweater and a police dog charged him.  Gadsden had been attending the demonstration as an observer.  He was related to the editor of Birmingham's black newspaper, The Birmingham World, who strongly disapproved of King's leadership in the campaign. Gadsden was arrested for \\"parading without a permit\\", and after witnessing his arrest, Commissioner Connor remarked to the officer, \\"Why didn't you bring a meaner dog; this one is not the vicious one.\\"  Hudson's photo of Gadsden and the dog ran across three columns in the prominent position above the fold on the front page of The New York Times on May 4, 1963.

The step-by-step justifications for this inference are as follows: 1. First, the structure of the statement is examined. The phrase \\"even the funniest idea isn't funny\\" seemingly works to convey disappointment or dissatisfaction. 2. The use of negative phrasing such as \\"isn't funny\\" indicates that the reviewer doesn't consider various aspects of the movie, supposedly meant to be humorous, to be effective in their delivery. 3. The use of \\"even\\", a word often used to express an extreme case or an unexpected outcome, suggests that parts of the movie that should have ordinarily been successful (the \\"funniest\\" parts) were not perceived as being funny.  4. All these points lead to the conclusion that the reviewer did not view the movie positively overall. The sentence under analysis doesn't contain any positive feedback about the movie.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Crate training is a great thing for your dog. You can put him in there when you aren't home, which will cut down on accidents in the house. It will also allow him a place to escape to when he is overwhelmed by everything or just needs to be alone. Since he will be spending significant time in his crate, you need to make sure you buy one large enough for your puppy. His crate, also known as a kennel, should be large enough that he can stand up, turn around, and comfortably lay down in. It should also have plenty of room to fit him as he grows. When you are first crate training your dog, you need to make it a comfortable and happy place for him. Start out with the crate open in your living room or kitchen where you are. Place a blanket, small bed, or crate pad in the crate to make him want to go in. You can also toss in a treat to encourage him inside. Once you send your dog into the crate with the door open for a few times, start shutting the door while he is in there. Leave the door closed for about 10 minutes. You should not let him out if he is still whining or scratching at the door of the cage. This will show him that this behavior will get him out of the cage. Over time, you should increase the amount of time you leave your puppy in the crate. Keep increasing the time he spends in the crate until he can stay in the crate for long periods of time without whining or pawing at the door.  This will vary depending on how old your puppy is. If he is under four months old, the time he needs to stay is two hours. If he is older than four months old, he needs to stay in there four hours without whining, as long as their bladders can hold it that long. Never leave a dog in a crate for longer than this, unless he stays in his crate while you are at work. Never use the crate as a punishment because he will start seeing it as a scary place. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article focuses on the benefits and process of crate training for dogs. Crate training provides dogs a safe space and helps prevent accidents when owners are not home. It highlights the importance of choosing an appropriately-sized crate for the dog's comfort and growth.

They were led by Daniel Boyd, who pleaded guilty in February 2011 to conspiring to kill people abroad and to provide material support to terrorists. Boyd's sentencing was delayed so that he could testify against three other co-conspirators who were found guilty last fall.  Two of Boyd's sons also pleaded guilty and are in prison.

Read this and answer the question Some researchers who study sexual orientation argue that the concept may not apply similarly to men and women. A study of sexual arousal patterns found that women, when viewing erotic films which show female-female, male-male and male-female sexual activity (oral sex or penetration), have patterns of arousal which do not match their declared sexual orientations as well as men's. That is, heterosexual and lesbian women's sexual arousal to erotic films do not differ significantly by the genders of the participants (male or female) or by the type of sexual activity (heterosexual or homosexual). On the contrary, men's sexual arousal patterns tend to be more in line with their stated orientations, with heterosexual men showing more penis arousal to female-female sexual activity and less arousal to female-male and male-male sexual stimuli, and homosexual and bisexual men being more aroused by films depicting male-male intercourse and less aroused by other stimuli. What do some researchers argue about the idea of sexual orientation?","output":"Some researchers argue that the concept of sexual orientation may not apply similarly to men and women, as their sexual arousal patterns exhibit differences when exposed to various erotic stimuli. A study of sexual arousal patterns using erotic films with different types of sexual activity and gender combinations has shown that women's arousal patterns do not align as closely with their declared sexual orientations as men's do. For women, both heterosexual and lesbian, their sexual arousal to erotic films does not differ significantly based on the genders of the participants (male or female) or the type of sexual activity (heterosexual or homosexual). This suggests that women's sexual arousal might be less dependent on the specific gender of sexual partners or the nature of the sexual act itself. In contrast, men's sexual arousal patterns tend to align more closely with their stated sexual orientations. Heterosexual men show more arousal to female-female sexual activity and less arousal to female-male and male-male sexual stimuli, while homosexual and bisexual men are more aroused by films depicting male-male intercourse and less aroused by other stimuli. In essence, researchers argue that the concept of sexual orientation may not be universally applicable or consistent across genders, as men and women exhibit different patterns of sexual arousal in response to various erotic stimuli. This could potentially challenge traditional understandings of sexual orientation as a binary and fixed concept, suggesting that it may be a more complex and nuanced phenomenon that varies between individuals and across genders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They also meet paper mill director Bethel Isely (Richard A. Dysart), who is to be their host. He tells them about his missing rescue team and lays the blame at Opies. The latter have their own explanation; Katahdin, a vengeful spirit of the forest that has been awakened by the activities of the loggers, which Isely describes as \\"larger than a dragon with the eyes of a cat\\". As Isely drives the couple to their cabin, their path is barred by a party of Opies who refuse to let Isely's people pass and a fight ensues between the leader of the Opies John Hawks (Armand Assante) and Kelso (Everett Creach), one of Isely's heavies. The heavy is armed with a chainsaw while Hawks has only a double-bit axe. The scuffle ends with Hawks laid on the ground with the chainsaw nearly at his throat, causing the Opies to relent and let the...

Usage: Labeling the given instance as \\"Sad\\" because the author is expressing surprise and sadness about a dark topic related to child abuse. The use of the hashtag \\"#dark\\" also indicates that the author is expressing sadness or discomfort regarding the situation. Part #2: Use hashtags and emojis for help, without relying solely on them. Usage: In the given instance, the hashtag \\"#dark\\" contributes to understanding the author's mood. However, the majority of the sentiment comes from the words \\"Brad Pitt being investigated for child abuse?!\\" and \\"this all just got really.\\" Including the hashtag helps confirm the author's sadness, but the text on its own also suggests the same sentiment. Part #3: Focus on the tweet's text. Usage: The text \\"Brad Pitt being investigated for child abuse?! this all just got really\\" serves as the foundation for judging the author's sentiment. The tweet's content refers to a serious, concerning topic, indicating sadness or disapproval.

Among the early blows struck for independence was a rebellion in the town of Olhão. On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy.

However, I will discuss various factors that could influence the rating of this review and suggest possible ratings based on different criteria. 1. Length and depth of the review: If we consider the length and depth of a review to be important factors, then the review \\"Awesome\\" would likely be rated less favorably. The review consists of only one word, which, although positive in nature, does not provide any specific information or feedback about the product or service. In this case, we might rate the review at a 2 or a 3 out of 5. 2. Clarity and simplicity: On the other hand, if we value reviews that are clear and straightforward, \\"Awesome\\" certainly fulfills this criteria. The word \\"awesome\\" clearly communicates a positive experience, with no room for ambiguity. For those who prefer concise reviews with a clear sentiment, this review could be rated as a 4 or a 5 out of 5. 3. Usefulness for other consumers: To determine the usefulness of a review, we must consider how the review could potentially help or inform other consumers considering the product or service. In this context, the review \\"Awesome\\" offers limited information. While it conveys a positive experience, it does not provide any details or reasons for its satisfaction, making it difficult for other consumers to fully understand the reasons behind the reviewer's opinion. In this case, the rating could be closer to a 1 or a 2 out of 5. 4. Emotional impact: If we consider that reviews may motivate potential customers to try a product or service based on the emotional impact of the reviewer's experience, then \\"Awesome\\" can be seen as a highly positive, albeit simple, expression of satisfaction. This emotional impact could sway some potential customers toward trying the product or service. In this case, we might rate the review as a 3 to 4 out of 5. In conclusion, the rating of review would depend on which criteria we choose to prioritize. If we prioritize length and depth, or usefulness for other consumers, the review \\"Awesome\\" would receive a lower rating. However, if we prioritize clarity and simplicity or emotional impact, this review might be rated more favorably. It is important to note that more specific information about the product or service and reviewer's experience should be provided for a comprehensive and accurate assessment of the review's quality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A man who went on the run after he was freed from a prison van on his way to trial has been arrested, police confirmed tonight. Stevie McMullen, 31, was being taken to court alongside Ryan MacDonald, 20, when three masked men armed with guns attacked the GEOAmey prison transport vehicle in Salford on Tuesday. Police caught McMullen this afternoon, travelling in a car with two other men on the A6, near Lancaster University, Greater Manchester Police said. ‘Dangerous’ MacDonald is still at large and there is a £10,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. At the time of the escape, McMullen. was due to appear on trial for conspiracies to kidnap, rob, commit arson. and possess a firearm. He has now been arrested on suspicion of escaping from lawful custody. The other two men, aged 27 and 25,. were arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. They have been. taken into police custody for questioning. Assistant Chief Constable Steve. Heywood said: ‘Since two prisoners were sprung from a GEOAmey prison van. on Tuesday, our officers have been working round-the-clock to trace. these fugitives and bring them back into custody. ‘This afternoon, we have arrested a. 31-year-old man in the Lancashire area as part of this operation, but. our efforts will continue to trace 20-year-old Ryan MacDonald, who is. still wanted by police.' ‘On Friday, a £10,000 reward was put. forward for information leading to the capture of these two men. This. full £10,000 reward still stands for anyone who gives us information. that leads to MacDonald's arrest and will be paid when he is back behind. bars. Investigation: The GEOAmey prison van was on Regent Road with its side door open and glass all over the road. Looking: A police officer stands guard at the crime scene where two men escaped from a prison van in Salford. Probe: A forensic officer retrieves evidence at the crime scene where two men escaped from a prison van. ‘I would ask members of the public not. to approach this man due to the potential danger he poses, but if you. see him then please call the police immediately. ‘We continue to follow up on a number. of leads but I would also like to offer MacDonald the opportunity to. hand himself in, which he can do either by calling police himself, or by. contacting a trusted family member, friend or his solicitor.’ Still at large: Ryan MacDonald, 20, who has now been sentenced in his absence, is still on the run. Shortly after 9am on Tuesday, a prison. van carrying prisoners from HMP Altcourse to Manchester Crown Square. was attacked on Regent Road, Salford, by at least three men wearing dark. clothing and balaclavas. The men had arrived at the location in a dark coloured Saab and threatened staff transporting the prisoners with a shotgun. Five men - believed to be three. offenders and the two escaped prisoners - then got back into the Saab,. which was driven a short distance and abandoned. It is believed three ran towards a nearby estate and two may have further escaped on a motorbike that was later found abandoned. On Tuesday, April 30 a 28-year-old. woman and 24-year-old man were detained at a house on the Ordsall. estate, Salford on suspicion of being involved in assisting an offender. They have been released on bail pending further inquiries until June. 26. MacDonald was due to be sentenced for conspiracy to commit robbery and aggravated vehicle taking when he escaped. His delayed hearing was held on Friday at Manchester Crown Court as he was jailed for seven years and 10 months. The 20-year-old defendant had pleaded guilty to the offences at an earlier hearing. MacDonald was part of a gang who. targeted pawnbrokers in Manchester and Salford where jewellery was. stolen in daylight smash-and-grab raids. Dangerous: Police warn that 20-year-old Ryan McDonald, of Salford, is still at large and should not be approached. Response: Two inmates escaped after a prison van was attacked on a road in Salford, Greater Manchester. Chief Superintendent Kevin Mulligan. said on Friday: ‘It is unfortunate that MacDonald wasn't present today. to see this sentence being passed down but we will track him down and. find him to ensure that he does get his day in the dock. ‘The offences for which he has been. sentenced today only underline just how dangerous he is. So I would like. to continue my plea to anyone who has information on his whereabouts to. call us. ‘This man has no place on our streets. and will not be allowed to undermine the work we have done in Salford to. help make people feel safe. ‘Anyone who sees MacDonald is not to approach him but call the police.’ Anyone with information is asked to call police on 0161 856 5237, Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or, in an emergency, call 999.

Passage:On December 8, 2017, the Phoenix Suns signed House to a two-way contract with the team. Throughout the rest of the season, House would split his playing time there between Phoenix and their NBA G League squad, the Northern Arizona Suns. House would make his debut with the team a day later, scoring two points and recording a single rebound in 11 minutes of play in a close loss against the San Antonio Spurs. On December 16, House would score a season-high 8 points in 15 minutes of playing time in a 108–106 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. House was later assigned to the Northern Arizona Suns affiliate alongside Davon Reed on December 28, mainly for healing purposes. House then returned to action on January 5, 2018, recording what was at the time a new season-high 9 points in a loss against the San Antonio Spurs. On February 23, his two-way contract expired, meaning he couldn't be allowed to play for Phoenix again until after the NBA G League's first season under its rebranded name concluded. Once that happened, he was allowed to return to Phoenix for the rest of the season. On March 30, House recorded a career-high 8 rebounds in a heartbreaking, buzzer-beating loss against the Houston Rockets. On April 1, House would record a new season-high with 16 points scored alongside 6 rebounds and 3 assists in a 117–107 loss against the Golden State Warriors. Two days later, House recorded 14 points, 6 rebounds, and a career-high 5 assists in a 97–94 win against the Sacramento Kings. On April 6, House would put up his first start in the NBA against the New Orleans Pelicans. Two days later, House would record career-highs of 22 points and 8 rebounds in a 117–100 loss to the Golden State Warriors. Solution:","output":"b"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"Besides the Stovl what is another aircraft mentioned in the paragraph?\\" is in \\"Another deck structure that can be seen is a ski-jump ramp at the forward end of the flight deck. This was first developed to help launch STOVL aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A ski-jump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a ski-jump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea.\\".

Continue the following story. Tanya determined that the couch made the deep scratches, and not the chair, because the  OPT:  a). couch is lighter..  b). chair is lighter..","output":"c). couch had sharp edges hidden beneath its frame. Tanya never imagined her cozy living room would turn into a crime scene of sorts. She had always taken pride in her sense of style and taste. The lush white carpet, the elegant gray couch and the charming wooden chair had been her carefully chosen ensemble. Now, she stared at the deep scratches on the pristine carpet, her heart sinking. Somehow, someway, the couch was the culprit. As she examined the jagged lines, she recalled her initial hypothesis about the chair being the offender. It had an antique design with intricately carved wooden legs. Yet, its soft, velvety cushions concealed its true nature, as Tanya discovered that the chair was significantly lighter. The sheer effort necessary to create such deep, menacing scratches on the carpet indicated that the more robust couch was likely responsible. Moreover, a closer inspection of both the couch and the chair revealed their construction. The chair was indeed old, but the wood was properly sanded, polished, and lacked any uneven or sharp surfaces. On the other hand, the couch had a heavier metal frame hidden beneath its chic gray upholstery. Its modern looks and plump cushions had instantly drawn her to the piece, but little did she know, lurking beneath the frame were sharp, metal edges. She couldn't help but wonder how she had overlooked such an alarming detail. The memories of her shopping excursions came flooding back, reminding her of the day she had brought the couch home. The hurried deliverymen had carelessly dragged the couch into the living room, paying no heed to the damage they were inflicting on the delicate carpet. At the time, she had been entirely focused on rearranging her living space, her excitement building as she planned the room's layout. Tanya couldn't recall paying much attention to the bottom of the couch, so enamored by its beautiful exterior. Now faced with the daunting task of repairing both the couch and the damage it had caused, her initial enthusiasm was replaced by a surge of frustration and regret. Determined to rectify her mistakes, Tanya began her search for a professional furniture repair service. She knew the couch's sharp edges had to be addressed before the damage spiraled further out of control. As for the carpet, she scanned through a series of online tutorials, contemplating whether she should fix it herself or opt for professional help. She came to the conclusion that the scale of the scratches was beyond her expertise, and so, reluctantly, added carpet repair to her growing list of things to do. Meanwhile, she couldn't help but think about her response to the entire ordeal. A part of her felt angry at the negligence of the manufacturers; they had done an inadequate job of sealing the couch's dangerous edges. On the other hand, she also felt responsible for overlooking such a crucial detail. In retrospect, her hasty decisions and neglect of thorough investigations had played a significant role in this debacle. As the days turned into weeks, Tanya proceeded to resolve the damages inflicted on her beloved living room. Lessons were learned, and she realized how important it is to pay attention to even the smallest of details. By the time the couch and carpet were restored to their former glory, Tanya vowed that in the future, she would not fall prey to superficial appearances. With this newfound wisdom, she continued to grow and evolve, cherishing her stylish living room which now held not only elegance but also a valuable life lesson."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government?, using the article: Makeba was among the most visible people campaigning against the apartheid system in South Africa, and was responsible for popularising several anti-apartheid songs, including \\"Meadowlands\\" by Strike Vilakezi and \\"Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd\\" (Watch out, Verwoerd) by Vuyisile Mini. Due to her high profile, she became a spokesperson of sorts for Africans living under oppressive governments, and in particular for black South Africans living under apartheid. When the South African government prevented her from entering her home country, she became a symbol of \\"apartheid's cruelty\\", and she used her position as a celebrity by testifying against apartheid before the UN in 1962 and 1964. Many of her songs were banned within South Africa, leading to Makeba's records being distributed underground, and even her apolitical songs being seen as subversive. She thus became a symbol of resistance to the white-minority government both within and outside South Africa. In an interview in 2000, Masekela said that \\"there [was] nobody in Africa who made the world more aware of what was happening in South Africa than Miriam Makeba.\\"Makeba has also been associated with the movement against colonialism, with the civil rights and black power movements in the US, and with the Pan-African movement.

It is also home to the famous Capilano Suspension Bridge, but warned that the crowds in mid-August would be overwhelming, we were given the tipoff that the Lynn Canyon Suspension Bridge and the surrounding park is a lovely place to while away an afternoon.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"Of course, the Czech phrase \\"Vymyslíme něco\\" translates to \\"Let's come up with something\\" or \\"Let's think of something\\" in English. This expression is often used when people want to brainstorm ideas, create solutions to problems, or make plans together. It can be a starting point for collaboration, inviting others to join in the process of generating new and innovative approaches. In the context of a conversation, you could use \\"Vymyslíme něco\\" to initiate a creative and imaginative discussion, or to encourage others to think outside the box. Czech and English share some similarities, as they both belong to the Indo-European language family, which is a large group of languages spoken in many parts of the world. However, Czech is a Slavic language, while English is a Germanic language, so they have some significant differences in grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. One of the interesting aspects of Czech is its rich system of inflections, which involve changing the form of a word to express its grammatical function in a sentence, such as its case, number, or gender. This process can be seen in the phrase \\"Vymyslíme něco,\\" where the verb \\"vymyslíme\\" is conjugated in the first-person plural form, meaning \\"we come up with.\\" On the other hand, English relies more on word order and auxiliary words to communicate grammatical information. In the English translation \\"Let's think of something,\\" \\"let's\\" is a contraction of \\"let us,\\" which is used to create a first-person plural imperative form, showing that the speaker is including themselves and their interlocutors in the action. Additionally, the preposition \\"of\\" is used to express the relationship between the verb \\"think\\" and the object \\"something.\\" Overall, \\"Vymyslíme něco\\" is a versatile and inclusive phrase that can be used to inspire creativity and collaboration between individuals who want to work together to achieve a common goal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – Farmers in Nebraska, Minnesota, Massachusetts, and New York are staging something of a mechanical revolt. They're attempting to get legislation passed in their states that would enable them, for the first time since the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, to repair their own tractors or get an independent mechanic to help. At the root of the morass is the software that helps run modern tractors and their sensors, diagnostic tools, and other high-tech elements. If farmers so much as open the metaphorical hood to check out the computers they could be violating the federal act, reports Modern Farmer. Mick Minchow, a Nebraska farmer for more than 40 years, is among the many who are fed up, reports Lincoln Journal Star. As it currently stands, any problem with his John Deere 8235 R requires a trip to the dealer and costs him important time. What he'd like to be able to do, per the paper, is something as simple as looking up the system code to determine if it's a serious problem or something as mundane as replacing a filter. John Deere's argument, as reported by Wired, is that giving farmers free rein over the software would \\"make it possible for pirates, third-party developers, and less innovative competitors to free-ride off the creativity, unique expression, and ingenuity of vehicle software.\\" Other potential issues that have been floated: the financial hit such a change could wreak on dealerships, and the complications of buying used equipment whose software was improperly changed. (This copyright dispute involved a bustle in your hedgerow.) Article:","output":"Title: Mechanical Revolt: Farmers Fight for the Right to Repair Their Own Tractors Introduction Farmers in Nebraska, Minnesota, Massachusetts, and New York are taking a stand against what they perceive as unreasonable restrictions on their ability to repair their own tractors, or to enlist the help of an independent mechanic. They are advocating for the passage of legislation in their states that would allow them to do so without violating the stipulations of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Central to this growing discontent is the increasingly complicated software, sensors, and high-tech aspects of modern tractors, which currently can only be legally repaired and maintained by authorized dealers. The Issue In-Depth Mick Minchow, a Nebraska farmer with over 40 years of experience, is among the many who have grown frustrated with these restrictive provisions, as reported by the Lincoln Journal Star. As it currently stands, any problem with his John Deere 8235 R requires a costly and time-consuming trip to the dealership for repair or maintenance. Minchow and other farmers argue that they should be able to carry out simple tasks such as looking up system codes to determine the severity of a problem, or performing routine maintenance like replacing a filter, without running afoul of the federal act. Manufacturers, such as John Deere, have countered this argument, stating that giving farmers unrestricted access to the software would create opportunities for piracy, unauthorized third-party development, and potentially allow less innovative competitors to exploit the technology, according to Wired magazine. Additionally, they argue that any changes to the current system could have a negative financial impact on dealerships, as well as complicating the buying and selling of used equipment whose software may have been improperly altered. These concerns frame the debate as not only a matter of inconvenience for the farmers but also a potential threat to the industry as a whole. The Role of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act At the heart of the issue is the DMCA, a set of laws passed in 1998 that sought to protect copyrighted digital content, including the software that runs modern tractors and their various high-tech components. Under the DMCA, any unauthorized tampering with, or circumventing of, the protections built into this software would constitute a violation of federal law. This bars farmers from diagnosing, repairing, or maintaining their equipment without the assistance of authorized dealers, even if the issue at hand is a simple and mundane fix. The Fight for Change In response to this perceived injustice, farmers in the aforementioned states are pushing for the passage of \\"right to repair\\" legislation, which would grant them greater control over their equipment and enable them to carry out basic maintenance tasks independently or with the help of an independent mechanic. This legislative effort is the latest chapter in an ongoing campaign for greater technological autonomy, which has seen similar battles fought over the repair of smartphones and other consumer electronics. Conclusion It remains to be seen whether these legislative efforts will ultimately succeed in granting farmers the right to repair their own tractors and other agricultural equipment. It is clear, however, that the growth of software-driven technology in many industries, not just agriculture, raises important questions about the balance between protecting intellectual property and granting consumers' greater autonomy and choice in how they maintain and repair their possessions. The \\"mechanical revolt\\" of the nation's farmers may serve as an important catalyst in helping to shape the conversation around these critical issues."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Five men accused of the brutal gang rape and murder of a trainee physiotherapist in Delhi have pleaded not guilty in a case that has already prompted the reform of India's sex crime laws.      The accused, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur, Pawan Kumar and brothers Ram and Mukesh Singh, signed statements in the new fast-track court, set up after the killing on 16 December, declaring they were innocent, said one of the men's lawyers.      The court will begin hearing the evidence of witnesses on Tuesday.      The five men could face the death sentence if convicted. A sixth accused, believed to be 17 years old, will be tried in a juvenile court and faces a maximum sentence of three years in a reform facility.      Police say the victim and a male friend were heading home from an evening movie when they boarded the bus. The attackers beat the man and raped the woman, causing her serious internal injuries with a metal bar.      The victims were eventually dumped on the roadside, and the woman died two weeks later in a Singapore hospital.      \\"After the judge read out the charges, the five pleaded not guilty and walked out,\\" AP Singh, a lawyer defending Sharma and Thakur told Reuters.      The prosecution says it has strong evidence against the five men including bloodstained clothing, DNA matches, mobile phone records, confessions and eyewitness statements.      Singh says Sharma was never on the bus and Thakur was hiding beneath a seat and never took part in the crime. The other men are represented by two other lawyers. ||||| A fast-track court here today framed charges against five accused in the December 16 gangrape case and put them on trial on various counts including conspiracy to abduct the 23-year-old girl and sexually assault and murder her.      A fresh offence under section 366 of the Indian Penal Code was added by the court against them for abducting the girl with the intention to compel and force her to 'illicit intercourse'.      The court, which fixed February 5 for starting the trial, also charged them with murder of the paramedic girl under section 302 (murder) of the IPC which entails the maximum punishment of death penalty.      Additional Sessions Judge Yogesh Khanna concluded that there were facts prima facie to suggest that the accused, along with another juvenile associate, conspired to deceitfully induce the girl and her male friend to board the vehicle believing it to be a chartered bus for raping the victim and committing other offences.      The accused bus driver Ram Singh, his brother Mukesh, Vinay Sharma, Pawan Gupta and Akshay Singh pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.      The sixth accused, which the police in the charge sheet claimed to be most brutal among them, has been declared 'minor' by the Juvenile Justice Board, which will try him.      However, the fast track court in the order described the juvenile as an 'associate' of the five accused, who committed gang rape in furtherance of the conspiracy and 'in furtherance of common intention'.      The girl had died in a hospital in Singapore on December 29 last year.      The court has farmed charges under section 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 376 (2)(g) (gangrape), 377 (unnatural offences), 395 (dacoity), 396 (murder in dacoity), 201 (destruction of evidence), 120-B (conspiracy), 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder), 365 ( kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery), and 412 (dishonestly receiving property stolen in the commission of a dacoity) of the IPC.

In these two sentences (1) Before laying sod on that clay, the ground needs two inches of coverage with topsoil. (2) Don't go to lunch if we don't have enough coverage for the help-desk phones., does the word coverage mean the same thing?","output":"No, the word \\"coverage\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences. Although they share the same word – coverage – the context and meaning are different in each scenario. Let's analyze both sentences to better understand the distinct meanings of \\"coverage\\" within these statements. 1. Before laying sod on that clay, the ground needs two inches of coverage with topsoil. In this sentence, \\"coverage\\" refers to the physical application of a layer of material (in this case, topsoil) over a surface (the clay ground). The context suggests that it is necessary to place a two-inch layer of topsoil on the clay ground before laying the sod. This will ensure that the sod has a suitable base for proper growth and establishment. The underlying idea is that topsoil, with its higher nutrient content and better drainage, will lead to a healthier and more efficient growth of the sod compared to clay soil. 2. Don't go to lunch if we don't have enough coverage for the help-desk phones. In this sentence, \\"coverage\\" refers to the availability of sufficient personnel to handle the incoming calls and successfully address customers' issues at the help-desk. The context is related to staffing and resource allocation, where ensuring that there are enough people to handle the workload is critical for providing good customer service. The sentence implies that if there are not enough people to cover the help-desk phones, the person in question should not go to lunch, as it would potentially lead to longer wait times for customers and a negative experience. In this context, \\"coverage\\" deals with people's presence and time to guarantee smooth operation. In conclusion, while both sentences use the word \\"coverage,\\" they refer to different concepts depending on the context. In the first sentence, \\"coverage\\" relates to the application of a material (topsoil) over another surface (clay ground), while in the second sentence, \\"coverage\\" is about ensuring adequate personnel availability to handle customer service responsibilities."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order. He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President. The Vice President was logged calling the President at 10:18 for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation. On Air Force One, the President's press secretary was taking notes; Ari Fleischer recorded that at 10:20, the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary. Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania. Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization. At approximately 10:30, the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane, this time only 5 to 10 miles out. Believing they had only a minute or two, the Vice President again communicated the authorization to \\"engage or \\"take out\\" the aircraft. At 10:33, Hadley told the air threat conference call: \\"I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are there's an inbound aircraft flying low 5 miles out. The Vice President's guidance was we need to take them out.\\" Once again, there was no immediate information about the fate of the inbound aircraft. In the apt description of one witness, \\"It drops below the radar screen and it's just continually hovering in your imagination; you don't know where it is or what happens to it.\\" Eventually, the shelter received word that the alleged hijacker 5 miles away had been a medevac helicopter. Transmission of the Authorization from the White House to the Pilots The NMCC learned of United 93's hijacking at about 10:03. At this time the FAA had no contact with the military at the level of national command. The NMCC learned about United 93 from the White House.

At least 20 states have said that they will not or only partly comply with the request, citing privacy concerns. Democrats fear that the commission may be used to justify tightening voting procedures - changes which could make certain groups less likely to vote. The groups most affected by so-called voter suppression tend to vote Democrat. But it is not just Democrats who are opposed to the collection of such data by the federal government. Mississippi's Secretary of State, Delbert Hosemann, a Republican, said in an official statement that his reply to the commission would be \\"they can go jump in the Gulf of Mexico and Mississippi is a great state to launch from\\". Mr Trump set up the commission to investigate claims - unsubstantiated, but which he repeats - that millions of fraudulent votes cost him the popular vote in the 2016 presidential election. He secured more votes in the all-important electoral college than his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, thus winning the presidency. Mr Trump established the Presidential Advisory commission on Election Integrity in May, despite evidence that voter fraud is not a widespread problem in the US. The aim is to \\"increase the American people's confidence in the integrity of our election systems\\". Kentucky's Secretary of State, Alison Lundergan Grimes, said she would not be releasing \\"sensitive personal data to the federal government\\". \\"Kentucky will not aid a commission that is at best a waste of taxpayer money and at worst an attempt to legitimise voter suppression efforts across the country,\\" she said in a statement.

Here is a news article: Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Air India says being grossly overweight does have a bearing on reflexes and can impair agility      India's national carrier Air India is set to ground 125 \\"overweight\\" cabin crew members.      An Air India official told the BBC that the order had been made on the basis of a document issued by the civil aviation authority last year.      The airline had warned 600 of its crew to \\"shape up\\" last year, but 125 had not managed to maintain the required weight, the official said.      The airline says however that the issue is not one of weight, but \\"fitness\\".      Airline officials confirmed to the BBC that the directive had been issued, but said it was part of an internal document which they could not comment on publicly.      They said the basis for the recommendation was concern that \\"unfit\\" cabin crew would not be able to operate efficiently in emergency situations.      Aviation regulations state that a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18-25 is normal for a male cabin crew member, while for a female it is 18-22.      Aviation expert Kapil Kaul told the BBC: \\"An overweight crew is a signal the airline is not fit. You need a smart friendly agile crew that can complement the image of the airline.\\"      However, national union leader Tapan Sen denied that service rules mention any firm weight restriction for cabin crew.      This is not the first time Air India has grounded staff over weight issues. In 2009, it dismissed nine hostesses for being \\"overweight\\" on safety grounds saying their shape could \\"impair agility\\".      In 2004, the airline landed itself in further controversy when it said that potential air hostesses and stewards should not have any scars, acne, or any major marks on the face. ||||| Air India last year warned 600 of its 3,500 cabin crew to lose weight within six months or risk being taken off flights and given a job on the ground. The airline now plans to remove about 130 from cabin crew duty because their body mass index (BMI) levels remain above the prescribed limit.      The airline said that the “normal” BMI for an air hostess is between 18 and 22, “overweight” between 22 and 27, and “obese” for a value above 27. For male attendants the brackets were 18 to 25, 25 to 30, and above. The NHS says a “healthy” BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9.      After the state-run airline’s staff were tested last year, the 600 found to be “overweight” or “obese” were declared “temporarily unfit” for flight duties and asked to undergo clinical examinations and lose weight by changing their diet and lifestyle and exercising more, while being monitored by staff.      “About 130 of them failed the reassessment,” an Air India official told The Telegraph in Calcutta. “We are now declaring them permanently unfit for their job as flight attendants.”      “People who are fitter can respond quicker and more efficiently in case of any untoward situation.”      This is not the first time Air India has removed staff from the air for being overweight. In 2009, the airline ground 10 flight attendants who failed to slim down.      In 2013, Air India said that deploying female flight attendants rather than male could save them about £329,000 per year in full costs because they weight on average 33 to 44 pounds lighter.      A member of the All India Cabin Crew Association said the grounding of 130 staff was “ridiculous”, according to The Telegraph.      “Any industry insider would vouch that Air India flight attendants are the best, mainly because of their long experience. So, this guideline and the management's decision to follow it to the letter is unacceptable.”      The airline has had a difficult year, with a special recruitment day in March welcoming zero attendees. It has also suffered from financial difficulties in recent years, with a government bailout necessary to keep the carrier afloat in 2012. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Air India is set to ground 125 \\"overweight\\" cabin crew members, citing fitness concerns that may affect their ability to operate efficiently in emergency situations.

Text:  Waves with shorter wavelengths have more energy. Answer:","output":"Based on the given text, it is stated that \\"waves with shorter wavelengths have more energy.\\" Consequently, if Jimbo increases the wavelength of the soundwave he is generating, the energy carried by that soundwave will decrease. To provide more context, it is essential to understand the relationship between the wavelength, frequency, and energy of a wave. The energy of a wave is directly proportional to its frequency and indirectly proportional to its wavelength. In simpler terms, as the wavelength of a wave increases, the frequency and the energy decrease. Similarly, as the wavelength decreases, the frequency and energy increase. Sound waves, like other types of waves, obey this principle. Since Jimbo is increasing the wavelength of the soundwave he is generating, the frequency of the soundwave will decrease, resulting in a reduction in energy carried by that soundwave. This outcome is in accordance with the given statement that \\"waves with shorter wavelengths have more energy.\\" In summary, when Jimbo increases the wavelength of the soundwave he is generating, the energy carried by that soundwave will decrease. This is due to the inverse relationship between wavelength and energy, where longer wavelengths correspond to lower energy, while shorter wavelengths correspond to higher energy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Snowboard Cross and Ski Cross Have Long History With Danger WEST VANCOUVER, British Columbia  Four at a time, the racers barrel down the mountain, navigating banked turns, long jumps, washboard bumps and  if they can help it  one another. The concept is simple: first one to the bottom wins. Join the discussion with news, analysis and features from the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver. Jean-Christophe Bott/Keystone, via Associated Press Danielle Poleschuk of Canda, right, and Katrin Ofner of Austria at a World Cup ski cross event last month. Ski cross is making its Olympic debut. There are times that no one makes it to the finish line without a tumble. And it is not unusual for some racers to never make it at all. “Yeah, we’ve had a lot of injuries, a lot of serious ones, a couple deaths in our sport,” said the American snowboard cross athlete Nate Holland, a gold medal contender. “It’s no joke.” A luger from the Republic of Georgia was killed in a crash on Friday, setting a somber tone for the Vancouver Games and stirring debate over how much is too much risk. Despite its high speeds through an icy chute, luge has had relatively few serious injuries since it was added to the Olympic program in 1964. Death in the sport is rare. But snowboard cross and its cousin, ski cross, the only new medal sport added for these Olympics, are probably the most dangerous sports at the Winter Games. Weeks after finishing 12th at the 2006 Turin Games, the Olympic debut for snowboard cross, Jonatan Johansson of Sweden died of internal injuries after a hard landing on a World Cup course in Lake Placid, N.Y. About 18 months before, Line Ostvold of Norway, a former world champion enticed out of retirement by the addition of snowboard cross to the Olympic roster, died of a head injury after a spill on a World Cup course in Chile. Still, the spectacle of snowboard cross was appealing enough that the International Olympic Committee added ski cross to the winter program in November 2006. Somewhat predictably, its debut next Sunday could be substantially depleted because of injuries in recent weeks. The former American Alpine skiing Olympians Daron Rahlves, 36, and Casey Puckett, 37, found that they missed the thrill of hurtling down a steep mountain after retiring. Having re-emerged as medal contenders in ski cross, each was hurt at the Winter X Games days after being named to the Olympic team. Their status for the Olympics is uncertain; Rahlves said it could be a last-minute decision, and Puckett tentatively plans to compete. The same is true for the Austrian snowboard cross favorite Max Schairer, the defending World Cup champion, who was released from a hospital Jan. 31, a day after sustaining a concussion and breaking ribs in a fall. At training last week, Yuka Fujimori of Japan, who was seventh in women’s snowboard cross at the 2006 Olympics, sustained neck and hip injuries and was hospitalized. And last year, three weeks after winning the bronze at the Winter X Games, the Norwegian snowboarder Stian Sivertzen crashed on the course that will be used for these Olympics, fracturing his collarbone, pelvis and lower back, and tearing his aorta. He later went into a coma but has recovered to reach the Olympics. The skiers and riders in the cross sports, which will take place on the same course at Cypress Mountain, realize danger has an allure not just for fans, but for themselves. The American snowboard cross athlete Graham Watanabe, whose injury history includes a severely injured knee and  in a separate crash  a pelvis broken in four places, said he was proud to make the Olympics largely because of the injuries he had overcome. “I try to put myself in positions where I come up to a jump and say, ‘This thing scares me to death right now,’ ” Watanabe said. “But if I conquer this one, the next one’s going to be easier.” The course at Cypress Mountain drops with an 18 percent grade over about two-thirds of a mile, or 1,100 meters. Athletes will jockey for position near the top, then snake around turns, over blind mounds and, airborne, across wide gaps, looking for places to pass. While the snowboard cross and ski cross are often compared to roller derby, intentional contact is not permitted. It is much more graceful than that. “There really is no feeling in the world like soaring through the air with other guys right next to you,” said Holland, who has won the Winter X Games five consecutive times, but was 14th in Turin after a fall and feels he has some unfinished Olympic business. “It’s really loud, before the lip, with all the boards on the snow. And then it’s just silent in the air. Then you hear pop-pop-pop-pop  all the landings. All your senses are perked, for sure.” But things can fall apart in a hurry. Puckett, a four-time Olympian in Alpine skiing, was leading a World Cup ski cross race in Grindelwald, Switzerland, two years ago. One of the four competitors had already fallen before a second lost his balance over a jump and, in midair, knocked out a third, who skidded out of control and upended Puckett, sending him cartwheeling down the mountain. The chain reaction sent Puckett to a hospital in a helicopter with a serious shoulder injury. The injury he had in January did not come about the same way. Leading near the finish, he crashed into a gate on his own. This time, it was his other shoulder that was hurt. The most famous race in snowboard cross probably came at the 2006 Olympics and it was not the American Seth Wescott’s gold medal run, which capped a day of chaos and carnage. It was the women’s final. Canada’s Maelle Ricker, a medal favorite again this Olympics, fell so hard that she was airlifted to a hospital. Dominique Maltais of Canada collided with a competitor and flew off the course and into the safety netting. And the American Lindsey Jacobellis was cruising to victory until the last jump when, comfortably ahead, she coolly grabbed her board, lost her balance in the air and tumbled to the snow. Tanja Frieden of Switzerland, who had been far behind after her brush with Maltais, breezed past for the victory. Jacobellis was left with one of the Winter Games’ most famous silver medals. Her quest for gold this time around is a major story line. Most telling might be what occurred in late January. Frieden retired from the snowboard cross after tearing her Achilles’ tendons in a crash. Crying, she made the announcement from a wheelchair.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes.  Do you have any questions?","output":"Yes, I do have a few questions: 1. What is the current progress of the legislation that would allow the Illinois Supreme Court to dedicate money raised through fee hikes to legal services for the poor? 2.

Mihail Sadoveanu (Romanian: [miha'il sado'veanu]; occasionally referred to as Mihai Sadoveanu; November 5, 1880 - October 19, 1961) was a Romanian novelist, short story writer, journalist and political figure, who twice served as acting head of state for the communist republic (1947-1948 and 1958). One of the most prolific Romanian-language writers, he is remembered mostly for his historical and adventure novels, as well as for his nature writing. An author whose career spanned five decades, Sadoveanu was an early associate of the traditionalist magazine Samanatorul, before becoming known as a Realist writer and an adherent to the Poporanist current represented by Viata Romaneasca journal. His books, critically acclaimed for their vision of age-old solitude and natural abundance, are generally set in the historical region of Moldavia, building on themes from Romania's medieval and early modern history. In 1896, when he was aged sixteen, Sadoveanu gave thought to writing a monograph on Moldavian Prince Stephen the Great, but his first literary attempts date from the following year. It was in 1897 that a sketch story, titled Domnisoara M din Falticeni (\\"Miss M from Falticeni\\") and signed Mihai din Pascani (\\"Mihai from Pascani\\"), was successfully submitted for publishing to the Bucharest-based satirical magazine Dracu. He started writing for Ovid Densusianu's journal Vieata Noua in 1898. His contributions, featured alongside those of Gala Galaction, N. D. Cocea, and Tudor Arghezi, include another sketch story and a lyric poem. Sadoveanu was however dissatisfied with Densusianu's agenda, and critical of the entire Romanian Symbolist movement for which the review spoke. He ultimately began writing pieces for non-Symbolist magazines such as Opinia and Pagini Literare. In parallel, he founded and printed by hand a short-lived journal, known to researches as either Aurora or Lumea.  Sadoveanu left for Bucharest in 1900, intending to study Law at the University's Faculty of Law, but withdrew soon after, deciding to dedicate himself to literature. He began frequenting the bohemian society in the capital, but, following a sudden change in outlook, abandoned poetry and focused his work entirely on Realist prose. In 1901, Sadoveanu married Ecaterina Balu, with whom he settled in Falticeni, where he began work on his first novellas and decided to make his living as a professional writer. His first draft for a novel, Fratii Potcoava (\\"The Potcoava Brothers\\"), came out in 1902, when fragments were published by Pagini Alese magazine under the pseudonym M. S. Cobuz. The following year, Sadoveanu was drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, stationed as a guard near Targu Ocna, and inspired by the experience to write some of his first social criticism narratives.  After that time, he spent much of his home in the country, where he raised a large family. Initially, the Sadoveanus lived in a house previously owned by celebrated Moldavian raconteur Ion Creanga, before they commissioned a new building, famed for its surrounding Gradina Linistii (\\"Garden of Quietude\\"). He was the father of eleven, among whom were three daughters: Despina, Teodora and Profira Sadoveanu, the latter of whom was a poet and a novelist. Of his sons, Dimitrie Sadoveanu became a painter, while Paul-Mihu, the youngest (born 1920), was author of the novel Ca floarea campului...

Article: Republican leaders, racing against the clock to find a tough response to President Barack Obama’s immigration policies, are now left with two messy options: punt or risk getting blamed for shutting down an agency that fights terrorism.      A punt is looking more likely by the hour.      Story Continued Below      On Monday evening, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell moved the Senate toward a standalone bill narrowly targeting the president’s 2014 executive action and sparing the 2012 action aimed only at certain young immigrants. It’s the GOP leader’s first step in trying to disentangle the immigration fight from a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security.      Senior Republicans said privately earlier in the day that the party may have no choice now but to fund the agency on a short-term basis. The length of a so-called continuing resolution isn’t clear, but McConnell plans to discuss the matter with GOP senators in a closed-door lunch on Tuesday.      The dual efforts — to potentially move a short-term funding bill and attack the immigration policies separately — are meant to signal to conservatives the GOP will continue to battle the president on immigration without jeopardizing DHS funding. While passing a short-term continuing resolution without restricting Obama on immigration would likely clear the Senate, it faces an uphill climb in the House, where it is unclear if conservatives will view the GOP’s evolving tactics as a run toward political cover.      Both McConnell and Boehner have vowed to avoid any shutdowns — raising the stakes for the leaders in only the second month of a Congress now fully under GOP control.      “There will be no shutdown,” one top Republican said privately Monday.      The Republicans’ first choice — a bill that would keep DHS open while blocking Obama’s executive order shielding roughly 5 million illegal immigrants from deportation — stalled again in the Senate on Monday. For the fourth time this month, Senate Democrats filibustered the measure. The vote was 47-46.      But with worries growing over national security preparedness in the event of a shutdown, an increasing number of Republicans said the party may have no option other than to extend the department’s funding for several weeks under a Continuing Resolution.      “Clearly I’d prefer a CR over lapsing,” said Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), who’s up for reelection next year.      Though members of both parties don’t want a temporary fix —“I’m not for a short-term CR,” the No. 2 Senate Republican, John Cornyn of Texas, said Monday — Republican leaders are unlikely to have a better alternative unless they can persuade their rank-and-file to defer to the courts. A Texas district judge recently blocked Obama’s November order, but the administration is appealing.      “We’re in a really strange constitutional spot: That you can’t ignore a president who has exceeded his authority, but neither can you put the nation at risk,” said Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.). “I don’t think [a shutdown] is going to happen. I think we’ll resolve it. I don’t hear anyone rushing to say: ‘Let’s have a shutdown to prove a point.’”      Like many Republicans, Lankford refused to say whether he would vote for a continuing resolution with no immigration provisions. But he did say a delay is more likely than a shutdown because it would allow time for the GOP to continue to fight the immigration order — and he wasn’t alone on Monday.      “That’s the most likely way out of it. I don’t think we ought to shut the government down, it doesn’t serve conservative ends,” said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.).      And after playing down the effects of a funding lapse last week, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) is now calling for an end to the stalemate.      A range of fall-back proposals continued to be floated on Monday. One would be to tie a short-term budget bill to the outcome of the Texas immigration case, another would be to file an amicus brief in support of the lawsuit.      A number of outspoken conservatives — such as Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz — are trying to stiffen GOP leaders’ spines, arguing that Democrats will shoulder the blame if the department shuts down. And as McConnell began to search for a way out of the jam and his colleagues expressed openness to punting on the immigration fight, Cruz did little to hide his disregard for party leaders’ tactics.      “There was a reason in December I so vigorously opposed the CRomnibus strategy: Because leadership had no way out,” Cruz said of a bill to fund the entire government until October, save for a short-term DHS bill that set up this month’s fight.      “I now await, eagerly, leadership’s solution,” Cruz said.      Neither Sessions nor Cruz would say if they would seek to throw procedural hurdles in front of a stopgap funding bill, which could add days to Senate consideration, with passage in the House anything but assured. Still, the approaching deadline could spur Congress to act, as deadlines typically do with one major exception: the government shutdown over Obamacare in 2013.      The parallels were not lost on Democrats, who spent Monday circulating polls that showed Americans would blame Republicans for a shutdown and that they prefer immigration policy be kept separate from funding the homeland security agency. Democrats are also gleefully highlighting remarks from Republicans questioning GOP leaders’ strategy. Both Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona warned on Sunday of major political fallout for their party and urged the GOP to place its bets on the legal challenge to Obama’s executive actions.      ”Leave it to the courts. It would be an excellent case for the Supreme Court,” McCain said on Monday, seeking to separate the funding deadline from the immigration fight. “I want to leave it to the courts and see how it all plays out.”      But even as Republicans lamented their situation, they also blamed Democrats for refusing to debate a bill. Ever since the Senate minority rejected the House’s proposal from being debated on the floor, Republicans have tried to saddle Senate Democrats’ with responsibility for a potential shutdown.      “If Democrats would quit filibustering and allow us to get on this bill, which fully funds the Department of Homeland Security, we’re [open] to letting them have amendments,” said Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.). “Can’t finish the bill if you can’t start it.”      But Hoeven, an appropriator who oversees homeland security spending, also threw cold water on a temporary bill.      “I don’t support going to a CR. I think it would be better to get to a bill like we got and go through the process and offer amendments,” Hoeven said. “But at the end of day, whatever we pass, has to get through the House, too.”      As the congressional standoff barrels to a climax, the Obama administration revved up its messaging machine. Flanked by nearly 30 employees from across the department and the chiefs of FEMA and Customs and Border Patrol, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Monday up to 80 percent of the department would work without pay in the event of a shutdown, while 30,000 employees would be furloughed, including 80 percent of FEMA.      Though it seems the only way out of a shutdown he decries, the DHS secretary also lambasted a potential short-term funding bill and likened it to “trying to drive across the country with no more than 5 gallons of gas in your tank and you don’t know when the next gas station will appear.”      Jake Sherman contributed to this report. ||||| Washington (CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced he is changing tactics in an attempt to break a stalemate with Democrats ahead of Friday's deadline when the Department of Homeland Security will run out of money, after taking his fourth failed vote on a House-approved measure.      On a measure that needed 60 votes to succeed, it failed with 47 voting in support to 46 against.      McConnell said he would bring a separate bill to the floor this week that would block funding for the implementation of President Barack Obama's immigration executive orders -- provisions in the current DHS bill that Democrats object to.      By separating the immigration matter from the DHS funding bill, McConnell hopes to satisfy conservatives by allowing them to vote against the immigration orders while allowing a so-called \\"clean\\" DHS bill possibly to move on a separate track.      While it's too early to know if the new plan will work -- and there are many procedural hurdles that could doom it -- it's the first new idea in weeks to break the congressional logjam over DHS.      Republicans also believe it will put on the spot a handful of centrist Democrats who raised concerns with the immigration orders but have so-far refused to vote against them as long as they were attached to the DHS bill.      \\"Some Democrats give the impression they want Congress to address the overreach,\\" McConnell said. \\"But when they vote, they always seem to have an excuse for supporting actions they once criticized. So I'm going to begin proceedings on targeted legislation that would only address the most recent overreach from November. It isn't tied to DHS' funding. It removes their excuse.\\"      Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, used the failed vote as an opportunity to blame Republicans for failing to fund the agency.      \\"It's becoming clear Sen. McConnell realizes he must separate himself from the far right, but the bottom line is this proposal doesn't bring us any closer to actually funding DHS, and Republicans still have no real plan to achieve that goal,\\" he said.      It's not apparent how many Democrats might be persuaded to vote against the immigration orders in a standalone bill and whether it would be enough to give Republicans the 60 votes they need to get over procedural hurdles. It is unlikely supporters could get the 67 votes needed to overcome a veto, which surely would come from the President should the legislation clear Congress.      Before Monday's vote, Senate Democrats squabbled with House Republicans about who exactly was to blame for the ongoing standoff.      There are only four days before DHS funding ends, which will leave large parts of the agency shuttered or employees will be forced to work without pay.      \\"We passed a bill that fully funds the department,\\" House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said in an interview on CNN. \\"We'll probably see something come from the Senate this week and we'll have to make some tough choices. It would be irresponsible for lawmakers and policy-makers to shut down his national security agency at this grave time.\\"      Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri urged her colleagues, via Twitter, to pass a funding measure to \\"show unity against terrorists.\\"      \\"Let's pass funding for Homeland Security today to show unity against terrorists,\\" McCaskill tweeted. \\"Then R's can bring up immigration for vote immediately after.\\"      Let's pass funding for Homeland Security today to show unity against terrorists.Then Rs can bring up immigration for vote immediately after. — Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) February 23, 2015      But DHS is still prepping for the worst case scenario. In a letter to employees, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said the department was making preparations \\"in the unlikely and unfortunate event that Congress does not fund DHS before Friday night a shutdown of this department occurs.\\"      \\"Have faith that his difficult and unnecessary situation will be resolved,\\" Johnson said. ||||| Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, joined by the department employees, during a news conference in Washington, Monday, Feb. 23, 2015. A partial shutdown of the Homeland Security Department loomed... (Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — Days from a Homeland Security Department shutdown, Senate Republicans sought a way out Monday by splitting President Barack Obama's contested immigration measures from the agency's funding bill.      It was not clear whether the gambit by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would succeed ahead of Friday's midnight deadline to fund the department or see it shut down. It was far from certain whether it would win any Democratic support, and House conservatives remain firmly opposed to any funding bill for the Homeland Security Department that does not also overturn Obama's executive actions on immigration.      But with Senate Democrats united against a House-passed bill that funds the agency while blocking the president on immigration, McConnell said it was time for another approach.      \\"It's another way to get the Senate unstuck from a Democrat filibuster and move the debate forward,\\" McConnell said on the Senate floor after a vote to advance the House-passed bill failed 47-46, short of the 60 votes needed. Three previous attempts earlier in the month had yielded similar results.      \\"This is our colleagues' chance to do exactly what they led their constituents to believe they'd do: defend the rule of law, without more excuses,\\" McConnell said in a jab at the handful of Senate Democrats who have voiced opposition to Obama's executive actions offering work permits and deportation deferrals for millions in the country illegally.      A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, welcomed McConnell's move, though without predicting its chances of success in the House.      \\"This vote will highlight the irresponsible hypocrisy of any Senate Democrat who claims to oppose President Obama's executive overreach on immigration, but refuses to vote to stop it,\\" said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel.      McConnell left unclear whether a vote overturning Obama's immigration moves would be followed by a stand-alone vote to fund the Homeland Security Department — an omission not lost on Senate Democrats.      \\"With four days left to go before Homeland Security runs out, he's bringing a bill to the floor that doesn't fund Homeland Security,\\" said Adam Jentleson, spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.      McConnell's move came after Obama warned the nation's governors that states would feel the economic pain of a Homeland Security shutdown, with tens of thousands of workers in line to be furloughed if the agency shuts down at midnight Friday, and many more forced to work without pay.      \\"It will have a direct impact on your economy, and it will have a direct impact on America's national security,\\" Obama told governors as they visited the White House as part of their annual conference.      Within hours of Republicans securing the Senate majority last November, McConnell vowed there would be no government shutdowns, but the immigration fight threatened to shut down the Homeland Security Department and undermine GOP promises that they would show the nation they could govern.      McConnell's move seemed aimed at dividing Senate Democrats who have been united against the 39.7 billion House-passed legislation that funds the Homeland Security Department through the Sept. 30 end of the budget year, while also rolling back Obama's executive actions granting work permits to millions of immigrants in this country illegally.      Aides said McConnell's bill would target only the executive actions Obama announced in November, not an earlier directive from 2012 that provided protections to hundreds of thousands of immigrants brought illegally to the country as youths.      That could make it more difficult for the handful of moderate Democrats who opposed Obama's executive actions when he announced them in November to vote against the legislation.      The move came as growing numbers of Senate Republicans called for Congress to jettison the immigration fight and pass a \\"clean\\" Homeland Security spending bill without immigration language. In wake of a federal court's ruling last week stating that Obama had exceeded his authority and putting his immigration policies on hold, several Senate Republicans said the courts were the best place to fight that battle.      \\"Leave it to the courts. I think we have an excellent case before the Supreme Court,\\" Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said Monday night.      The Obama administration on Monday asked U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen in Brownsville, Texas, to put his ruling on hold and filed a notice of appeal of his ruling to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.      House conservatives, by contrast, said the court developments only strengthened their resolve to use the Homeland Security budget to fight Obama on immigration.      \\"A federal judge has confirmed that what we've done is the right thing,\\" conservative Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio said Monday. \\"I hope that the U.S. Senate can see the light and do the right thing.\\"      A short-term extension of current funding levels remained possible, but lawmakers have only a few days to come up with even that partial solution before the agency's funding expires.      A Homeland Security shutdown would result in some 30,000 administrative and other workers getting furloughed. Some 200,000 others would fall into essential categories and stay on the job at agencies like the Border Patrol, Secret Service and Transportation Security Administration, though mostly without drawing a paycheck until the situation is resolved.      ___=      Associated Press writers Andrew Taylor and Charles Babington contributed to this report. |||||Summary:","output":"Republicans in the US are struggling to find an appropriate response to President Obama's immigration policies. They can either delay the decision or risk being blamed for shutting down an agency which combats terrorism. Currently, a delay looks like the most likely option. Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, is moving the Senate to a standalone bill which specifically targets the President's immigration policies without involving a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security.

Article: Media caption Emergency workers were on the scene quickly after the crash      The US authorities have begun an investigation into the causes of Sunday's train crash in the Bronx area of New York in which four people were killed and more than 60 injured.      The 05:54 from Poughkeepsie to Grand Central Station derailed as it went into a bend in the railway line near Spuyten Duyvil station.      It was reportedly travelling faster than the speed limit in the area.      The train's event recorder, similar to a flight recorder, has been recovered.      The National Transportation Safety Board sent investigators to the site with instructions to inspect the overturned cars and interpret information from the recorder. They are expected to be there for several days.      'Spinal injury'      The Federal Railroad Administration has also sent a team of investigators.      Officials have identified the deceased as Donna Smith, 54, James Lovell, 58, James Ferrari, 59, and Ahn Kisook, 35. Three of the dead were found outside the train, and one was found inside.

On Monday, a second data recorder was found in the train's rear locomotive. Investigators said they hoped to download information on the speed and settings of the train from that recorder.      Some 26,000 weekday commuters on the route were warned to brace for crowded trains on the first morning after the derailment.      Train service south of Spuyten Duyvil has been \\"suspended until further notice\\", the train's operator, Metro-North, said on Monday morning. Buses were being provided to the New York subway system.      Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokeswoman Marjorie Anders said the bend where the derailment occurred was in a slow-speed area.      The train appeared to be going \\"a lot faster\\" than normal as it approached the bend coming into the station, passenger Frank Tatulli told WABC-TV.      The speed limit on the curve is 30mph (50km/h), compared with 70mph in the area approaching it, investigators said.

The Fire Department of New York says there are \\"multiple injuries\\"... (Associated Press)      The National Transportation Safety Board said its investigators could spend up to 10 days probing all aspects of the early Sunday morning accident on Metro-North that toppled seven cars _ carrying roughly 150 passengers _ and the locomotive, leaving the lead car only inches from the water at a bend in the Bronx where the Hudson and Harlem rivers meet.      The NTSB said it would consider whether excessive speed, mechanical problems or human error played a role in the crash.      It was the latest accident in a troubled year for Metro-North, which had never experienced passenger death in an accident in its 31-year history.      Late Sunday night, the Metropolitan Transit Authority, which oversees Metro-North, was preparing to begin using cranes to upright some of the toppled cars on the slight chance anyone might still be underneath.      Joel Zaritsky, who was dozing as he traveled to a dental convention aboard the train, woke up to feel his car overturning several times.      \\"Then I saw the gravel coming at me, and I heard people screaming,\\" he told The Associated Press, holding his bloody right hand. \\"There was smoke everywhere and debris. People were thrown to the other side of the train.\\"      The MTA said it would provide shuttle buses Monday morning to ferry passengers between stops and to another rail line, but it urged riders who could work from home to do so.      NTSB board member Earl Weener said at a press conference Sunday the agency had just begun its investigation and hadn't yet spoken to the train's conductor, who was among the injured. His name was not released.      Investigators were due to examine factors ranging from the track condition to the crew's performance. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the track did not appear to be faulty, leaving speed as a possible culprit for the crash. The speed limit on the curve is 30 mph, compared with 70 mph in the area approaching it, Weener said.      Authorities did not yet know how fast the train was traveling but had found a data recorder, he said.      One passenger, Frank Tatulli, told WABC-TV that the train appeared to be going \\"a lot faster\\" than usual as it approached the sharp curve near the Spuyten Duyvil station.      Nearby residents awoke to a building-shaking boom. Angel Gonzalez was in bed in his high-rise apartment overlooking the rail curve when he heard the roar.      \\"I thought it was a plane that crashed,\\" he said.      Within minutes, dozens of emergency crews arrived and carried passengers away on stretchers, some wearing neck braces. Others, bloodied and scratched, held ice packs to their heads. In their efforts to find passengers, rescuers shattered windows, searched nearby woods and waters and used pneumatic jacks and air bags to peer under wreckage.      The MTA identified the victims Sunday as Donna L. Smith, 54, of Newburgh; James G. Lovell, 58, of Cold Spring; James M. Ferrari, 59, of Montrose; and Ahn Kisook, 35, of Queens. Three of the dead were found outside the train, and one was found inside, authorities said. Autopsies were scheduled for Monday, the New York City medical examiner's office said.      Lovell, an audio technician, was traveling from his Cold Spring home to midtown Manhattan to work on the famed Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, said longtime friend Janet Barton. The tree-lighting ceremony is Wednesday night.      Eleven of the injured were believed to be critically wounded and another six seriously hurt, according to the Fire Department. After visiting an area hospital Sunday evening, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters that the 11 who originally were critical no longer appeared to have life-threatening injuries.      As deadly as the derailment was, the toll could have been far greater had it happened on a weekday, or had the lead car plunged into the water instead of nearing it. The train was about half-full at the time of the crash, rail officials said.      For decades, the NTSB has been urging railroads to install technology that can stop derailing caused by excessive speed, along with other problems.      A rail-safety law passed by Congress in 2008 gave commuter and freight railroads until the end of 2015 to install the systems, known as positive train control. PTC is aimed at preventing human error _ the cause of about 40 percent of train accidents. But the systems are expensive and complicated. Railroads are trying to push back the installation deadline another five to seven years.      Metro-North is in the process of installing the technology. It now has what's called an \\"automatic train control\\" signal system, which automatically applies the brakes if an engineer fails to respond to an alert that indicates excessive speed.      Such systems can slow trains in some circumstances but not bring them to a halt, said Grady Cothen, a former Federal Railroad Administration safety official.      Sunday's accident came six months after an eastbound train derailed in Bridgeport, Conn., and was struck by a westbound train. The crash injured 73 passengers, two engineers and a conductor. In July, a freight train full of garbage derailed on the same Metro-North line near the site of Sunday's wreckage.      ___      Associated Press writers Deepti Hajela, Colleen Long, Jake Pearson and Jennifer Peltz in New York, Joan Lowy in Washington and Stephen Singer in Hartford, Conn., contributed to this report. ||||| Jim Lovell in an undated photo provided by his family.      By Josh Dawsey and Will James      Jim Lovell preferred life away from the spotlight: living on a secluded lake, caring for his family while his wife served as a town official and staging complex, behind-the-scenes effects for large entertainment events.      “He would never seek the limelight,” said friend Jonathan Kruk. “It was almost like he didn’t have an ego. He was the one who made it possible, smiling behind the scenes.”      Grieving family members and friends said the “Today” show audio technician was a family-oriented man who loved Hudson Valley history, good writing and adventures in the wild outdoors near his Cold Spring home. Mr. Lovell, 58 years old, had battled cancer and endured open-heart surgery, according to close friend Richard Shea.      Another friend, John Zuvic, said Mr. Lovell’s flexible schedule allowed him to do what he cared about most – spending time with his sons. He often went fishing, swimming and windsurfing with them in nearby Lake Valhalla. “His main pastime was being with his boys,” he said. He was also fascinated by military history and played guitar, Mr. Zuvic said.      Mr. Lovell had left the family’s home early Monday for Rockefeller Center, where he was preparing the Christmas tree for his televised premiere. “That was a challenge, to get the tree up and ready for the world,” Mr. Zuvic said.      In a note to the staff, Don Nash, executive producer of “Today,” called Mr. Lovell “one of the nicest guys you ever met.”      On Monday, his grieving son, Finn, described the emotional scene of learning of his father’s death. Finn had spent the night with a friend, who drove him home when his mother said to immediately return. His mom, Philipstown Town Councilwoman Nancy Montgomery, left for the Bronx and later returned to summon her sons into a room of the lakeside home.      “All my brothers came into my room, he said. “And she said, ‘He’s gone.’”      Finn, 17 years old, said his mom was being “strong for her boys, strong for the rest of the family.”      Mr. Zuvic said he has been thinking about all the things he and Mr. Lovell had talked about doing together, like finishing a renovation project at Mr. Lovell’s home or camping with their children in the mountains nearby, that they would never get to do. “We were looking forward to a lot of things,” he said. ||||| It was not clear how fast the Metro-North train was going. But an official from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said the train operator had reported that the train was going into the turn too fast and that he had performed an emergency braking maneuver.      The operator told the first rescuers to reach the scene that he had “dumped” the brakes, according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.      Dumping the brakes, railroad experts said, is a last-resort move that has the effect of slamming on the emergency brakes on all the cars of a train at once. It is usually done to avert a collision with another train or a vehicle at a grade-level crossing.      Video      Officials opened an investigation but cautioned that it would take time to piece together the evidence and identify a possible cause. The National Transportation Safety Board sent investigators to the site with instructions to inspect the overturned cars and interpret information from the train’s “event recorders,” devices that are somewhat similar to the flight recorders on airplanes. The Federal Railroad Administration also dispatched a team of investigators.      Earl F. Weener of the transportation safety board said at a morning news conference with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo that investigators had yet to interview the operator of the train, who was among those injured. A spokeswoman for Metro-North said the engineer, identified as William Rockefeller of Germantown, N.Y., had about 14 years’ experience with the line. There were also three conductors on the train.      “Our mission is to not just understand what happened but why it happened, with the intent of preventing it from happening again,” Mr. Weener said.      The accident was the latest episode in a trying year for Metro-North, the nation’s second-largest commuter railroad, and the first with passenger fatalities in Metro-North’s 30-year history.

Scores of passengers were hurt, five critically.      And in July, a CSX freight train derailed near where the Metro-North train left the tracks on Sunday. Officials said there was no connection between the accidents.      By Sunday night, the transportation safety board had given Metro-North clearance to begin removing the crippled train and repairing the tracks. But the crash was likely to disrupt the Monday commute for thousands of passengers on the railroad’s Hudson line. Metro-North arranged for buses to take Hudson line passengers to White Plains, N.Y., on Sunday to catch trains on a different line that was running normally. On Monday, Hudson line trains will be running as far south as Yonkers, where passengers will be able to catch buses to the 242nd Street station of the No. 1 train.      The train jumped the tracks on one of the sharpest curves in the Metro-North system, not far from the Spuyten Duyvil station. Governor Cuomo said the Metro-North engineer had described applying the brakes as the train approached the curve, a stretch of track where the speed limit dropped to 30 miles an hour, from 70. But it was unclear whether the brakes had malfunctioned or had been activated too late.      “We’ve always had this configuration — we didn’t have accidents, right?” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference.      Video      “It can’t just be the curve,” he said, adding, “There has to be another factor.”      The train was propelled by a locomotive at the back end, as is customary on the Hudson line. Northbound trains are pulled by an engine at the front, but the trains are not turned around at the end of the line. Instead, southbound trains are pushed, with the locomotive at the back. As it came off the tracks, the train plowed up dirt as it burrowed into the ground.      It came to a stop in a postcard scene of a late-autumn landscape, among bulrushes and trees that had long since lost their leaves. Police and Fire Department rescuers had to take down part of a chain-link fence to reach the tracks, not far from where the Hudson meets the Harlem River.

The rescuers put ladders up to one of the overturned cars, climbed in and “started pulling people out,” said Kevin Farrell, 28, a hospital administrator who lives in a co-op building overlooking the crash site. He said he watched passengers being helped out with their arms already in splints. Several were away taken on stretchers.      The trip had begun before sunrise in Poughkeepsie, the riverfront town where New York’s colonial leaders ratified the United States Constitution. The train picked up a small collection of people with their own reasons to be riding a train into Manhattan so early on the Sunday after Thanksgiving. It stopped in Ossining an hour after it left Poughkeepsie, then in Tarrytown 18 minutes before the crash.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      That was its last stop before 125th Street in Manhattan, where it was due 12 minutes after it derailed.      Mr. Cuomo, at the news conference with Mr. Weener of the safety board, said more than once that “safety is Job 1.”      “If there is a lesson to be learned from this tragedy,” the governor said, “we want to learn it.”      The victims were identified as James M. Ferrari, 59, of Montrose, N.Y.; Kisook Ahn, 35, of Woodside, Queens; Jim G. Lovell, 58, of Cold Spring, N.Y.; and Donna L. Smith, 54, of Newburgh, N.Y. The injured passengers were taken to a number of hospitals. A police officer who was on the train was taken to St. Barnabas Hospital with broken bones. The officer, a woman, was in stable condition, officials at the hospital said.      NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center said two of the 14 passengers it treated were in critical condition on Sunday night; five others were admitted. Four other passengers were treated at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Allen Pavilion, at Broadway and 220th Street. All four were released, the hospital said.      Photo      Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg did not visit the accident scene, but Sunday night he visited victims at Montefiore Medical Center and at St. Barnabas.      “The two families that I talked to, their loved ones were in serious but not critical condition, and the doctors had told them both that they were going to survive and, with some pain and that sort of thing, come out O.K.,” Mr. Bloomberg said after his visit to St. Barnabas, before he entered Montefiore.      “Both very badly banged up; in one case the woman was in the operating room so I didn’t talk to her, I talked to family members,” he said. “In the other case, I talked to the police officer, who is 37 years old, been on the job for eight years, and she was in good spirits; actually, we joked about me being unemployed in 32 days and the fact that I was too old to join the Police Department. She had three kids and the kids are O.K. Somebody had taken care of them.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      He added, “The tragic thing is four people who aren’t going to come home. I think at this point most, if not all, of those that were critical look like they will be O.K., eventually.”      The fire commissioner, Salvatore J. Cassano, said the consequences of the accident — the injuries and the disruptions — could have been worse if it had not happened on a Sunday morning. “On a work day, fully occupied, it would have been a tremendous disaster,” he said.      But passengers said it was harrowing just the same. Some had fallen asleep, like Joel Zaritsky of Poughkeepsie, on his way to Manhattan for a dental convention, and Ryan Kelly of Yorktown Heights, N.Y., on his way to his job at a discount clothing store in Lower Manhattan. Mr. Kelly said he had holiday music playing on his headphones and woke up realizing that the train was tilting over.      “I grabbed the seat and got thrown into the shelf where you put your stuff,” he said. “I hooked my hand in there and shielded my face with the other hand.” He said one hand was injured.      Mr. Russell, who was in the third car from the back, said the train tipped and slid along “like a vacuum cleaner” as it came off the tracks, with gravel and dirt pouring in as the windows shattered. He gripped his seat as the train rolled over.      “You had to hold the chair so you didn’t fall out,” he said.      Mr. Russell said he helped other passengers before climbing out into a field of broken glass and debris. He was taken to Jacobi Medical Center, where he was treated for back pain and released. He said he was rethinking his routine.      “You think you’re safe on the train,” he said. “I know I’m going to be taking a car for a while.” ||||| As for so many other commuters from the river towns and suburbs north of New York City, the Metro-North Hudson line train was Jim Lovell’s lifeline, shuttling him from his Hudson Valley home to Grand Central Terminal in under 90 minutes whenever he had a job to do.      On Sunday morning, the assignment was special: Mr. Lovell, a freelance media consultant with nearly 40 years of experience in sound, lights and production, had been hired to help set up the towering Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center, which is to be lighted on Wednesday. He took the early train from Cold Spring, N.Y., on the banks of the Hudson River, bound for Manhattan.      Boarding the train a few stops after Mr. Lovell, Donna L. Smith, 54, and her sister, Linda Smith, were making one of their occasional trips to the city for pleasure. Sometimes they took in a Mets game or went shopping; this time, Donna Smith was going to see her sister perform Handel’s “Messiah” with her choral group.      Image Jim Lovell was one of four people killed in a derailment.      But neither Mr. Lovell, 58, nor Donna Smith ever made it to Manhattan. They were two of four passengers killed when a southbound train derailed near the Spuyten Duyvil station just after 7 a.m. Sunday. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A summary is a brief statement or account of the main points of something.

Use the following highlights to write an article: 'I'd heard banging and drilling and thought he was doing some DIY', said burgled neighbour Neil Barton. Nathan Kennedy jailed for three-and-a-half years. Article:","output":"Title: \\"The Disguised Sounds of Crime: Burglar Busted after Pretending to Do DIY\\" Intro: In an unexpected turn of events, Neil Barton, a concerned neighbor who thought his neighbor was merely completing a DIY project, discovered that Nathan Kennedy was, in fact, committing a burglary. Kennedy, who cleverly masked his criminal activities with the sounds of drilling and banging, has now been sentenced to three-and-a-half years of imprisonment. Paragraph 1: Neil Barton, an unsuspecting resident of a quiet neighborhood, had overheard continuous banging and drilling noises coming from next door, which led him to believe that his neighbor Nathan Kennedy was carrying out some DIY work. However, the truth proved to be far more sinister than initially anticipated. Paragraph 2: As time passed the noises continued, but Barton noticed that Kennedy was nowhere to be seen and had not mentioned any DIY projects. He decided to investigate further, and upon closer inspection, discovered that Kennedy had been committing a series of burglaries using the sounds of drilling and banging to camouflage his illegal activities. Paragraph 3: Once the menacing truth was unveiled, authorities were alerted, resulting in the apprehension of Nathan Kennedy. He was charged with multiple counts of burglary and, following a swift trial, sentenced to three-and-a-half years behind bars. The law enforcement officials commended Barton for his vigilance and quick thinking, which effectively led to Kennedy's arrest. Conclusion: Nathan Kennedy's deceptive tactics, involving the impersonation of DIY sounds to cover up his burglary spree, ultimately led to his downfall, thanks to the keen observation of his neighbor, Neil Barton. This story serves as a reminder to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activities, even if they seem mundane or innocent at first glance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In poetry, what effect does onomatopoeia have? Select from:  --no.  --yes. The answer is:","output":"yes. These two questions are essentially the same, as they both inquire about the effect of onomatopoeia in a literary context. While the first question is framed more generally, the second question specifies the context as poetry. However, it can be inferred that onomatopoeia is a device commonly utilized in literature, including poetry, and that the implications would remain consistent in either context. Onomatopoeia refers to the literary device in which words mimic or resemble the sounds they represent. This technique can make a work, such as a poem, more engaging and vivid by creating a multisensory experience for the reader. In poetry specifically, onomatopoeia contributes to the overall tone, atmosphere, and emotional impact of the piece. It can convey action and bring a poem to life by creating an auditory experience alongside the visual and emotional elements. Furthermore, onomatopoeia can also enhance the musicality and rhythm of a poem, making it more enjoyable to read or recite. In summary, both questions address the impact of onomatopoeia, with the second question specifying its use in poetry. Despite the slight difference in wording, the essence of the inquiry remains the same.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Many attackers look for individuals who are distracted and not aware of what’s happening around them. Avoid staring at your phone while you’re walking or on the bus, and instead, keep your eyes on the landscape and people around you. This can help you identify any potentially dangerous situations.  It’s okay if you have your phone out or nearby—that could even be helpful if you need to call for help. Just don’t use it to the detriment of not knowing what’s going on around you. Pay attention to how people are acting, if someone is following or staring at you a lot, and any potential escape routes you could take in case something were to happen. Even if the person in the car seems kind, confused, or lost, don’t step up to an open window. If you can, cut across the street or behind some houses to get away from an unknown person who is trying to talk to you.  Common ruses that would-be-abductors use are asking for directions or pretending to be looking for a lost pet. They assume that people, children especially, will take pity on them and want to be helpful. If this car circles back around to you again, try going to a neighbor’s house or calling your parents or the police. If you can, take note of the license plate number. You could also turn and walk in the opposite direction if you think a car is following you. If they also turn around, you know there is a potentially dangerous situation at hand. When someone is following you on foot, it’s important to get to the safety of other people or to at least get far enough away from them that they can’t easily grab you. The main goal is to prevent them from getting close enough to touch you or to coordinate an abduction with a second person waiting nearby in a car. Generally, there is more safety in numbers. Try ducking into a store or crossing over to a busier street. Abductors are less likely to strike when their victim is surrounded by other people. If you’re out shopping after dark, park as close to the front of the store as you can, and try to get a parking spot beneath a lamp post. If you are walking somewhere after dark, try to stay in well-lit areas where there are other people around.  If you’re at a store, you could also ask an employee to escort you to your car. If you carry mace with you, make sure you know how to use it. If it lies forgotten at the bottom of your bag, it won’t help you if you’re attacked. Have an agreed-upon phrase that only you and your family members know. If someone approaches you and says they were sent by your parents to give you a ride home for whatever reason, they must be able to give you the code word. If they don’t know it, run away and find other adults.  This code word or phrase should be something simple, yet unique, to your family that a stranger couldn’t easily guess. Even if the person approaching you knows your name and the names of your other family members, you still need to ask for the code. It’s possible they learned your names some other way and don’t actually know your family. If you feel that a person is off or they’re giving you weird vibes, trust that feeling. If you feel uncomfortable in any kind of situation, it’s okay to leave or ask someone to come get you. Attackers can use the promise of people being polite or afraid of being rude to their advantage, so resolve that you will trust your gut and keep yourself safe, even if that means you have to be “rude.” Our intuition often comes from a primal place that is meant to identify potential threats to our safety.","output":"When you're outside, it's important to pay attention to what's happening around you and not just look at your phone.

Gibson challenged the idea that the nervous system actively constructs conscious visual perception, and instead promoted ecological psychology, in which the mind directly perceives environmental stimuli without additional cognitive construction or processing. A \\"Review of General Psychology\\" survey, published in 2002, ranked Gibson as the 88th most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with John Garcia, David Rumelhart, Louis Leon Thurstone, Margaret Floy Washburn, and Robert S. Woodworth.  - David Everett Rumelhart (June 12, 1942  March 13, 2011) was an American psychologist who made many contributions to the formal analysis of human cognition, working primarily within the frameworks of mathematical psychology, symbolic artificial intelligence, and parallel distributed processing. He also admired formal linguistic approaches to cognition, and explored the possibility of formulating a formal grammar to capture the structure of stories.  - Eleanor Jack Gibson ( December 7 , 1910 -- December 30 , 2002 ) was an American psychologist . Among her contributions to psychology , the most important are the study of perception in infants and toddlers . She is popularly known for the \`\` visual cliff '' experiment in which precocial animals , and crawling human infants , showed their ability to perceive depth by avoiding the deep side of a virtual cliff . Along with her husband James J. Gibson , she forwarded the concept that perceptual learning takes place by differentiation . Gibson is credited with creating the Gibsonian or ecological theory of development , which centers on the concept of affordances and how children learn to perceive them . According to Life magazine in 1959 , the \`\` Visual Cliff '' was \`\` a wooden table from the edge of which strong plate glass extended ... Children were put on the table top and coaxed to crawl out over the glass . But when they got to the edge of the cliff and looked down almost all of them quickly withdrew . Even their mothers ' most persuasive urgings could not get them out . '' Similar studies were done with animals , including rats and kittens . The visual cliff findings indicated that perception is an essentially adaptive process , or as Dr. Gibson put it , We perceive to learn , as well as learn to perceive . In 1982 , she was invited to Beijing to teach Chinese psychologists about recent theories and techniques of research . She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977 . In 1992 , Eleanor Gibson was awarded the National Medal of Science . A Review of General Psychology survey , published in 2002 , ranked Gibson as the 74th most cited psychologist of the 20th century , in a tie with Paul E. Meehl .  - James Bowdoin II (August 7, 1726  November 6, 1790) was an American political and intellectual leader from Boston, Massachusetts, during the American Revolution and the following decade. He initially gained fame and influence as a wealthy merchant. He served in both branches of the Massachusetts General Court from the 1750s to the 1770s. Although he was initially supportive of the royal governors, he opposed British colonial policy and eventually became an influential advocate of independence. He authored a highly political report on the 1770 Boston Massacre that has been described by historian Francis Walett as one of the most influential pieces of writing that shaped public opinion in the colonies.  - The visual cliff apparatus was created by psychologists Eleanor J. Gibson and Richard D. Walk at Cornell University to investigate depth perception in human and animal species. This apparatus allowed them to experimentally adjust the optical and tactical stimuli associated with a simulated cliff while protecting the subjects from injury. The visual cliff consists of a sheet of Plexiglas that covers a cloth with a high-contrast checkerboard pattern. On one side the cloth is placed immediately beneath the Plexiglas, and on the other, it is dropped about 4 feet below. Since the Plexiglas supports the weight of the infant this is a visual cliff rather than a drop off. Using a visual cliff apparatus, Gibson and Walk examined possible perceptual differences at crawling age between human infants born preterm and human infants born at term without documented visual or motor impairments.  - The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, frequently known as the American Academy, is one of the oldest and most prestigious honorary societies and a leading center for policy research in the United States. Election to the Academy is considered one of the nation's highest honors since its founding during the American Revolution by John Adams, John Hancock, James Bowdoin, and other scholar-patriots who contributed prominently to the establishment of the new nation, its government, and the United States Constitution.  - Eleanor Jack Gibson (7 December 1910  30 December 2002) was an American psychologist who focused on reading development and perceptual learning in infants and toddlers. In the 1960s and 1970s Gibson, with her husband James J. Gibson, created the Gibsonian ecological theory of development which emphasized how important perception was because it allows humans to adapt to their environments. Perhaps her most well-known contribution to psychology was the \\"visual cliff\\", which studied depth perception and visual or motor impairments in both human and animal species. This led to a new understanding of perceptual development in infants. The environment provides information for the sensory system to develop with increased stimuli, so perceptual development corresponds with environmental stimuli. Infants develop from adapting to the environment. Gibson was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1971 and as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977. In 1992 she was awarded the National Medal of Science, which is the highest scientific honor in the United States, and only five of which have been awarded to psychologists.  - Margaret Floy Washburn (July 25, 1871  October 29, 1939), leading American psychologist in the early 20th century, was best known for her experimental work in animal behavior and motor theory development. She was the first woman to be granted a PhD in psychology (1894), and the second woman, after Mary Whiton Calkins, to serve as an APA President (1921). A \\"Review of General Psychology\\" survey, published in 2002, ranked Washburn as the 88th most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with John Garcia, James J. Gibson, David Rumelhart, Louis Leon Thurstone, and Robert S. Woodworth.  - Robert Sessions Woodworth (October 17, 1869  July 4, 1962) was an American academic psychologist of the first half of the twentieth century. He studied under William James along with such prominent psychologists as Leta Stetter Hollingworth, James Rowland Angell, and Edward Thorndike. A graduate of Harvard and Columbia, his textbook \\"Psychology: A study of mental life\\", which appeared first in 1921, went through many editions and was the first introduction to psychology for generations of undergraduate students. His 1938 textbook of Experimental Psychology was scarcely less influential, especially in the 1954 second edition, written with Harold H. Schlosberg. He is known for introducing the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) formula of behavior. A \\"Review of General Psychology\\" survey, published in 2002, ranked Woodworth as the 88th most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with John Garcia, James J. Gibson, David Rumelhart, Louis Leon Thurstone, and Margaret Floy Washburn.  - Perceptual learning is the process of learning improved skills of perception. These improvements range from simple sensory discriminations (e.g., distinguishing two musical tones from one another) to complex categorizations of spatial and temporal patterns relevant to real-world expertise (e.g., reading, seeing relations among chess pieces, knowing whether or not an X-ray image shows a tumor). Sensory modalities may include visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, and taste. Perceptual learning forms important foundations of complex cognitive processes (i.e., language) and interacts with other kinds of learning to produce perceptual expertise. Underlying perceptual learning are changes in the neural circuitry. The ability for perceptual learning is retained throughout life.  - The National Medal of Science is an honor bestowed by the President of the United States to individuals in science and engineering who have made important contributions to the advancement of knowledge in the fields of behavioral and social sciences, biology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics and physics. The twelve member presidential Committee on the National Medal of Science is responsible for selecting award recipients and is administered by the National Science Foundation (NSF).  - Louis Leon Thurstone (29 May 1887  30 September 1955) was a U.S. pioneer in the fields of psychometrics and psychophysics. He conceived the approach to measurement known as the law of comparative judgment, and is well known for his contributions to factor analysis. A \\"Review of General Psychology\\" survey, published in 2002, ranked Thurstone as the 88th most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with John Garcia, James J. Gibson, David Rumelhart, Margaret Floy Washburn, and Robert S. Woodworth.

The jobs the president is creating pay 9,000 less than the jobs that we're losing. And this is the first president in 72 years to preside over an economy in America that has lost jobs, 1. 6 million jobs. Hypothesis: americas job market is growing","output":"The task at hand is to determine whether the given hypothesis, 'America's job market is growing', can be drawn from the given context.  Let's analyze the context provided step-by-step: 1. An initial mention of 'start creating jobs in America' seems to suggest that job creation is a needed and ongoing process, which might purport an intent for future growth. 2. The mention of the newly created jobs paying '9,000 less than the jobs that we're losing' implies that, while jobs may be being created, they are not of the same quality or income level as the jobs being lost. 3. The mention of the president presiding 'over an economy in America that has lost jobs, 1.6 million jobs' points to a net loss in jobs, countering the concept of growth. Based on these considerations, the hypothesis 'America's job market is growing' does not conform to the information given in the context. The context illustrates a current job market that is struggling with lower quality new jobs and a net loss of jobs, pointing more towards a decremented or stagnant job market rather than a growing one."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To elaborate, water bodies like lakes and rivers have a certain carrying capacity, which is the maximum amount of water they can hold without overflowing. This carrying capacity can be influenced by various factors including topology, vegetation, soil composition, and artificially built structures like dams or levees.  In a balanced environment, excess water in the river or lake—caused by prolonged or heavy rain, for example—will drain into the ground or flow downstream to other bodies of water, thereby maintaining the water level. However, there might be circumstances that prevent this natural drainage or increase the water flow into the river or lake. This could include upstream rain, snowmelt, a ruptured dam, changing weather patterns, or loss of vegetation.  When the water input is too great for the lake or river to handle, the water level rises beyond its usual limit, causing it to overflow its banks. This is the first step in the flood process you outlined, and sets in motion a chain of events that can lead to widespread flooding: the water starts to build up on the ground, covers streets, gets deep in some places, and enters houses and other buildings, causing significant damage and potentially endangering lives.  After the initial cause of the overflow—be it constant heavy rain or damaged infrastructure like a dam—is addressed or stops naturally, the floodwater will gradually recede. It will flow into streams or finally absorb into the ground, get taken up by plants, and some of it will eventually evaporate. This marks the concluding stages of the flood process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon general counsel threatened legal action Thursday against a former Navy SEAL who wrote a revealing book about last year's Osama bin Laden raid, warning him he has violated secrecy agreements and broken federal law.  In a letter addressed to \\"Mark Owen,\\" the pen name of book author Matt Bissonnette, General Counsel Jeh Charles Johnson wrote the Pentagon is considering pursuing \\"all remedies legally available\\" against the former SEAL and his publisher, Penguin Putnam.  \\"In the judgment of the Department of Defense, you are in material breach and violation of the nondisclosure agreements you signed.

The story sheds more light on the now famous skill and daring of the SEALs. But the book's very existence stoked controversy because members of the elite unit don't usually divulge details of their operations.  The book is one of several accounts about the operation to have surfaced after last year's raid.  Buzz ramps up over SEAL's bin Laden book  Government officials only recently became aware the former SEAL was writing a book, but they were told it encompassed more than just the raid and included vignettes from training and other missions.

Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage. Context: The company \\"Spacely Sprockets and Spindles\\" is in dire trouble. Their latest project, dubbed the 'Orbiting Ore Asteroid,' has had numerous technical setbacks, doing only 3 days of work in over 6 months. To make matters worse, the vice-president in charge of operations, Alexander Throttle-bottom, has run off, making this the fourth vice-president that the operation has lost. Matters are further compounded when the site's assistant refuses to press the start button to activate the factory, or accept Spacely's offer for a promotion or raise.Using his secretarial computer, Spacely pegs George Jetson to be the new vice-president, sending George home to pack and tell his family. However, the news is met with with sadness, as the move will interfere with Jane's recycling program, Elroy's spaceball tournament, and Judy's date with rock star Cosmic Cosmo.Even so, the family manages to come together (with the exception of Judy who is sad about her missed date), and the family arrives at the 'Orbiting Ore Asteroid,' which not only houses the factory, but a shopping center and housing complex. The Jetsons meet their new neighbors, including Lucy-2, whose husband Rudy-2 works at the factory, and son Teddy-2 plays on the local spaceball team. They also meet the Furbolo family, including their mischievous daughter, Fergie.The next day, George arrives at work and meets Rudy-2. Rudy verses George on the factory equipment, and they prepare for the official start-up of the factory. Meanwhile, Jane and Judy go shopping with Lucy-2. Still feeling depressed, Judy goes off on her own, and meets a boy named Apollo Blue, whom she quickly develops a crush on.Later on that day, everyone turns out for the re-opening of the plant, with George activating the controls. However, the machine malfunctions again, irritating Spacely. Shortly thereafter, Rudy-2 reveals to George about previous technical issues with the plant, and cautions that it may be safer if George were to go home. George refuses, not wanting to give up on being vice-president. The next day, repairs appear to be made but the factory again malfunctions. Spacely blames George for the technical glitches, and leaves Earth to check on the factory.After inspecting the factory again, Rudy-2 reveals that the incidents do not appear to be accidents, but 'warnings' to shut down the plant. Rudy then explains about the factory's troubles, and of the 4 previous vice-presidents. George decides to stay overnight at the plant, and figure out just what is happening.Elroy and Teddy-2 sneak off to follow him. However, when their disappearance is found out, Jane asks Judy and Apollo Blue to try and find them. Judy and Apollo find both Elroy and Teddy-2 at the plant, along with Fergie, who tagged along. They also find a strange little creature, whose species Fergie identifies as a Grungee. The Grungee leads them into the core of the asteroid, where it is revealed why the factory keeps being sabotaged: The factory's enormous drill is destroying the Grungee's habitat in the base of the asteroid. The Grungees have been making the plant malfunction to keep their homes from being destroyed.Jane and Astro soon make their way into the factory, along with Rudy-2. Rudy stays in the factory, as Jane and Astro go below. Soon afterwards, they all find George, who had been bound and gagged by the Grungees. George has no idea why this has happened to him, untill Jane and the others explain.Shortly after this revelation, Mr Spacely arrives, and against Rudy-2's protestations, reactivates the drill, almost killing Elroy when it's actions cause a large amount of rock to collapse. The other Grungees manage to help him, and they all head top-side. After Mr Spacely refuses to stop the drill, George manage to make the system malfunction. When Spacely demands an explanation, George explains about the Grungees, and Spacely is soon found to have ignored reports that the asteroid was inhabited.A deal is made by which the Grungees operate the plant,   Question: Judy Jetson is having a hard time adjusting, and accepting the fact that she lost her chance at a date who?","output":"Judy Jetson is having a hard time adjusting, and accepting the fact that she lost her chance at a date with rock star Cosmic Cosmo."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the 19th-century, it was used in a much narrower sense by English writers to discuss developments in the early Italian libretto, e.g., \\"Rigoletto\\" and \\"Un ballo in maschera\\". Characteristic are the influence of French bourgeois drama, female instead of male protagonists, and the practice of opening the action with a chorus.  - Opera seria (plural: \\"opere serie\\"; usually called \\"dramma per musica\\" or \\"melodramma serio\\") is an Italian musical term which refers to the noble and \\"serious\\" style of Italian opera that predominated in Europe from the 1710s to c. 1770. The term itself was rarely used at the time and only attained common usage once \\"opera seria\\" was becoming unfashionable and beginning to be viewed as a historical genre. The popular rival to \\"opera seria\\" was \\"opera buffa,\\" the 'comic' opera that took its cue from the improvisatory commedia dell'arte.  - Italian Baroque (or \\"Barocco\\") is a stylistic period in Italian history and art that spanned from the late 16th century to the early 18th century.  - A Requiem or Requiem Mass, also known as Mass for the dead (Latin: \\"Missa pro defunctis\\") or Mass of the dead (Latin: \\"Missa defunctorum\\"), is a Mass in the Catholic Church offered for the repose of the soul or souls of one or more deceased persons, using a particular form of the Roman Missal. It is frequently, but not necessarily, celebrated in the context of a funeral.  - Thésée (\\"Theseus\\") is a \\"tragédie en musique\\", an early type of French opera, in a prologue and five acts with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully and a libretto by Philippe Quinault based on Ovid's \\"Metamorphoses\\". It was first performed on 11 January 1675 by the Paris Opera for the royal court at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye and was first performed in public in April at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal in Paris.  - The Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye is a royal palace in the commune of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, in the \\"département\\" of Yvelines, about 19 km west of Paris, France. Today, it houses the Musée d'Archéologie Nationale (National Museum of Archaeology).  - Ottone, re di Germania (\\"Otto, King of Germany\\", HWV 15) is an opera by George Frideric Handel, to an Italianlanguage libretto adapted by Nicola Francesco Haym from the libretto by Stefano Benedetto Pallavicino for Antonio Lotti's opera \\"Teofane\\". It was the first new opera written for the Royal Academy of Music (1719)'s fourth season and had its first performance on 12 January 1723 at the King's Theatre, Haymarket in London. Handel had assembled a cast of operatic superstars for this season and the opera became an enormous success.  - A libretto is the text used in, or intended for, an extended musical work such as an opera, operetta, masque, oratorio, cantata or musical. The term \\"libretto\\" is also sometimes used to refer to the text of major liturgical works, such as the Mass, requiem and sacred cantata, or the story line of a ballet.  - The Paris Opera() is the primary opera company of France. It was founded in 1669 by Louis XIV as the , and shortly thereafter was placed under the leadership of Jean-Baptiste Lully and officially renamed the ', but continued to be known more simply as the . Classical ballet as we know it today arose within the Paris Opera as the Paris Opera Ballet and has remained an integral and important part of the company. Currently called the ', it mainly produces operas at its modern 2700-seat theatre Opéra Bastille which opened in 1989, and ballets and some classical operas at the older 1970-seat Palais Garnier which opened in 1875. Small scale and contemporary works are also staged in the 500-seat Amphitheatre under the Opéra Bastille.  - Teseo ( \`\` Theseus '' , HWV 9 ; Italian pronunciation : ( tezo ) ) is an opera seria with music by George Frideric Handel , the only Handel opera that is in five acts . The Italian - language libretto was by Nicola Francesco Haym , after Philippe Quinault 's Thésée . It was Handel 's third London opera , intended to follow the success of Rinaldo after the unpopular Il pastor fido . First performed on 10 January 1713,Teseo featured \`\` magical '' effects such as flying dragons , transformation scenes and apparitions and had a cast of notable Italian opera singers . It was a success with London audiences , receiving thirteen performances even though the stage machinery for the \`\` magical '' effects broke down , and would have received more performances had not one of the theatre 's managers run away with the box office receipts .  - Flavio, re de' Longobardi (\\"Flavio, King of the Lombards\\", HWV 16) is an opera seria in three acts by George Frideric Handel. The Italian-language libretto was by Nicola Francesco Haym, after Matteo Noris's \\"Flavio Cuniberto\\". It was Handel's fourth full-length opera for the Royal Academy of Music. Handel had originally entitled the opera after the character of Emilia in the opera.  - Publius Ovidius Naso (20 March 43 BC  AD 17/18), known as Ovid in the English-speaking world, was a Roman poet who lived during the reign of Augustus. He was a contemporary of the older Virgil and Horace, with whom he is often ranked as one of the three canonical poets of Latin literature. The Imperial scholar Quintilian considered him the last of the Latin love elegists. He enjoyed enormous popularity, but, in one of the mysteries of literary history, was sent by Augustus into exile in a remote province on the Black Sea, where he remained until his death. Ovid himself attributes his exile to \\"carmen et error\\", \\"a poem and a mistake\\", but his discretion in discussing the causes has resulted in much speculation among scholars.  - Dramma per musica (Italian, literally: \\"drama for music\\", plural: \\"drammi per musica\\") is a term which was used by dramatists in Italy and elsewhere between the late-17th and mid-19th centuries. In modern times the same meaning of \\"drama for music\\" was conveyed through the Italian Greek-rooted word \\"melodramma\\" (from  = song or music +  = scenic action). \\"Dramma per musica\\" never meant \\"drama \\"through\\" music\\", let alone music drama.  - Theseus was the mythical king of Athens and was the son of Aethra by two fathers: Aegeus and Poseidon.  - Nicola Francesco Haym (6 July 1678  31 July 1729) was an Italian opera librettist, composer, theatre manager and performer, and numismatist. He is best remembered for adapting texts into libretti for the London operas of George Frideric Handel and Giovanni Bononcini. Libretti that he provided for Handel included those for \\"Giulio Cesare\\", \\"Ottone\\", \\"Flavio\\", \\"Tamerlano\\", \\"Rodelinda\\", and several others; for Bononcini, he produced two, \\"Calfurnia\\" and \\"Astianatte\\".  - An organ concerto is a piece of music, an instrumental concerto for a pipe organ soloist with an orchestra. The form first evolves in the 18th century, when composers including Antonio Vivaldi, Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel wrote organ concertos with small orchestras, and with solo parts which rarely call for the organ pedal board. During the Classical period organ concerto became popular in many places, especially in Bavaria, Austria and Bohemia (whether called there a concerto, pastorella, or sonata), reaching a position of being almost an integral part of the church music tradition of \\"jubilus\\" character. From the Romantic era fewer works are known. Finally, there are some 20th- and 21st-century examples, of which the concerto by Francis Poulenc has entered the basic repertoire, and is quite frequently played.  - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.  - The masque was a form of festive courtly entertainment that flourished in 16th- and early 17th-century Europe, though it was developed earlier in Italy, in forms including the intermedio (a public version of the masque was the pageant). A masque involved music and dancing, singing and acting, within an elaborate stage design, in which the architectural framing and costumes might be designed by a renowned architect, to present a deferential allegory flattering to the patron. Professional actors and musicians were hired for the speaking and singing parts. Often the masquers, who did not speak or sing, were courtiers: the English queen Anne of Denmark frequently danced with her ladies in masques between 1603 and 1611, and Henry VIII and Charles I of England performed in the masques at their courts. In the tradition of masque, Louis XIV of France danced in ballets at Versailles with music by Jean-Baptiste Lully.  - Poseidon (Greek: ) was one of the twelve Olympian deities of the pantheon in Greek mythology. His main domain was the ocean, and he is called the \\"God of the Sea\\". Additionally, he is referred to as \\"Earth-Shaker\\" due to his role in causing earthquakes, and has been called the \\"tamer of horses\\". He is usually depicted as an older male with curly hair and a beard.  - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.  - Tamerlano (\\"Tamerlane\\", HWV 18) is an opera seria in three acts written for the Royal Academy of Music theatre company, with music by George Frideric Handel to an Italian text by Nicola Francesco Haym, adapted from Agostin Piovene's \\"Tamerlano\\" together with another libretto entitled \\"Bajazet\\" after Nicolas Pradon's \\"Tamerlan, ou La Mort de Bajazet\\".  - Tragédie en musique (Musical tragedy), also known as tragédie lyrique (French lyric tragedy), is a genre of French opera introduced by Jean-Baptiste Lully and used by his followers until the second half of the eighteenth century. Operas in this genre are usually based on stories from Classical mythology or the Italian romantic epics of Tasso and Ariosto. The stories may not have a tragic ending  in fact, they generally don't  but the atmosphere must be noble and elevated. The standard \\"tragédie en musique\\" has five acts. Earlier works in the genre were preceded by an allegorical prologue and, during the lifetime of Louis XIV, these generally celebrated the king's noble qualities and his prowess in war. Each of the five acts usually follows a basic pattern, opening with an aria in which one of the main characters expresses their feelings, followed by dialogue in recitative interspersed with short arias (\\"petits airs\\"), in which the main business of the plot occurs. Each act traditionally ends with a \\"divertissement\\", offering great opportunities for the chorus and the ballet troupe. Composers sometimes changed the order of these features in an act for dramatic reasons.  - George Frideric (or Frederick) Handel (born , ; 23 February 1685 (O.S.) [(N.S.) 5 March]  14 April 1759) was a German, later British baroque composer who spent the bulk of his career in London, becoming well known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, and organ concertos. Handel received important training in Halle and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712; he became a naturalised British subject in 1727. He was strongly influenced both by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition.  - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music.  - Giulio Cesare in Egitto (Italian for \\"Julius Caesar in Egypt\\", HWV 17), commonly known as Giulio Cesare, is a dramma per musica (\\"opera seria\\") in three acts composed for the Royal Academy of Music by George Frideric Handel in 1724. The libretto was written by Nicola Francesco Haym who used an earlier libretto by Giacomo Francesco Bussani, which had been set to music by Antonio Sartorio (1676). The opera was a success at its first performances, was frequently revived by Handel in his subsequent opera seasons and is now one of the most often performed Baroque operas. Composition history. \\"Giulio Cesare in Egitto\\" was first performed at the King's Theatre in the Haymarket, London on 20 February 1724. The opera was an immediate success. A contemporary wrote in a letter on 10 March 1724: ...the opera is in full swing also, since Hendell's new one, called Jules César  in which Cenesino and Cozzuna shine beyond all criticism  has been put on. The house was just as full at the seventh performance as at the first.  - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores).  - Ballet is a type of performance dance that originated in the Italian Renaissance courts of the 15th century and later developed into a concert dance form in France and Russia. It has since become a widespread, highly technical form of dance with its own vocabulary based on French terminology. It has been globally influential and has defined the foundational techniques used in many other dance genres. Becoming a ballet dancer requires years of training. Ballet has been taught in various schools around the world, which have historically incorporated their own cultures to evolve the art.  - Giovanni Bononcini (or Buononcini) (18 July 1670  9 July 1747) (sometimes cited also as Giovanni Battista Bononcini) was an Italian Baroque composer, cellist, singer and teacher, one of a family of string players and composers.  - Italian opera is both the art of opera in Italy and opera in the Italian language. Opera was born in Italy around the year 1600 and Italian opera has continued to play a dominant role in the history of the form until the present day. Many famous operas in Italian were written by foreign composers, including Handel, Gluck and Mozart. Works by native Italian composers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti, Verdi and Puccini, are amongst the most famous operas ever written and today are performed in opera houses across the world.  - Jean-Baptiste Lully (born Giovanni Battista Lulli ; 28 November 1632  22 March 1687) was an Italian-born French composer, instrumentalist, and dancer who spent most of his life working in the court of Louis XIV of France. He is considered a master of the French baroque style. Lully disavowed any Italian influence in French music of the period. He became a French subject in 1661.  - A myth is any traditional story consisting of events that are ostensibly historical, though often supernatural, explaining the origins of a cultural practice or natural phenomenon. The word \\"myth\\" is derived from the Greek word mythos, which simply means \\"story\\". Mythology can refer either to the study of myths, or to a body or collection of myths. Myth can mean 'sacred story', 'traditional narrative' or 'tale of the gods'. A myth also can be a story to explain why something exists.  - Opera buffa (plural: \\"opere buffe\\"; Italian for \\"comic opera\\") is a genre of opera. It was first used as an informal description of Italian comic operas variously classified by their authors as \\"commedia in musica\\", \\"commedia per musica\\", \\"dramma bernesco\\", \\"dramma comico\\", \\"divertimento giocoso\\".   - An oratorio is a large musical composition for orchestra, choir, and soloists. Like an opera, an oratorio includes the use of a choir, soloists, an ensemble, various distinguishable characters, and arias. However, opera is musical theatre, while oratorio is strictly a concert piecethough oratorios are sometimes staged as operas, and operas are sometimes presented in concert form. In an oratorio there is generally little or no interaction between the characters, and no props or elaborate costumes. A particularly important difference is in the typical subject matter of the text. Opera tends to deal with history and mythology, including age-old devices of romance, deception, and murder, whereas the plot of an oratorio often deals with sacred topics, making it appropriate for performance in the church. Protestant composers took their stories from the Bible, while Catholic composers looked to the lives of saints, as well as to Biblical topics. Oratorios became extremely popular in early 17th-century Italy partly because of the success of opera and the Catholic Church's prohibition of spectacles during Lent. Oratorios became the main choice of music during that period for opera audiences.  - The characters of the \\"\\" usually represent fixed social types, stock characters, such as foolish old men, devious servants, or military officers full of false bravado. The main categories of these characters include servants, old men, lovers, and captains. The characters are exaggerated \\"real characters\\", such as a know it all doctor called Il Dottore, a greedy old man called Pantalone, or a perfect relationship like the Innamorati.   - In Greek mythology, Aegeus or Aegeas, was an archaic figure in the founding myth of Athens. The \\"goat-man\\" who gave his name to the Aegean Sea was, next to Poseidon, the father of Theseus, the founder of Athenian institutions and one of the kings of Athens.  - Operetta is a genre of light opera, \\"light\\" in terms both of music and subject matter.    What object entity has the relation of 'genre' with the subject 'teseo'?   Choices: - action  - allegory  - archaeology  - art  - ballet  - baroque  - cantata  - church music  - comic  - commedia per musica  - concert  - concerto  - dance  - democracy  - design  - drama  - entertainment  - family  - genre  - greek mythology  - history  - instrumental  - libretto  - love  - march  - mass  - melodramma  - military  - music  - musical  - mythology  - narrative  - opera  - opera buffa  - opera seria  - operetta  - oratorio  - philosophy  - play  - study  - supernatural  - tale  - tragédie en musique  - vocal music The answer is:","output":"opera seria"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Previously vice-president, she ousted Malia Bouattia who was elected in 2016. Ms Bouattia ran into controversy when an article she co-wrote in 2011, describing Birmingham university as a \\"Zionist outpost\\", came to light. Ms Martin, a former student at Lewisham and Southwark College, highlighted the fact that she is \\"black single mother from a working-class family\\" during her campaign. Ms Martin told the BBC News website: \\"This is where I am coming from. It's the only thing I know. \\"I came into this campaign with nothing but overcoming adversity and challenges and barriers. \\"I was born into barriers and the struggle is real.\\" She said things began to change for her when she returned to college after the birth of her first daughter six years ago. Ms Martin saw an advert for the role of women's officer at her college student union and went for it. \\"Here the people didn't look like me or talk like me, but they had a heart like me. \\"The rest is history,\\" she added. The former student has promised a union which is \\"united and fighting for free education for everyone\\". She said: \\"I am honoured and humbled to have been elected as NUS national president. \\"I take this as a vote of trust that our members believe I can lead our national movement to be the fighting and campaigning organisation we need it to be, representing the breadth of our diverse membership. \\"Further education made me who I am today and I look forward to sharing stories of just how powerful all forms of education can be when we're all given access to it. \\"During my term in office I want to spend my time listening, learning and leading.\\" The post of NUS president has long been a coveted position for those seeking political office. Former NUS presidents include Jack Straw, Charles Clarke, Liam Burns and Trevor Phillips. The new president pushed the standing president into second place winning by 402 votes to 272. The NUS paid tribute to Ms Bouattia's efforts to make the student movement \\"more diverse\\" and representative. In her speech seeking re-election, she spoke of the death threats and harassment she had faced during her presidency. She was the first black Muslim to hold the post of NUS president, repeatedly denied accusations of anti-Semitism and also apologised for her past comments about Birmingham University. A string of disaffiliation votes by student unions around the country during the summer followed the controversy. However, most of these had actually been set in train before the issue flared up. Three of the 26 who held referendums, Loughborough, Hull, and Newcastle universities, disaffiliated. Then a group of student leaders wrote an open letter saying Jewish students had not felt safe \\"participating in our national movement\\". The third candidate, Tom Harwood, who won just 35 votes, stood on a platform of \\"re-legitimising\\" the student movement and speaking \\"for all students\\". \\"We should be fighting credible battles, and offering constructive solutions. Only then can we deliver. \\"We must shout louder about living costs, fight for realistic improvements to tuition fees, and be flexible and innovative in our response to government policy.\\" This article was about:","output":"The article discusses the election of Shakira Martin as the new president of the National Union of Students (NUS) in the UK.

If \\"A boy is climbing on top of a tree.\\", can we conclude \\"A child is running away from his brother.\\"?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"A child is running away from his brother\\" based on the information provided in the statement, \\"A boy is climbing on top of a tree.\\" The two statements describe different actions and situations. The initial statement only provides information about a boy engaged in the activity of climbing a tree. It does not provide any information about the boy's motivation, intentions, or relationship with other individuals. It is important not to infer or draw unsupported conclusions based on a single statement without further context. In contrast, the second statement involves two individuals, specifically siblings, and describes a different action - one child running away from their brother. This statement suggests a different context or scenario altogether, potentially involving a game or disagreement between siblings. To establish a logical connection between the two statements, there has to be additional information that ties the actions or situations together. For example, if we were told that \\"A boy is climbing on top of a tree to hide from his brother during a game of hide-and-seek,\\" then a connection could be established, as it would provide a shared context for both statements.

The school is owned, though, by Delassalle's teacher wife, the frail Christina (Clouzot). Delassalle also has a relationship with Nicole Horner (Signoret), another teacher at the school. Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both, as well as unkind to the children. Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan to get rid of Michel forever. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him. The two women then drown him in a bathtub and dump his body in the school's neglected swimming pool. When his corpse floats to the surface, they think it will appear to have been an accident. Almost everything goes according to their plans until the body fails to surface. Michel's corpse is nowhere to be found when the pool is drained. Nicole sees in the paper that the police have found the corpse. However, when Christina goes to the morgue, she learns it is not actually Michel's body. There she meets Alfred Fichet (Vanel), a retired private detective. He becomes involved in the case, much to Nicole's chagrin. When Christina and Alfred come back, a boy is punished for breaking a window; the boy says it was Michel who punished him. After hearing this, Christina becomes very sick and is unable to be photographed for the school photo. However, it appears that Michel appears in the photo standing in the back next to a window. Nicole becomes worried and leaves the school. Christina, overcome by fear, tells Alfred everything. He does not believe her, but he investigates the pool. That night, Christina hears noises and wanders the school. When she realizes that someone is in the school, she runs back...

Sentence: \\"Fred must have both been singing songs and been drinking beer.\\" Pick from options: would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically? Possible answers: [+] unacceptable [+] acceptable...I think the answer is","output":"To determine whether a linguist would rate this sentence as linguistically acceptable or not, let's examine the sentence structure and grammar. Sentence: \\"Fred must have both been singing songs and been drinking beer.\\" Step 1: Analyze the sentence structure and identify the main components. The subject is 'Fred,' the modal verb is 'must,' and the verbs are 'be singing songs' and 'be drinking beer.' Step 2: Check for appropriate usage of the conjunction 'both.' 'Both' is used to connect two or more elements that are equally applicable to the subject. In this case, 'singing songs' and 'drinking beer' seem to be the two actions that 'Fred' is performing. Step 3: Examine the verb structure. 'Must have been' is used here as a modal verb to indicate past possibility. It is correctly followed by the past participle form of the verb 'to be,' which is 'been.' Step 4: Analyze the consistency in verb structure. In this case, the verb structure is consistent: 'been singing songs' and 'been drinking beer' both use 'been' and the present participle form of their respective verbs. After analyzing the sentence, it appears to be grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. Therefore, a linguist would likely rate this sentence as [+] [+] acceptable."},{"instruction":"Process: - Coal is mined out of the ground - Coal is pulverized into fine powder - The coal is mixed with hot air - The coal and hot air are blown into a boiler - The coal and hot air burn over a fire - Highly purified water is pumped through pipes in the boiler - The water turns into steam - The steam presses against turbines - The turbines spin - Electricity is produced.
