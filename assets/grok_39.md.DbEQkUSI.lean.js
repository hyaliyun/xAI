Review title: wishful thinking and misinformed Product review: Murray, like Gardner and Crowley, was one of those early eclectics about her study of the Old Religion. There is too much supposition and not enough factual basis for her conclusions on the development of the \\"Witch God.\\" The first chapter, however, is a great read following the earliset depictions of the horned god. But the jump to stating that these depictions from all over Europe at varying times are linked to a single cohesive religion is tenuous. This is yet another case in which the author has made the facts fit her conception rather than objectively trying to make connections between the facts. This is the case, unfortunately, for almost all early expositors of witchcraft and the Old Religion. Read the more scholarly \\"Triumph of the Moon\\" by Ronald Hutton if you're looking for objectivity rather than charlatanism. The answer to this question is:","output":"The following review would likely decrease the chances of you buying the product.  Reasoning step-by-step: 1. The reviewer mentions that there is too much supposition and not enough factual basis for the author's conclusions. This lowers the credibility of the author's arguments and might make you question the value of the information presented. 2. The reviewer states that the author has made facts fit her conception rather than objectively connecting them. This points to potential bias in the author's viewpoint, which could lead to misinformation or partial understanding. 3. While the reviewer acknowledges the first chapter as a great read, it may not be enough to consider buying the entire product, especially if the rest of the content is called into question. 4. The reviewer suggests an alternative and more scholarly book that provides objectivity on the same subject matter.

He wakes most mornings before six, makes breakfast, exercises, and retrieves his mail. Christmas is approaching and he decides to follow his neighbors' example of decorating his lawn with a few holiday items. Upon receiving a social security check in the mail, he promptly tears it in half and calls the pension office to speak to his case worker, Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker). She tells him that he will be sent another check but it's clearly evident that Frank simply calls in to be able to speak with her. They get along and chat about mundane things including which books she's reading and how many leaves are growing on Frank's avocado seed. One day, Frank plucks up the courage to say that he'll be in Kansas City the following week, where she lives, and would like to meet her and take her out to dinner. Though nervous about meeting him face to face, Sarah agrees, becoming excited.In the middle of the night, Frank wakes up, dons his robe, and wanders sleepily downstairs. As he turns a corner towards the kitchen, three men wearing SWAT gear follow silently behind him. They watch as he enters the kitchen and closes the door. With the go-ahead, one man kicks the door in but finds the kitchen empty. As they look for him, Frank suddenly appears and takes them all out one by one with silent precision. Noticing more men waiting outside, Frank takes a handful of bullets and puts them in a frying pan with oil and turns on the stove. He goes into the basement and sledgehammers through the floor to a hidden depository where a packed bag, money, weapons and ammunition, and passports are stored. Upstairs, the bullets cook off, giving the impression of a gunfight, and the operatives waiting outside open fire on Frank's house with automatic rifles. They enter the house but Frank's skills enables him to quickly subdue the assassins. He walks away from his home unscathed as his front porch collapses.Sarah returns home from a bad...

Answer:","output":"The events in question: Lviv and Kiev celebrating Ukrainian Independence Day and the Ukrainian Language Society's founding congress both occurred in 1989. Based on the provided text, Lviv and Kiev celebrated Ukrainian Independence Day earlier in the year, on January 22, 1989. On this day, in Lviv, thousands gathered for an unauthorized moleben, a type of religious service, in front of St. George's Cathedral. In the capital city, Kiev, 60 activists gathered in an apartment to commemorate the proclamation of the Ukrainian People's Republic back in 1918. These gatherings were a clear sign of the growing sentiment for independence in the country. Meanwhile, the Ukrainian Language Society held its founding congress a few weeks later, on February 11–12, 1989. This society played a crucial role in promoting and preserving the Ukrainian language. The establishment of such a society was incredibly significant, especially considering the historical repression of the Ukrainian language during Soviet times. Shortly after, on February 15, the formation of the Initiative Committee for the Renewal of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church was announced. Similarly to the Ukrainian Language Society, this religious organization's formation also represented a significant stride towards Ukrainian independence and cultural self-awareness. The program and statutes of the church renewal movement were proposed by the Writers Association of Ukraine and published in the literary journal Literaturna Ukraina on February 16, 1989. This organization heralded Ukrainian dissidents such as Vyacheslav Chornovil, marking another crucial step in the resurgence of Ukrainian national consciousness and identity.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

Cohen, having a private conversation about issuing payments regarding his alleged affair with Playmate Karen McDougal. The (very serious) conversation should have been all the President could think about. But instead, a Coke is all that could cool Trump down in this moment.      We reached out to Coca-Cola for comment about Trump's love affair, but did not hear back in time for publication. However, it doesn't look like the warm feelings are mutual, because on Wednesday, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey told CNBC Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum are hurting the company.      Your move, Donny. ||||| Bad news for Coca-Cola fans: The company said Wednesday that it is raising soda prices in part due to President Trump's recent tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.      Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey announced the price hike in a call with investors and later in media interviews, citing rising transportation and metal costs after Trump slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods and numerous other countries earlier this year.            \\"We had to take with our bottling partners an increase [in prices] in our sparkling beverage industry in the middle of the year, which is relatively uncommon,\\" Quincey said on CNBC's Squawk on the Street after the earnings report. \\"That's the metal steel and aluminum going up. The labor going up.\\"            How the higher charges to the company’s bottlers and retailers will trickle down to consumers remains to be seen. That's because retailers \\"have discretion in what consumers are charged on the shelf,\\" Scott Leith, a Coca-Cola spokesperson, told BuzzFeed News.      Coca-Cola is the first major US-based player in the global beverage industry to announce price hikes that are tied to Trump's tariffs. But there have been warnings that others may follow, particularly beer companies, which are also heavily reliant on the prices of aluminum.      None of the major brewers have announced hikes, but smaller craft brewers have felt the impact quicker and some have already had to make adjustments. Octopi Brewing in Waunakee, Wisconsin, told the CBC that after its US supplier of aluminum cans, citing the tariffs, hiked prices by 15%, it opted to pass the extra costs on to customers.      \\"It's terrible,\\" CEO Isaac Showaki said. \\"It's hitting our bottom line … we probably could have hired almost two people full-time.\\"      In retaliation, China, a major aluminum exporter, has levied higher fees on a slew of US products, including soybeans and cars. But being that Diet Coke is known to be one of Trump's go-to beverages, it's the Coca-Cola increase that might hit closest to home. The nation was reminded of the president's affinity for the dark soda in a secret recording obtained by CNN in which Trump could be heard telling someone to get him a Coke. |||||","output":"Donald Trump's love for Diet Coke is well-documented, with the US President reportedly consuming up to 12 cans per day.

Although Coca-Cola is the first major US-based beverage company to announce price hikes in direct correlation to Trump’s tariffs, other companies, especially beer producers reliant on aluminum, could potentially do the same."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

More children suffer from OCD than most people realize. According to the director of the Children's Center for OCD and Anxiety in Philadelphia, more than a million children in the US have OCD. That means, 1 in 100 children in America have OCD.  Unlike adults who can recognize they have OCD, children do not understand that they have OCD. Instead, children may view their repetitive thoughts or actions as shameful and feel like they are going crazy. This makes many children too embarrassed to tell an adult of their problems. The average age that OCD manifests is 10.2  OCD seems to appear equally in boys and girls. One part of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is a tendency to obsess. Obsessions are persistent or repetitive thoughts, images, ideas, or impulses that rise repeatedly into a person’s consciousness. The child cannot shake the thoughts, which become increasingly realistic to him. The unwanted thoughts can be frightening and if unresolved, they can leave your child anxious and distracted, making them appear mentally unbalanced.  These thoughts can cause a lot of doubt. These thoughts can tell the child something bad is going to happen to someone they care about. The second part of OCD is a tendency toward compulsive behavior. Compulsions are excessively repetitive and rigid behaviors or actions that are performed to reduce anxiety, ward off bad thoughts, or banish something dreaded. The child can do these actions mentally or physically. The actions are often in response to obsessions to help lessen the fear and can seem like strong habits.  In general, compulsions are easier to spot – you don’t necessarily know what your child is thinking, but if you pay attention, you’ll be able to observe compulsive behavior. Some parents believe the symptoms of OCD are just a phase. They also believe their children are acting out to get attention. If your child has OCD, this is not the case. OCD is a neurological disorder. It is not your fault that the child has OCD, so do not blame yourself. Children with OCD may have one or more co-occurring conditions. These include anxiety disorders, depression, bipolar disorder, ADHD, eating disorders, autism, or Tourette Syndrome.  Other disorders share similarities with OCD and can be confused with it. These include body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, hair-pulling and skin-picking disorder. Summary:","output":"OCD is a condition where kids have unwanted thoughts that make them feel scared and worried. These thoughts can make them do certain actions over and over again, like washing their hands or checking if the door is locked. Sometimes, kids with OCD feel too embarrassed to tell grown-ups about their thoughts and actions. It's important to remember that OCD is not the child's or the parent's fault. Some kids with OCD might also have other challenges like feeling extra worried, feeling very sad, or having trouble paying attention."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ironically at the start of the contest, Jeff is ready to die, but suicide is against the rules, so he wants Dawn to be the one to bump him off. However, as the game progresses, Jeff's motives change, and this confuses Dawn's situation.The movie builds towards a showdown between the two high-school sweethearts.

Back at Lecter Castle, six Lithuanian militiamen (Grutas, Dortlich, Grentz, Kolnas, Milko, and Pot Watcher) request to join the Waffen-SS. The SS commander orders them to kill the Lecters' Jewish cook who was left behind, to which they gleefully comply.A Soviet tank stops at the Lecters' lodge looking for water, and forces everyone out of the house. However, the tank is then spotted by a German Stuka bomber, which sparks a firefight. The bomber is shot down by the tank, but subsequently crashes into it and the ensuing explosion kills everyone, except Hannibal and Mischa. The SS militiamen then loot Lecter Castle.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question:  in a 2016 comic book film Cara Jocelyn Delevingne played a fictional character created by who? A:","output":"In the 2016 comic book film \\"Suicide Squad,\\" Cara Jocelyn Delevingne portrayed the fictional character named Dr. June Moone, also known as Enchantress. The Enchantress is a powerful sorceress who is the alter-ego of Dr. June Moone, a gifted archaeologist. Created by DC Comics, the character first appeared in Strange Adventures #187 in April 1966.  Enchantress was co-created by writer Bob Haney and artist Howard Purcell. Bob Haney is a significant comic book writer best known for his contributions to DC Comics, particularly during the Silver Age of Comic Books. Haney co-created various memorable characters, such as Metamorpho and the Teen Titans, while establishing unique comic book series like \\"The Brave and the Bold\\" and many more. In contrast, Howard Purcell was a notable comic book artist who started his career with Quality Comics before joining DC Comics, where he also worked on characters like Spectre and Phantom Stranger. In \\"Suicide Squad,\\" directed by David Ayer, the film's story revolves around a group of supervillains assembled by the United States government to perform high-risk, black-op missions. The government agency involved, A.R.G.U.S., is led by Amanda Waller, played by Viola Davis. Waller convinces the government to assemble Task Force X, a team of dangerous inmates from the Belle Reve penitentiary, as a last-ditch effort to counter potential threats. Cara Delevingne's Enchantress quickly becomes the primary antagonist of the story. The character's dual nature, as both a skilled archaeologist (Dr. June Moone) and a supernatural entity, adds complexity to her portrayal. Delevingne plays both roles, with Dr. Moone struggling to contain the destructive tendencies of her Enchantress alter-ego. The film sees Enchantress attempting to take over the world while the members of Task Force X, including popular characters like Harley Quinn, Deadshot, and Captain Boomerang, work together to stop her. In summary, Cara Jocelyn Delevingne played the fictional character Enchantress, created by writer Bob Haney and artist Howard Purcell for DC Comics, in the 2016 comic book film \\"Suicide Squad.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There is no reference to someone named Hank or any interaction between Maurice Foley and a person by that name.

The research, which followed 200 students for four years, found that women consistently outperformed men in their studies even though they had started their courses with almost identical A-level grades. An analysis of the results showed that while 65 percent of female graduates were awarded, only 35 percent of male graduates did as well. Girls are known to outperform boys at school, but this research showed that trend continued at university. Fiona Smith, who led the research, said, \\"The research shows that the difference has something to do with schools in general.\\" \\"It also shows something about the inequality for working women in terms of pay and promotion. Women work harder at school, harder at university, and do better at both, but they still receive less pay.\\" The research found that female students were more faithful, less likely to miss lectures, and more likely to believe that their marks reflected their abilities than male students. Female students were also more likely to ask for and receive support from their professors. Women were also more likely to choose their universities because they liked the courses offered. In contrast, men were more likely than women to miss lectures due to \\"other affairs\\" and \\"laziness\\", and to believe that playing sports was an important part of university life. Generally, people think that women's success comes from more emphasis on coursework, but the research showed that female geographers at Brunel did better in their exams than in their coursework. Dr Smith said, \\"Most women feel that getting good grades is the most important part of university life. They believe that they need to work harder in order to compete in the male-dominated   environment they will encounter at work. Good grades are viewed as an 'insurance policy' for success.

Among 15 patients with uptake including a lymph node and ablation-Tg levels less than 10 ng/mL, 14 patients (93.3%) showed ablation success, whereas successful ablation was achieved in only 2 (18.2%) of the 11 patients with uptake including a lymph node and ablation-Tg levels equal to or greater than 10 ng/mL (P < 0.001). Answer: These data indicate that the combined use of serum Tg levels measured just before ablation and the 131I WBS patterns after ablation may be an early predictor of ablation success in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma who received total thyroidectomy and high-dose 131I ablation therapy. A:","output":"Question: Based on the passage, how effective is the combined use of serum thyroglobulin levels measured just before ablation and the 131I whole body scintigraphy patterns in predicting ablation success in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma who underwent total thyroidectomy and high-dose 131I ablation therapy?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as ISO/IEC 646 that are identical or nearly identical to ASCII, with extensions for characters outside the English alphabet and symbols used outside the United States, such as the symbol for the United Kingdom's pound sterling (£). Almost every country needed an adapted version of ASCII, since ASCII suited the needs of only the USA and a few other countries. For example, Canada had its own version that supported French characters. Other adapted encodings include ISCII (India), VISCII (Vietnam), and YUSCII (Yugoslavia). Although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ASCII, true ASCII is defined strictly only by the ANSI standard. Why did Brasil need an adapted version of ASCII? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"Brazil needed an adapted version of ASCII to accommodate the unique characters and symbols used in the Portuguese language, which is the official language spoken in Brazil. While ASCII was originally designed to cater to English and some other languages, it lacked support for certain characters and diacritics commonly used in Portuguese, such as the ç (c-cedilla), ã (a-tilde), õ (o-tilde), and accented vowels like á, é, í, ó, and ú. As a result, Brazil created its own character-encoding standard called ABNT NBR 9611, which was based on the ISO/IEC 646 international standard. This encoding was specifically tailored to meet the needs of the Brazilian market by including the necessary characters and symbols that were missing from the original ASCII standard. Subsequently, other international standards were developed to meet the character-encoding requirements of various languages and regions around the world. One such example is ISO-8859-1 (also known as Latin-1), which covers several Western European languages, including Portuguese, and contains the necessary characters and symbols for the Brazilian Portuguese language as well. However, in the age of digital globalization, character encoding standards have transitioned to a more universal approach to accommodate a wide range of languages and scripts. The Unicode Standard, for example, provides a unique code point for every character across different languages and ensures compatibility and consistency across multiple platforms, applications, and devices. UTF-8, a widely used Unicode encoding, has gradually become the default encoding for the global exchange of information, including Brazilian Portuguese."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Brian Williams’s and Jon Stewart’s Common Ground Other than timing, Jon Stewart’s triumphant retirement and Brian Williams’s public and humbling disenfranchisement would seem to have little in common. But begin with the fact that both men went to high school in New Jersey and both began their adult lives without much going for them, other than a sense that the island with all of the tall buildings in the distance suggested there was more to life than volunteering as a firefighter (Mr. Williams) or tending bar (Mr. Stewart). Both men made up for lost time once they got into their careers. Mr. Williams churned through assignments and assumed an anchor chair on MSNBC and at NBC on the weekends while he was in his 30s, and slid into the big chair in 2004 by the time he was 45. Mr. Stewart ground it out in stand-up, working almost nightly at the Comedy Cellar, then landed some TV gigs here and there. After blowing up large on the “Late Night With David Letterman” in 1993, he was thought to be a favorite to replace him, but that job went to Conan O’Brien. It was only when he got his hands on the wheel of “The Daily Show” that he found his sweet spot and opened up a singular vein in American comedy. Both men spent more than a decade on top of their businesses for good reasons. Mr. Stewart had a remarkable eye for hypocrisy, found amazing writers and executed their work and his own with savage grace, no small feat. Mr. Williams managed to convey gravitas and self-awareness at the same time while sitting atop one of the best television news operations in the business. They were kings of their respective crafts. But now they are both done, at least for the time being. Mr. Stewart, who said Tuesday he would leave “The Daily Show’’ sometime this year, leaves on top, on his own terms. For all the cynicism assigned to his approach, Mr. Stewart is at heart a patriot and an idealist. Again and again, his indictment of politicians and media figures was less about what they were and more about what they failed to be. It is telling that when he did take time off from hosting his show, he did so to make a feature film called “Rosewater,” about Maziar Bahari, an Iranian journalist who was imprisoned shortly after appearing on “The Daily Show.” His subject was, in essence, being punished for an act of speech and Mr. Stewart, in spite of his nightly beatdowns of the press, admires the profession. You got the feeling after a while that he had grown tired of pointing out the foibles of the press and the politicians he covered. His version of the news may have started as fake, but it was seeming more and more real all the time. Oddly, Mr. Stewart will leave his desk as arguably the most trusted man in news. And Mr. Williams will find his way back to his desk only if he figures out a way to regain the trust he has squandered. Mr. Williams is now all but locked in his own home — he might as well have an ankle monitor on. There is no playbook on how to come back from such a fall. Stephen B. Burke, the chief executive of NBCUniversal, said everyone deserved a second chance. I very much agree. I just can’t figure out how that second chance comes at NBC. What is the path to that? At what point will the tabloids and blogs take their boot off his neck and allow him to go to the gym, take a walk, have dinner with friends, let alone begin to resume a kind of active rehabilitation — whatever that looks like — in the public eye? When news of his untruths first broke, I think it was commonly believed that Mr. Williams was too big to fail. He seemed to think he would find a way to thread the needle and keep his job. But after a week of management miscues, aided by Mr. Williams’s ham-handed apology and misguided self-exile, NBC executives took firm control of what they came to see as an existential threat to the credibility of their news operation and suspended him. It is difficult to surmise what Mr. Stewart will do next — he has been plain about the fact that he isn’t sure himself — in part because his next step is not a natural one. His talents do not fit easily into that of a generic talk show host. His interview skills are intermittent and his interest in that kind of thing would seem to be low. While Mr. Stewart is adept at live television, you get the feeling that his need for its blandishments have diminished over time. He may be that odd celebrity who says he is taking time off to spend with his family and actually means it. “I’m going to have dinner on a school night with my family, who I have heard from multiple sources are lovely people,” he said in his announcement, which was a surprise in terms of timing, but not in terms of intention. We all knew he was getting close to done. Mr. Williams is another matter. I visited him at his apartment in 2011 when he was doing promotion for “Rock Center,” a newsmagazine that did not pan out. He made the source of his happiness plain. “When you see me on television, I am there,″ he said. “That is where I am.” Gesturing toward the big flat panel on the wall of his apartment, he added, “I am a creature of live television.” Still, it was not enough for him to be the No. 1 anchor of the No. 1 news program in America. Perhaps he sensed that he was king of an entropic kingdom imprisoned by incontinence and cholesterol ads. As the ever more manic news cycle whirred around his evening newscast, it would be hard not to feel a little beside the point. And so came the serial talk show appearances on “Late Night With Jimmy Fallon” and “Late Show With David Letterman.” He appeared several times on “30 Rock,” often as a version of himself, and hosted “Saturday Night Live.” He was good at all these things, good enough so that when NBC was thinking about a successor for Jay Leno, Mr. Williams raised his hands, a gesture that went over like a box of rocks with his overseers. And, of course, there were appearances on “The Daily Show,” including a very funny few minutes in August 2012. Mr. Stewart was mocking something that had been on the NBC newscast, and Mr. Williams mentioned that sometimes when he is writing the show, he actually thinks of what Mr. Stewart will do with the same material. “You don’t write any of that stuff,” Mr. Stewart said, laughing as he said it. “They take you out of the vegetable crisper five minutes before the show and they put you in front of something that is spelled out phonetically. I know how this goes.” So, everyone is in on the joke. It’s all knowing winks and fake attacks on confected news read by people who are somewhat bored by what they do. It just seems less funny now.

Upon his arrival, he meets his teammates Rip Van Kelt (Randall Batinkoff), Charlie Dillon (Matt Damon), Jack Connors (Cole Hauser), and his roommate Chris Reece (Chris O'Donnell) and learns of the school's cherished honor code system. Soon learning that his new friends are prejudiced against Jews, he suppresses his background. David becomes the team hero and wins the attentions of beautiful dÃ©butante Sally Wheeler (Amy Locane), whom Dillon claims is his girlfriend. In the afterglow of a victory over the school's chief rival St. Luke's, Dillon inadvertently discovers that David is Jewish and, out of jealousy, makes this widely known, causing Sally and his teammates to turn against Davidâsoon after, he finds a sign above his bed bearing a swastika and the words \\"Go home Jew\\". David is constantly harassed by his classmates, led by Richard \\"McGoo\\" Collins (Anthony Rapp) and his body guard-like roommate Chesty Smith (Ben Affleck); only Reece and another unnamed student remain loyal to Greene. Overwhelmed by pressure from his prestigious family, Dillon uses a crib sheet to cheat in an important history exam. David and Van Kelt each spot him doing so, but remain silent. Dillon gets pushed while leaving class and drops the sheet on the floor after the test; when the teacher, Mr. Geirasch (Michael Higgins), discovers it, he informs the class that he will fail all of them if the cheater does not confess. He leaves the task of finding the cheater up to the students, led by Van Kelt, the head prefect.

Translate to English","output":"The sentence \\"Deshalb zünden sie Autos an.\\" translates to English as \\"That's why they set cars on fire.\\" In recent years, the act of setting cars on fire has been observed in various parts of the world and is often associated with different motives such as vandalism, protest, insurance fraud, and gang-related activities. Vandalism is the most common reason behind setting cars on fire. It usually involves individuals or groups who engage in destructive acts to cause damage to property and provoke fear in the community. Various factors can contribute to this behavior, including boredom, a feeling of anonymity, a desire for attention, or a wish to express anger or frustration over personal or social injustice. Protests and political unrest also account for several cases of cars set ablaze. Protesters who want to convey their dissatisfaction with authorities or showcase their opposition to certain policies and political figures can resort to such extreme actions. However, it is important to mention that not all protesters subscribe to these violent methods, and it is only a small group who commit such acts. Another possible motivation is insurance fraud. People can set their cars on fire in an attempt to fake an accident or theft and collect a payout from their insurance company. This crime is often well-planned and carried out in a way that leaves minimal clues leading back to the person responsible. Lastly, setting cars on fire can be a sign of gang-related activities. When rival gangs try to assert dominance and control over a certain territory, they may resort to setting cars on fire to send a strong message or intimidate the opposing gang. In some cases, the act is done as a form of retaliation or to inflict harm on a specific individual related to the rival gang. In summary, there are various possible reasons behind people setting cars on fire. The context of each incident and the motives behind them can vary widely, but all these situations have severe consequences for society, as they impact public safety and contribute to a sense of fear and insecurity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Margaret is a sophomore in high school who just started her Spring break. With a week off from school, her family is spending some time driving out of state to visit her grandma, Kathy, who has a cabin up in the snowy mountains. Margaret always enjoys spending time with her grandma because she has interesting stories and makes some of the best pie around. Also, they always go skiing when visiting the cabin so Margaret is excited for that.  Whose joints will be more sore after skiing?  Hint: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided and the hint given, Kathy's joints will likely be more sore after skiing. This is because she is in late adulthood, which is associated with a decline in strength and stamina, as well as an increased risk of developing diseases like arthritis. These factors can contribute to increased joint pain and soreness when engaging in physical activities like skiing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Just one week after suffering an on-field cardiac arrest, soccer player Fabrice Muamba was able to watch most of his team Bolton's emotional victory over English Premier League relegation rivals Blackburn Rovers on Saturday. \\"The fact he was able to watch a large part of the game, given where we were a week ago, is great news,\\" Bolton manager Owen Coyle told the club's website on Monday. \\"He was pleased that his teammates won the match, although he fell back asleep when the score was 2-0.\\" The 23-year-old midfielder's heart stopped for 78 minutes following his collapse during the previous weekend's FA Cup quarterfinal against Tottenham, which will be replayed on Tuesday following its initial abandonment at halftime.

This victory is essential for Bolton's hopes of remaining in the English Premier League. The other options are incorrect because they do not involve the team Bolton and are unrelated to the context of the story.

She was the youngest of eight children (one died at birth). Her mother Lilly Mae Young was a single mother (her partner left to find work and never returned) living during the Great Depression. Young's oldest sister Inie was severely disabled by whooping cough at a very young age. Context: While still in high school, Young went to a professional wrestling show and challenged then-champion Mildred Burke when she visited Tulsa to wrestle Gladys Gillem. Because the promoters told her she could not wrestle the champion, she wrestled Gillem in a shoot fight, beating her within seconds. After the fight, promoter Billy Wolfe wanted Young to become a professional wrestler. She left home two years later to wrestle professionally. Young later travelled to Charlotte, North Carolina where she met and trained with The Fabulous Moolah and also met Ed \\"Strangler\\" Lewis whom told her \\"I don't like girl wrestlers, women should be in the kitchen, but after seeing you, you was born to be a wrestler.\\"  There have been conflicting reports as to the year in which Young began her career. Young claimed her first match was August 20, 1939, while WWE said she \\"started her professional career\\" this year. However, Young also once said her first match was March 22, 1940. According to Dave Meltzer of The Wrestling Observer, historians have been unable to find any records that she began in 1939 and that her first match was most likely in 1941. Meltzer wrote, \\"In reality, Young is believed to have competed in seven decades, matching the record held by Lou Thesz. [...] You really couldn't call [her] 2010 match anything resembling a pro wrestling match, even giving as much leeway as possible. While she always claimed to have started in 1939, at 16, historians researching have been unable to find any records of her wrestling prior to 1941, when she turned 18 and went on tour with Billy Wolfe's troupe.\\"  In 1941, Young, along with Mildred Burke, opened up Canada for female wrestling. In Canada, they worked for Stu Hart. She was wrestling in Memphis, Tennessee on December 7, 1941, the day that Pearl Harbor was bombed by the Japanese, which led to the United States entering World War II. During the war, Young helped women take advantage of the fact that the men were fighting overseas by expanding their role in the sport. Question: Was her family supportive of this? Answer:","output":"It is difficult to definitively determine the extent of support from Johnnie Mae Young's family for her wrestling career, as there are limited sources available discussing this aspect of her life. However, given the circumstances of her childhood and upbringing during the Great Depression, it can be reasonably assumed that her decision to pursue professional wrestling was shaped by both personal passion and the potential for financial gains. As the youngest of eight children in a single-parent household, it is likely that Young and her siblings faced various challenges while growing up. Her mother, Lilly Mae Young, needed to provide for the large family, and as a result, Johnnie Mae's choice to pursue professional wrestling as a career might have been partly motivated by the promise of financial stability. Furthermore, her experience of witnessing her oldest sister Inie's disability due to whooping cough might have contributed to her resilience and determination to make the most of her opportunities. It is possible that her family recognized the potential for success in such an unconventional career for a woman at the time, and they might have been supportive of her decision in that regard. Considering the era in which Johnnie Mae Young began her wrestling career, women in professional wrestling were not as widely accepted as they are today. For her to break barriers and achieve success in a male-dominated sport speaks to her courage, dedication, and determination. While it cannot be said for certain how supportive her family was at the beginning of her wrestling career, Johnnie Mae Young's ambitions, skills, and talent likely earned their respect and admiration over the years. The fact that she went on to have a trailblazing career in professional wrestling that spanned over seven decades speaks volumes about her determination and perseverance, traits that her family may have come to support and admire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

At the beginning of the period, Australia and Antarctica remained connected, and warm equatorial currents mixed with colder Antarctic waters, distributing the heat around the world and keeping global temperatures high. But when Australia split from the southern continent around 45 Ma, the warm equatorial currents were deflected away from Antarctica, and an isolated cold water channel developed between the two continents. The Antarctic region cooled down, and the ocean surrounding Antarctica began to freeze, sending cold water and ice floes north, reinforcing the cooling.

I found the following answer on Google: While talk radio has historically been associated with AM/FM, starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of podcasts . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"The answer provided partially talks about the development of internet-based talk-radio shows such as podcasts, but it skips over the inception of regular talk radio shows in the U.S.. Talk radio in the U.S. began much earlier than 2005. Though the precise origin can be a bit murky, the venture of regularly scheduled talk radio shows can be traced back to the early 20th century. The first radio news program was broadcast August 31, 1920 by station 8MK in Detroit, Michigan, which was owned by The Detroit News, a newspaper. The KDKA radio station in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, also started broadcasting in 1920, and is often considered the pioneer in commercial radio broadcasting. These developments eventually led to the variety of talk radio shows we know today. However, as a genre, talk-format radio began to truly surge in popularity in the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s, with influential radio personalities using the medium to comment on a variety of topics and interact with listeners via phone calls. So, to sum up, talk radio itself has its roots in the early 20th century with a surge in its format in the mid 20th century, while the transition to a cost-effective internet platform through podcasts began around 2005."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: The Last Legion Movie plot: The film is narrated by Ambrosinus, native to Britain, who knows of a legend concerning the sword of Julius Caesar, which was hidden away from evil men. It begins shortly before the coronation of Romulus Augustulus as Emperor in 475. Having traveled through much of the known world in search of Caesar's sword, Ambrosinus has then become the tutor to the young Romulus. A Druid and part of a secret brotherhood protecting the sword, he at times gives the impression he is a magician, but his \\"magic\\" is usually revealed to be simple trickery. One of the running concepts of the movie surrounds the question of whether or not Ambrosinus has any actual magical abilities or simply an illusionist. Romulus's father Orestes rules Rome but is not Emperor himself. On the day before the coronation, Odoacer, commander of the barbarian Goths allied with Rome, demands a third of Italy from Orestes, but is rebuffed. The same day, Romulus meets the general of the Nova Invicta Legion, Aurelianus Caius Antonius, called \\"Aurelius\\". The night after Romulus is crowned, Rome is attacked by the Goths. Most of Aurelius's men, pledged to protect the emperor, are killed, though Aurelius is only stunned and left for dead. Orestes and his wife are killed by Odoacer's lieutenant Wulfila, who captures Romulus. The next day, Odoacer, now ruler of the Western Empire, plans to have Romulus killed. However, Ambrosinus convinces Odoacer to spare the boy. Instead, Romulus is exiled to Capri along with Ambrosinus, guarded by Wulfila and his men. His prison is a villa constructed more than four centuries earlier by the emperor Tiberius. With Ambrosinus's help, Romulus discovers a hidden chamber within the villa. He comes across a statue of Caesar holding the fabled sword, forged by a Chalybian smith after his military campaigns in Britain. Writing near the statue's feet proclaims the sword was made for \\"he who is destined to rule\\". This is interpreted as a prophecy by various characters, and Romulus keeps the weapon.

Principiul limbii materne plus două se referă la ideea că fiecare persoană ar trebui să învețe și să utilizeze limba maternă, precum și încă două limbi străine în cursul vieții sale. Acest concept este promovat de Uniunea Europeană, care susține că multilingvismul poate îmbunătăți nivelul educațional, sporirea comunicării și cooperării între țările europene, precum și promovarea diversității culturale. Învățarea limbilor străine la o vârstă fragedă reprezintă un alt element important al politicii de multilingvism. Studiile au arătat că copiii care sunt expuși limbilor străine de la o vârstă fragedă au mai multe șanse să devină vorbitori fluenți în acele limbi și să dezvolte abilități lingvistice superioare.

An American P-38 Lightning fighter plane with smoke trailing from one of its engines sputters and loses altitude above an Italian coastal town. A pair of German officers abruptly interrupt their lunch to catch up with the rapidly descending plane. When the Germans arrive at the crash site, they encounter a burning fuselage surrounded by Italian soldiers. The soldiers explain that the pilot was killed in the crash. Satisfied, the Germans leave. As soon as they are gone, the Italians mock their imperious occupiers and part ranks to reveal a hidden and slightly injured American flyer, Colonel Joseph Ryan (Frank Sinatra).Ryan is taken to an Italian POW camp filled with British and American prisoners. Italian discipline over the camp is lax and the prisoners are filthy and ragged. Constant escape attempts have enraged the Italian commandant and resulted in the withholding of clean clothes, hot water, razors, and food parcels. The ranking British officer has just died while imprisoned in the camp sweat box. Command has fallen to the irascible British Major Fincham (Trevor Howard) of the Ninth Fusiliers. The pragmatic Ryan and the inflexible Major Fincham immediately clash, with Ryan outranking Fincham and able to coutermand his orders.With the Americans only weeks from liberating the camp, Ryan wants all futile escape attempts stopped. He betrays the active escape tunnels to the Italian commandant, Major Battaglia (Adolfo Celi), earning both the enmity of the British prisoners and the scornful nickname \\"Von Ryan.\\" As a reward for Ryan's cooperation, Battaglia turns the showers back on and issues razors and Red Cross parcels. But he balks at issuing clean clothing, since he is selling the donated clothes on the black market. Ryan orders the men to strip and burn their filthy clothes. As punishment, Ryan is placed in the sweat box while the men receive their clean clothing.Some time later, Ryan's fellow inmates release him from the box with the welcome news that the Allies have... Answer:","output":"In the movie \\"Von Ryan's Express,\\" the prisoners led by Colonel Joseph Ryan (Frank Sinatra) and British Major Fincham (Trevor Howard) escape the train cars by orchestrating a clever and daring plan. The opportunity for escape arises when the Italian forces surrender, and the Germans take control of the camp. The prisoners are loaded onto a train to be transported to a more secure location in Germany. Ryan and Fincham, recognizing the danger of their situation, decide to put aside their differences and work together to escape. Their plan involves several stages: 1. Take control of the train: Ryan and Fincham organize the prisoners, with each group responsible for a specific task. They begin by overpowering the guards in their own car and then move on to the other cars. Altogether, they neutralize the German guards by using weapons and improvised tools. 2. Control the engine: Ryan, Fincham, and a small group of prisoners make their way to the locomotive at the front of the train. They overpower the German engineer, seize control of the engine, and take over as the train crew, wearing German uniforms to avoid suspicion. 3. Change the train route: The prisoners switch tracks and change the train's direction, steering it towards Switzerland and freedom. They do this by replacing the track-switching levers and using fake train orders to deceive the German railway personnel. 4. Deal with the German pursuers: While on the run, the prisoners encounter various obstacles, such as German patrols, roadblocks, and other trains. They have to deal with them by using force, deception, and quick thinking. They also destroy bridges and tracks behind them to impede the pursuing Germans. 5. Reach the Swiss border: With great effort, the prisoners finally reach the Swiss border. Unfortunately, they are confronted by the German forces at the border, leading to a climactic showdown. Ryan sacrifices himself to save the other prisoners, allowing them to escape unharmed across the border into neutral Switzerland. In summary, the prisoners in \\"Von Ryan's Express\\" escape the train cars by working together to overpower the guards, taking control of the engine, changing the train's route, and dealing with obstacles and German pursuers along the way to reach the Swiss border."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Obamacare -- the law that refuses to die -- is suddenly under attack again. Republicans will take full control of Congress in January and repealing Obamacare will almost certainly be one of their first priorities. The GOP is seizing on leaked tapes in which MIT professor Jonathan Gruber, an architect of the law, said the \\"stupidity of the American voter\\" and a \\"lack of transparency\\" were vital to its passage in 2010. And, perhaps most importantly, the Supreme Court is poised to rule on subsidies that are central to the law. \\"We have to take it very seriously. It is hard to predict how the Court will ultimately decide,\\" said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, an advocacy group that campaigns to sustain Obamacare. It's a surprising turn of events for an issue that had seemed to move to the back burner in recent months. The law has already survived one key Supreme Court challenge and millions are now insured because of the legislation. And the issue, which was expected to dominate this year's elections, took a back seat to fears about Ebola and ISIS. The next round of open enrollment for Obamacare begins Saturday. The Supreme Court poses the gravest threat after agreeing to hear a challenge to the crucial tax credits that subsidize health coverage purchased on federal exchanges. In what amounts to a tussle over language, the suit contends that the law permits subsidies to be dispersed only through state exchanges. But 35 states rely on federal exchanges to market health insurance — in many cases because Republican governors who oppose Obamacare refused to set up marketplaces. To reach consumers in those states, the federal government offers a market place and subsidies. But if the Court rules next year that those federal subsidies are illegal, it could throw the entire health care system into chaos, threaten millions of health plans and send the entire law into a \\"death spiral.\\" Chief Justice John Roberts, who outraged conservatives by saving Obamacare from a previous Supreme Court challenge in 2012, may again be the crucial swing vote. But there is a chance that even an adverse ruling would not end Obamacare's life. Harvard Law Professor Einer Elhauge says some states, to protect themselves against possible health care chaos, might finally decide to set up their own arrangements or partner with the federal exchange. \\"The prospect of that disruption is sufficiently problematic that I would not be surprised to see a lot of states adopt exchanges,\\" said Elhauge, who authored a book on the original Obamacare Supreme Court case. Obamacare also faces a political assault from resurgent Republicans devoted to the mantra : \\"repeal and replace.\\" Because so many party candidates vowed to eliminate the law during their election campaigns, Republican leaders in the House and the Senate are under pressure to schedule votes to do just that. But the votes will be largely symbolic. Though they captured the Senate, Republicans are still short of the 60 votes needed to overcome Democratic filibusters. And even if they did put a repeal bill on the President's desk, there is zero chance he would sign it and destroy his own proudest political achievement. So, as a fallback plan, opponents of Obamacare will likely try to tear it down bit by bit, possibly by attaching bills amending it to must-pass legislation. Plans are piling up. Paul Ryan and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio are teaming up to produce a plan to \\"deliver quality affordable health care coverage to American families,\\" a spokesman for the Wisconsin lawmaker told CNN. Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch has a market based health care plan he wrote with Sens Richard Burr and Tom Coburn. \\"Conservatives should ... take advantage of opportunities to repeal any part of the law and replace it with better policies that empower Americans, not Washington,\\" Hatch wrote in USA Today on Wednesday. Wyoming Republican Sen. John Barrasso, an orthopedic surgeon and health policy expert, warns GOP hopes of repealing Obamacare are not realistic until there is a Republican in the White House but told WPBI radio last month conservatives should \\"systematically strip away the worst parts of Obamacare.\\" But some conservatives want a more radical approach, and recommend repealing Obamacare by using the budget tool reconciliation, which requires only 51 votes — and, ironically, was used to pass the law in 2010. But again, Obama would be ready with this veto pen. Some adjustments to the law could draw some Democratic support. They could include a repeal of the delayed employer mandate requiring large firms to provide health care and changes to rules requiring companies to provide insurance to employees that work more than 30 hours a week. Some Democratic senators from red states are eying a repeal of the tax on medical devices , which raises 29 billion over the next decade to finance the cost of insuring more Americans. But conservatives might be end up frustrated because none of the fixes that have a chance of becoming law will seriously undermine Obamacare as a whole. \\"The parts you could chip away out probably are not going to destabilize the legislation. It gets through with a few bits knocked off — but it is still there,\\" said Stuart Butler, a health care expert and senior Brookings Institution fellow. Republican lawmakers determined to kill Obamacare may also find themselves under pressure from the corporate health firms which have spent millions of dollars adapting to the new law are are worried about more disruption. But Obamacare's capacity to ignite controversy is undimmed. Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell couldn't keep a smile off his face on Thursday when discussing the leaked Gruber tape. \\"What this insider is saying confirms that they were spinning tales from the beginning — that they did not tell the truth about ObamaCare,\\" McConnell said. House Speaker John Boehner's office said Gruber's comments proved Obamacare was rammed through Congress with \\"arrogance, duplicity and contempt for the will of the American people.\\" A test also awaits on Saturday with the debut of the second open enrollment period for Obamcare, with advocates desperate to avoid website and other teething problems of last year. The White House is backing efforts, which include mobile apps and targeted social media advertising, to recruit more \\"young and invincibles\\" — people who are least likely to sign up for coverage but who are needed to offset older, sicker patients to make the system work. The number of sign-ups in the three month enrollment period are likely to play an important role in the political debate going forward. Federal officials last week projected that between nine and 9.9 million people would be signed up to Obamacare in 2015, lower than the 13 million number previously projected by the Congressional Budget Office. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The article discusses the various challenges and threats that the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, is facing despite its survival in recent years. Some key points from the article are: 1. Republicans are poised to take control of Congress in January, and repealing Obamacare is expected to be one of their top priorities. 2. GOP is using leaked tapes of MIT professor Jonathan Gruber, one of the architects behind Obamacare, who revealed that the \\"stupidity of the American voter\\" and a \\"lack of transparency\\" were vital to the law's passage in 2010. 3. The Supreme Court hearing a challenge to the tax credits that subsidize health coverage purchased on federal exchanges poses a significant threat to the law. If the court renders federal subsidies illegal, it might lead to chaos in the healthcare system and put the entire law in jeopardy. 4. Republican lawmakers are planning to dismantle Obamacare through various means, including repealing key components and replacing them with alternative policies, or using the budget tool reconciliation to remove the law entirely. 5. Adjustments to the law may draw bipartisan support, including repealing the employer mandate, changing rules concerning employee insurance, and repealing the tax on medical devices. 6. Corporate health firms that have already spent millions of dollars adapting to Obamacare might pressure GOP lawmakers not to disrupt the law further. 7. The controversial nature of Obamacare remains apparent, as evidenced by the leaked Gruber tape, which has fueled claims that the law was pushed through Congress with deceit and arrogance. 8. The upcoming second open enrollment period for Obamacare starts on Saturday and will be a crucial test for the system, with efforts being made to avoid the issues faced during the previous enrollment period.

Context: Coming off their dominating win over the Dolphins, the Bills flew to Cleveland Browns Stadium for a Week 15 intraconference duel with the Cleveland Browns in a race for the wild card.  The game was played under horrible weather conditions with heavy lake effect snow falling throughout the game making it difficult for either team to move the ball offensively.  In the first quarter, Buffalo trailed early as Browns kicker Phil Dawson managed to get a 35-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Bills continued to trail as LS Ryan Neill's snap to Punter Brian Moorman went over Moorman's head, causing him to kick the ball through his endzone for a Cleveland safety.  Later, the Browns increased their lead with Dawson just managing to nail a 49-yard field goal.  Near the end of the game, Buffalo managed to get deep into Cleveland territory.

Given the question: I know that the answer to the question \\"A sleeveless outer vestament worn by Christian clergyman is called?\\" is in \\"Among the paleo-orthodox and emerging church movements in Protestant and evangelical churches, in which some Presbyterians are involved, clergy are moving away from the traditional black Geneva gown to such vestments as the alb and chasuble, but also cassock and surplice (typically a full length Old English style surplice which resembles the Celtic alb, an ungirdled liturgical tunic of the old Gallican Rite), which some, particularly those identifying with the Liturgical Renewal Movement, hold to be more ancient and representative of a more ecumenical past.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer is:","output":"The sleeveless outer vestment worn by Christian clergyman mentioned in the text is called an \\"alb.\\" This term originates from the Latin word \\"albus,\\" which simply means \\"white\\" -- a reflection of its traditional color. The alb is a long, white linen tunic that has been worn by clerics since early Christianity. Its length and color symbolize purity, and it is typically worn with a cincture, which is a type of belt.  In the provided text, it also shares that in addition to the alb, other vestments can include the chasuble, cassock, and surplice. The chasuble is a circular garment covering the entire body, the cassock is a close-fitting ankle-length robe, and the surplice is a loose-fitting tunic of varying length, usually worn over a cassock.  It’s also interesting to note the emerging movement towards these vestments among some Presbyterian circles, reflecting a desire for an enriched sense of tradition and a connection to more ancient forms of Christian practice. The \\"paleo-orthodox\\" movement attempts to reconnect with the church’s past, while the \\"emerging church\\" movement emphasizes the lived experience of faith in the contemporary world, valuing cultural relevance over tradition. Moreover, the text mentions the \\"Liturgical Renewal Movement,\\" which is an indication of some churches’ preference for vestments seen as more ancient, aiming for a connection to Christianity’s deep historical roots. This reflects a broader trend across many denominations and faith traditions toward engaging more deeply with the faith and practices of earlier times, in the hope of finding new resonance and relevance for today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If true, this would be the largest initial production run of iPhones – up from 60 million for the iPhone 5S and 5C last year. Suppliers claim the Californian firm has asked for between 70 and 80 million units combined for the rumoured 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 6s by 30 December. Scroll down for video. Suppliers claim Apple has ordered between 70 and 80 million units combined for its rumoured, upcoming 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 6s (leaked images pictured) by 30 December. The reports come after iPhone maker Foxconn confirmed it has hired 100,000 new workers to manufacture the gadgets. Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures. As. the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced. using diamond-coated saws. These round disks are ground into shape, and. polished, to become glass. The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant. Apple already uses sapphire crystal in. the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera. As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones. The reports come after iPhone maker Foxconn confirmed it has hired 100,000 new workers to manufacture the new gadgets. The 4.7-inch iPhone is. expected to go into production next week, with the larger 5.5inch version. set to start three weeks later. Apple has traditionally touted the benefits of smaller screens, and its devices typically have a 4-inch display. By increasing the size of its iPhone 6 handsets, Apple phones will be closer in size to those made by rival Samsung and HTC. Apple's larger screens are expected to use in-cell technology that will make the screens thinner and lighter by adding touch sensors to the liquid crystal. display. Current models have a separate touchscreen layer. Elsewhere, the 5.5-inch iPhone screen is expected to be made of sapphire crystal, rather than glass. Due to the complex nature of these screens, reports claim Apple could even ask component makers to prepare for 120 million displays, to account for any faults and replacements that need to be issued. The Economic Daily said earlier this week Foxconn finally confirmed the rumours it would hire a huge number of staff. The report appears to contradict earlier claims the larger 'phablet' sized iPhone 6 won't ship until 2015. This figure is up from 60 million for the iPhone 5S (pictured) and 5C last year. Apple has traditionally touted the benefits of smaller screens, and its devices typically have a 4-inch display. Increasing the size of its iPhone 6 handsets, Apple phones will be closer in size to those made by rival Samsung. Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up. until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest. phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 0.24 inches (6.18. millimetres). This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 0.23 inches (5.75 millimetres). By. comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 0.3 inches (7.6. millimetres), while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 0.295 inches. (7.5 millimetres). Samsung's Galaxy S5 is 0.32 inches (8.1 millimetres) thick, while the HTC One M8 is 0.37 inches (9.4 millimetres). A. YouTube videomaker recently claimed to have acquired one of the sapphire screens - and has. subjected it to a barrage of abuse, from stabbing it with a knife and. keys to bending and twisting it. In the video, the screen emerges totally unscathed, raising hopes is could lead to a far more resilient handset from Apple. Marques. Brownlee, a popular YouTube host claims to have got the screen from. well known Apple leaker Sonny Dickson, who recently made his own video. showcasing the screen. In the video he can be seen bending and twisting the screen. 'I slowly realised there is absolutely no way I can break this display under my own power,' he said. 'The worst blemish on the surface was actually my fingerprint marks and the dust from handling it so much.' The. glass is also extremely high-quality, Brownlee noted: 'There’s. absolutely no colour shift while looking through the sapphire glass.' Apple. already uses a small amount of sapphire glass for the 'Home' button and. camera lens in the iPhone 5S, but the rest of the current iPhone front. display is made of Gorilla Glass. Apple's larger screens are expected to use in-cell technology that will make the screens thinner and lighter by adding touch sensors to the liquid crystal display. Elsewhere, the 5.5-inch iPhone screen is expected to be made of strong and resilient sapphire crystal - shown here being stabbed with a knife. IDozens of pictures have leaked online claiming to show Apple's iPhone 6. They all show a thin, curved device with distinctive white 'bars' across the back. However,. a Japanese news agency has claimed that in fact, the finished product. will look very different - and that it could even have a curved screen. Prolific Apple-tipster, Sonny Dickson, has got his hands on leaked images of the front and back of a possible Apple LCD backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches (14cm). The photos suggest Apple is already producing components for its anticipated 5.5-inch phone.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Once upon a time,the animals decided that they must do something heroic to meet the problems of\\" a new world\\".So they organized a training school. They adopted an activity curriculum  consisting of running,climbing,swimming and flying.To make it easier to manage the curriculum,all the animals took all the subjects. The duck was excellent in swimming,in fact,better than his instructor,but he made only passing grades in flying and was very poor in running.Since he was slow in running,he had to stay after school and also drop swimming in order to practice running.This was kept up until his webbed  feet were badly worn and he was only average in swimming.But average was acceptable in school,so nobody worried about that except the duck. The rabbit started at the top of the class in running,but had a nervous breakdown because of so much make-up work in swimming. The squirrel was excellent in climbing until he developed frustration in the flying class where his teacher made him start from the ground up instead of from the treetop down.He also developed a \\"Charlie horse\\" and then got a C in climbing and a D in running. The eagle was a problem child and was disciplined severely.In the climbing class he beat all the others to the top of the tree,but insisted on using his own way to get there. At the end of the year,an abnormal eel that could swim very well,and also run,climb and fly a little,had the highest average and was the one who gave a good-bye speech. The prairie dogs stayed out of the school because the administration would not add digging to the curriculum. Options: A He was a problem child. B He beat all to become the best.

Suspended beneath is a gondola or wicker basket (in some long-distance or high-altitude balloons, a capsule), which carries passengers and (usually) a source of heat, in most cases an open flame. The heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant since it has a lower density than the colder air outside the envelope. As with all aircraft, hot air balloons cannot fly beyond the atmosphere. Unlike gas balloons, the envelope does not have to be sealed at the bottom, since the air near the bottom of the envelope is at the same pressure as the surrounding air. In modern sport balloons the envelope is generally made from nylon fabric and the inlet of the balloon (closest to the burner flame) is made from a fire resistant material such as Nomex. Modern balloons have been made in all kinds of shapes, such as rocket ships and the shapes of various commercial products, though the traditional shape is used for most non-commercial, and many commercial, applications.

The culture associated with the samurai such as the tea ceremony, monochrome ink painting, rock gardens and poetry were adopted by warrior patrons throughout the centuries 1200–1600. These practices were adapted from the Chinese arts. Zen monks introduced them to Japan and they were allowed to flourish due to the interest of powerful warrior elites. Musō Soseki (1275–1351) was a Zen monk who was advisor to both Emperor Go-Daigo and General Ashikaga Takauji (1304–58). Musō, as well as other monks, acted as political and cultural diplomat between Japan and China. Musō was particularly well known for his garden design. Another Ashikaga patron of the arts was Yoshimasa. His cultural advisor, the Zen monk Zeami, introduced tea ceremony to him. Previously, tea had been used primarily for Buddhist monks to stay awake during meditation. Q: Who brought Chinese arts to Japan?","output":"A: Zen monks brought Chinese arts to Japan, where they introduced things like the tea ceremony, ink painting, rock gardens, and poetry.

The young entrepreneur is the founder of Beni American University (BAU), Nigeria's first private online university. Launched in late 2012, the school allows students to access their classes at any time of the day with any internet-enabled device. \\"We are providing executive programs for graduates who are looking for employment and want to build up their resumes, or managers who want to climb up the hierarchy of their companies,\\" says Ukanwoke, now 25. \\"We also have courses targeted at people who want to start their own business.\\" 'Nigeria's Mark Zuckerberg' Ukanwoke's idea to start BAU came from his previous online venture called Students Circle, an educational social networking site he'd launched while in university that allows learners to interact and access free resources from leading schools. \\"When I created Students Circle in 2010,\\" explains Ukanwoke, \\"I found out that ... many were looking for certificates, hoping that they could get something they could use to maybe find employment or get a promotion in the workplace. \\"There was a need for a new institution to be created in Nigeria,\\" adds Ukanwoke, who was once described by Forbes as \\"Nigeria's Mark Zuckerberg.\\" Now, some 18 months into his new business endeavor, Ukanwoke has hired 10 instructors and has about 200 students, with an average age of 26. But the startup's journey so far has not been without challenges -- Nigerian laws require universities to have a physical campus so last year Ukanwoke went and bought land in the country's Benue State with the goal to build a private campus that could accommodate some 10,000 students. The project is expected to launch next year, but in the meantime the web courses are up and running -- a 12 week online program can cost between 100 and 300. Among the courses offered are corporate diplomacy, global marketing, leadership and management, digital journalism, project management and entrepreneurship and innovation, which is the university's most popular class. \\"It's good because I have four kids,\\" says Chinenye Madukwe, one of BAU's students. \\"I have opportunity to work at the same time, because I have a small interior design outfit.\\" Oo Nwoye, another BAU student, says he enrolled \\"for the knowledge.\\" \\"It is just helpful for my business and that is the most important thing to me,\\" he explains. Education is key. A son of two teachers, Ukanwoke says he is driven by his passion to use technology to solve social problems. \\"I grew up within the framework where education was put at a very high level of importance, and entrepreneurship is something that I always wanted to do,\\" he says. \\"Without education I don't think we can do any progress,\\" he adds. \\"It's not just about getting a certificate -- education is about teaching people how to make a living and teaching people how to live; how to interact with others, how to lead their lives and make something out of themselves,\\" continues Ukanwoke. \\"With education comes discipline and we need a lot of discipline in Nigeria as well, so education is really important.\\" Ukanwoke relies mainly on social media to advertize but says that it's student referrals that are increasing BAU's enrollment. \\"We still have a long way to go, we have a lot of work to do, a lot of policy wrangling too,\\" he admits. \\"But it's a work in progress and we are quite happy with where we are.\\"","output":"Gossy Ukanwoke is a very smart young man who started Beni American University, which is Nigeria's first online school.

Now, about 200 students from all over Nigeria are learning many interesting subjects like business, marketing, and how to be good leaders.

Brazenly taunting him with her sexuality, she bluntly dissects their prior relationshipâa nightmarish web of masochism, money, manipulation and dependency, pimping her out to dangerous clients in order to gain both a business advantage and perverse personal thrills. She outlines her newest ambition, since their estrangement, of raising the necessary capital to run a nightclub in Beijing. Miles makes no pretense of the fact that he is less interested in the proposal than the woman, and encourages her to visit him at his apartment. Without making any promises, Sandra leaves for her job at an import business, run by a young married couple: Lester and Sue Wong. Sandra's own import sideline, drug running, is facilitated by her close bond of loyalty with low-ranking employee Lisa.

It was the most commonly used member of the DOS family of operating systems, and was the main operating system for IBM PC compatible personal computers during the 1980s and the early 1990s, when it was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI), in various generations of the graphical Microsoft Windows operating system by Microsoft Corporation.  - A game show is a type of radio, television, or internet programming genre in which contestants, television personalities or celebrities, sometimes as part of a team, play a game which involves answering questions or solving puzzles usually for money and/or prizes. Alternatively, a \\"gameshow\\" can be a demonstrative program about a game (while usually retaining the spirit of an awards ceremony). In the former, contestants may be invited from a pool of public applicants. On some shows, contestants compete against other players or another team, while other shows involve contestants playing alone for a reward or a high score. Game shows often reward players with prizes such as cash, trips and goods and services provided by the show's sponsor prize suppliers, who in turn usually do so for the purposes of product placement. One of the reasons that television broadcasters make game shows is because they are substantially less costly than producing scripted drama shows. Some TV game shows fall under the category of reality television.  - An arcade game or coin-op is a coin-operated entertainment machine typically installed in public businesses such as restaurants, bars and amusement arcades. Most arcade games are video games, pinball machines, electro-mechanical games, redemption games or merchandisers. While exact dates are debated, the golden age of arcade video games is usually defined as a period beginning sometime in the late 1970s and ending sometime in the mid-1980s. Excluding a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, the arcade industry subsequently declined in the Western hemisphere as competing home-based video game consoles such as Playstation and Xbox increased in their graphics and game-play capability and decreased in cost.  - The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64.  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - Stephen (or Stephan) Gary \\"Steve\\" Wozniak (born August 11, 1950), nicknamed \\"Woz\\", is an American inventor, electronics engineer, programmer, and technology entrepreneur who co-founded Apple Inc. He is known as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.  - The VIC-20 (Germany: VC-20; Japan: VIC-1001) is an 8-bit home computer that was sold by Commodore Business Machines. The VIC-20 was announced in 1980, roughly three years after Commodore's first personal computer, the PET. The VIC-20 was the first computer of any description to sell one million units.  - Eugene Peyton Jarvis (born 1955) is an American game designer and programmer, known for producing pinball machines for Atari and video games for Williams Electronics. Most notable amongst his works are the seminal arcade video games \\"Defender\\" and \\"\\" in the early 1980s, and the \\"Cruis'n\\" series of driving games for Midway Games in the 1990s. He co-founded Vid Kidz in the early 1980s and currently leads his own development studio, Raw Thrills Inc. In 2008 Eugene Jarvis was named the first Game Designer in Residence by DePaul University's Game Development program. His family owns the Jarvis Wines company in Napa, CA  - The Atari 2600 (or Atari VCS before 1982) is a home video game console by Atari, Inc. Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976. This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games that were physically built into the unit.  - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor.  - The West Coast Computer Faire was an annual computer industry conference and exposition most often associated with San Francisco, its first and most frequent venue. The first fair was held in 1977 and was organized by Jim Warren and Bob Reiling. At the time, it was the biggest computer show in the world, intended to popularize the personal computer in the home. The West Coast PC Faire was formed to provide a more specialized show. However, Apple stopped exhibiting at the West Coast Computer Faire, refusing to exhibit at any show other than COMDEX that also had PC-based exhibits. In 1983, Warren sold the rights to the Faire for US3 million to Prentice Hall, who later sold it to Sheldon Adelson, the owner of Interface Group and COMDEX. In total, sixteen shows were held, with the last in 1991.

It includes a microprocessor, memory, and minimal input/output (I/O) circuitry mounted on a single printed circuit board. Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs).

Japanese PM Shinzo Abe to become the country’s first leader to visit Pearl Harbour Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will visit Pearl Harbour with Barack Obama. (AFP) Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday he will visit Pearl Harbour this month with U.S. President Barack Obama \\"to console the souls\\" of victims of Japan's surprise attack on U.S. forces there 75 years ago. Abe, who will be the first serving Japanese prime minister to visit the naval base in Hawaii, said he wanted to demonstrate resolve to end the horror of war. This year, Obama became the first serving U.S. president to visit the Japanese city of Hiroshima, which the United States attacked with an atomic bomb in 1945. \\"I'll visit Pearl Harbour with President Obama. This will be a visit to console the souls of the victims,\\" Abe told reporters. \\"I would like to show to the world the resolve that horrors of war should never be repeated.\\" Abe will visit Hawaii on Dec. 26 and 27 and plans to hold his final summit meeting with the outgoing U.S. president during the trip. Japanese attack on United States naval base at Pearl Harbour, Hawaii, 7 December 1941. (AFP Obama has close ties to Hawaii, the island state where he was born and where he and his family have vacationed throughout his White House term. Japanese forces attacked Pearl Harbour with torpedo planes, bombers and fighter planes on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, bombing the U.S. fleet moored there, in the hope of destroying U.S. power in the Pacific. The attack led to the United States entering World War Two and the defeat of Japan in August 1945, days after U.S. atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The White House said Abe's visit would highlight the alliance between the former wartime enemies. \\"The two leaders' visit will showcase the power of reconciliation that has turned former adversaries into the closest of allies, united by common interests and shared values,\\" the White House said in a statement. Abe last year spoke to the U.S. Congress and expressed \\"deep repentance\\" over Japan's role in World War Two. Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University's Japan campus, said an outright apology from Abe would be unlikely during his Pearl Harbor visit. \\"He won't go as far as to apologize, but there will be a demonstration of contrition. He will follow Obama's model (in Hiroshima). Obama has shown the way forward in addressing the past without whitewashing and denying,\\" Kingston said. In Hiroshima, Obama reiterated his commitment to pursuing a world without nuclear weapons, while avoiding any direct expression of remorse or apology for the U.S. nuclear bombings. \\"I think Abe wants to draw a line under history and move forward with (President-elect Donald) Trump and get some difficult obstacles out of the way. It's probably an astute move on Abe's part,\\" Kingston said.

Which country released less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere?  China used alternative fuels to generate electricity, while Mongolia burned lots of fossil fuels. There were frequent debates between the two countries on this matter.  Hint: Carbon dioxide is the most significant long-lived greenhouse gas in Earth's atmosphere. Since the Industrial Revolution anthropogenic emissions – primarily from use of fossil fuels and deforestation – have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere, leading to global warming.  Carbon dioxide also causes ocean acidification because it dissolves in water to form carbonic acid. The answer to this question is:","output":"The country that released less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere is China.  The paragraph makes it clear that China used alternative fuels to generate electricity. Alternative fuels refer to energy sources that are not based on fossil fuel consumption. This could encompass a broad range of energy sources, such as solar power, wind energy, nuclear power, or biofuels, among others. Such alternative fuels are considered to be 'cleaner' energy sources because they either release fewer greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, or none at all, depending on the type of alternative fuel considered. On the other hand, the paragraph mentions that Mongolia utilized a high amount of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels, which include petroleum, coal, and natural gases, are notorious for their high carbon dioxide emissions. Upon combustion, the carbon within these fuels is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, a harmful greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming and climate change. The rapid increase in the human-made emissions of carbon dioxide, especially since the industrial revolution, has been primarily due to our heavy global reliance on fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide causes global warming because it has the ability to trap solar radiation within Earth's atmosphere, contributing to the 'greenhouse effect', which is responsible for heating our planet. In addition to causing global warming, carbon dioxide also contributes to ocean acidification. When it dissolves in seawater, a chemical reaction occurs forming carbonic acid, which increases the acidity of the ocean. This can have harmful effects on marine organisms, particularly those with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons, like corals, oysters, clams, and some plankton. Given the aforementioned reasons, it is evident that the country that relied on alternative fuels, which is China in the presented scenario, would have released less carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than the country that heavily depended on burning fossil fuels, which is Mongolia. This conclusion is based on the implied understanding that the combustion of fossil fuels results in much greater carbon dioxide emissions compared to the use of alternative energy sources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Alexis Pilkington was a popular 17-year-old and a well-liked athlete who had already won a soccer scholarship to college. But none of that stopped Alexis from becoming the target of online bullying  . Alexis began to receive hundreds of online unpleasant comments via the latest social networking site called www.formspring.com. In March 2010, Alexis committed suicide and although all agreed that the online bother was not the single factor that led to Alexis' death, everyone did agree that it was a contributory factor. Unfortunately, Alexis' story is not unique. A 2010 study conducted by the Cyberbullying Research Center showed that cyberbullying victims were almost twice as likely to have attempted suicide compared to youth who had not experienced cyberbullying. Suicide is obviously the extreme and no one can minimize the tragedy of it. However, there are other damages that occur as a result of aggressive bullying. It can damage self-esteem and lead to feelings of worthlessness, and also increase social isolation and make victims become withdrawn, depressed, anxious, and insecure. So what causes girls to be so unkind towards each other? A term known as relational aggression may best describe the cause of girl-on-girl bullying. It starts with a clique   usually led by a girl with a high level of social status and popularity. In order not to lose her position, she will control girls within the clique and take action if she feels threatened. At the leader's directive the girls within the clique will spread rumors and lies and annoy other girls continuously. The bullying starts at school but will quickly go to cyberbullying due to anonymity  . Girls will easily do so in the anonymity of the Internet. Ultimately the cause will be summarized as the insecurity and jealousy of one girl and the twisted loyalty of members within her clique. Underneath the confident exterior   of a female bully lie desperate insecurities. Question: Which of the following is NOT the cause of bullying? Options: A: Lack of security. B: Jealousy of others.

John is a physician in the local hospital. Today, he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. John determines that patient A is obese, and patient B is not obese. He needs to prescribe medicine according to his findings.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which patient is less at risk of getting type 2 diabetes, patient A or patient B?  Hint: Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The answer to this question is:","output":"Patient B. To arrive at this answer, let's break down the information given in the paragraph and hint: 1. Obesity is defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0 kg/m2 or greater. 2. Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. 3.

The 2nd Marquess occupied the castle on visits to his extensive Glamorgan estates, during which he developed modern Cardiff and created Cardiff Docks as the outlet for coal and steel from the South Wales Valleys, but did little to the castle itself, beyond completing the 1st Marquess's work.  The 3rd Marquess despised Holland's efforts, describing the castle as having been \\"the victim of every barbarism since the Renaissance\\", and, on his coming of age, engaged Burges to undertake rebuilding on a Wagnerian scale. Almost all of Burges's usual team were involved, including Chapple, Frame and Lonsdale, creating a building which John Newman describes in Glamorgan: The Buildings of Wales as the \\"most successful of all the fantasy castles of the nineteenth century.\\" The central block of the castle comprises the two storey banqueting hall, with the library below. Both are enormous, the former to act as a suitable reception hall where the Marquess could fulfil his civic duties, the latter to hold part of his vast library. Both include elaborate carvings and fireplaces, those in the banqueting hall depicting the castle itself in the time of Robert, Duke of Normandy, who was imprisoned there in 1126–1134. The fireplace in the library contains five figures, four representing the Greek, Egyptian, Hebrew and Assyrian alphabets, while the fifth is said to represent Bute as a Celtic monk.

And the answer is...","output":"To find the value of 't' for the equation -2761*t = -2782*t - 1176, we first need to separate the 't' terms on one side of the equation and make the other side contain only the numerical value. Let's start by adding 2782*t to both sides of the equation to isolate terms with 't' on the same side. This gives us: -2761*t + 2782*t = -2782*t - 1176 + 2782*t. Simplifying it further: 21*t = -1176. We obtained this by subtracting -2761*t from 2782*t which gives 21*t. On the right-hand side, -2782*t and +2782*t cancel out each other, leaving you with -1176. The next step is to isolate 't'. To do this, we have to divide both sides of the equation by 21. Thus, the final equation becomes: t = -1176 / 21. Doing the division on the right-hand side gives: t = -56. So, the solution of the given equation -2761*t = -2782*t - 1176 is t = -56. This means that if we substitute t with -56 in the original equation, both sides of the equation will be equal, showing that t = -56 is indeed the correct solution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation of enzymes breaking down less fats could have an indirect effect on insulin release in the body. If there is a reduced breakdown of fats, it could potentially lead to an increased reliance on carbohydrates as an energy source. As a result, the consumption and breakdown of carbohydrates might increase, causing blood sugar levels to rise. In response to the elevated blood sugar levels, the pancreas releases more insulin to help regulate blood glucose levels by promoting glucose uptake into cells.

Alex is full of life and more interested in playing the fool, by dancing around and doing the \\"happy face/angry face\\" gag with his paw. Zuba shows him his paw, which has an Africa-shaped birthmark on it, which Alex also has on his paw. Just then, Makunga (Alec Baldwin), a scheming lion who wants to be Alpha Lion, challenges Zuba. Leaving Alex alone for a while, Zuba kicks the pride out of Makunga. As the fight is going on, Alex notices a piece of rope moving on the ground and follows it. He goes off the reserve and is captured by poachers, who dump him in a crate and put him in the bed of their truck. Zuba notices that his son is missing. He sees the truck moving along the fence of the reserve and hears his son, crying out for help. He runs and jumps on the truck. He manages to free the crate of its binds, when one of the poachers shoots him, causing him to fall off the truck. He doesn't notice that Alex's crate has fallen out of the truck-bed and into a nearby river. Despite the painful hole in his ear, he mourns the loss of his son.Meanwhile, in the box, Alex sits timidly. Finally, he reaches New York City and is fished out and put in the New York City Zoo. When he sees all the people looking at him, he starts to dance around, much to the audience's pleasure.

More than 10,000 homes were blacked out as a result of the late Sunday storms which swept through northern New South Wales. A number of fires are also burning across the state after being sparked by lightning strikes. The NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) reports that it is battling 90 blazes so far, 47 of which are deemed out of control. Most were caused by lightning strikes late on Sunday that followed scorching temperatures in Sydney and around the state, NSW RFS spokesman Ben Shepherd said. The Bureau of Meteorology reported that the unsettled conditions were being caused by a slow-moving low-pressure trough, with forecast of storms in southern and western parts of the state. Peter Zmijewski, senior meteorologist at Bureau of Meteorology, told Daily Mail Australia that the high temperatures were not unseasonal but because of the changing seasons. He said: 'This time of the year it’s a transition in the season and there are a lot of adjustments going on, this is why we can experience very hot and cold in the same day.' The November to January temperature outlooks indicate a warmer than normal season for both daytime and night-time temperatures across most of Australia. 'There's a build up of heat due to the clear sunny days which has allowed heat to build,' said Weatherzone meteorologist Kim Westcott. 'The heat is slowly moving ahead of a slow pressure trough.'

They’re under huge pressure to write and publish but an ever-growing mountain of teaching and admin is stopping them doing just that. Our research finds that whilst nobody is immune to these pressures, some academics cope better than others – and that’s because over the years, they’ve developed personal “systems” to help them write. We recently carried out in-depth interviews with 23 scholars across the UK, Europe and the US. We deliberately chose a diverse group so as to not make any assumptions based on age, seniority, or research background. Academic experience ranged from six months to 27 years and subject fields ranged from social sciences, economics, business, and arts. We did this as part of our user research to inform the development of Prolifiko – a digital coaching tool for writers. Whilst every academic had developed a writing productivity system personal to them, we found there were six common “habits” that the most prolific (and generally least stressed) academics tended to use. 1. They “time-block” their writing in advance Scheduling – booking in time to write in advance – was the single most common habit of our writers. It didn’t appear to matter what type of time-blocking method a scholar chose to use or how lengthy a writing session was. Some blocked out long periods of time on sabbatical, whilst others preferred to block out short, regular times throughout the day or across a week. What seemed to matter far more was the act of planning, as this mentally prepared the individual for writing – and so made the process easier and less stressful. “When I need to write I block out time. I’m lucky in that I can work from home – I block out a couple of straight days to do the writing and I plan it in beforehand. I couldn’t really write in any other way than blocking out that time.” Question: Researchers found that writers who don't time-block their writing in advance probably: Options:  A. not enough information  B.

Please briefly summarize this news article: How I got schooled on college savings plans Is your child eventually going to wish he’d been born in another state? The federal government did a great service 17 years ago when it allowed states to set up Section 529 college savings plans as a way for overwhelmed parents to save for the ever-rising costs of higher education. The money you put in today gets to grow free from any federal taxes until you decide to spend it — a big advantage that can massively multiply your savings, especially if you start putting money away years before your child goes to college. But each state runs its own plan, and unfortunately not all college plans are created equal. And if you want to take advantage of any potential state tax benefits, you have to invest in the plan offered by your home state. The result: The plans are an essential monopoly in most states, granted by the state treasurer or other officials to a money management firm. And some state plans are taking advantage by charging oversize fees. My husband and I got a firsthand glimpse of the problem a few years ago when setting up college savings plans for our children, a daunting process even for someone who spends her days following financial markets. Most plans offer a large number of funds, from actively managed ones to passive ones that track stocks or bonds. The sheer number of options confounded me, so I called the best person I could think of to ask for advice: Warren Buffett. He told me what he often tells investors: If you’re not a money manager, you’re better off investing in a fund that indexes the stock market. If stocks go up over time, your investment rises, and you’ll pay far lower fees than you would for an actively managed fund. (Buffett says the most likely scenario is that 10,000 in a stock index fund will grow to 40,000 in 20 years.) With that in mind, I began researching administrative fees. To invest in a plain-vanilla stock index fund in my home state of New Jersey’s college savings plan, I would have to pay 40 basis points. A similar index fund in Nebraska’s college savings plan would cost 51 basis points, and 42 points in Nevada. And if you buy through an adviser in many states, you can pay 85 basis points for those same funds. But invest in a stock index fund in California and you can pay as little as 18 basis points, or in Arizona just 19 basis points. It may not sound like a big difference — indeed, these are all fees of less than 1%. But over 10 years for a 10,000 account, a 75-point spread in administrative costs can easily add up to over 1,000 or more in extra fees you pay, and that’s not chump change. So what gives? “It’s a complicated business,” explains Laura Lutton, the head of 529 research at Morningstar, which rates about 60 college savings plans a year. “You’re mixing money management and state politics, so all kinds of things can happen.” Part of the issue has to do with economies of scale. New York’s plan is able to charge just 17 basis points for its stock index fund because it has a whopping 13.2 billion in assets under management. Alabama, meanwhile, which has just 164 million in assets, charges 30 basis points to invest in an index-based stock fund. Obviously state officials with a bigger purse can drive a better bargain when it comes to fees. The good news: The purse seems to be growing in every state. The industry now has about 187 billion in assets, up from 166 billion at the end of last year. And that extra heft has given the states more leverage with money managers. “If you’d looked around a few years ago, the disparity would have been even greater,” says Michael Fitzgerald, the Iowa state treasurer and chair of the College Savings Plan Network. He was able to negotiate a better deal for his constituents as more people signed up for the plan: “In 1998 we were charging 68 basis points. Now we’re down to 28.” It’s proof that states can negotiate better deals with money managers. If your state officials haven’t already done that on your behalf, let them know you think they can do better. Someday your child will thank you for it. Becky Quick is an anchor on CNBC’s Squawk Box. This story is from the October 28, 2013 issue of Fortune. Summary:","output":"The article provides a detailed account of the author's exploration and understanding of the American college savings plan, commonly referred to as the Section 529 plan. These savings plans are set up by individual states, with contributions growing tax-free until they are used, a scheme permitted by the federal government over seventeen years ago. The writer, however, notes that these state-managed plans are not equal, varying significantly in the asset management fees charged.  The differences in fees across states became clearer as the author, together with her husband, established plans for their children. Despite the overall fees being less than 1%, she observed how such fees could accumulate over time to meaningful amounts. For instance, a 75-basis point difference in administrative costs on a 10,000 account could total over 1,000 in a decade. The article explains how each state's plan fees related to the volume of assets managed; New York could charge as little as 17 basis points due to its massive 13.2 billion in assets, while Alabama with assets of 164 million charged 30 basis points. Nonetheless, there is a silver-lining; with the entire industry's assets growing from 166 billion to 187 billion in a year, states have more leverage to negotiate better terms with money managers. In conclusion, the article serves as a call to action, urging citizens to push their state officials for better negotiations with the aim of lowering college savings plan fees, ultimately benefiting their future college children."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Previous studies have indicated that toll-like receptor (TLR) mRNA is present in sinonasal mucosa, and levels of TLR9 expression are decreased in recalcitrant CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). However, the cellular source and function of TLR9 in the sinonasal epithelium is not known. In this study, primary epithelial cell cultures were analyzed from control subjects and CRSwNP patients to determine the presence and function of TLR9 protein.', 'Primary epithelial cell cultures were established from 5 controls and 10 CRSwNP patients undergoing sinus surgery. Flow cytometry was used to confirm purity of epithelial cells and to assess expression of TLR9 protein. Epithelial cells were stimulated with TLR9 agonist, and mRNA was analyzed by real-time PCR for expression of human beta-defensin (HBD) 2 and interleukin (IL)-8.', 'Flow cytometry showed TLR9 protein in 100% of epithelial cells from controls and CRSwNP patients.

Bugs Bunny is underneath the podium drinking carrot juice when Sam makes a pledge to make good on his previous promise \\"to rid this country of every last rabbit\\" if elected. Bugs then decides he needs to fight against Sam by running against him for mayor. Bugs proceeds to quickly try and win the townspeople over with Theodore Roosevelt's famous \\"I speak softly, but I carry a BIG stick!\\" quote, even dressing up like Roosevelt. However, Sam declares \\"I speak LOUD and I carry a BIGGER stick, and I use it too!\\" (When watching this on The Bugs Bunny Show, Daffy Duck says \\"I speak medium, and I carry the BIGGEST stick.)

He sends a boxful of \\"assorted\\" picnic ants to steal all of the food at Bugs' picnic, to which Bugs hides a dynamite stick in a watermelon for him.

A coroner has criticised the Ministry of Defence for a series of failures which led to the deaths of two soldiers in a fire as they slept at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan. Privates Dean Hutchinson, 23, and Robert Wood, 28 - plus one survivor - were sleeping in a tented office so they could respond more quickly when vital supplies arrived. But in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2011 witnesses could smell smoke and went out to see flames engulfing the air-conditioned canvas unit. Tragic: Privates Dean Hutchinson, 23 (left), and Robert Wood, 28 (right), died in the fire on February 14, 2011. Today David Ridley, Wiltshire and Swindon Coroner, condemned a string of 'contributory factors' to the deaths - including a broken fire alarm. The MoD now has 56 days to reply in writing with details of actions that have been taken to prevent future similar deaths. Pte Wood, known as Woody, had become a. father to a boy, Noah, shortly before he died. He was a driver port. operator, posted to 17 Port and Maritime Regiment, and lived in. Hampshire. Pte Hutchinson, from County Durham, was a driver and had seven years’ service with the Army. The inquest heard that both senior. commanders and fire safety officers did not know the soldiers were. sleeping on duty during night shifts at the base in Helmand Province. Witnesses described struggling to get hold of emergency services when they saw the Transport Troop unit was ablaze. Private Sikeli Ratu, who was woken by. the smell of smoke, fled the canvas tent to raise the alarm but soldiers at the scene did not know the emergency 222 number. He told the court he. could hear Pte Hutchinson calling his name. By. the time firefighters arrived at the scene, the blaze had taken hold of. the tent, with flames approximately 3ft high and only the metal tent. poles remaining of the structure. They had been sleeping in the canvas tent in Camp Bastion (pictured) to be closer to vital supplies being delivered. Fire. investigators have concluded that the blaze started in the vicinity of. the electrical appliances - including a 32in flat-screen TV, boiler and fridge, and a nearby air conditioning unit. The fire quickly spread, igniting combustible. materials stored nearby, the court heard. Recording a narrative conclusion, Mr Ridley listed the seven errors that led to the deaths of Pte Hutchinson and Pte Wood:. 'The. systemic failure by the chain of command to communicate the occurrence. of sleeping on duties at night to key personnel, such as the unit fire. safety officer, as safety measures associated with this practice to all. Transport Troop personnel. 'The failure to police the occurrence of sleeping on duties at night through the use of random checks. 'The. failure to effectively check the working functionality of the nine-volt. smoke detector located inside the tent where the fire started,. resulting in it not being in working order at the time of the fire. 'The. systemic failure to provide effective training, especially to fire. NCOs, to identify the potential risk of the overloading of sockets and. extension blocks. The MoD now has 56 days to make or plan measures to prevent future similar deaths of soldiers. 'The. failure to rectify the error in the December 2010 fire risk assessment,. when it became known that sleeping was taking place within the tent in. December 2010. 'The failure to request a fresh fire risk assessment following the structural alterations that took place in January 2011. 'The absence of the Transport Troop tent from the theatre asset register.' The court heard senior officers were not certain who was responsible for checking the smoke detectors in the Transport Troop tent. It also emerged senior officers were not certain who was responsible for checking the smoke detectors in the Transport Troop tent. The rear of the Transport Troop tent was not permanently sealed and could be opened by unzipping the fire retardant inner lining and undoing the toggles to the canvas door. But the rear door to the adjacent Quartermaster’s tent was tied up tightly and also padlocked, the inquest was told. Since the tragedy a number of changes have been made by the Ministry of Defence and Army to improve safety for troops using tents.

Summarize the following: Using your phone will also help you ignore almost anyone. There are a few things you can do to ignore someone with your phone. First, you can just use the phone to look busy whenever you see that person. Talk to someone else on the phone, laughing wildly, or look engrossed in an intense text-message exchange with someone you actually want to talk to.  Change your phone number so the person can't call or text you. Block that person's number from your phone so you can't receive messages from them. Set an alarm on your phone to ring when you know you're near that person, so you can pick it up and pretend to be talking to someone. Invest in some headphones, and wear them at all times when you're alone, even if you're not listening to music. When you see that person, blast your music to deafening volumes and bounce your head to the beat, so you look completely absorbed in your tunes, with absolutely no time to waste on the person you're trying to ignore. If you want to be really annoying, you can even close your eyes and sing along to the music, giving the person you're ignoring almost no chance to talk to you. Ignoring someone online is even easier than ignoring them in person because you don't have to physically avoid them. To ignore someone online, just make sure to avoid any of that person's emails, Facebook posts or messages, Twitter feeds, or any other attempts to contact you online.  Block that person from any of your social networks. Make sure he has no way of reaching out to you online. Change your email address and other usernames if you have to. That person should have no way of contacting you online.","output":"When you want to ignore someone, you can use your phone to help.

Speculation was rife last week when an Apple-owned car was spotted driving around California fitted with Street View-style cameras.

Scroll down for video A unnamed Apple employee has hinted that the tech giant is developing a vehicle as part of a project that 'will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.' The email was sent to Business Insider. It followed sightings of an Apple-owned car fitted with cameras (pictured) in California 'Unfortunately for that theory, only six companies have been issued the permits necessary to test such vehicles, and","output":"Apple is not one of them. However, it is possible that the tech giant is operating under a subsidiary or a different name in order to keep its activities discreet. Moreover, California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) recently revealed that it has been in discussions with Apple about \\"autonomous vehicle testing,\\" though no formal permits have been granted yet. This adds to mounting evidence that Apple is indeed working on its own electric or autonomous vehicle. If Apple is entering the automotive market, it's likely doing so with an ambitious and innovative plan. Apple's reputation for groundbreaking design and technological expertise suggests that any vehicle it develops could be a significant contender in the electric or autonomous vehicle market. Furthermore, the company has a history of disrupting established markets, as seen with the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. Rumors of an Apple car project, codenamed \\"Project Titan,\\" have been circulating for years. According to multiple reports, the company has hired hundreds of engineers and automotive experts to work on the project. In addition, Apple CEO Tim Cook has hinted in interviews at the company's interest in transportation, stating that \\"autonomous systems can be used in a variety of ways, and a vehicle is only one.\\" Other potential uses for the car-mounted cameras could be related to advances in location tracking or augmented reality. Apple's recent acquisition of AR startup Metaio, as well as the introduction of its ARKit software, indicate that the company is seriously pursuing augmented reality technology. These cameras may be used to gather detailed street-level data that could be integrated into future AR applications or other mapping services. Whatever the ultimate purpose of the Apple-owned car and its mysterious cameras, it's clear that the tech giant is exploring new avenues and possibly entering new markets. If Apple does pursue an electric or autonomous vehicle, it could have a significant impact on the competitive landscape of the automotive industry and potentially challenge Tesla's position as the leading innovator in electric vehicles. In any case, Apple's entry into this space is sure to ignite significant interest and speculation, as the world awaits the potential emergence of another game-changing product from the tech powerhouse."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You can't guarantee that you will always succeed, but you can take charge of how you feel. Whether you are at work, at school, playing sports, or in any other kind of competitive environment, focus on showing good character. Choose from:  *Show that you genuinely care about the people you care about. The best examples of good character include perseverance, professionalism, honesty, hard work, and kindness.;  *Be proud of others' efforts and your own, no matter who comes out on top. For instance : Be a good sport.;  *The more you ignore criticism, the more you give yourself valuable opportunities to improve. Respond to any criticism with unchallenged assertiveness or self-assurance, and always be friendly.;  *The more you present an impressive image, the more competitive you will be in both life and work. If the competition becomes too overwhelming to handle, you may need to talk with an employee at work about setting some ground rules.; Answer:","output":"Dealing with competition is a challenging yet integral part of life. There are several strategies that can prove useful in developing a well-rounded approach to handle competition effectively.  Firstly, demonstrating grace in the face of competition is critical. Instead of allowing the fear of losing get the better of you, aim to focus on your strength and determination. This idea is about taking charge of your emotions and reactions, which can significantly impact your overall performance. One of the most important facets of good character is showing genuine care for those you are competing against. It's crucial to shift your perspective from seeing others simply as rivals to recognizing them as individuals. When you are able to appreciate their aspirations and hard work, it cultivates a more positive and supportive environment. Examples of good character, like perseverance, honesty, and professionalism, can not only enhance your competitive spirit but also earn respect from others. Be proud of your own efforts, but also applaud the efforts of your competitors. This mindset of sportsmanship is highly appreciated in any competitive environment. It's not always about winning or losing; sometimes what truly counts is the effort put forth and the lessons learned. Criticism is another facet of competition that requires special attention. Instead of ignoring criticism, consider it as a valuable opportunity for improvement. Respond to criticism with assertiveness and self-assurance which shows your resilience and capacity to grow. Moreover, always maintain a cordial and friendly demeanor to foster healthier competitive relationships. Lastly, presenting an impressive image can project an aura of confidence that sets you apart from the competition. This can be especially beneficial in the workspace, where portraying a professional image can help you to excel. If the competition becomes too overwhelming, it might be good to discuss with a higher-up about setting some understandable ground rules. This can help create a balance, fostering an environment that is competitive yet manageable. So, to conclude, dealing with competition requires a healthy balance of perseverance, professionalism, kindness, and an assertive yet friendly demeanor. It's about maintaining grace under pressure, acknowledging others' efforts, accepting criticism for self-improvement, projecting a confident image and, when required, setting effective ground rules to manage extreme competition. With these strategies, not only can you navigate through competitive situations, but you can also emerge wiser, stronger, and more resilient."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Alexander \\"Alexx\\" Wesselsky (born 18 November 1968) is the lead singer of the German band Eisbrecher. He is best known for his 10-year tenure as the former lead singer of the band Megaherz, from 1993 to 2003.  - Hardcore punk (often abbreviated to hardcore) is a punk rock music genre that originated in the late 1970s. It is generally faster, harder, and more aggressive than other forms of punk rock. Its roots can be traced to earlier punk scenes in San Francisco and Southern California which arose as a reaction against the still predominant hippie cultural climate of the time and was also inspired by New York punk rock and early proto-punk. New York punk had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the established music industry and \\"anything similar to the characteristics of mainstream rock\\" and often addresses social and political topics.  - The Deutsche Alternative Charts (often referred to as DAC) is the primary record chart for Germany's alternative music scene. The charts cover genres ranging nu metal to Britpop, from rock music to alternative electronic. Established in 1997, the DAC rankings are generated by a weekly poll of 350 representatively selected DJs and trend dealers.  - An icebreaker is a special-purpose ship or boat designed to move and navigate through ice-covered waters, and provide safe waterways for other boats and ships. Although the term usually refers to ice-breaking ships, it may also refer to smaller vessels, such as the icebreaking boats that were once used on the canals of the United Kingdom.  - Jochen \\"Noel Pix\\" Seibert (March 25, 1972 in Munich, West Germany) is a German rock and house musician. Pix has a German father and a German mother. He is the lead guitarist and programmer of the German Neue Deutsche Härte band Eisbrecher. Pix formerly belonged also to the band Megaherz as the band's keyboardist. He releases his house tracks under the alias \\"Housemaster Kinky J\\". Noel Pix sings the German translations of theme songs for anime series like Pokémon, Digimon or Dragon Ball Z. He had one hit in the German, Austrian, and Swiss singles chart: The theme song for the second season of Pokémon (\\"Pokémon Welt\\") peaked at No.50 in Germany, No.30 in Austria, and No.49 in Switzerland.  - KMFDM (originally Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid, \\"loosely\\" translated by the band as \\"no pity for the majority\\") is an industrial band led by German multi-instrumentalist Sascha Konietzko, who founded the group in 1984 as a performance art project.  - Godflesh are an English industrial metal band from Birmingham. They were formed in 1988 by Justin Broadrick (guitar, vocals and programming) and G. C. Green (bass) and disbanded in 2002. Godflesh's innovative music is widely regarded as a foundational influence on industrial metal and post-metal. Broadrick and Green reformed Godflesh in 2010.  - Industrial metal is a musical genre that draws from industrial dance music, thrash metal and hardcore punk, using repeating metal guitar riffs, sampling, synthesizer or sequencer lines, and distorted vocals. Founding industrial metal acts include Ministry, Godflesh, and KMFDM.  - Antikörper (\\"German\\" for \\"Antibodies\\") is the second album of the German band Eisbrecher, released on October 20, 2006. The album debuted on the Media Control Charts at #85 & the Deutsche Alternative Charts at #10.  - Lead guitar is a guitar part which plays melody lines, instrumental fill passages, guitar solos, and occasionally, some riffs within a song structure. The lead is the featured guitar, which usually plays single-note-based lines or double-stops. In rock, heavy metal, blues, jazz, punk, fusion, some pop, and other music styles, lead guitar lines are usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar, which consists of accompaniment chords and riffs.  - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.  - \`\` Leider '' ( German for Regrettably or Sufferings ) is the first single from German industrial metal group Eisbrecher from their Antikörper album . On 22 August 2006 a double - single \`\` Leider / Vergissmeinnicht '' was released in the US . It combines both of Eisbrecher singles from their second album .  - Neue Deutsche Härte (\\"abbrev:\\" NDH) is a subgenre of rock music.

The declaration of a specific year, like the year 2010 in this case, as the 'European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion', essentially tends to spotlight and bring a stronger focus on these problems, making it a focal point for initiating and implementing measures across the Union to deal with the crisis. However, the speaker believes that if Member States could proactively and independently ramp up their efforts in dealing effectively with poverty and social exclusion, there wouldn't be a requirement for the European Union to resort to the measure of highlighting a special year to tackle these issues. The idea is to encourage the Member States to handle these critical social crises with utmost priority, through their own initiatives and requisite actions that remain aligned with the EU's overall principles and guidelines. The notion underscores the urgency required in addressing such EU-wide problems without having to wait for a specific event or occasion to incite action.

She grew up in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey, a township with over 40,000 residents in 2010, but approximately 5,000 when she was in elementary school. Her elementary school consisted of two rooms, with a single teacher for each room. One room housed the first through third grades, while the other room was for the fourth through sixth grades. Rene Muth, later to become Rene Portland, the long-time Penn State women's basketball coach, was on each of the championship teams. Her father owned a hardware store, and provided some buckets which some of the parents and the nuns, banged on with wooden dowels to make noise. This was the beginning of the Bucket Brigade. The team still wore pleated tunics and Chuck Taylor Converse sneakers. Some teams wore tunics, while others wore shorts. The Immaculata team wore tunics until the end of the 1973 season, then switched to a two piece blouse and skirt.  The Immaculata team again won all their regular season games in the 72-73 season, and earned a spot in the National Tournament. This year, the tournament was hosted by Queens College in New York, making travel easier. The first round game was against Florida State, which Immaculata won 59-48. The quarter-finals match was against Western Washington, which they won 66-53. They moved on to play their third game in two days in the semi-final against Southern Connecticut, one of the premier teams of that era. Southern Connecticut had a twelve-point lead with three minutes to go in the game. The Macs fought back and took the lead, only to have Southern Connecticut tie the game with 26 seconds remaining. Marianne Crawford, the freshman guard for Immaculata, put up a shot, but it was coming off the rim. Theresa Shank saw it, and tipped it in as the buzzer sounded for the two point win, 47-45.  The win set up the championship between Immaculata and Queens, playing on the Queens home court. The venue had a seating capacity of 3,000, Some thought the 1972 run had been a fluke, but the repeat performance was convincing fans the Immaculata team was very good. In the championship game, the final score of 59-52 is consistent with a reasonably close game, but the score was 59-37 in the fourth quarter when Rush pulled her starters and the bench players allowed the Queens team to score 15 consecutive points. The win completed the first undefeated season in US college women's basketball history, and the second consecutive National Championship for Immaculata.  The Immaculata team went on to win an unprecedented third consecutive championship in the 1974 tournament.

Here is a question about this article: Instructions are also embedded in fonts to tell the operating system how to properly output different character sequences. A simple solution to the placement of combining marks or diacritics is assigning the marks a width of zero and placing the glyph itself to the left or right of the left sidebearing (depending on the direction of the script they are intended to be used with). A mark handled this way will appear over whatever character precedes it, but will not adjust its position relative to the width or height of the base glyph; it may be visually awkward and it may overlap some glyphs. Real stacking is impossible, but can be approximated in limited cases (for example, Thai top-combining vowels and tone marks can just be at different heights to start with).

Here is a news article: The transformational issue in this campaign might not be healthcare, or the economy, or immigration, but Bain Capital, says the New York Times – in a surprised acknowledgment that the private equity firm that Mitt Romney helped found is proving to be a powerful weapon against him.      The Bain attacks are, so far, the most controversial Obama campaign strategy, derided by many Democratic pros and insiders. Theirs is a simple analysis: populist attacks seldom work for the Democrats (curiously, they tend to work well for the Republicans); private equity is an issue too complicated to gain lasting attention; it's silly to offend the financial community, which provides so much support to the Democrats, over a low-return issue.      This last point is causing the most head-shaking within the party. Particularly in the wake of the eruption by Obama partisan, Newark Mayor Cory Booker, in which he characterized the anti-Bain campaign as nauseating: why bite the hand that feeds you?      Indeed, part of the great generational shift of party identification and loyalty has been the movement of the Republican party away from Wall Street and to social interest groups, and the movement of the Democrats from their traditional labor roots to a new home among the financial Medicis. In ways large and small, the Democrats, during the historic Clinton-led stockmarket surge, became the party of Goldman Sachs. Obama may have incurred the wrath of rich (and wakadoo) Republican outliers – the Koch brothers, for instance – but (at least, up until now) he and the Democratic party have had a firm hold on that once rock-ribbed Republican club, the eastern financial establishment.      And while this new alignment gave the Democrats vast resources, it also, in ways large and small, confused its message. The Democrats became the snob party, the haughty party, the yuppie party, while the Republicans, remarkably, became the salt-of-the-earth lot. George Bush, from as rock-ribbed a family as anyone has ever been, somehow turned into an everyman.      Part of the Democrats' inability to make the financial meltdown its own issue is caused by its own deep ambivalence and profound conflict of interest when it comes to the financial industry: many senior administration officials expect to leave office and get jobs, and make personal fortunes, in the institutions that might otherwise be blamed, and even indicted, for the present mess.      But then, in another staggering reversal, the Republicans end up with Mitt Romney – Mitt Romney! – a figure straight out of the Republicans' long-ago, country-club, preppy, pink-pants, stockbroker era, as their certain nominee. Mitt Romney is the unreconstructed George Bush.      Romney is such a vivid caricature that he resets the cultural timeline of both parties. We're back before it all got confused – before the great liquidity that began in the 1980s made a significant part of the voting public believe their self-interest lay in asset appreciation (of real estate, stocks, options, shadow equity, art, whatever).      Before that – say, before Ronald Reagan – the world was a much simpler place. There was a rarified group (the 1%, if you will) that we understood to represent capital; and the rest of us, who were not owners and whose future who was not tied to asset appreciation, who got a pay check.      One of the notable developments of the modern postwar, 1950s, 60s, 70s era is the detente that had largely grown up between these two groups: capital got its fair reward and so did labor. Then, in the postmodern era, the balance dramatically shifted to capital. This happened in part because so many more people had come to believe, illusorily or not, that they were capital.      But suddenly, the music stopped and, in something of a sight gag, Mitt Romney was left standing. There can hardly be a more perfect reminder than Romney and Bain of the stark divide between capital and the rest of us. It is not even that they are so bad, but that it is just so hard to identify with them. Few people are ever going to confuse themselves with Mitt Romney.      When you personalize the story with Romney and Bain, it's easy to see that that a particular group of people make their money differently than the rest of us. There is really no disguising the paramount point about private equity – not least of all because private equity has never seen much reason to disguise it: its reason for being is exclusively to benefit its shareholders.      Indeed, after the great liquidity revolution, this became the operating principle of capital everywhere. We are in it for ourselves but, with a little hocus pocus, if we benefit, you will benefit, too. The rich get richer and so does everybody else – so it seemed.      Except, obviously, we now know that is not true. Only Mitt and friends are rich.      Saying as much, the Obama-led attacks on Mitt and Bain can easily seem simplistic and crude and, also, upsetting to anyone who has a capital stake. This is why Cory Booker, ever-cultivating wealthy benefactors (and being cultivated by them, too), is sickened by the reductiveness of it all, and why Mitt Romney is raising so much cash. This is turning the presidential election into a referendum on the financial establishment and its worldview … and its personality, its vibe, and its look.      And what if it works? What if Romney, hopelessly characterized as out-of-step with the modern world, loses? What if Bain becomes a famous punchline? Can there really be a reset? What if Obama, a muddle of conflicting messages, successfully argues the point he, and more and more of the world, seem to be groping for: the brief elevation of shareholder interest above all else is over. That anomalous moment in history has passed. Now, we need to return to a new, old model of stakeholders, wherein everybody's interest, employees, vendors, community, as well as shareholders, are represented.      Somewhere in this argument, Mitt Romney becomes a curious relic of our weird and disappearing time. ||||| Propelled by a torrent of blistering television advertisements, President Obama is successfully invoking Mitt Romney ’s career at Bain Capital to raise questions about his commitment to the middle class, strategists in both parties say, as the candidates engage in a critical summer duel to set the terms for this fall.      Despite doubts among some Democrats about the wisdom of attacking Mr. Romney’s business career, Obama commercials painting him as a ruthless executive who pursued profits at the expense of jobs are starting to make an impact on some undecided voters, according to strategists from both sides, who differ on whether they are causing any substantial damage.      While the sense of worry and alarm that has hung over the White House for weeks is dissipating, and with his supporters relieved by the Supreme Court decision on Thursday to uphold most of his health care law, Mr. Obama faces new challenges before the conventions at the end of the summer.      People close to the Romney campaign say it could close its June fund-raising books having collected an additional 100 million, possibly more, a tally that would exceed all expectations and further extend the overall Republican financial advantage in the race.      With that cash influx, Mr. Romney’s team is preparing a new advertising campaign that will aggressively portray Mr. Obama as a craven political figure, rather than the transformative leader he pledged he would be.      They began that effort in the past several days with a new ad that uses video of Hillary Rodham Clinton lashing out at Mr. Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary campaign as spending “millions of dollars perpetuating falsehoods.” Aides said they were considering more ads with Mrs. Clinton or her husband criticizing Mr. Obama.      “He’s just another politician,” Matt Rhoades, the campaign manager for Mr. Romney, said in an interview. “He’s not the Barack Obama of the last campaign.”      And Mr. Obama’s aides acknowledged that whatever they do, they still must contend with a troubled economy, with monthly reminders in the unemployment and job creation reports, the next of which comes out on Friday.      Mr. Romney’s aides said in interviews that their strategy depended on keeping their candidate close to Mr. Obama in the polls until at least the Republican convention at the end of August. They hope to begin to pull away then with a relentless case that Mr. Obama has not been up to the job of fixing the economy — and that Mr. Romney has the experience and the knowledge to lead the nation to recovery.      They have studiously avoided getting drawn into what they have called side issues. And at times they have limited Mr. Romney’s media appearances, even after the health care decision, which conservatives believe will help motivate voters who now see electing Mr. Romney as the only chance of undoing the law.      But Mr. Romney’s strategy of avoiding clashes on issues other than the economy and minimizing his risks — he has no public events scheduled until at least the Fourth of July — is starting to draw criticism even from some fellow Republicans, who are urging him to take more specific stands and set out a more positive agenda.      Mr. Obama, by contrast, has put other big issues in front of the nation on his terms, most notably same-sex marriage and illegal immigration, displaying the advantages of incumbency, energizing crucial voting groups and moving public attention at least temporarily away from jobs.      But even as they have tried to expand the playing field of issues, Mr. Obama’s aides said they would not let up on their efforts to challenge the core of Mr. Romney’s campaign, his claim to be a better economic manager.      “We’ve got to make sure people fully appreciate Mitt Romney is not some safe alternative,” said David Plouffe, a senior adviser to the president.      To drive home that point over the past few weeks, Mr. Obama has gone on an advertising binge, spending more than 12 million during a single week in mid-June, according to a Republican group that monitors advertising spending.      According to the independent media tracking firm CMAG, between early April and late June Mr. Obama spent at least 40 million and Mr. Romney at least 10 million, with outside groups like Crossroads GPS and Restore Our Future making up the difference for him.      The latest advertisement against Mr. Romney has been criticized by independent fact-checkers as incorrectly calling Mr. Romney a corporate raider and unfairly alleging that he “shipped jobs to China and Mexico.”      Mr. Obama’s acute focus on Bain has drawn complaints from Democrats, including high-profile surrogates like Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark, who said in May that he found the attacks nauseating. And even as the liberal “super PAC” Priorities USA Action joined the attack with similar ads, some Democrats said they had concluded that the attacks were not working anyway. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The article discusses how Bain Capital, a private equity firm co-founded by Mitt Romney, has become a powerful weapon against him in the political campaign. It highlights the controversy surrounding the Obama campaign's strategy to attack Romney's ties to Bain Capital. Despite concerns within the Democratic party that attacking Romney's business career could backfire, Obama's ads portraying Romney as a ruthless executive who pursued profit at the expense of jobs are starting to make an impact on undecided voters. The article also notes that the Romney campaign's fundraising efforts have exceeded expectations, allowing them to mount a counter-offensive advertising campaign portraying Obama as just another politician who failed to live up to his promises.

Willow town used hardwoods, while Pine town used softwoods.  Which town used more conifers to make paper? A:","output":"Pine town used more conifers to make paper, and I'll explain why in detail below. To better understand this, let us first delve into the characteristics of hardwoods and softwoods, as well as conifers. Hardwoods are derived from angiosperm trees, which are usually deciduous and broad-leaved trees. These trees include oak, maple, beech, walnut, and mahogany, among others. Hardwoods are known for their dense and closely packed cell structure, making them strong, heavy, and durable. They are typically used for furniture, flooring, and construction purposes. On the other hand, softwoods come from gymnosperm trees, which are mostly evergreen and coniferous. Some common softwood species are pine, spruce, cedar, and fir. Softwoods have a less dense cell structure compared to hardwoods, making them lighter and more flexible. They are commonly used for framing, paneling, and paper manufacturing. Now, conifers are a group of trees that possess needle-like leaves and produce cones. The majority of conifers are evergreen, and most of them fall under the category of softwoods. Given their nature, conifers are a reliable source for the production of paper, as they contain long cellulose fibers and relatively low lignin content, allowing for easier and better-quality paper production. Returning to the towns in question, Pine town used softwoods for their lumber, while Willow town used hardwoods. Since conifers fall under the category of softwoods and are a popular choice for paper production, Pine town would have used more conifers to produce paper than Willow town. Willow town's focus on hardwoods, derived from deciduous trees, makes them a less suitable source for paper production, emphasizing even further that Pine town used more conifers for this purpose."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question: Some times I have trouble expressing myself, but I use clothing, sometimes even ugly clothing as a form of this.  Here are possible answers to this question: - fun - fashion - pain - communication - embarrassment  I believe the correct choice is \\"communication\\", here's why: A:","output":"When faced with the question of why someone uses clothing, particularly ugly clothing, as a form of self-expression, the potential answers provided are: fun, fashion, pain, communication, and embarrassment. Step 1: Analyze each possible answer to see if it relates to the concept of self-expression through clothing. - Fun: Could be a reason for choosing unusual clothing, but it doesn't directly relate to the concept of self-expression. - Fashion: May be a general description of clothing choice, yet it doesn't necessarily explain why someone might wear ugly clothing to express themselves. - Pain: Unlikely to be a reason for choosing clothing for self-expression, as it doesn't typically relate to clothing. - Communication: This clearly links to self-expression, as communication can be an outward demonstration of someone's thoughts, feelings, or ideas, often presented through different mediums. - Embarrassment: May be a result of someone's clothing choice, but it doesn't directly address the purpose of self-expression through ugly clothing. Step 2: Identify the most relevant answer to the question. Of the given options, \\"communication\\" appears to be the most directly related to the concept of using clothing, particularly ugly clothing, as a form of self-expression. Conclusion: Therefore, I agree that the correct choice is \\"communication.\\" This is because communication, as a means of conveying one's thoughts, feelings, or ideas, is strongly related to the concept of self-expression through clothing. It makes sense that a person might use unique or unusual clothing as a way to communicate their identity, emotions, or personality to others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Returning to his assistant Watson in secret, Holmes notes that all the victims were wealthy gamblers, so disguised as \\"Rajni Singh\\", a distinguished Indian officer, he stalks London's gaming clubs. It is not long before he encounters the villain of the piece, Adrea  Spedding. Holmes discovers that she seeks out men short of money, persuades them to pawn their life insurance policies with her accomplices, then kills them. Holmes sets himself up as her next victim, discovering that she uses the deadly spider, Lycosa Carnivora, whose venom causes such excruciating pain that the victims kill themselves. Holmes also finds the footprint of a child nearby. Searching for evidence Holmes and Watson visit eminent arachnologist Matthew Ordway, who may have supplied the deadly creatures. Holmes soon realizes that the man he is speaking to is an impostor, but the villain makes his escape. Searching the premises, Holmes finds the corpse of the real Ordway, as well as his journals, which allude to something or someone from Central Africa immune to the spider venom. This baffles Holmes until he finds the model skeleton of a child. However, Dr. Watson points out that the relation of the skull and the circumference of the chest prove it is not a child, and Holmes deduces that the Central African thing described in the journal is a pygmy. Holmes and Watson continue their investigations at a nearby fairground, where Holmes allows himself to fall into the clutches of Spedding and her gang. Bound and gagged, Holmes is tied behind a moving target in a shooting gallery, at which Lestrade and Watson take pot shots with a  .22 rifle.

Does it follow that \\"Tuppence said that she would eat it if it were frozen first. \\"?","output":"No, the statement \\"Then I shan't drink it, said Tuppence firmly\\" does not directly imply that \\"Tuppence said that she would eat it if it were frozen first.\\" Let's analyze the text in more detail to better understand what Tuppence is actually saying. The character Tuppence is expressing her determination and decision not to drink something. The use of the word \\"shan't\\" – a contraction of \\"shall not\\" – emphasizes that she is firm about her decision and not likely to change her mind about it. We can infer that she might be talking about a beverage or some liquid substance that she finds objectionable or unsuitable for consumption. However, it is not possible to tell what exactly this substance is or why she refuses to drink it from the given text. Moving on to the second statement, \\"Tuppence said that she would eat it if it were frozen first,\\" it suggests a very different situation. The central idea here is that Tuppence would be willing to consume the substance in question if it were turned into a frozen state. This implies a specific condition that must be met before Tuppence will consider consuming the item. The focus here is on the state change of the substance, from liquid to frozen. The original text does not mention this condition or any willingness on Tuppence's part to eat the substance if it were frozen first. Instead, she simply states that she will not drink it. It is possible that the two statements could be related in a broader context, with further information or dialogue connecting them. However, when considered solely within the context of the provided sentence, it does not follow that Tuppence's statement implies her willingness to eat the substance under different conditions. In summary, without more context, we cannot assume that the given text implies Tuppence would eat the referred substance if it were frozen first. All we can deduce from the original sentence is that Tuppence has firmly decided not to drink something, and the reason for her decision is not provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the following list of characters into a correctly formed sentence: Itrequiresthatthephenomenaofconsciousnessbeapproachedwithoutconjectureandthatthelawsofconnectionbeinductivelyestablished.","output":"In the study of cognitive science, it requires that the phenomena of consciousness be approached without conjecture, from a purely objective standpoint, and that the laws of connection between cognitive processes and their external manifestations be inductively established, firmly based on systematic observation and empirical data rather than speculative theories. To better understand this concept, let's break it down into simpler terms. What this essentially means is this: when investigating the phenomena surrounding consciousness - the state of being awake and aware of one's surroundings, thoughts, and feelings - it is crucial to proceed without conjecture. In other words, scientists tasked with this kind of exploration must not make assumptions or form conclusions without having solid proof or evidence to support these claims. In this manner, an objective approach must be enforced to eliminate any bias that might skew the results. Besides approaching these phenomena without conjecture, it is equally important that the laws of connection are inductively established. By 'laws of connection', this refers to the principles that govern the relationship between the observable manifestations of consciousness and the underlying cognitive processes that cause these manifestations. For instance, a person might exhibit certain behaviors when they're experiencing particular thoughts or feelings. The principles that dictate these relationships are what we refer to as the laws of connection. To 'inductively establish' these laws means to derive them systematically from empirical data - observational and experimental results gleaned from rigorous scientific methods. Scientists should base these laws on evidence and ensure they are not merely speculative but are grounded on confirmed findings. Inductive reasoning, in this case, is vital because it allows researchers to make broad generalizations based on specific observations. For instance, if a particular cognitive process consistently leads to a specific kind of behavior in a wide range of individuals, researchers can use inductive reasoning to establish a law of connection that links that process to that behavior. In conclusion, the meticulous study of consciousness demands a substantial level of academic rigidity, hinting at the complexity of the human mind and its processes. Both the approach to the phenomena of consciousness and the establishment of the laws connecting these processes and their manifestations need to be handled with utmost care, eliminating conjecture and firmly anchoring on evidence-based inductive reasoning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both species are searching for Selene: the vampires seek justice for the death of Viktor, while the Lycans, led by Marius, intend to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids. Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted clemency and to train the coven's neophyte Death Dealers. She asks Thomas to plead Selene's case before the full council; the plea is successful and the council reluctantly agrees to a pardon in exchange for Selene's help. Selene arrives with David.

Q: If I tell you that If food is not immediately used in the body for heat then that food is stored in the body for future use, and ask you the question \\"when food is not immediately used for what it is stored in the body?\\", is the correct answer \\"fats\\"? A:","output":"The correct answer is not solely \\"fats,\\" although fats do contribute to the storage of excess energy in the body. When the body has more energy from food than it immediately needs to carry out different bodily functions, it stores the excess energy in various forms for future use, such as glycogen and fats (lipids). These stored forms of energy can be utilized by the body when there is an energy deficit, such as during periods of prolonged exercise or fasting. First, let's discuss glycogen, a multi-branched polysaccharide of glucose that serves as a form of energy storage in the body. Glycogen is primarily stored in the liver and muscles and can be readily broken down into glucose when the body requires a quick source of energy. Glycogen storage is limited, so when the capacity is reached, any further excess glucose is converted into fats. Fats, or lipids, are one of the three main classes of macronutrients, alongside carbohydrates and proteins. Fats are stored in the body in the form of molecules called triglycerides. Triglycerides are a key component of adipose tissue and represent the body's long-term energy reserve. When the body needs energy and glycogen stores have been depleted, it begins to break down stored triglycerides into glycerol and free fatty acids, which can be used for energy production. In addition, when food is not used immediately for energy, the body may also store some of the proteins that we consume. Proteins, though not the preferred source of energy in the body, can still be converted to glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis when energy needs are high and carbohydrate or lipid stores are not sufficient. This typically occurs during extended periods of energy deficit, like fasting or intense exercise. However, the body first attempts to utilize glycogen and lipids for energy before resorting to muscle protein breakdown. In conclusion, when food is not used immediately, the excess energy is stored in the body primarily as glycogen and fats (lipids), and occasionally as proteins. These stored energy sources serve as reserves that help the body maintain its energy balance and provide necessary fuel to support various body processes, growth, and physical activity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They believe that God is all-knowing, all-powerful, and present everywhere. 2. Jesus Christ - They believe that Jesus Christ is God's son, the first of God's creations, and that he played a key role in the creation of the universe. They reject the concept of the Holy Trinity and believe that Jesus is not God but God's only-begotten Son. Jesus' life on earth serves as an example and model for their own lives. 3. Salvation - Jehovah's Witnesses believe that salvation is dependent upon faith in God's promises as revealed in the Bible, obedience to God's laws, and dedication to serving him. They actively engage in evangelism and outreach activities to spread the message of God's Kingdom, taking their cue from Jesus' commandment in Matthew 28:19-20. 4. God's Kingdom - One of their core beliefs is that God established a heavenly government, and Jesus Christ returned to earth invisibly in 1914 to rule over this kingdom. They believe that in the near future, God will establish a paradise on earth, and only Jehovah's Witnesses will survive the destruction of the wicked while the righteous will live forever on a renewed and perfect earth. 5. Baptism - Jehovah's Witnesses practice water baptism by complete immersion for those who wish to become members of the faith. To qualify for baptism, the person must demonstrate a deep understanding of their teachings and display a commitment to live by those teachings. 6. Moral Code - Jehovah's Witnesses observe a strict moral code, including abstinence from premarital sex, adultery, and homosexuality. They also refrain from behaviors that they consider offensive to God, such as practicing other religions, using idols, lying, stealing, or engaging in violence. 7. Observances and Holidays - Jehovah's Witnesses observe the Memorial of Jesus Christ's death (also called the Lord's Evening Meal) annually, which is the only religious observance they take part in. They abstain from celebrating holidays, such as Christmas, Easter, and birthdays, viewing these events as having pagan origins or as promoting self-centeredness. 8. Blood Transfusions - They have a strict stance on blood transfusions, believing that accepting blood from another person is a violation of God's command found in the Bible. This includes whole blood, red cells, white cells, platelets, and plasma; however, they do accept some blood fractions. Understanding Jehovah's Witnesses beliefs can provide context for their customs, practices, and lifestyles. While the short answer you found on Google is correct, there is much more to their belief system which distinguishes them from other Christian denominations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You are presented with the quiz \\"What have humans have collected and grown for food for thousands of years?\\"   But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"humans have collected and grown mushrooms for food for thousands of years\\" and \\"mushrooms are also fungi\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","output":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"What have humans have collected and grown for food for thousands of years?\\" would be option v. fungi. The teacher mentioned that humans have collected and grown mushrooms for food for thousands of years, and mushrooms are also classified as fungi. This information narrows down the answer choices and provides a clear link to fungi as a food source that has been utilized by humans throughout history. Fungi, a large and diverse group of organisms, play a crucial role in ecosystems and have been used by humans for various purposes, including food consumption. Some fungi, specifically edible mushrooms, have been a staple in many traditional diets worldwide. They offer a rich source of nutrients including proteins, vitamins, minerals, and fiber, providing numerous health benefits and dietary diversity. The other options listed as possible answers do not directly meet the criteria of the quiz question: i. sunlight - Although sunlight is essential for human life, it is not something that humans collect or grow for food. ii. fungus - Fungus could be considered a relevant answer, but the plural term \\"fungi\\" would be more appropriate as the quiz is asking for a collective term. iii. bread - While humans have been making bread for many years, it's not as directly linked to the hints provided by the teacher as fungi. iv. salmon - While salmon has also been a food source for many years, it does not relate to the hints provided by the teacher. vi. dust - Dust is not a food source collected or grown by humans. vii. plants - While this answer may seem correct, given the hints provided, fungi are a more appropriate choice. viii. edible - This term is too vague to answer the quiz question adequately. In summary, taking into account the hints given by the teacher and understanding the role of fungi in human history and their nutritional value, the best answer to the question \\"What have humans have collected and grown for food for thousands of years?\\" is v. fungi."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a review of a product in the Polish language.

Movie title: Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles Context: In modern-day San Francisco, reporter Daniel Molloy (Christian Slater) interviews Louis de Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt), who claims to be a vampire. Louis begins by describing his human life as a wealthy plantation owner in 1791 Spanish Louisiana. He had lost the will to live following the death of his wife and infant child; one night he is attacked by the vampire Lestat de Lioncourt (Tom Cruise) while drunkenly wandering the waterfront of New Orleans. Lestat senses Louis' dissatisfaction with life and offers to turn him into a vampire. Louis accepts and is transformed, but he rebels against killing humans, drinking animal blood to sustain himself. He is disgusted by Lestat's pleasure in killing and comes to suffer tremendously as a vampire. Louis finally succumbs to his hunger and kills his faithful house slave Yvette (Thandie Newton). Guilt-ridden, he tries to kill himself by setting fire to his house, but Lestat rescues him and they flee. Wandering the streets of New Orleans, amid an outbreak of plague, Louis finds an ill little girl in a house who has not realized her mother is dead. He bites the girl, Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), whom Lestat later transforms into a vampire \\"daughter\\". Lestat hopes that Claudia's transformation will discourage Louis from leaving. As thirty years pass, Claudia matures psychologically but still remains a little girl in appearance. She has become a sadistic killer who closely bonds with Louis. When she finally realizes she will never grow up and have an adult body of her own, thus being trapped in the form of a child forever, she is furious with Lestat and finds herself deeply hating him for making her a vampire. She tricks him into drinking the blood of twin boys she killed by overdosing them with laudanum, knowing that blood from a corpse is fatal to vampires. This weakens him, and she slits his throat. Claudia and Louis dump Lestat's body in a swamp and the two plan a voyage to Europe. However Lestat returns on the night of their departure, having drained the blood of swamp...

Write an article using the following points: Pitbull is an accomplished businessman. His stage name has a meaning. Pitbull has had run-ins with other celebs.","output":"Title: Pitbull: The Accomplished Businessman Behind the Stage Name Introduction Armando Christian Pérez, globally known as Pitbull, is a Grammy-winning artist, entrepreneur, and philanthropist. Since his musical debut in the early 2000s, Pitbull has earned a remarkable reputation in the entertainment industry. In this article, we will delve into the meaning behind his stage name, and how his business acumen transcends beyond music. Moreover, we will explore some of his run-ins with other celebrities and shed light on the personality that the world knows as Pitbull. Pitbull: The Meaning Behind the Name The Miami-born artist adopted the stage name “Pitbull” as a symbol of power, loyalty, and determination. Much like the breed of dog, Pitbull showcases resilience and tenacity in his music and business ventures. In numerous interviews, he has emphasized that adopting this stage name was a deliberate effort to pay tribute to the characteristics of the dog breed – fearless, loyal, and driven. These traits accurately reflect Pitbull's framework in the entertainment industry, which has led him to achieve considerable success. Pitbull as an Accomplished Businessman Pitbull’s business ventures span a myriad of industries, ranging from his top-notch music career to his apparel line, fragrances, radio station, and even a food and beverage venture. One might argue that his most prominent success has been his creation of his record label, Mr. 305 Inc., which has produced hits for many artists and generated substantial revenue. His entrepreneurial spirit also extends to collaborations with world-renowned brands such as Kodak, Norwegian Cruise Lines, and Voli Vodka. His ventures into the food industry include an equity stake in Miami Subs Grill, a fast-food chain with approximately 35 restaurants in Florida, and the global launch of a restaurant called iLov305 in Miami Beach – a testament to his love for his hometown. Furthermore, he co-owns a multicultural marketing agency, 305 Worldwide, that collaborates with major brands to create targeted campaigns for diverse audiences. Aside from his business success, Pitbull's philanthropic efforts have positively impacted many communities. He helped in founding the Sports Leadership and Management (SLAM) Academy, a tuition-free public charter school located in Miami. This institution offers quality education with a sports-centric theme that engages students and prepares them for pursuing degrees in management, marketing, and allied industries. Run-ins with Other Celebrities While Pitbull's amicable demeanor sets him apart within the music industry, he has not been a stranger to confrontations with other celebrities. One notable feud involved rapper Lil Wayne – a short-lived disagreement that began when Lil Wayne openly criticized the Miami Heat, a local basketball team that Pitbull passionately supports. In response, Pitbull released a diss track called \\"Welcome 2 Dade County\\" aimed at Lil Wayne to show support for Miami and his local fans. Despite this altercation, recent collaborations with prominent artists like JLO, Marc Anthony, and Ne-Yo demonstrate that Pitbull continues to maintain healthy relationships within the music community. In conclusion, Pitbull's unwavering entrepreneurial drive, combined with his fierce loyalty and tenacity, perfectly aligns with the meaning behind his stage name. Throughout his career, Pitbull has diversified his portfolio, impacting industries ranging from music to education. While he may have had brief disputes with fellow celebrities, his focus has remained unshaken – to achieve success in business and entertainment while exhibiting loyalty to his beloved hometown, Miami. Today, Pitbull's name represents not just a stage name but a symbol of a powerful and accomplished artist and entrepreneur whose story will continue to inspire future generations."},{"instruction":"Q:Generate a question that has the following answer:  fifteen  for the following movie plot:  In a brief scene in 1964, an aging, overweight Italian American, Jake LaMotta (Robert De Niro), practices a comedy routine. The rest of the film then occurs in flashback. In 1941, LaMotta is in a major boxing match against Jimmy Reeves, where he received his first loss. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). Some time thereafter, Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vikki (Cathy Moriarty) at an open-air swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite the fact that Jake dominates Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson and Joey feels Robinson won only because he was enlisting into the US Army the following week. By 1947, Jake marries Vikki. Jake constantly worries about Vikki having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake's opponent in his next fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colasanto), and Vikki. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vikki approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey speaks with Vikki, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. Como later orders them to apologize, and has Joey tell Jake that if he wants a chance at the championship title, which Como controls, he will have to take a dive first. In a match against Billy Fox, after briefly pummeling his opponent, Jake does not even bother to put up a fight. He is suspended shortly thereafter from the board on suspicion of throwing the fight, though he realizes the error of his judgment when it is too late.

She is broadcasting a live Facebook video.      “Are you going live?” asks her passenger, Dunmore teen Chaniya Morrison-Toomey.      Before Ms. Hughes can answer, more lights flash inside the car, followed by the sounds of screeching tires.      Then blackness.      The live feed captured the last moments before a tractor-trailer plowed into the back of her car.      Ms. Hughes, 18, and Ms. Morrison-Toomey, 19, were declared dead at the scene.      State police investigators said the teens were traveling very slowly in the right lane of I-380 southbound.      The teens were driving with a spare tire doughnut, said Pennsylvania State Trooper Dave Peters, the spokesman for Troop N. State police had initially reported the teens were driving with a flat tire, but it’s unclear if that is true. The fiery wreck badly damaged the car, making it difficult to determine its condition beforehand, Trooper Peters said.      The driver of the truck, Michael Jay Parks of Tobyhanna, was not hurt. It’s too early in the investigation to know if police will charge him with a crime.      A friend of both teens, Samantha Piasecki, 17, of Scranton, said she rode in that car with Ms. Hughes and Ms. Morrison-Toomey Monday night.      “They were both down-to-Earth people,” she said of her friends. “They had good personalities. They had smiles that could light up dark rooms. Anytime you were with them it was always fun.”      Ms. Hughes asked Ms. Piasecki to come with them, she said, but Ms. Piasecki asked to be dropped at her mother’s home in Scranton.      She was thankful, she said, that she got out of the car, “but I feel like if I went, I could have stopped it somehow.”      At about 3 a.m., she watched the video.      “It broke me,” Ms. Piasecki said.      The video has been viewed more than 7,000 times.      It was posted to Ms. Hughes’ profile page, but not by her.      The video goes dark for seven minutes before someone picks it up again. At the end of the eight-minute video, a man is heard speaking and a blurry but bearded face can be seen before the video ends. After a Facebook Live video is broadcast, someone must push a button on the phone to post it to the web.      State police will use the video in their investigation, Trooper Dave Peters said.      The video will not be removed because it does not violate Facebook’s rules.      “People watching Live video can report potential violations of our Community Standards, and we will take the appropriate action,” said Andrea Saul, a Facebook spokeswoman. “We also encourage people to contact law enforcement if they see a Live stream in which someone is in danger.”      According to its Community Standards, Facebook marks as disturbing any videos that show the violent death of a human by accident, murder or suicide. The content is not accessible to users under 18, a warning screen is added and auto-play is disabled.      Ms. Hughes was a student at West Scranton High School, a spokesman for the school district confirmed. Grief counselors attended to students at the school Tuesday and Wednesday, he said.      The Monroe County Coroner’s Office conducted autopsies on the teens Wednesday.      Because the car burned, investigators could not visually identify the teens. Assistant Chief Deputy Coroner Michael Sak, who conducted the autopsy, could not be reached Wednesday.

State police identified the victims as driver Brooke Miranda Hughes, 18, of Scranton, and passenger Chaniya Morrison-Toomey, 19, of Dunmore.      The teens were video broadcasting themselves live online on Facebook during the crash. Investigators from the state police will use the video in their investigation, Trooper Dave Peters said. The video has been removed from the site or is in the process of being removed, he said.      Just after midnight, the two were traveling slowly in a Suzuki Forenza compact car southbound in the right lane of Interstate 380 near Tobyhanna because of a flat tire, state police said.      A tractor-trailer traveling behind them was unable to stop and plowed into the car, forcing it into the guardrail on the right side of the highway.      The speed limit on that stretch of highway is 70 mph. It is not known how fast the truck was traveling.      The truck continued past the vehicle before stopping on the right shoulder.      The teens’ car came to rest in the right lane and burst into flames, state police said. The Monroe County coroner declared both occupants dead at the scene.      Because of the fire, the bodies cannot be visually identified, Monroe County Coroner Robert Allen said. The coroner’s office will confirm the teens’ identifications with DNA after an autopsy scheduled for today.      It’s unclear how state police identified the teens.      Ms. Hughes worked at Long John Silver’s near the Viewmont Mall and was trying to earn a high school degree through cyber school, said Maryann Vidra, a friend who used to live in the North Scranton housing project Bangor Heights with Ms. Hughes.      “She had a heart of gold,” said Ms. Vidra, 32, who now lives in Indianapolis. “She saw the good in everybody. She gave everybody the benefit of the doubt. I saw the true Brooke. She carried a lot of pain with her. She was a genuine person.”      Ms. Vidra said she watched the online video of the crash, but “wished I didn’t.”      “I (saw) light, and then I heard the crash,” she said, before becoming upset and unable to discuss the video any further.      Ms. Morrison-Toomey twice worked at the KFC restaurant on North Keyser Avenue, first a few years ago and recently returned to the job, coworkers said.      Employees there worked with heavy hearts Tuesday night. Ms. Morrison-Toomey was a hard worker who always showed up on time, said Donnie Chavis, a shift supervisor at the restaurant. Among coworkers, she was a jokester and a vibrant presence, Mr. Chavis said. She had been at the store Monday night and was scheduled work Tuesday morning, he said.      Coworker Troy Smith described Ms. Morrison-Toomey as a people person who got along with everyone, employee and customer alike.      “She was a good friend to everybody and it hurt everybody when we found out,” Mr. Smith said.      Ms. Morrison-Toomey attended schools in the Old Forge School District for several years before transferring out, Superintendent John Rushefski said. The video greatly distressed one district student Tuesday who watched it, he added, and a guidance counselor checked on classes to see if it affected others.      The driver of the truck, Michael Jay Parks of Tobyhanna, was not hurt. It’s too early in the investigation to know if police will charge him, Trooper Peters said.

Kun pohdimme, kumpi vaihtoehto olisi parempi ilmailulle, on tärkeää tarkastella molempien järjestelmien etuja ja haittoja. Suljetun järjestelmän edut: 1. Turvallisuus: Suljetussa järjestelmässä turvallisuusnäkökohdat ovat tarkemmin valvottuja, ja järjestelmän sisälle pääsy on rajoitettu. Tämä voi vähentää tunkeutumisen ja sabotaasin uhkia. 2. Yksityisyys: Koska suljettu järjestelmä on eristetty ulkopuolisilta, se tarjoaa paremman yksityisyydensuojan sekä liiketoiminnalle että asiakkaille. 3. Laadunvalvonta: Suljetut järjestelmät voivat mahdollistaa tarkan laadunvalvonnan, joka voi johtaa parempaan toimintaan ja tehokkuuteen. Suljetun järjestelmän haitat: 1. Innovoinnin rajoittaminen: Koska suljetussa järjestelmässä on vähemmän läpinäkyvyyttä, se voi rajoittaa teknologista kehitystä ja innovointia. 2. Korkeammat kustannukset: Suljetun järjestelmän kehittäminen ja ylläpito voivat olla kalliimpaa verrattuna avoimeen järjestelmään. 3. Matalampi joustavuus: Suljetun järjestelmän rakenne voi olla rajoittavampi, mikä voi tehdä vaikeammaksi mukautua muuttuviin markkinoihin ja teknologioihin. Avoimen järjestelmän edut: 1. Innovointi: Avoimessa järjestelmässä tieto ja teknologia ovat vapaasti saatavilla, mikä voi edistää innovointia ja kehitystä. 2. Kustannustehokkuus: Avoimet järjestelmät voivat olla edullisempia kehittää ja ylläpitää, koska ne hyödyntävät olemassa olevia resursseja ja teknologioita. 3. Laaja yhteistyö: Avoimeen järjestelmään sisältyy usein laajempi yhteistyö eri osapuolten ja organisaatioiden välillä, mikä voi johtaa parempiin ratkaisuihin ja tehokkaampaan toimintaan. Avoimen järjestelmän haitat: 1. Turvallisuusriskit: Avoimessa järjestelmässä on suurempi alttius ulkopuolisille riskeille, kuten tietoturvahyökkäyksille tai sabotaasille. 2. Yksityisyyden heikkeneminen: Koska avoimessa järjestelmässä tiedonkulku on vapaampaa, yksityisyys voi olla heikompi sekä yrityksille että asiakkaille. 3. Laadun vaihtelu: Avoimissa järjestelmissä laadunvalvonta voi olla vaikeampaa, mikä saattaa johtaa epätasaiseen suorituskykyyn ja tehokkuuteen. Lopulta päätös siitä, kumpi järjestelmä olisi parempi ilmailulle, riippuu siitä, mitkä tekijät ovat tärkeämpiä kullekin osapuolelle. Turvallisuus, yksityisyys ja laadunvalvonta ovat tärkeitä näkökohtia suljettua järjestelmää puoltaville, kun taas avoin järjestelmä kannustaa innovaatioon, kustannustehokkuuteen ja laajaan yhteistyöhön."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: I read this background article the other day: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster. The same principle explains why storing food in a cold refrigerator reduces the rate at which food spoils (see Figure below ). Both food frying and food spoiling are chemical reactions that happen faster at higher temperatures.

Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which woman's bread will grow mold slower? The answer is:","output":"Martha's bread will grow mold slower. Since Martha stores her bread in the freezer, the low temperature slows down the rate of chemical reactions, including the growth of mold. Mold, a type of fungus, requires warmer conditions to grow and multiply effectively. By keeping the bread in the freezer, Martha is essentially providing an unfavorable environment for mold growth, thereby preserving the bread for a longer period.

The company mines iron ore at Kiruna and at Malmberget in northern Sweden. The company was established in 1890, and has been 100% state-owned since the 1950s. The iron ore is processed to pellets and sinter fines, which are transported by Iore trains (Malmbanan) to the harbours at Narvik and Luleå and to the steelmill at Luleå (SSAB).   - Narvik is located on the shores of the Ofotfjorden. The municipality is part of the traditional district of Ofoten of Northern Norway, inside the Arctic Circle. The municipality of Narvik borders the municipality of Ballangen to the southwest, Evenes to the northwest, Bardu, Gratangen, Lavangen and Skånland (in Troms county) to the north, and Norrbotten County (Lapland) in Sweden to the south and east.  - Johan Olof Hjalmar Lundbohm ( 25 April 1855 -- 4 April 1926 ) was a Swedish geologist and chemist and the first managing director of LKAB ( Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag ) in Kiruna . He is regarded as the founder of the city .  - A geologist is a scientist who studies the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the Earth as well as the processes that shape it. Geologists usually study geology, although backgrounds in physics, chemistry, biology, and other sciences are also useful. Field work is an important component of geology, although many subdisciplines incorporate laboratory work.  - A chemist (from Greek chm (ía) alchemy + -ist; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English.  - Iore, often stylized IORE, is a class of 34 electric locomotives built by Adtranz and its successor Bombardier Transportation for the Swedish mining company LKAB's railway division Malmtrafik. The class is a variation of Adtranz's Octeon modular product platform, thus related to Bombardier's later TRAXX platform. The locomotives haul iron ore freight trains on the Iron Ore Line and Ofoten Line in Sweden and Norway, respectively. The 68-car trains are hauled by two single-ended CoCo locomotives, each with a power output of . Each operates with tractive effort and has a maximum speed of . Delivery of the first series of 18 locomotives was made from 2000 to 2004, and they replaced some of the aging Dm3 and El 15 units. In 2007, eight more vehicles (4 double units) were ordered, with production to be completed by 2011, by which time, another four double units were ordered.

A pharmacist is a member of the health care team directly involved with patient care. Pharmacists undergo university-level education to understand the biochemical mechanisms and actions of drugs, drug uses, therapeutic roles, side effects, potential drug interactions, and monitoring parameters. This is mated to anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. Pharmacists interpret and communicate this specialized knowledge to patients, physicians, and other health care providers.  - The polar night occurs when the night lasts for more than 24 hours. This occurs only inside the polar circles. The opposite phenomenon, the polar day, or midnight sun, occurs when the Sun stays above the horizon for more than 24 hours. \\"Night\\" is understood as the center of the Sun being below a free horizon. Since the atmosphere bends the rays of the Sun, the polar day is longer than the polar night, and the area that is affected by polar night is somewhat smaller than the area of midnight sun. The polar circle is located at a latitude between these two areas, at the latitude of approximately 66.5 degrees. In the most northern city of Sweden, Kiruna, at 67°51'N, the polar night lasts for around 28 twenty-four-hour periods, while the midnight sun lasts around 50 twenty-four-hour periods.  - The city's vicinity shares a long history with the indigenous Sami people, with evidence of at least 6000 years of settlement. The city of Kiruna was founded in 1900 and quickly became a major centre of iron ore extraction and mining industry. During World War II, large quantities of iron were transported from Kiruna by rail to the east coast, and further down to be sold to Germany. Due to Kiruna's position north of the Arctic Circle the city experiences both midnight sun and polar night throughout the year as well as a very cold climate, even by Scandinavian standards.  - The Sami people (also Sámi or Saami, traditionally known in English as Lapps or Laplanders) are an indigenous Finno-Ugric people inhabiting the Arctic area of Sápmi, which today encompasses parts of far northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Kola Peninsula of Russia. The Sami are the only indigenous people of Scandinavia recognized and protected under the international conventions of indigenous peoples, and are hence the northernmost indigenous people of Europe. Sami ancestral lands are not well-defined. Their traditional languages are the Sami languages and are classified as a branch of the Uralic language family.  - Luleå (Lule Sami \\"Luleju\\") is a city on the coast of northern Sweden, and the capital of Norrbotten County, the northernmost county in Sweden.

The largest shareholders are Industrivärden and the Government of Finland.  - Alchemy is a philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout Europe, Egypt and Asia. It aimed to purify, mature, and perfect certain objects. Common aims were chrysopoeia, the transmutation of \\"base metals\\" (e.g., lead) into \\"noble\\" ones (particularly gold); the creation of an elixir of immortality; the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease; and the development of an alkahest, a universal solvent. The perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and, in the Hellenistic and western tradition, the achievement of gnosis.

How Grindr has transformed users' experience of intimacy In our era of social media saturation, suggesting that technology has transformed intimacy would not be a radical idea. From facilitating political communities to online dating, technology presents us with a number of exciting opportunities and anxieties. Let’s take Grindr as an example. For same-sex attracted men, myself included, it has become the smartphone symbol for the possibilities of organising sex, friendship and relationships with the tap of a screen. The product markets this quite clearly: “Grindr is quick, convenient, and discreet. And it’s as anonymous as you want it to be.” It also has millions of users worldwide. Whether you are reading in a library or lying in the park, everywhere you go with your phone becomes a site of sexual possibility. Bodies are conveniently cropped, filtered and framed for consumption. In our haste to use the platform, though, we often ignore a critical question: what emotional work is involved when seeking intimacy online? Emotional labour is not a novel concept. Sociologist Arlie Hochschild refers to it as the work involved in managing our feelings and how we express them. We do this everyday. We do it when we manage (not always successfully) our feelings of anxiety at a bourgeoning relationship, or when we are asked to feign interest in a conversation that bores us. Online spaces makes this much harder to navigate since we oscillate between disparate feelings in a confined space of time. From the moment I sign on to Grindr, these bodies are presented as assortment of thumbnails, ordered in terms of geographical proximity. Sorting through each profile makes me feel like I’m a kid in an adult candy store: “window-shopping” my way through, hoping to find the right guy to fit my current mood. I could just be after casual sex or be looking to find a romantic partner. It could even be both! This is best illustrated by the pop culture phrase: “looking for Mr Right or Mr Right Now.” I can “star” our favourite users and segment our conversations. I’m in control of who I respond to, how quickly I respond, and the nature of the conversation I am having. I can tap incessantly on one screen, sending photos to a guy looking to “hook up now” while scrolling through to a conversation with a friend about where to have brunch on Sunday. Then I return to another conversation with a potential boyfriend to reflect on how amazing our previous date was and to eagerly organise our next one. The first conversation titillates me as I imagine the prospect of immediate sex. The next puts me in a relaxed state of mind as I talk about my favourite local cafes. The last one generates longing or hope as we converse about sparking a relationship. Meanwhile, all this textual intercoursing happens within the space of minutes. Our physical, intellectual and emotional capacities go into overdrive. It can be quite exhausting. With this in mind, it probably comes as no surprise that many Grindr users have deleted and reinstalled the application several times. With the labour and time demands of talking to so many people, Grindr becomes an intimate commitment of its own. Then, of course, there is the anxiety over finding ways to limit (or not) how you use it. Do you continue to use it when you have a monogamous partner? How do you express your desires in ways that do not marginalise others? Do you keep searching for more and more people to talk to, or do you invest time in cultivating attachments to those you have already formed a connection with? The recent web series The Grindr Guide shows us that the possibility of pleasure or romance comes with its own kinds of intimate anxieties. Some people feel hopeful after going on a stimulating date, only to then be disappointed to see their date on Grindr immediately after. Relationship surveillance takes on a problematic dimension: we can now monitor the movements of the people we are dating, or just talking to. We can see when they are online, where they are, and what they are looking for. Our desire for surveillance feeds on this anxiety loop. Grindr makes us work through a smorgasbord of feelings, often within incredibly short spaces of time. We cruise. We talk. We share photos. We meet people. We do that in a myriad of combinations. It is important to celebrate the capacity to form online intimacies – but we need to seriously account for the emotional labour that is involved in pursuing them. While people say nothing worth having comes easily, we need to ask ourselves: are we willing to pay the emotional price for it? What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the impact of Grindr, a popular dating app for same-sex attracted men, on users' experience of intimacy.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person from whom the couple inherited the Brownlow estates?  The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598. In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons.

As the musical prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen at play in the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle reminder of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: \\"I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me\\". The wary Flosshilde cries: \\"Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe\\". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: \\"Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love\\", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: \\"Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!\\" Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him  bewailing their loss. Answer:","output":"Woglinde, Wellgunde, and Flosshilde are the three people observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:You are presented with the question \\"What can cause plants to receive less energy\\" and the following answer choices:  - summer solstace  - Dehydration  - fossil fuels  - exposure to cold  - lunar orbit  - They may not survive.  - solar flares  - the Earth being tilted  Now knowing that the Earth being tilted on its axis causes ones side of the Earth to receive less energy from the Sun than the other side and plants obtain their energy from the sun, choose the best answer. A:","output":"The best answer would be \\"the Earth being tilted\\".  First, I analyze all the given options one by one: - \\"Summer solstice\\" represents the time when the Earth's axial tilt towards the sun is at a maximum, causing longer daylight hours and therefore more potential solar energy for the plants. So, it is incorrect.  - \\"Dehydration\\" hinders the process of photosynthesis due to the absence of sufficient water, it does not directly reduce the sun’s energy reaching the plants. So, this might have an indirect effect but is not the best answer here.  - \\"Fossil fuels\\" cause pollution and global warming but do not directly reduce the amount of sunlight reaching plants. Therefore, fossil fuels is also not the most suitable answer.  - \\"Exposure to cold\\" can harm the plant's metabolic processes but does not directly cause the plant to receive less solar energy. So, it also doesn’t seem to be the best answer in this context. - \\"Lunar orbit\\" has no considerable effect on the amount of sunlight a plant receives. So, this cannot be the correct answer. - \\"They may not survive\\" is a result of conditions, not a condition in itself causing less sunlight. So, this does not fit as an answer.  - \\"Solar flares\\" produce more energy, not less. However, they could potentially cause some harm to the Earth's atmosphere, but this is not a direct cause of plants receiving less sunlight. Thus, this answer is also not the best one. - \\"The Earth being tilted\\" causes a change in the seasons which makes one side of the Earth to receive less energy from the Sun for a certain period of the year. During winter months, due to the Earth's tilt, the sun’s rays hit the Earth at a lower angle and are spread out over a greater area, causing plants to receive less solar energy. This explains why plants grow less during winter. After examining all the answer choices, the option \\"the Earth being tilted\\" directly affects the amount of solar energy plants receive and therefore, is the best answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Take consumer products giant Procter and Gamble. Even with a 1.8 billion Research and Development budget, it still manages 500 active partnerships each year, many of them with small companies. Can we infer the following? 500 small companies are partners of Procter and Gamble.","output":"To infer the information given, let's break it down step-by-step: 1. Procter and Gamble is a consumer products giant. 2. It has a 1.8 billion Research and Development budget. 3. It manages 500 active partnerships each year. 4. Many of these partnerships are with small companies. From these statements, we can infer that Procter and Gamble has a large number of partnerships, and many of them are with small companies. However, we cannot definitively conclude that all of the 500 partnerships are with small companies, as it is only mentioned that \\"many\\" of them are. Therefore, it is not accurate to infer that exactly 500 small companies are partners of Procter and Gamble.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Henry III's reign was in crisis in 1258. He had recently suffered defeat in Wales, there were agricultural problems leading to a famine, and relations with the pope were worsening. Discontent amongst England's magnates led Henry to promise reform, but under continued pressure his authority disintegrated. A royal council of fifteen magnates was formed in June that year, and the rule of the country transferred from the king to the council. With foreign help Henry's reign was restored in 1261 as the council were reluctant to start a civil war. Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, raised a rebellion. In 1264 civil war broke out between those loyal to the king and the baronial forces led by de Montfort.Rochester's constable in 1264, Roger de Leybourne, held the castle in support of Henry. John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey, was the garrison's co-commander. A baronial army led by Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Hertford, laid siege to the castle on 17 April that year. Having marched from the earl's castle to Tonbridge the army attacked from the Rochester side of the river, either the south or west. While the army advanced towards the city the royalist garrison set alight the suburbs. The king's hall within the castle was also burned down, although it is unclear why. An army under Simon de Montfort marched from London with the intention of attacking the city from another direction. The earl's first two attempts to cross the Medway were fought back, but he was successful on 18 April, Good Friday. The method used is uncertain, although it involved a fire-ship. The smoke may have been used as cover for the rebels, or the ship may have been used to burn the bridge while the army travelled by water. In a co-ordinated attack that had been pre-arranged, the armies of de Montfort and de Clare attacked the city. They entered Rochester in the evening and that night the cathedral was raided. The following day the rebels captured the castle's outer enclosure and the royal garrison retreated to the keep. Because the next day was Easter...","output":"The name of the king whose loyalists engaged in a civil war with the baronial forces in 1264 is King Henry III of England.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What are the names of the two verminform creatures Clive and Elisa previously worked on? from the following article ?  Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them from doing this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa, however, disobey their superiors and pursue their own agenda in secret, developing a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink filled with cold water. Later on Clive fully submerges Dren in the sink, and in doing so discovers that Dren is amphibious, but remains ambiguous in whether he tried to save Dren or kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death. It is subsequently discovered that Ginger had spontaneously changed to a male, but Elsa and Clive failed to notice because they were focused on Dren.

Sara Agintas, 45, right, had a free gastric band operation and now she wants the NHS to send her daughter Hannah, 14, to £4,500 weight loss camp. A mother of six who dropped from 38 stone to 22 after having a free £14,000 gastric band says she now wants the taxpayer to send her overweight daughter to boot camp. Sara Agintas, 45, from Milton Keynes, says that while she has managed to lose weight after having an operation to reduce her stomach capacity, she's concerned that her 14-year-old daughter, Hannah, who is 5ft 9in and weighs 17 stone, needs expensive intervention by the State. Mrs Agintas, who has shrunk from a size 38 to 22 since her operation in 2012, said: 'I can’t afford to pay for a weight loss camp, but I don’t see why the Government can’t step in and provide for her with a funded camp on the NHS. 'It would be an investment for her future - I have tried everything I can to help her at home, with no luck.' Mrs Agintas had her gastric band operation done for nothing by a private surgeon after she appeared in the press two years ago calling to have the operation on the NHS. At the time, she said: 'I can’t afford a personal trainer or weight-loss surgery – I need help from the taxpayer.' Now she believes the only way her daughter will lose weight is by attending a weight-loss camp for children - paid for by the State. 'I don't want Hannah to end up the way I was and if she doesn't stop, that's exactly what's going to happen,' she said. 'I just can't get through to her - she will eat anything she can get her hands on. 'I make hearty home cooked meals at home from scratch, and I serve up smaller portions, but Hannah will always have seconds or finish up any leftovers - even though she doesn’t need it.' Mrs Agintas said: 'I would love her to go to a kids’ boot camp but it is just so expensive and way out of my price range. The camps I've looked at cost about £4,500 and that’s just not the kind of money I have. 'I think she would really benefit from going to a boot camp, so she can be out of the home environment and completely educated by health professionals. 'If she keeps on she will end up with no choice but to get a gastric band like me, and I don’t want that for her.' Scroll down for video. Mrs Agintas says her son, Sam, 16, left, is working on his diet but daughter Hannah, centre, needs expert help. The way she was: The mother of six went from size 38 and 38 stone to size 22 and 22 stone after her free op. Schoolgirl Hannah, whose BMI of 35 defines her as obese, said: 'I know I'm a bit overweight, but I don’t have as much to lose as my mum did. 'I think my mum has done really well and I’m proud of her.  I do want to lose some weight so she can be proud of me too, but I don’t find it easy. 'I wouldn't mind going to a boot camp.' In Britain, a five-week residential stay at a high-end fitness camp starts from £4,250.  Parents are told children can lose up to three stone, through a combination of diet, exercise and education about nutrition. Mrs Agintas says she's sought medical advice about Hannah’s weight but has been offered no support. 'I've taken Hannah to the doctors about her weight but all I have been told is that she's fine and will grow out of it once her teenage years are over,' she said. Mrs Agintas says she's sought medical advice about Hannah’s weight but has been offered no support. Hannah, left, has a BMI of 35, which classes her as obese, and her mother, right, says she must go to fat camp. Since losing weight and keeping it off with healthy cooking and exercise, Mrs Agintas says she has improved the quality of her life, getting a job as a passenger escort for disabled children and becoming a parish councillor. She said: 'The gastric operation really gave me the kick-start I needed to turn my life around. 'Before, I was stuck to a sofa. I couldn't move or do anything, and the only time I went out was at night to do the weekly shop. 'It wasn't a life, and my doctor gave me just one year to live, but I couldn't leave my kids without a mum.' Mrs Agintas lives at home with her three youngest children, Sam, 16, Hannah, and Zoe, 11.  Zoe is naturally slim, but both Sam and Hannah are overweight. Mrs Agintas says her weight crept up after she suffered from cravings for junk food when she was pregnant. Time to work out: The family, who live in Milton Keynes, eat healthy, home-cooked food, but it isn't enough. Sam weighs 18 stone but is trying to lose weight by eating his mother’s healthy meals and joining a gym to lose weight. Mrs Agintas said: 'The Government have billions of pounds, and I think they should spend some money helping parents who cannot afford to send their kids to a fat camp. 'More money needs to be spent on educating young people about food and exercise, it’s an investment for the future. 'I am worried about Hannah and her spiralling into what I was like. The situation is drastic and she needs to stop now before she gains any more weight. 'Hannah only has about four stone to lose and I'm sure she can do it - but I have tried everything. You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink.' Gastric band surgery is available on the NHS, but not for everyone.  Guidelines say the patient must have a BMI of 40 or more, or a BMI between 35-40 and a serious health condition (such as high blood pressure) that could be improved if the patient loses weight. It also depends on where the patient lives - different clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in different areas may have varying criteria for eligibility. Meanwhile, surgery for children is not recommended except for in exceptional circumstances where a child has a BMI of over 50 or is classed as morbidly obese. GPs will offer advice on weight loss so a visit to the doctor will be the best place to start. The NHS offers a free, downloadable 12-week weight loss plan, which advises on calorie intake and exercise. Other services on offer include slimming clubs, meetings with dieticians, and exercise groups. For more information visit the NHS weight loss page.

Options: - laboratory - restaurant - freezer - grocery store - laboratory Answer:","output":"Among the given options, the most appropriate and in line with common sense for storing food you just bought would be a freezer. A detailed explanation of all the options and why the freezer is the best choice is provided below: 1. Laboratory: A laboratory is a place where scientific research and experiments are conducted. This is not a suitable environment for storing food, as laboratories typically have strict safety protocols and controlled conditions which are often not compatible with proper food storage and preservation. 2. Restaurant: While a restaurant stores and prepares food, it is not an ideal place to store personal groceries or food items because they cater to multiple customers and serve different meals. They have their own food storage system designed for serving their guests. This option does not offer practicality and convenience for your food storage needs. 3. Freezer: The freezer is an ideal option for storing food that you just bought since it is specifically designed to keep perishable items at a consistent temperature, prolonging their shelf-life and preserving their quality. This appliance is commonly used for preserving a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, meats, and other perishable products, and can be found in most households. 4. Grocery Store: Although a grocery store sells food items, it is not an appropriate storage option for food you have already purchased. Typically, when you buy food from a store, you take it home for consumption and storage. Grocery stores are not equipped for individual food storage and are focused on selling products rather than providing personal storage options. 5. Laboratory (repeated option): As previously mentioned, a laboratory is not a suitable place for storing food due to the reasons stated above. In conclusion, the freezer is the most logical and common-sense option for storing food you just bought. It is designed specifically for preserving and maintaining the quality of perishable items and is a practical and accessible choice for most individuals to utilize."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is it bad for my health to drink 2-3 Red Bulls a week? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"To answer the first question, I will perform a step-by-step analysis of the health impact of drinking Red Bull: Step 1: Identify the main ingredients in Red Bull that could have health impacts: - Caffeine - Taurine - B-group vitamins - Sugars Step 2: Research the effects of each ingredient on health: - Caffeine: It is a stimulant that can boost alertness and concentration, but excessive consumption can lead to insomnia, heart palpitations, and increased blood pressure. - Taurine: It is an amino acid that supports neurological functions and might have positive effects on cardiovascular health. However, definitive conclusions about taurine are still not clear.    - B-group vitamins: These vitamins play a crucial role in maintaining good health and well-being. They may have a positive impact on energy levels and brain function if consumed in the recommended daily allowance.  - Sugars: Consuming beverages with added sugars can contribute to weight gain and an increased risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular issues if consumed in excessive amounts. Step 3: Consider the potential negative impact of consuming Red Bull frequently or in large quantities: - Excessive caffeine intake can lead to addiction and withdrawal symptoms. - High sugar content can contribute to obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular issues. - Mixing Red Bull with alcohol can lead to risky behavior as it may mask the effects of alcohol and increase the chances of overconsumption. Now addressing the second question – if it is bad for your health to drink 2-3 Red Bulls a week: In general, moderate consumption (1 can per day) of Red Bull is considered safe for most healthy adults. That being said, 2-3 Red Bulls a week is unlikely to pose significant health risks for most people as long as there are no underlying health issues or a sensitivity to caffeine. However, it's essential to consider individual circumstances and medical conditions. To answer the third part of your inquiry - Both questions are related but are not inquiring about the same information. The first question asks about the general health impact of drinking Red Bull, while the second question specifically asks if consuming 2-3 Red Bulls per week is bad for health.

Joe Paterno led the Penn State Nittany Lions for 46 seasons and -- in the process -- became the winningest coach in college football history. Then came the child molestation scandal involving his former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky and allegations that Paterno played a role in concealing it. The NCAA vacated 111 of his wins over a 14-year period, fined the school 60 million, reduced scholarships and banned it from bowl games for four years. Paterno died last year, his iconic reputation in tatters. But his relatives filed a lawsuit Thursday to see that his legacy doesn't end that way. The lawsuit -- filed by the Paterno family, several members of the Penn State Board of Trustees, faculty, former players and coaches -- takes to task the NCAA and a report by former FBI director Louis Freeh, whom the sports body hired to conduct an independent investigation of Penn State's handling of the scandal. \\"The report on which the NCAA relied for its actions is fundamentally wrong, incomplete and inaccurate,\\" a release from the parties filing the lawsuit said. \\"The consent decree with Penn State was hastily imposed on the University, completely disregarding the rights of the affected parties.\\" The 40-page suit, filed in Common Pleas Court of Centre County, Pennsylvania, Thursday, is the second filed against the college sports governing body.

In 2002, a graduate assistant brought to Paterno allegations of Sandusky's sexual abuse in one of Penn State's facilities. Paterno informed his supervisors of the report, but the school's board of trustees fired Paterno in November 2011, saying he could no longer perform his duties in the shadow of scandal. Sandusky was convicted in June 2012 on 45 counts of child sex abuse. He was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison. Penn State supporters mark anniversary of Paterno's death.

Article: The Lyubov Orlova (shown here) was seized in St. John's, Newfoundland, in 2010 because of a financial dispute between the ship's Russian owners and a charter company.      After months of drifting across the North Atlantic, a luckless, abandoned cruise ship spotted drifting off the coast of Ireland may have finally sunk beneath the waves.      The Lyubov Orlova, a 328-foot-long (100 meters) vessel named after a Russian screen siren from the 1930s, was built in 1976 and chartered for expeditions to polar waters.      But after the ship was abandoned in 2010 in Newfoundland, Canada, the Lyubov Orlova was sold for scrap to an outfit in the Dominican Republic, Phys.org reports. [Disasters at Sea: 6 Deadliest Shipwrecks]      While the ship was being towed to its Caribbean destination in January 2013, the towline snapped in rough seas and the crew was unable to reconnect the line, leaving the ship to drift eastward across the Atlantic Ocean.      With no crew, no warning lights and no GPS system, the ship appeared doomed. But in February, the ship was spotted by the Atlantic Hawk, an oil industry supply ship, which managed to attach a towline.      Transport Canada, however, ordered the Atlantic Hawk to release the vessel since it was by then in international waters and no longer under Canadian jurisdiction.      Months passed with no sign of the Lyubov Orlova until it was spotted by the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, a Defense Department mapping service, drifting some 1,300 nautical miles (2,400 kilometers) west of the Irish coast, Gizmodo reports.      The ship hasn't been seen in months, and some speculate it may have finally sunk.      The star-crossed ship hasn't had an easy life: In 2006, it ran aground off Antarctica and had to be towed to safety by a Spanish icebreaker.      The Lyubov Orlova was seized in St. John's, Newfoundland, in 2010 because of a financial dispute between the ship's Russian owners and a charter company. The crew, bereft with no pay and nothing to eat, were forced to rely on food donations from Canadians for several months before returning to Russia.      A French environmental organization, Robin du Bois, labeled the Lyubov Orlova an imminent threat to health and safety.      \\"In case of a collision or sinking or any accident, the Lyubov Orlova will immediately release fuel … other toxic liquids, asbestos ... mercury and other non-degradable floating waste,\\" the group declared in a statement.      The Irish Coastguard received a signal in March from the emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) of the Lyubov Orlova. An EPIRB is activated when it contacts water, the Irish Examiner reports.      Follow Marc Lallanilla on Twitter and Google+. Follow us @livescience, Facebook & Google+. Original article on LiveScience.com. ||||| The Lyubov Orlova, seen being towed out of St. John's in January, had long been an eyesore along the waterfront. (CBC)      Four months after an empty Russian cruise ship snapped a tow line and drifted into the North Atlantic off Newfoundland her trail has gone cold.      The Canadian Coast Guard says it has received no reported sightings of the Lyubov Orlova since March 12.      At the time, one of the empty vessel's emergency radio beacons flashed an unconfirmed location almost 1,300 kilometres off Newfoundland. The beacon could have been activated after hitting water or another object.      The ship was drifting toward Iceland or Ireland but there have been no recent sightings reported by European officials or other maritime agencies.      \\"The owners of the Lyubov Orlova remain responsible for their vessel,\\" Sam Whiffen, a spokesman for Fisheries and Oceans Canada, said.      On Jan. 24, the Lyubov Orlova snapped her tow line as she was being hauled by the tugboat Charlene Hunt to the Dominican Republic for scrap.      'It has ruined me,' co-owner says      An increasingly glum Reza Shoeybi, co-owner of the wayward ship, said in February that his life's savings were lost with her.      \\"It has ruined me,\\" he said in an interview at the time. \\"I don't have anything else. I've lost 12 years of my savings.\\"      Shoeybi said he and an uncle, both of Toronto, became co-owners of the once popular Arctic cruise ship named for a revered Russian actress from the 1930s. They took over payments after a family friend bought it for 275,000 in a Federal Court process last year.      Canadian authorities had seized the Lyubov Orlova in September 2010 as part of a lawsuit by Cruise North Expeditions against its Russian owners.      The badly neglected, rat-infested ship sat listing in its prime harbour berth in St. John's for more than two years before Shoeybi arrived to get it ready for tow. He said he and his uncle spent about 400,000 and had hoped to make between 700,000 and 800,000 in the Dominican depending on metal prices. |||||Summary:","output":"The Lyubov Orlova, a 328-foot long abandoned cruise ship, was last spotted drifting off the coast of Ireland in 2013. The Russian ship was initially seized in St. John's, Newfoundland, in 2010 due to a financial dispute between its owners and a charter company. In 2013, it was sold for scrap to a company in the Dominican Republic. While being towed to its destination, the towline snapped, and it has been drifting in the Atlantic Ocean ever since. After months of no sightings, it is speculated that the ship may have finally sunk."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A prominent Republican woman launched a she-said, she-said battle over wages on Wednesday morning by accusing the White House of paying women less than men – just hours after President Barack Obama begged Congress to outlaw the practice. High-stakes gender politics made an appearance in Tuesday's State of the Union address when the president insisted that 'Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work.' 'Really,' he said to cheers from Democrats on Capitol HIll. 'It’s 2015. It’s time.' On Wednesday morning former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina claimed 'the president hasn't really led in this regard. He's not paying women equally by his own measures in his own White House.' 'He's not paying women equally,' former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina (left) said of the president, during a morning-show joust with White House adviser Valerie Jarrett (right) President Barack Obama made a point of mentioning pay equity for women in his State of the Union speech, a political dog-whistle that motivates Democratic voters but is subject to widely varying interpretation. The line brought applause from Democrats but not much enthusiasm from Republicans, who 'won't stand – literally – for pay equity,' according to some wags on Twitter. Fiorina, herself a potential 2016 presidential candidate, glossed over details from the administration's annual Report to Congress on White House Staff that show women are paid equally for the same work but aren't trusted with as many high-level jobs. She aired her complaint on MSNBC's Morning Joe program, where she faced off against top Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett. 'Every woman across the nation agrees that equal pay for equal work is absolutely required,' Fiorina said. 'I also think it's just a fact that laws exist on the books today, and if a woman is being discriminated against because of her gender, she should use the full extent of that law.' Jarrett fired back. 'Let's unpack your question a little bit. ... In the White House women do earn equal pay for equal work,' she said. Obama's salary data show that male white-collar White House employees earn an average of about 88,600, compared with 78,400 for females. That 13 per cent wage gap is in line with the federal government as a whole, according to the Office of Personnel Management. But it's larger than the overall gap in the District of Columbia, which the Washington Post reports is 9.9 per cent. Nationally, women in the U.S. earn 23.5 per cent less than men. That number, like the White House's, results in large part from women holding more junior-level jobs with lower salaries. Fewer men take time away from their careers to raise children, giving them access to continued career advancement and salary growth. And some researchers point to trends in women's employment that suggest many mothers accept lower wages in exchange for better health benefits and greater flexibility in working hours. That may be one reason why 87 men in the White House earn six-figure salaries, something only 53 women on Obama's staff can say.compared to 53 female White House officials. The White House's 2014 report also showed that there are two more men than women in the highest-ranking positions. Fiorina's spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But the longtime tech executive, who ran an unsuccessful bid for a California U.S> Senate seat in 2012, hinted during the on-air tussle that her real target was labor unions and their preference for seniority-based pay systems. 'The single greatest impediment to equal pay for equal work is this seniority system, which pays not on merit, not on performance, but on time and grade,' she claimed. 'And who is it who supports the seniority system? Unions, government bureaucracies, the vast majority of constituencies that the Democratic party represents and who support the Democratic party.' Paying women 'by merit and by their results,' Fiorina insisted, would result in a system where 'women will be paid equally.' Fiorina, a onetime US Senate candidate in California, now lives in Virginia and is weighing a presidential run in 2016. Jarrett is among the Obamas' oldest friends from their Chicago days, and is seen in Washington as a political 'fixer' who has the president's ear more often than his Cabinet secretaries. Jarrett fired back that Obama's State of the Union barb about pay equity was a reference to the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that Republicans have consistently blocked since 2009. The National Women's Law Center supports the measure, saying it would allow judges to take a close look at companies' pay practices to be sure any gender disparities 'serve a legitimate business purpose' and spring from 'factors other than sex.' Business advocates and their Republican supporters, however, maintain that there is a broad list of reasons why some women earn less than some men. In 2009 the U.S. Department of Labor commissioned a study from the CONSAD Research Corporation that counseled the government on how to interpret wage data from the U.S. Census and other sources. It found that 'differences in the compensation of men and women are the result of a multitude of factors.' 'The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers,' the report concluded. The Equal Pay Act Of 1963 already makes it illegal to pay women less than men for performing the same job in the same company. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"- A prominent Republican woman accused the White House of paying women less than men, just hours after President Barack Obama urged Congress to outlaw the practice. - Carly Fiorina, former Hewlett-Packard CEO, claimed President Obama had not led in this regard and was not paying women equally in his own White House. - Valerie Jarrett, a top Obama adviser, defended the White House, stating that women do earn equal pay for equal work within the administration. - Obama's salary data shows a 13% wage gap, which is in line with the federal government as a whole, but broader than the gap seen in the District of Columbia. - Fiorina argued that the seniority system, supported by unions and government bureaucracies, is the single greatest impediment to equal pay for equal work. She insisted that paying women based on merit and results would ensure pay equality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which STD is colloquially known as ‘the clap’?","output":"The sexually transmitted disease (STD) colloquially known as \\"the clap\\" is gonorrhea, a bacterial infection caused by the Neisseria gonorrhoeae bacterium. The term \\"the clap\\" is believed to have originated from old French or English slang, but its exact origins are unclear. Some theories suggest it may have derived from the French word \\"clapier,\\" which means a brothel, while others believe it comes from an Old English word for rabbit burrow, as both rabbits and gonorrhea were associated with promiscuity in the past. Gonorrhea is a common STD worldwide, and it mainly affects people who are sexually active, both men and women. It spreads through unprotected vaginal, oral, or anal sexual contact with an infected person, and it can also be transmitted from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth. Like many other STDs, gonorrhea often does not show any symptoms, or the symptoms may be very mild, which can make it difficult to detect and diagnose. When symptoms do manifest, they generally appear within 2-14 days after infection. For men, symptoms may include a burning sensation during urination, discharge from the penis (pus-like or watery), swelling or pain in the testicles, and less commonly, swelling of the foreskin. Women can experience symptoms such as painful urination, increased vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding between periods, lower abdominal pain, and pain during sex. If left untreated, gonorrhea can lead to serious health complications. For women, the infection can spread to the womb, fallopian tubes, or ovaries, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can result in chronic pain, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility. In men, untreated gonorrhea can lead to inflammation of the epididymis, the tube that carries sperm from the testicles, possibly resulting in infertility as well. Additionally, both men and women are at risk of disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI), where the infection spreads to other parts of the body, such as the skin, joints, heart, or brain. The good news is that gonorrhea can be treated with antibiotics. However, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae has become a growing public health concern in recent years. It is important to treat the infection promptly and follow the prescribed antibiotic treatment to avoid contributing to the development of antibiotic resistance. In addition, practicing safe sex, such as using condoms consistently and correctly, can help to reduce the risk of contracting or spreading gonorrhea and other STDs. Regular check-ups and screening for STDs are crucial, especially for individuals who are sexually active or at a higher risk. This can help with early detection and treatment, which is key to preventing the spread of gonorrhea and reducing its long-term health impacts. Open communication with sexual partners about STDs and sexual health is also an essential part of maintaining good sexual health and reducing the risk of infection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While their candidate is riding high — and will be sworn in as the country’s 45th president in just 61 days — their portfolio is feeling a little tattered. Since Election Day, Smith & Wesson shares were down 15 percent heading into Monday’s opening bell. Shares of Sturm, Ruger were down 17 percent over the same span. And the pain may not be temporary. Americans who raced to gun shops to buy guns over the past four years — and in the four weeks leading up to Nov. 8 — out of fear Pres. Obama and Hillary Clinton (who was then leading in the polls) would soon move to cut off their Second Amendment rights, are now slowing the buying spree. Gun shop owners are seeing a steep drop-off in sales since Election Day. Dave Larsen, the sales manager at Doug’s Shoot’n Sports in Salt Lake City told the local Fox TV affiliate that business is off since Trump won. “I did have one gentleman order a gun from me on Tuesday, and then after the election results came in he called me and said, ‘Dave, let’s cancel that order,’” Larsen said. “I asked him point blank, ‘Is this because Donald won?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, kind of.’ ” Larsen said the customer later decided to keep the gun. It’s quite a let down for gun shop owners who saw record sales in October. After posting double-digit declines over the eight trading days since Election Day, Smith & Wesson shares picked up on Monday, jumping 2.2 percent in morning trading, to 24.66.

To saw lumber, which means cutting a big piece of wood into smaller pieces, you'd want to follow a few simple steps. Let me explain them to you: 1. Decide what size pieces you need: First, figure out what sizes of wooden pieces you want. You can ask a grown-up to help you with this. 2. Mark the wood: Once you have the sizes, you need to mark the big piece of wood with a pencil and ruler. This will help you know where to cut. Ask an adult to help you with this part too. 3. Put on safety gear: Cutting wood can be dangerous, especially for little kids. So, it's really important to have an adult help you and wear special gear like safety goggles, gloves, and ear protection. 4. Choose the right saw: There are different types of saws to cut wood. Some saws are big and noisy, called power saws, and others are smaller and quieter, called hand saws. An adult will pick the right saw for the job. 5. Secure the wood: Before starting to cut, you need to make sure the wood doesn't move around. Adults can use special tools like clamps or a workbench to hold the wood securely in place. 6. Start sawing: Now, the grown-up will start sawing along the pencil lines you made earlier. They'll hold the saw with both hands and move it back and forth to cut through the wood. 7. Keep the cuts straight: To get nice, straight cuts, the person sawing will need to focus and follow the marks closely as they cut. 8. Finish up: Once the wood has been cut into the smaller pieces you wanted, the grown-up will want to smooth out any rough edges with sandpaper. That's how you saw lumber, little friend! Just remember, cutting wood is a job for grown-ups, so make sure you have an adult to help you out and stay safe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

În forma sa originală, textul menționează că regulamentul se referă la stabilirea listei țărilor terțe pentru cetățenii cărora li se impune sau nu li se impune obligația de a avea viză atunci când trec frontierele externe ale Uniunii Europene. Acesta stabilește unele condiții și criterii pentru includerea sau excluderea unei anumite țări de pe această listă, cum ar fi riscul pentru securitate publică, cooperarea cu privire la readmisie și legislația privind controlul frontierelor. Scopul principal al acestui regulament este de a simplifica procedura de aplicare a vizelor, precum și de a asigura o mai bună securitate a frontierelor Uniunii Europene împotriva imigrării ilegale și a altor activități legate de migrarea ilegală și traficul de persoane. În conformitate cu prevederile acestui regulament, cetățenii țărilor terțe pot fi scutiți de obligația de a avea viză în cazul în care țara lor de origine respectă criteriile stabilite de Uniunea Europeană. Aceste criterii pot include, de exemplu, respectarea drepturilor omului, situația privind securitatea țării, stabilitatea economică și politica externă. Scopul acestei scutiri de viză este de a facilita călătoriile, menținând în același timp securitatea frontierelor externe ale UE și combaterea imigrației ilegale. Pe de altă parte, țările terțe ale căror cetățeni sunt supuși obligației de a avea viză sunt cele care nu îndeplinesc criteriile stabilite de Uniunea Europeană și, ca atare, reprezintă un risc mai mare pentru securitatea frontierei externe a UE. Acesta înseamnă că cetățenii acestor țări trebuie să obțină o viză înainte de a putea intra în spațiul Schengen, urmând astfel să se supună unor controale mai riguroase și să se asigure că nu reprezintă un risc pentru UE sau țările membre. În concluzie, acest regulament stabilește lista țărilor terțe ale căror cetățeni trebuie să obțină o viză atunci când trec frontierele externe ale Uniunii, precum și pe cei ale căror cetățeni sunt scutiți de această cerință. Regulamentul menționează anumite criterii și condiții pentru a evalua fiecare țară în funcție de risk și colabarea cu statele UE într-un context de securitate frontiere și migrație."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Giants' defense was trashed by the media during Week 4, their bye week, as they had allowed a whopping 92 points in their first three games, roughly 31 per game. After forcing a punt, the Giants drove to the Washington 29, but Jay Feely was wide left on a 47-yard attempt. Aided by a William Joseph roughing-the-passer penalty on 3rd-and-11 that would have forced a Washington punt, Mark Brunell drove the Redskins to the Giants' 21, where John Hall nailed a 39-yard field goal. Manning was unfazed, finding Amani Toomer on a 44-yard completion to move the ball to the Washington 10, and apparently finding him for a touchdown pass of 5 yards three plays later, but the score was nullified by a Jeremy Shockey pass-interference penalty. Feely knocked in a chip shot of 24 yards to tie the score, 3-3, early in the second quarter. Manning would again use the big play to help the Giants to their next score, finding Plaxico Burress on a 46-yard completion that gave the Giants the ball at the Redskins' 22. Soon after, Feely hit a 34-yard field goal to give the Giants their first lead since Week 2. After forcing a punt, Manning led the Giants on a 14-play, 84-yard drive, capped by a 32-yard field goal by Feely, his third of the quarter and half. The Giants' offense finally ground into gear on the first possession of the second half, going on a 15-play, 69-yard drive that ate up 8:05 of the clock, capped by a 2-yard touchdown toss from Manning to Burress.

Determine the sentiment: Rob Schneider is a famous comedian cause of his movements, facials and performances of \\"not humans\\". This time he is The Animal. Marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero and one day, nobody takes a call from a man that gets attacked, so Marvin has to take this case and save the attacked man. But on his way to the crime scene, he crashes with his car and gets really damaged. He doesn't remember what happens and at the next ordinary day, his life is not same when he finds out that he has animal instincts. Of course, we got our female that our main character is trying to reach but his tryings, are useless. She is played by Collen Haskell. There are no negative characters. The negative character, is destiny if I could use this metaphor. Marvin should find out, how to become a normal human being again. By the way-his animal instincts, helps him in some situations. Schneider's performance is a so-so. The movie is so unreal that gets stupid at some moments but it is one of those movies, called mindless fun as I have written above. So watch it for the monkey style Rob Schneider but it is definitely not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that Schneider appears in. He is a great comedian but this is not his best movie.","output":"Analyzing the sentiment of the given text involves examining the tone, feelings and emotions conveyed. Throughout the text, the sentiment is somewhat mixed.  Firstly, there are positive sentiments expressed towards Rob Schneider as a comedian, although the reviewer does not believe this is his best work, which conveys a mild negative sentiment.  Secondly, the storyline discussed seems to contain elements of comedy, suspense, and adventure, hinting at a mixture of positive and negative sentiments. The character Marvin's journey is described intriguingly, with the transition from a more mundane life to one driven by animal instincts. However, this is not entirely positive since he also wants to become a normal human again.  Thirdly, the movie described is called \\"mindless fun\\" and at times \\"stupid\\" and \\"unreal\\", suggesting a negative sentiment. However, the use of the term \\"mindless fun\\" implies that one might enjoy the movie should they not take it too seriously, hinting at a somewhat positive sentiment.  Finally, the line about Rob Schneider not being one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that Schneider appears in implies a negative sentiment towards the film. Given these examples, overall I would say the sentiment leans slightly more toward negative, due to the criticisms of the movie and Rob Schneider's performance in it, even if there are certain positive aspects mentioned as well. The criticisms seem to outweigh the positives, resulting in an overall mildly negative sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They lose individuals through deaths and emigration. These factors together determine how fast a population grows.   Q: What do populations gain through births and immigration?   Choices:  - humans  - Over Population  - Over Crowding  - individuals  A: Answer:","output":"From the given paragraph, we can deduce that populations gain individuals through births and immigration. The statement mentions that these two factors, along with deaths and emigration, collectively determine the growth rate of a population. Therefore, the answer to the question \\"What do populations gain through births and immigration?\\" is \\"individuals.\\" Although the other choices provided - humans, overpopulation, and overcrowding - might be related to population growth or movements, they are not accurately aligned with the specific information given in the paragraph. These concepts might emerge as an outcome or consequence of population growth, rather than being what populations directly gain through births and immigration. To elaborate, when a population increases due to births and immigration, it simply means that more individuals are either being born or moving into a specific area. This increase in individuals could, over time, create issues such as overpopulation and overcrowding, particularly if the infrastructure and resources in the area cannot support the increased number of inhabitants. However, these issues are not a direct result of births and immigration but rather a consequence of more people living in a confined space. The mention of \\"humans\\" in the list of choices could be seen as partially correct, considering that human populations consist of individuals. Nevertheless, the provided paragraph does not specifically refer to human populations but rather to populations in general. This term could also apply to animal or plant populations, for instance.

Answer the following question: Title: a philosophical rather than religious journey Review: It is saddening to read the reviews posted because this novel is not a Christian tract and in fact addresses that margin of life where one observes human behavior, including one's own, and begins to wonder where it may lead, if anywhere. It is not a religious book but in fact a philosophical one, in the guise of a journal. One can read it with Boethius, Anne Frank, Camus or maybe even John Kennedy Toole (A Confederacy of Dunces. Had to throw that oddity in...) But the point is that this book appeals even to atheists like Albert Camus, and there is a reason for that. It skims very near the glowing core of fundamental issues without lapsing into easy solutions. And it does have a plot, on some levels ironic. But irony is too often lost on the faithful, and too often the end rather than the means to understanding for the faithless. Note that in France, it is regarded as one of the top half dozen books of the 20th century. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","output":"This product review conveys a positive sentiment. The reviewer appreciates the novel for addressing the margin of life, human behavior, and its philosophical nature.

Jean-Christophe Lafaille (31 March 1965 - 27 January 2006 [presumed]) was a French mountaineer noted for a number of difficult ascents in the Alps and Himalaya, and for what has been described as \\"perhaps the finest self-rescue ever performed in the Himalaya\\", when he was forced to descend the mile-high south face of Annapurna alone with a broken arm, after his climbing partner had been killed in a fall. He climbed eleven of the fourteen eight-thousand-metre peaks, many of them alone or by previously unclimbed routes, but disappeared during a solo attempt to make the first winter ascent of Makalu, the world's fifth highest mountain. After Annapurna, Lafaille resolved never to climb again, but during his long physical and psychological recovery he began scrambling in the foothills of the Alps, and eventually returned to extreme climbing. In the Alps he carried out an enchainment of nine north faces in fifteen days, skiing from mountain to mountain, and made the first ascent of the Lafaille Route on the Petit Dru, which at the time was considered the hardest route in the Alps, but his most important climbs were in the Himalaya.  A year after his accident on Annapurna, he climbed Cho Oyu, and then in 1994 he climbed a new route, solo, on the north face of Shishapangma. It was the first of many solo ascents of 8000 meter peaks, including consecutive ascents of Gasherbrum I and Gasherbrum II in four days in 1996, and Manaslu in 2001.  Annapurna remained an obsession for Lafaille, and he would later call his autobiography Prisoner of Annapurna. He returned to the mountain three times. The first time he made a solo attempt on the British line on the South Face, which failed due to poor snow conditions. In 1998 he returned to the same route with a larger team, but the expedition was abandoned when a team member was killed in an avalanche. He finally reached the summit in 2002 with Alberto Inurrategi via the long, committing east ridge.  By 2003 Lafaille had decided to try to climb all fourteen 8000-metre peaks; but unlike many of the mountaineers who take on this goal, he had no desire simply to climb them by well established routes, in large expeditions and with bottled oxygen. He preferred to continue trying to achieve new routes or solo ascents, or to climb in the more demanding winter season. In 2003 he climbed Nanga Parbat, Dhaulagiri (solo) and Broad Peak in a two-month period. The last of these nearly killed him when he fell into a crevasse and then developed high altitude pulmonary edema. He was rescued by Ed Viesturs and Denis Urubko.  In December 2004 he made a solo ascent of Shishapangma. It was intended to be the first winter ascent of the mountain, but he reached the summit on 11 December which was seen as too early to be classed as a true winter ascent.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? is n't nearly as funny as it thinks it is","output":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is\\" can be considered negative. To reach this conclusion, let's analyze the sentence in terms of its structure and the language used. On the surface level, the sentence can be broken down into two components: the negation (isn't) and the qualifier (nearly as funny). The use of \\"isn't\\" immediately sets a negative tone, as it is indicating that something does not meet expectations or possesses a certain quality. Here, the negation is applied to the perceived humor of the subject in question. The second part of the sentence, \\"nearly as funny as it thinks it is,\\" conveys that the degree of hilarity or humor anticipated by the subject is reportedly overestimated by a significant amount. This discrepancy between the subject's perception and reality suggests a negative evaluation since the humor falls short of what is believed or projected. Using the word \\"thinks\\" further highlights the overconfidence in the entity's humor. Additionally, the tone of the sentence could be interpreted as mildly sarcastic or critical, as the author is, in essence, remarking that the subject believes it is funnier than it actually is – which indirectly questions the subject's judgment or self-awareness. Sarcasm is often associated with negativity and critical assessments. To summarize, the sentiment of the sentence \\"isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is\\" is negative due to the use of negation, the discrepancy between anticipation and reality it describes, and the potentially sarcastic tone. This combination of factors indicates a less-than-favorable view of the subject."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The group has been through several personnel changes, but lead vocalist, guitarist and songwriter Mikael Akerfeldt has remained Opeth's primary driving force throughout the years. Opeth has consistently incorporated progressive, folk, blues, classical and jazz influences into its usually lengthy compositions, as well as strong influences from death metal, especially in their early works. Many songs include acoustic guitar passages and strong dynamic shifts, as well as both death growls and clean vocals. Context: Opeth recorded its debut album, Orchid, with producer Dan Swano in April 1994. Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.  After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swano. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.  In 1997, after the tour, Akerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Akerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martin Lopez (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martin Mendez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Akerfeldt. Lopez and Mendez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Akerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martins to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. Lopez made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden's \\"Remember Tomorrow\\", which was included on the album A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden.  With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordstrom, at Studio Fredman in August 1997. Although Opeth had Mendez, due to time constraints Akerfeldt played bass on the album. My Arms, Your Hearse was released to critical acclaim on August 18, 1998. Question: Which album was released in 1994. Whats the answer?","output":"Opeth's debut album, Orchid, was recorded in 1994, but it was not released until May 15, 1995.

The premise contains information about a woman wearing a cowboy hat and her proximity to a blue building, while the hypothesis claims that the woman is asleep. There is insufficient data in the premise to draw a conclusion about the woman's state of consciousness or to determine whether or not she is asleep. To accurately assess the validity of the hypothesis, more information would be needed. The missing information might include clues such as: 1. The woman's posture and body position: Is she lying down, sitting, or standing? If she is lying down in a relaxed position with her eyes closed, it could be more likely that she is asleep. 2. The woman's facial expression and eye movement: If her eyes are closed, and she appears relaxed, it could support the hypothesis that she is asleep. On the other hand, if her eyes are open, and she is engaging with her surroundings, it would be difficult to argue that she is sleeping. 3. The time and context of the scene: The time of day and the environment in which the woman is situated could offer information on whether or not it is plausible for her to be asleep. For instance, if it is nighttime and the blue building is a residential place, the possibility of her sleeping might be more credible. Conversely, if it is during the day and the scene is in a busy public area, it would be less likely that the woman is asleep. 4. Any external factors: Factors that might affect the woman's state of consciousness, such as any stimuli or activities happening around her or any items she is holding or interacting with, could contribute to determining if sleep is a reasonable conclusion. In summary, we cannot infer the truth of the hypothesis based solely on the premise provided.

His distinguished performance helped the Spurs mount a dominating rout at White Hart Lane, the club's home ground. This unforgettable outing for Kane, arguably one of England's finest footballers in recent times, emphasised his sheer amount of talent and the significant influence he exerts on the Tottenham side. After only recently recovering from an injurious blow, his triumphant return to the pitch was amiably celebrated by the Spurs' faithful, who lauded their star striker for his eye-catching display. Unleashing his relentless prowess on the opposition, Kane's well-taken treble — a feat requiring precision, skill, and game intelligence — demonstrated his quintessential attacking finesse. The commanding performance culminated in a stirring exhibition of high-calibre football, ensuring the Spurs' dominance throughout the game. However, the spectacle at White Hart Lane wasn't solely concentrated on Kane's exceptional hat-trick. An unexpected turn of events saw the formidable striker taking over the goalkeeping duties, post the sending-off of Hugo Lloris. Despite being an uncommon sight, it illuminates Kane's versatility as a player, ready to fill in the gaps whenever there's a call for duty. It was demonstrative of the unwavering team spirit that exists within Tottenham's ranks, with the team's beloved striker not hesitating to don the gloves when the situation demanded. In the midst of the Kane-dominated narrative unfolding at White Hart Lane, Erik Lamela managed to construct his own spotlight. The outstanding Argentine international marked his contribution to the game with an absolute screamer, a goal so visually impressive that it sent the home crowd into resounding applause. Lamela’s sheer audacity to attempt such an incredible shot, and successfully executing it, stood as a testament to the attacking brilliance that Tottenham can boast of. This game was undoubtedly a football exhibition, an amalgamation of scintillating goals, tactical prowess, and an impressive display of resilience and teamwork. Kane’s return and his subsequent high-quality performance helped spur the team towards a substantial victory. While Lloris's untimely dismissal could have potentially disrupted their stride, Tottenham showed an admirable sense of unity and adaptability, providing a staggering reminder of their Premier League contendership. The match also underscored the quality of Mauricio Pochettino's squad, highlighting the team's depth and flexibility, backed by solid performances from Lamela, Kane, and the rest of the squad. With a rejuvenated Kane leading the charge, Tottenham surely emerge as a force to be reckoned with, capable of challenging the upper echelons of the Premier League. A game filled with thumping goals, unexpected goalkeeping shifts, and a relentless attacking display, the rout at White Hart Lane served as an enthralling spectacle for any football enthusiast. As the fans revel in this victory, they will be even more reassured of their team's capabilities, all thanks to a triumphant return from Harry Kane and an unyielding team performance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: -  People dig up coal from the ground - People burn coal for heat or electricity - Pollution from the coal goes into the sky - Coal pollution enters clouds - Clouds rain over an area  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step in this process would likely involve the consequences and effects of the coal pollution on the environment, ecosystems, and human health.  When coal is burned for heat or electricity, it releases pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter, and carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. As these pollutants mix with the water vapor present in clouds, they form substances like acid rain or smog, which negatively impact the environment. When the clouds carrying coal pollution rain over an area, several outcomes can occur: 1. Acid Rain: Coal pollution can cause acid rain, which is the result of air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides combining with atmospheric moisture to form sulfuric and nitric acids. These acids as part of the rainwater can lower the pH of natural water bodies, such as rivers, lakes, and soils. This can lead to the decline of plant and animal species in the affected area, reducing biodiversity and negatively impacting ecosystems. Acid rain also contributes to the corrosion of buildings and infrastructure.  2. Contamination of Water Sources: As the polluted rainwater enters rivers, lakes, or groundwater systems, it can contaminate drinking water sources. This can be hazardous to the health of humans and animals that rely on these water sources, as the pollution may contain heavy metals and other toxic substances. The contamination of water can also affect aquatic life, leading to reproductive issues and even fish kills in extreme cases. 3. Soil Pollution: Polluted rainwater seeping into the soil can alter the soil's chemical composition and nutrient balance, making it tough for plants to grow. Furthermore, the polluted soil may contaminate the plants that grow on it, negatively affecting the entire ecosystem. This can, in turn, affect agricultural practices, causing lower crop yields and potential health risks for humans and animals consuming the affected crops. 4. Human Health Issues: Coal pollution that enters the atmosphere can settle on the ground or be inhaled by people. Breathing in such polluted air has been linked to various respiratory and cardiovascular health issues, such as asthma, bronchitis, and even heart attacks. Children, the elderly, and people suffering from pre-existing health conditions are particularly vulnerable to these health risks. 5. Climate Change: Carbon dioxide released from burning coal is a significant contributor to the greenhouse gases responsible for global climate change. Increased CO2 levels lead to a rise in global temperatures, resulting in the melting of polar ice caps, rising sea levels, and other devastating consequences for the planet. In conclusion, the final step in the process involves various negative environmental, ecological, and human health impacts of coal pollution. It highlights the need for a transition to cleaner energy alternatives and a reduction in the dependence on coal to help mitigate these consequences."},{"instruction":"Title: Perfect Review: Leaves my hair looking nice and straight !

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What philosopies arose during the Hellenistic period? Context: The Hellenistic period covers the period of ancient Greek (Hellenic) history and Mediterranean history between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and the emergence of the Roman Empire as signified by the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt the following year. At this time, Greek cultural influence and power was at its peak in Europe, Africa and Asia, experiencing prosperity and progress in the arts, exploration, literature, theatre, architecture, music, mathematics, philosophy, and science. For example, competitive public games took place, ideas in biology, and popular entertainment in theaters. It is often considered a period of transition, sometimes even of decadence or degeneration, compared to the enlightenment of the Greek Classical era. The Hellenistic period saw the rise of New Comedy, Alexandrian poetry, the Septuagint and the philosophies of Stoicism and Epicureanism. Greek Science was advanced by the works of the mathematician Euclid and the polymath Archimedes. The religious sphere expanded to include new gods such as the Greco-Egyptian Serapis, eastern deities such as Attis and Cybele and the Greek adoption of Buddhism.

Acting, script, Quincy Jones' score, cinematography, editing, etc. -- just fantastic. As most viewers know, this movie is based on Truman Capote's book about the famous murder of a Kansas farm family (the Clutters) by a couple of young guys during a misguided robbery. I've never seen a movie that so brilliantly turned a true story into a riveting film. The actors are solid across the board, but the focus is on the killers, Dick and Perry, and the law enforcement team pursuing them. Scott Wilson, as Dick Hickock is amazing. Cocky, twitchy, and devoid of compassion he comes across so charming, oily and plausible. Robert Blake as Perry Smith is extraordinary as well -- lonely, and at once empathetic and cold-blooded. Who could fold these characteristics into one individual and make us buy it? He does, and it's brilliant! A key point of the book is how it took the intersection of these two very differently sociopathic individuals to create the critical mass to commit such a stupid and heinous crime, and these two actors make it work beautifully. Both had moments in their subsequent careers, but these performances are high water marks, and that stands for acting period. The cops are wonderful too. Leading the investigation is John Forsythe, but the other three detectives are great as well. Unlike contemporary movies where producers feel it necessary to endow police with superhuman assets or foibles, these are just genuine flatfeet, working the case with determination and competence. They seem so real. I've never seen cops on the screen so powerful in their authenticity; and I've seen most of the crime classics going way back. Really one of a kind in this respect. PARTIAL SPOILER COMING (this movie's unique in that you already know what's happened, but I'm warning for the record). Of course, the best scenes from the best crime shows and movies are the interrogations -- the intellectual fencing matches between the cops and the crooks, Mano a Mano. This movie has hands down the best interrogation scenes you'll ever see on film. Watch Dick and Perry try to bluff their way through and slowly unravel, unaware the cops have the goods on them. But the cops need to deftly prep their suspects to fracture their alibis and hopefully elicit confessions. This is some of the best acting you'll ever see. Think Glengarry Glen Ross without the showboating. To help translate the sad and horrific angles of this true story, ICB was filmed at the actual Clutter house, and I've heard the Clutters were played by film students to give them a genuine feel. It works. These seem like decent, simple folk. It makes the crime so palpable and sad. I'll stop here. It's not a feel-good movie, but it is one of the best movies ever made, and so unique, it's mandatory viewing for every film buff. Question: is it a negative review?

Translate this to English?","output":"Is the \\"Mali af\\" a smart public policy or an election game? The term \\"mali af\\" in Turkish can be translated to \\"financial amnesty\\" or \\"tax amnesty\\" in English. Therefore, the question asks whether the financial amnesty is a smart public policy or merely an election game. Financial amnesty, or tax amnesty, refers to a limited-time offer by a government to allow taxpayers to pay a specified amount, generally lower than the total amount due, in exchange for forgiveness of a tax liability relating to a previous period, without fear of criminal or legal prosecution. This policy can have both advantages and disadvantages, and its effectiveness will depend on various factors, such as economic conditions, legislation, and public perception of the program. Advantages of financial amnesty may include: 1. Increased revenue collection: A well-designed and well-implemented tax amnesty program can lead to increased tax revenue for the government during the short-term amnesty period. This is because taxpayers who previously evaded their tax obligations would be more willing to come forward and pay their outstanding taxes at the lower amnesty rate. 2. Voluntary compliance: Tax amnesty programs can encourage higher levels of voluntary compliance in the future by providing a one-time opportunity for taxpayers to “clean the slate” and start anew. If taxpayers perceive the amnesty program as fair and effective, they may be more likely to comply with tax laws in the future. 3. Formalization of the economy: Tax amnesty programs can help to formalize the economy by bringing previously undeclared income into the tax net. This, in turn, can contribute to the growth and stability of the economy over time. 4. Reduced enforcement costs: Tax amnesty programs can help reduce the costs associated with enforcing tax compliance, since more taxpayers would be compelled to come forward and pay their outstanding tax liabilities without the need for aggressive enforcement measures. On the other hand, potential disadvantages and risks of financial amnesty might include: 1. Undermining tax morale: Tax amnesty programs could lead to a decrease in tax morale among those who have been compliant with their tax obligations. These taxpayers may feel that the amnesty program is unfair since it rewards tax evaders while they have been paying their taxes diligently. 2. Perception of a recurring amnesty: Taxpayers might anticipate future amnesties and become less likely to comply with their tax obligations, knowing that they might receive another opportunity to settle their debts at a reduced rate. 3. Loss of revenue: Depending on the specifics of the amnesty program, the government might collect less revenue than it would have had it pursued the full tax liability of non-compliant taxpayers. 4. Short-term focus: Tax amnesty programs are often implemented as a short-term solution to generate immediate revenue, which might not address the root causes of tax evasion and compliance issues. Additionally, they could divert attention and resources from more comprehensive and long-lasting tax reform efforts. In conclusion, whether financial amnesty is a smart public policy or an election game will largely depend on the program's design, implementation, and effectiveness in addressing the issues of tax evasion and compliance. A well-designed and implemented tax amnesty program with clear objectives and fairness can lead to increased revenue collection, voluntary compliance, and a formalized economy. However, it may also result in negative consequences such as undermining tax morale, fostering expectations of recurring amnesties, and providing only short-term revenue increases without addressing underlying issues. Therefore, a careful balance must be struck, and governments need to evaluate the long-term benefits and potential drawbacks before introducing financial amnesties."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  On Christmas Eve 1950, a man named Wilfred Butler, engulfed in flames, runs out of his mansion near the small town of East Willard, Massachusetts. His death is ruled accidental, and the house left to his grandson Jeffrey. Twenty years later in present day 1970, lawyer John Carter arrives in East Willard on Christmas Eve with his assistant and mistress Ingrid, having been charged by Jeffrey Butler to sell the house. Carter meets with the town's leading citizens: Mayor Adams; Sheriff Bill Mason; the taciturn Charlie Towman, who owns the local newspaper; and Tess Howard, who operates the town's telephone switchboard. They all agree to buy the Butler mansion on behalf of the town for the bargain price of 50,000, which Jeffrey Butler requires to be paid in cash the next day. Carter and Ingrid stay the night at the Butler mansion, unaware that they are being watched by an unseen man who has just escaped from a local mental hospital and just arrived in East Willard in a stolen car. After dinner, Carter and Ingrid retreat to a bedroom to have sex. Their unknown stalker enters the bedroom and brutally murders them both with an ax, and then reads from a Bible before placing a crucifix in Ingrid's hand. The killer calls the sheriff, asking him to come investigate Carter's disappearance, and introduces himself as the house's owner. While talking with Tess, who forwards his call, he calls himself \\"Marianne\\". At nightfall, Jeffrey Butler arrives at the mansion to meet with Carter, but finds it locked and empty. He drives to the mayor's home, where he meets Diane, the mayor's daughter. The mayor has gone to the county's bank to obtain the required cash for the payment, so she redirects Jeffrey to the sheriff's office.

The storm is the strongest to hit the state in decades, with catastrophic flooding expected. The last Category 4 storm to hit the U.S. was Charley in 2004 in Florida, while the last Category 4 storm to hit Texas was Carla in 1961.      Residents staying in the area frantically stocked up on food, water and gas, while others heading out of the storm's path boarded up windows and doors of their homes and businesses.      Airlines canceled flights, schools were shuttered while concerts and other planned events in Houston and coastal cities were postponed.

At the time, the storm's eye was 30 miles away from the coastal city of Corpus Christi, Texas.      The National Weather Service warned Harvey could bring a potentially devastating storm surge, heavy rainfall and wind hazards to the Lone Star State's coast. A tornado watch is in effect for areas of southeastern Texas and southwest Louisiana.      Life-threatening storm surge waters could reach 9 to 13 feet above ground level. Catastrophic flooding is expected across parts of the area. And rainfall will be heavy, with an estimated 15 to 30 inches of rain falling in many areas and as high as 40 inches in some from today through Wednesday, the National Weather Service said.      ABC News      Here's a projected timeline for Hurricane Harvey thus far, according to forecasts from the National Weather Service:      Saturday: Harvey roared ashore late Friday evening. The storm's path going forward remains uncertain but it is forecast to meander near or just inland of the middle of the Texas coast through the weekend.      Sunday through Monday: Some forecast models show Harvey expanding across the Gulf Coast as it makes its way over southern Texas.      Tuesday through Wednesday: The hurricane could, according to some models, move northeast and then re-emerge briefly over the Gulf of Mexico before making a second landfall in northeastern Texas or western Louisiana.      ABC News      Preparation and evacuations      Storm preparation began in earnest on Wednesday and intensified on Thursday. Shoppers lined up to fill their carts with food and water, while lines for gas stretched out of many stations. Some people also got to work boarding up their homes and businesses to protect against the expected 100-plus mile per hour winds. Even the Texas Department of Transportation in Victoria boarded up its windows on Thursday.      As of Friday, governors had declared states of emergencies for 30 counties in Texas and statewide for Louisiana.

We'll handle it again.\\"      AP      The Coast Guard said Thursday it was sending shallow-depth vessels to Texas and Louisiana that are capable of responding in flooded urban areas. And with gale force winds predicted to arrive within 24 hours, the Coast Guard on Thursday also ordered a nearly total closure of ports in Houston, Texas City, Galveston, Freeport and Corpus Christi.      By Friday afternoon, the Coast Guard had already completed its first search-and-rescue mission, rescuing 12 people from a 160-foot vessel near Port Mansfield, Texas.      Texas officials announced mandatory evacuations for all seven counties on the coast: Calhoun County, San Patricio County, Refugio County, Brazoria County, Jackson County, Victoria County and Matagorda County. In four of those countries, officials ordered their entire county to evacuate and warned those who chose to stay behind that their rescue could not be guaranteed. Voluntary evacuations were urged for residents in other areas.

That storm made landfall in Kenedy County, just south of Corpus Christi, according to the National Weather Service -- a path that was similar to the one forecast for Hurricane Harvey.      Here's a timeline of some of the recent hurricanes to hit Texas and the damage they caused:      Hurricane Bret (Aug. 22, 1999): The Category 3 storm made landfall on a Sunday evening about 60 miles south of Corpus Christi. Luckily, the area is sparsely populated compared to Corpus Christi, and so problems were limited. Central Kenedy County received more than 15 inches of rain over two days, according to the NWS. The storm did about 88 million in damages in 2017 figures. Four Americans died in the storm.      Hurricane Claudette (July 15, 2003): While Claudette came ashore as only a Category 1 storm with maximum winds of 90 miles per hour, it did extensive damage after coming ashore at Port O'Connor, about 100 miles northeast of Corpus Christi, and moving inland across Calhoun County, according to the NWS. Two people were killed.      Hurricane Rita (Sept. 24, 2005): The last Category 3 storm to make landfall in Texas was Rita, though it did so much farther north than Harvey is expected to land. Rita, which hit just three weeks after Hurricane Katrina, made landfall right along the Texas-Louisiana border with sustained winds of 120 miles per hour. The town of Center, Texas -- near Nacogdoches -- received 10.48 inches of rain in the storm, but it moved quickly through the area, limiting rainfall accumulation. Still, 59 people from Texas were killed in the storm, according to the NWS, and a number of others died in a bus accident during evacuations.      Hurricane Ike (Sept. 13, 2008): Ike, the last hurricane to make landfall in Texas, hit near Galveston as a Category 2 storm after decimating areas of the Caribbean in the week prior with winds as high as 145 miles per hour. By the time it hit Galveston, winds were at a sustained maximum of 110 miles per hour, according to the NWS. The massive size of Ike resulted in substantial rainfall totals for the area. The highest total was 18.9 inches near Spring Creek, south of Houston, according to the NWS. Some sensors measuring storm surge actually failed due to salt water, according to a NOAA report, but the highest total was 17.5 feet in Chambers County.

Given the following context:  During ancient times, Gibraltar was regarded by the peoples of the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The Phoenicians were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a shrine to the genius loci of the place, as did the Carthaginians and Romans after them. Excavations in the cave have shown that pottery, jewellery and Egyptian scarabs were left as offerings to the gods, probably in the hope of securing safe passage through the dangerous waters of the Strait of Gibraltar.The Rock was revered by the Greeks and Romans as one of the two Pillars of Hercules, created by the demigod during his tenth labour when he smashed through a mountain separating the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. According to a Phocaean Greek traveller who visited in the sixth century BC, there were temples and altars to Hercules on the Rock where passing travellers made sacrifices. The Spanish later symbolised the importance of the Pillars of Hercules with a heraldic device consisting of a pair of columns with a scroll wrapped around them – a symbol that became the  sign and the related Portuguese cifrão ().To the Ancient Romans, Gibraltar was known as Mons Calpe, a name perhaps derived from the Phoenician word kalph, \\"hollowed out\\", presumably in reference to the many limestone caves in the Rock. It was well-known to ancient geographers, but there is no known archaeological evidence of permanent settlements from the ancient period. According to the Roman writer Avienus, the ancient Greek traveller Euctemon recorded that thirty stadia separate [the Pillars of Hercules]; [Euctemon] says that they bristle with woods all over and are always unwelcoming to seamen. Indeed he says that on those are both temples and altars to Hercules.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many percent are not  female householder with no husband present?","output":"Title: Exploring the Percentage of Non-Female Householders with No Husband Present Introduction: Gender dynamics and familial structures have undergone significant changes over the past few decades. Women occupy a large portion of the workforce, leading to a shift in traditional gender roles within households. However, there is still a percentage of households that are not headed by a female with no husband present. This article delves into the various factors that contribute to these statistics, providing insights into the demographics and societal nuances that define non-female householders with no husband present. Step 1: Determine the source of data To accurately answer the question, we need to find a reliable source of data. The United States Census Bureau is one such organization that conducts comprehensive surveys and shares data on households and families across the country. Their American Community Survey (ACS) is an annual survey providing detailed demographic and social statistics. For this article, we will consider using the most recent data available. Step 2: Analyze the Data Once we obtain the required dataset, we can proceed to analyze the exact percentage of non-female households without a husband present. This involves breaking down the data into categories, including male-headed households, households with unmarried couples, single-person households, and households headed by non-family members. Step 3: Interpret the Findings Upon calculating the percentage, we need to interpret the results and understand the factors that contribute to these figures. This may involve considering regional influences, socioeconomic factors, and cultural practices/preferences that can affect household compositions. Step 4: Compare and Contrast It could be beneficial to compare the current statistics with historical data, highlighting the pivotal events or societal changes that led to the evolution of such household structures. This would enable us to understand the shifts in gender roles and provide context to how the contemporary statistics were shaped. Step 5: Discuss Implications and Future Trends Explaining the implications of these findings is essential to understanding the societal impact. This includes analyzing the consequences on gender equality, economic growth, and overall well-being of the population. Moreover, it is crucial to discuss potential future trends in households, accounting for the changing gender roles, technological advancements, and evolving family structures. Conclusion: Understanding the percentage of non-female householders with no husband present is crucial to contextualizing societal shifts, evaluating gender roles, and developing a comprehensive portrait of modern households. By examining the factors contributing to these statistics, we get a glimpse into the complex interplay of culture, economics, and demographics. Determining the accurate percentage of such households and understanding its implications contribute to a more informed perspective on contemporary family structures, gender dynamics, and societal progression."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In April 1997, the band convened at Buck's Kauai vacation home to record demos of material intended for the next album. The band sought to reinvent its sound and intended to incorporate drum loops and percussion experiments. Just as the sessions were due to begin in October, Berry decided, after months of contemplation and discussions with Downs and Mills, to tell the rest of the band that he was quitting. Berry told his bandmates that he would not quit if they would break up as a result, so Stipe, Buck, and Mills agreed to carry on as a three-piece with his blessing. Berry publicly announced his departure three weeks later in October 1997. Berry told the press, \\"I'm just not as enthusiastic as I have been in the past about doing this anymore . . . I have the best job in the world. But I'm kind of ready to sit back and reflect and maybe not be a pop star anymore.\\" Stipe admitted that the band would be different without a major contributor: \\"For me, Mike, and Peter, as R.E.M., are we still R.E.M.? I guess a three-legged dog is still a dog. It just has to learn to run differently.\\"The band cancelled its scheduled recording sessions as a result of Berry's departure. \\"Without Bill it was different, confusing\\", Mills later said. \\"We didn't know exactly what to do. We couldn't rehearse without a drummer.\\" The remaining members of R.E.M. resumed work on the album in February 1998 at Toast Studios in San Francisco. The band ended its decade-long collaboration with Scott Litt and hired Pat McCarthy to produce the record. Nigel Godrich was taken on as assistant producer, and drafted in Screaming Trees member Barrett Martin and Beck's touring drummer Joey Waronker. The recording process was plagued with tension, and the group came close to disbanding. Bertis Downs called an emergency meeting where the band members sorted out their problems and agreed to continue as a group.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes?\\" with the following options:  - migraines  - pollen  - cancer  - orchids  - genes  - a cuticle  - A computer  - mitosis A:","output":"Given the two facts provided, the answer to the question \\"What is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes?\\" is mitosis.  Fact 1 states that cell division is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes, and Fact 2 states that mitosis is cell division. Eukaryotes and prokaryotes are two types of cells that have distinct differences in their structure and functions. Eukaryotes, which include multicellular organisms such as plants, animals, and fungi, have a complex cellular structure with a nucleus enclosed within a nuclear membrane and several organelles. On the other hand, prokaryotes, which include bacteria and archaea, have a simpler structure with no nucleus or membrane-bound organelles. Mitosis is a type of cell division that results in the formation of two daughter cells, each having the same number and kind of chromosomes as the parent cell. This is essential for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction in living organisms. The process of mitosis is more complex in eukaryotes compared to prokaryotes due to several reasons: 1. Presence of nucleus: In eukaryotes, the genetic material is contained within the nucleus, which must break down and reform during mitosis. In prokaryotes, the genetic material is present in the cytoplasm and does not require any nuclear envelope breakdown or reformation. 2. Multiple linear chromosomes: Eukaryotic cells have multiple linear chromosomes that need to be replicated, condensed, and separated during the process of mitosis. On the other hand, prokaryotes have a single, circular chromosome, which makes the process of cell division simpler. 3. Spindle apparatus: The formation and function of the spindle apparatus, which helps in organizing and separating the chromosomes during mitosis, is more complex in eukaryotic cells. In prokaryotes, the process of chromosome separation is relatively simpler and does not involve a well-defined spindle apparatus. 4. Cell cycle regulation: The cell cycle, which includes the phases of cell growth, DNA replication, and mitosis, is regulated by a complex network of proteins and checkpoints in eukaryotes. Prokaryotic cell division, on the other hand, is governed by a simpler set of regulatory mechanisms.  Therefore, based on the complexity of mitosis in eukaryotes compared to prokaryotes, the correct option in the given list would be mitosis."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: BONN, Germany – A French woman held hostage in Yemen appeared for the first time in a video that surfaced on Monday, appealing for her release. Isabelle Prime, who works as a consultant with ties to the World Bank, was abducted from Sanaa along with her Yemeni translator in February. The translator was released shortly afterward, but there was no word until now on Prime. In her first video since her disappearance, Prime appeared to be under severe duress -- sitting in the desert dressed in a black robe and looking frail and anguished. She addressed French President Francois Hollande and Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi by name, saying, \\"please bring me to France fast because I am really really tired.\\" The video of Prime was viewed by The Associated Press on Monday. The identity of her captors remains unclear, but Yemen, the Arab world's poorest nation, is home to one of the most active and dangerous branches of Al Qaeda. French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal said his government has verified the authenticity of the video and that it was filmed in April. Nadal said officials from the ministry will meet with the Prime family on Tuesday. He told AP that the French government is \\"mobilized to obtain the release\\" of Prime. Yemen has descended into civil war with Shiite rebels in control of the capital, Sanaa, and several other cities. The rebels, known as Houthis, are supported by Iran and allied with army units loyal to the country's ousted President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Hadi, the internationally recognized president, has been forced to flee the country. A military coalition led by Saudi Arabia began conducting airstrikes against rebel positions on March 26, but two months of bombing have done little to push back the rebel forces. The airstrikes and ground-level violence have killed more than 1000 civilians and displaced a half million people. On Monday, coalition warplanes bombed the capital, targeting weapon depots hidden in nearby Noqoum mountain. An Associated Press video showed heavy smoke rising from the mountain as sounds of explosions rocked the area.

The heavy downpours that drenched Augusta on Tuesday would have been greeted by groans from soaked patrons and photographers hoping for snaps of glamourous WAGs.

That’s because each of McIlroy’s four major victories so far has come on courses which have been subjected to heavy rain at some point during the week. Wet conditions hand McIlroy a massive advantage: his huge hitting with sky-high ball flight means he can still fly his ball miles. Shorter hitters or those with low ball flight, meanwhile, will have no roll on the wet fairways and will be hitting their approach shots from miles back.Rory McIlroy is favourite to win the 79th Masters at Augusta NationalBubba Watson is the defending champion and chasing a third Masters winTiger Woods returns to action but has no form and worries over his gameJason Day and other big-hitters look set for strong week at Masters 2015COURSE GUIDE: McIlroy and more stars take you round Augusta NationalCLICK HERE for the Masters 2015 leaderboard   Questions:The Masters, played on the modern-day _, is the one major of the year where a formula for a winner can be identified: long driving + strong early season form + course experience + the week of their lives = green jacket.

Context: On 15 September 1940, known as the Battle of Britain Day, an RAF pilot, Ray Holmes of No. 504 Squadron RAF rammed a German bomber he believed was going to bomb the Palace. Holmes had run out of ammunition and made the quick decision to ram it. Holmes bailed out. Both aircraft crashed. In fact the Dornier Do 17 bomber was empty. It had already been damaged, two of its crew had been killed and the remainder bailed out. Its pilot, Feldwebel Robert Zehbe, landed, only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack. During the Dornier's descent, it somehow unloaded its bombs, one of which hit the Palace. It then crashed into the forecourt of London Victoria station.

He rents a room in the home of widow Charlotte Haze, largely because he is romantically attracted to her adolescent daughter Dolores, also called \\"Lo\\", who he sees while touring the house. Obsessed from boyhood with girls of approximately her age (whom he calls \\"nymphets\\"), Humbert is immediately smitten with Lo and gets married to Charlotte only just to be near her daughter. Charlotte finds Humbert's secret diary and discovers his preference for her daughter. Furious, Charlotte runs out of the house, when she is struck by a car and killed.  Her death frees Humbert to pursue a romantic and sexual relationship with Lo, whom he nicknames \\"Lolita\\". Humbert and Lo then travel the country, staying in various motels before eventually settling in the college town of Beardsley, where Humbert takes a teaching job and Lo begins attending an all-girls Catholic school. However, Lo's increasing boredom with Humbert, combined with her growing desire for independence, fuels a constant tension that lead to a fight between them. Humbert's affection for Lo is also rivaled by another man, playwright Clare Quilty, who has been pursuing Lo since the beginning of the pair's travels. Lo eventually escapes with Quilty, and Humbert's search for them is unsuccessful, especially as he doesn't know Quilty's name. Three years later, Humbert receives a letter from Lo asking for money. Humbert visits Lo, who is now married and pregnant. Humbert asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. He relents and gives her a substantial amount of money. Lo also reveals to Humbert how Quilty actually tracked young girls and took them to Pavor Manor, his home in Parkington, to exploit them for child pornography.

He was forced to flee to Scandinavia in 976 after his half-brother Yaropolk had murdered his other brother Oleg and taken control of Rus. In Scandinavia, with the help of his relative Earl Håkon Sigurdsson, ruler of Norway, Vladimir assembled a Viking army and reconquered Novgorod and Kiev from Yaropolk. As Prince of Kiev, Vladimir's most notable achievement was the Christianization of Kievan Rus', a process that began in 988. The Primary Chronicle states that when Vladimir had decided to accept a new faith instead of the traditional idol-worship (paganism) of the Slavs, he sent out some of his most valued advisors and warriors as emissaries to different parts of Europe. They visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews, and the Muslims before finally arriving in Constantinople. They rejected Islam because, among other things, it prohibited the consumption of alcohol, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow. Upon their arrival home, they convinced Vladimir that the faith of the Byzantine Rite was the best choice of all, upon which Vladimir made a journey to Constantinople and arranged to marry Princess Anna, the sister of Byzantine emperor Basil II. Now answer this question: When did the Christianization of Kievan begin?","output":"The Christianization of Kievan Rus' began in the year 988.

Options: - catch cold - feel lonely - enter college - graduate from high school - finish junior high  Explain why a human would choose \\"graduate from high school\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"graduate from high school\\" To explain why a human would choose \\"graduate from high school\\" as the correct answer, we need to understand the concept of tertiary education and the prerequisites for entering it. Tertiary education, also known as higher education, typically includes universities, colleges, and vocational or technical institutions. It is the education level that follows the completion of secondary education. Now, let's analyze the given options and determine why \\"graduate from high school\\" is the correct choice: 1. Catch cold: Catching a cold is a common illness that has no relevance to entering tertiary education. It is not a requirement or a step taken before pursuing this level of education. Therefore, this option is not correct. 2. Feel lonely: Feeling lonely is an emotional state and is unrelated to the educational prerequisites for pursuing tertiary education. So, this is also not an appropriate answer. 3. Enter college: Entering college is part of tertiary education, not a step taken before going into it. Therefore, this option cannot be the correct answer, since the question is asking about what someone does before entering tertiary education. 4. Graduate from high school: High school graduation is the completion of secondary education, generally required for admission into tertiary education institutions. Earning a high school diploma or equivalent qualification demonstrates that the student has gained the necessary knowledge and skills to advance to a higher level of education. Therefore, graduating from high school is the correct answer to the question. 5.

Write some highlights for the following article: Harvey Weinstein never met a ratings controversy that he couldn't massage into a publicity campaign. He did it in the '90s, when he turned up the heat on the teensploitation psychodrama \\"Kids,\\" all because the film received a rating of NC-17 (which it probably deserved). He did it two years ago, when the downbeat-sexy \\"Blue Valentine\\" got slapped with the same scarlet letter (which it didn't deserve at all). But in the case of \\"Bully,\\" Weinstein isn't just mounting a PR blitz -- he's fighting the good fight. The movie is a sensitive and eye-opening documentary about the epidemic of bullying in American public schools. It's a film that would do well to be seen by as many teenagers as possible, and Weinstein had wanted to show it in schools. Yet \\"Bully\\" received an R rating, all because the F-word is used in it a handful of times. The Weinstein Co. has now decided to release \\"Bully\\" unrated. This doesn't solve the problem, since some theaters refuse to show unrated movies. So the very audience that Bully was made for still might have a hard time getting near it. Weinstein hired David Boies and Ted Olson, the attorneys who helped overturn California's Proposition 8, to take on the Motion Picture Association of America. The MPAA, with its famously fusty, punitive, and -- some would say -- arbitrary ratings system, defended the R rating for \\"Bully,\\" stating that it wouldn't be fair to make an exception just because of the movie's good intentions. I agree that they shouldn't just make an exception: They should do a heck of a lot more. That the MPAA is content to keep a film as humane and as deeply unsensational as \\"Bully\\" away from most of the adolescents whose lives it could possibly help is a folly and outrage. \\"Bully,\\" directed by Lee Hirsch, takes a sympathetic, insightful look at five anguished kids from suburban and rural communities around the country and how the bullying that they've endured has shaped their lives. Tyler, 17 years old, was so mocked by his peers that he hanged himself. Alex, 12, born prematurely (at just 26 weeks), is a sweet, smart kid singled out because of his \\"fish face.\\" He has been slammed into lockers, sat on during bus rides, called \\"b****\\" and \\"f*****\\" -- and after all that, it was only really clear how bad the problem was when he stopped complaining. (Being bullied had become his only reality.) Kelby, a 16-year-old lesbian, suffered abuse to the point that she tried to commit suicide three times. Why are these kids targeted? Some of it is based on looks and prejudice, but much of it represents nothing more -- or less -- than the ostracization of those who are lonely or shy. They're viewed as \\"outsiders,\\" and then vilified for it. \\"Bully\\" is a portrait of good kids reduced to shells of themselves by a climate of toxic hate and fear. There's only one thing missing from the movie, and that's an in-depth look at the bullies themselves. We're forced to guess at what has made them into junior sadists. My own conjecture is that their almost complete lack of empathy represents the channeling of a larger current of intolerance now at loose in the culture -- the kind you see increasingly in politics, not to mention all over the Internet. Arguments against the ratings system have, of course, been made many times before: by directors, producers, and film critics -- and, in 2006, by Kirby Dick in his documentary \\"This Film Is Not Yet Rated,\\" which opened the door on the MPAA's antiquated maze of codes and restrictions. As Dick powerfully argued, what's fundamentally broken about the MPAA isn't the system so much as the thinking behind the judgments. The ratings-board members, swathed in their shadow of anonymity, insist on a nearly Victorian double standard for sex and violence: Anything associated with the former (like the word \\"f---\\") is treated as taboo, whereas horror and action films that feature over-the-top violence routinely get a PG-13. This outdated distinction may be a reflection of \\"American values,\\" but that does not make it right. And the fact that the board tends to go easier on big-budget blockbusters may be the shoddiest double standard of all. It's an indication that too many questionable agendas are guiding these judgments. A film like \\"Bully\\" makes it clear that there's something deeply wrong with this picture. For this is an urgent and moral movie; there shouldn't be a puritanical roadblock standing between it and its audience. As long as the MPAA is issuing its cavalier decrees, though, they're the ones acting like bullies. \\"Bully\\": B+. See the full article at EW.com.

Article: A fundraising campaign inspired by Philando Castile has now raised more than 45,000 for St. Paul Public Schools, helping reduce school lunch debt at more than 56 schools in the district.      “Philando Feeds the Children,” which began as a Metropolitan State University class project, handed over a 35,000 check to the school district last week.      That means the fundraiser, which began last fall, has donated 45,000 to the school district so far, taking a substantial chunk out of the district’s 102,000 school lunch debt, said Stacy Koppen, director of nutrition services for the school district.      According to the fundraiser page, more than 139,000 has been raised in honor of Castile, who worked as a supervisor in the lunchroom at the district’s J.J. Hill Montessori school. Castile was shot and killed by a St. Anthony police officer during a traffic stop in 2016.      He’d been known to reach into his own pocket to make sure kids didn’t go hungry.      “The impression painted of Philando by others who knew him is very consistent about how he was a really sympathetic individual,” Koppen said. “He was just a lovely person. He was kind and cared about students. If they could not pay for their lunch, he would oftentimes pay for it out of his own pocket. So a fundraiser literally allowing people to pay for school lunches out of their own pockets could not resonate anymore because that’s who he was everyday.” ||||| A memorial including a photo of Philando Castile adorns the gate to the governor's residence where protesters demonstrated July 25, 2016, in St. Paul against the shooting death of Castile on July 6, 2016, by St. Anthony police officer Jeronimo Yanez during a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minn.

We use them to read books, see colors and view the wonders of the world. But sometimes, we use them too much and it hurts them. In the past, nearsightedness   was a common eye problem among children. This is mostly because of their bad eye habits, such as watching TV too long and reading books in bed. However, today's technology is changing the way we live. Children spend more time working and playing in front of computers, smartphones and iPads. US children spend more than 42 hours a week in front of electronic screens  , US' ABC news reported. This has caused a new problem for our eyes: digital   eyestrain  . People with digital eyestrain may get headaches, dry and red eyes, eye pain, watering and other eye problems. But don't worry.

News article: U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a press event at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, March 5, 2016. REUTERS/Joe Skipper      BERLIN German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel has branded leading U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump a threat to peace and prosperity while Chancellor Angela Merkel said it had always been a pleasure to work with Democrat Hillary Clinton.      The comments by Gabriel, Germany's vice chancellor and leader of the Social Democrats, are the clearest sign yet that ruling politicians in Europe are increasingly worried about the outcome of the U.S. presidential elections.      \\"Whether Donald Trump, Marine le Pen or Geert Wilders - all these right-wing populists are not only a threat to peace and social cohesion, but also to economic development,\\" Gabriel told Welt am Sonntag newspaper in an interview published on Sunday.      Gabriel said that Trump and French National Front leader Le Pen were promising voters \\"a way back into a fairytale world\\" in which economic activity only happened within national borders but that history had shown such isolated economies had no prospect.      \\"We have to make the effort to explain how we want to shape globalization in a fair way,\\" Gabriel said.      Politicians in Germany and elsewhere in Europe have watched nervously as businessman and reality TV star Trump has moved from long shot to front-runner of the Republicans seeking the party's nomination ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election.      PRAISE FOR PUTIN      Trump has described Merkel's welcoming policy towards refugees as \\"insane\\" and predicted it would cause rioting in Germany.      He has also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been at odds with Europe since Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region two years ago.      Merkel told Bild am Sonntag newspaper in an interview she did not know Trump personally. When asked about his attacks against her refugee policy, the chancellor said: \\"I don't see any reason why I should reply to him.\\"      At the same time, Merkel said of Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton: \\"I value her long political experience, her commitment for women's rights, family issues and health care.      \\"I value her strategic thinking and that she is a strong supporter of the transatlantic partnership. Whenever I had the chance to work together with Hillary Clinton, it was a great pleasure.\\"      Germany does not face a federal election until next year. But a new anti-immigrant party, the Alternative for Germany (AfD), has emerged as a threat to Merkel's conservatives. The AfD wants Germany to shut its border to migrants and use force to repel them if necessary.

In a Saturday morning email blast announcing the sixth episode of his web series “Horace and Pete,” C.K. included a lengthy postscript urging readers not to vote for Trump.      “Please stop it with voting for Trump,” C.K. writes. “It was funny for a little while. But the guy is Hitler. And by that I mean that we are being Germany in the ’30s. Do you think they saw the sh-t coming? Hitler was just some hilarious and refreshing dude with a weird comb over who would say anything at all.”      Later in the email, C.K. implores his conservative readers to vote for a different GOP candidate.      “We shouldn’t have to vote for someone because they’re not a shocking c— billionaire liar,” C.K. writes. “We should choose based on what direction the country should go… If you are a true conservative. Don’t vote for Trump. He is not one of you. He is one of him. Everything you have heard him say that you liked, if you look hard enough you will see that he one day said the exact opposite. He is playing you.”      C.K. added, “Trump is not your best. He’s the worst of all of us. He’s a symptom to a problem that is very real. But don’t vote for your own cancer. You’re better than that.”      See the full postscript below:      P.S. Please stop it with voting for Trump. It was funny for a little while. But the guy is Hitler. And by that I mean that we are being Germany in the 30s. Do you think they saw the shit coming? Hitler was just some hilarious and refreshing dude with a weird comb over who would say anything at all.      And I’m not advocating for Hillary or Bernie. I like them both but frankly I wish the next president was a conservative only because we had Obama for eight years and we need balance. And not because I particularly enjoy the conservative agenda. I just think the government should reflect the people. And we are about 40 percent conservative and 40 percent liberal. When I was growing up and when I was a younger man, liberals and conservatives were friends with differences. They weren’t enemies. And it always made sense that everyone gets a president they like for a while and then hates the president for a while. But it only works if the conservatives put up a good candidate. A good smart conservative to face the liberal candidate so they can have a good argument and the country can decide which way to go this time.      Trump is not that. He’s an insane bigot. He is dangerous.      He already said he would expand libel laws to sue anyone who “writes a negative hit piece” about him. He says “I would open up the libel laws so we can sue them and win lots of money. Not like now. These guys are totally protected.” He said that. He has promised to decimate the first amendment. (If you think he’s going to keep the second amendment intact you’re delusional.) And he said that Paul Ryan, speaker of the house will “pay” for criticizing him. So I’m saying this now because if he gets in there we won’t be able to criticize him anymore.      Please pick someone else. Like John Kasich. I mean that guy seems okay. I don’t like any of them myself but if you’re that kind of voter please go for a guy like that. It feels like between him and either democrat we’d have a decent choice. It feels like a healthier choice. We shouldn’t have to vote for someone because they’re not a shocking cunt billionaire liar.      We should choose based on what direction the country should go.      I get that all these people sound like bullshit soft criminal opportunists. The whole game feels rigged and it’s not going anywhere but down anymore. I feel that way sometimes.      And that voting for Trump is a way of saying “fuck it. Fuck them all”. I really get it. It’s a version of national Suicide. Or it’s like a big hit off of a crack pipe. Somehow we can’t help it. Or we know that if we vote for Trump our phones will be a reliable source of dopamine for the next four years. I mean I can’t wait to read about Trump every day. It’s a rush. But you have to know this is not healthy.      If you are a true conservative. Don’t vote for Trump. He is not one of you. He is one of him. Everything you have heard him say that you liked, if you look hard enough you will see that he one day said the exact opposite. He is playing you.      In fact, if you do vote for Trump, at least look at him very carefully first. You owe that to the rest of us. Know and understand who he is. Spend one hour on google and just read it all. I don’t mean listen to me or listen to liberals who put him down. Listen to your own people. Listen to John Mccain. Go look at what he just said about Trump. “At a time when our world has never been more complex or more in danger… I want Republican voters to pay close attention to what our party’s most respected and knowledgeable leaders and national security experts are saying about Mr. Trump, and to think long and hard about who they want to be our next Commander-in-Chief and leader of the free world.”      When Trump was told what he said, Trump said “Oh, he did? Well, that’s not nice,” he told CBS News’ chief White House correspondent Major Garrett. “He has to be very careful.”      When pressed on why, Trump tacked on: “He’ll find out.”      (I cut and pasted that from CBS news)      Do you really want a guy to be president who threatens John McCain? Because John McCain cautiously and intelligently asked for people to be thoughtful before voting for him? He didn’t even insult Trump. He just asked you to take a good look. And Trump told him to look out.      Remember that Trump entered this race by saying that McCain is not a war hero. A guy who was shot down, body broken and kept in a POW camp for years. Trump said “I prefer the guys who don’t get caught.” Why did he say that? Not because he meant it or because it was important to say. He said it because he’s a bully and every bully knows that when you enter a new school yard, you go to the toughest most respected guy on the yard and you punch him in the nose. If you are still standing after, you’re the new boss. If Trump is president, he’s not going to change. He’s not going to do anything for you. He’s going to do everything for himself and leave you in the dust.      So please listen to fellow conservatives. But more importantly, listen to Trump. Listen to all of it. Everything he says. If you liked when he said that “torture works” then go look at where he took it back the next day. He’s a fucking liar.      A vote for Trump is so clearly a gut-vote, and again I get it. But add a little brain to it and look the guy up. Because if you vote for him because of how you feel right now, the minute he’s president, you’re going to regret it. You’re going to regret it even more when he gives the job to his son. Because American democracy is broken enough that a guy like that could really fuck things up. That’s how Hitler got there. He was voted into power by a fatigued nation and when he got inside, he did all his Hitler things and no one could stop him.      Again, I’m not saying vote democrat or vote for anyone else. If Hilary ends up president it should be because she faced the best person you have and you and I both chose her or him or whoever. Trump is not your best. He’s the worst of all of us. He’s a symptom to a problem that is very real. But don’t vote for your own cancer. You’re better than that.      That’s just my view. At least right now. I know I’m not qualified or particularly educated and I’m not right instead of you. I’m an idiot and I’m sure a bunch of you are very annoyed by this. Fucking celebrity with an opinion. I swear this isn’t really a political opinion. You don’t want to know my political opinions. (And I know that I’m only bringing myself trouble with this shit.) Trump has nothing to do with politics or ideology. He has to do with himself. And really I don’t mean to insult anyone. Except Trump. I mean to insult him very much. And really I’m not saying he’s evil or a monster. In fact I don’t think Hitler was. The problem with saying that guys like that are monsters is that we don’t see them coming when they turn out to be human, which they all are. Everyone is. Trump is a messed up guy with a hole in his heart that he tries to fill with money and attention. He can never ever have enough of either and he’ll never stop trying. He’s sick. Which makes him really really interesting. And he pulls you towards him which somehow feels good or fascinatingly bad. He’s not a monster. He’s a sad man. But all this makes him horribly dangerous if he becomes president. Give him another TV show. Let him pay to put his name on buildings. But please stop voting for him. And please watch Horace and Pete. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel has labeled US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump a threat to peace and prosperity, while Chancellor Angela Merkel has said it has always been a pleasure to work with Democrat Hillary Clinton.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What is the thing or person that may be immune to the venom of the Lycosa Carnivora?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Consulting detective Sherlock Holmes fakes his own death in Scotland in order to investigate a number of bizarre apparent suicides that he is convinced are part of an elaborate plot by \\"a female Moriarty\\". Returning to his assistant Watson in secret, Holmes notes that all the victims were wealthy gamblers, so disguised as \\"Rajni Singh\\", a distinguished Indian officer, he stalks London's gaming clubs. It is not long before he encounters the villain of the piece, Adrea  Spedding. Holmes discovers that she seeks out men short of money, persuades them to pawn their life insurance policies with her accomplices, then kills them. Holmes sets himself up as her next victim, discovering that she uses the deadly spider, Lycosa Carnivora, whose venom causes such excruciating pain that the victims kill themselves. Holmes also finds the footprint of a child nearby. Searching for evidence Holmes and Watson visit eminent arachnologist Matthew Ordway, who may have supplied the deadly creatures. Holmes soon realizes that the man he is speaking to is an impostor, but the villain makes his escape. Searching the premises, Holmes finds the corpse of the real Ordway, as well as his journals, which allude to something or someone from Central Africa immune to the spider venom. This baffles Holmes until he finds the model skeleton of a child. However, Dr. Watson points out that the relation of the skull and the circumference of the chest prove it is not a child, and Holmes deduces that the Central African thing described in the journal is a pygmy. Holmes and Watson continue their investigations at a nearby fairground, where Holmes allows himself to fall into the clutches of Spedding and her gang. Bound and gagged, Holmes is tied behind a moving target in a shooting gallery, at which Lestrade and Watson take pot shots with a  .22 rifle.

One major incident that garnered widespread criticism, including from fellow Republican presidential contenders, involved his comments about Senator John McCain's time as a POW (Prisoner of War) while serving in Vietnam. Trump dismissed McCain as \\"a war hero because he got captured. I like people who weren't captured.\\" In an attempt to clarify his statement, Trump said, \\"I am not a fan of John McCain because he has done so little for our Veterans.\\" However, he did not apologize for his comments and maintained that he spoke his mind. Many political rivals, as well as the media, condemned Trump's comments. Some reactions included: Bobby Jindal: \\"After Donald Trump spends six years in a POW camp, he can weigh in on John McCain's military service.\\" Rick Santorum: \\"@SenJohnMcCain is an American hero, period.\\" Jeb Bush: \\"Enough with the slanderous attacks. @SenJohnMcCain and all our veterans - particularly POWs have earned our respect and admiration.\\" Lindsey Graham: \\"If there was ever any doubt that @realDonaldTrump should not be our commander in chief, this stupid statement should end all doubt.\\" Rick Perry: \\"As a fellow veteran, I respect @SenJohnMcCain because he volunteered to serve his country.

Politicians from both sides of the aisle stood up to defend Senator McCain's military service and sacrifices as a POW. McCain survived five and a half years of imprisonment in North Vietnam, enduring torture and solitary confinement. The general consensus was that regardless of one's political beliefs, military service and the sacrifices made by veterans and POWs deserve respect and admiration, and Trump's comments were seen as far outside the bounds of acceptable political discourse. However, despite the backlash, Trump refused to apologize, illustrating his tendency to double down on his controversial statements."},{"instruction":"Title: Good Story...

First question: Why cross platform mobile development is not good enough for enterprise solutions? Second question: What are the best tools for cross-platform mobile application development? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Possible answers: I. no. II. yes.","output":"I. No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question focuses on the limitations of cross-platform mobile development for enterprise solutions, while the second question seeks the best tools available for cross-platform mobile application development. Let's dive deeper into each question. First question: Why cross-platform mobile development is not good enough for enterprise solutions? Cross-platform mobile development allows developers to create applications that work on multiple mobile platforms such as Android, iOS, and Windows Phone using a single codebase. It can save time and resources and be a cost-effective solution compared to building native applications. However, for enterprise solutions, cross-platform mobile development may not be ideal due to some limitations: 1. Performance: Cross-platform mobile apps may run slower than their native counterparts because they rely on frameworks and extra layers to function on multiple platforms. These layers can cause performance issues, especially on devices with limited resources or in applications with high-performance requirements. 2. User experience (UX): Cross-platform applications may not provide the same level of user experience as native applications. Native applications can seamlessly integrate with the specific design guidelines and user interface elements of each platform, while cross-platform apps may struggle to maintain consistency across different platforms. 3. Integration: Enterprise solutions often require deep integration with the device's hardware, APIs, and features. Cross-platform development tools may not provide the same level of access to platform-specific technologies as native development tools, which could hinder functionality and compatibility. 4. Vendor lock-in: Some cross-platform development tools could lock developers into a specific framework, making it challenging to switch platforms or update applications in the future without significant rework. 5. Security: Cross-platform mobile development can introduce security issues on different platforms, especially if the chosen framework cannot keep up with platform-specific vulnerabilities. Enterprise solutions often require stringent security measures, and cross-platform development may not be able to provide those requirements. Second question: What are the best tools for cross-platform mobile application development? Despite the limitations for enterprise solutions, there are several excellent tools for cross-platform mobile application development that are more suited for smaller-scale projects or specific use cases. Here are some of the best tools available: 1. React Native: React Native, developed by Facebook, allows developers to build mobile apps using JavaScript and React. It provides platform-specific UI components and APIs, which helps in creating near-native app experiences. It supports iOS, Android, and Windows. 2. Xamarin: Xamarin, acquired by Microsoft, allows developers to create cross-platform applications using C# and the .NET framework. With Xamarin, developers can share up to 90% of their code across different platforms, and it supports iOS, Android, and Windows. 3. Flutter: Flutter, created by Google, is an open-source UI toolkit for building natively compiled cross-platform mobile applications using Dart language. It provides an extensive widget library to create visually appealing applications and supports hot-reloading, making it easier to test and develop apps quickly. 4. Apache Cordova (formerly known as PhoneGap): Apache Cordova is an open-source framework that enables developers to build cross-platform mobile apps using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses WebView to render the application and allows access to native APIs and device features using plugins. 5. Ionic: Ionic is an open-source framework for building cross-platform hybrid and Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is built on top of Angular and Apache Cordova, providing a comprehensive collection of components and tools for creating feature-rich applications. These tools cater to different requirements and offer various features to help developers build cross-platform mobile applications efficiently. However, it's essential to choose the right tool depending on the project's specific needs and the desired level of native-like performance and user experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After its defeat in the 1979 general election the Labour Party underwent a period of internal rivalry between the left represented by Tony Benn, and the right represented by Denis Healey. The election of Michael Foot as leader in 1980, and the leftist policies he espoused, such as unilateral nuclear disarmament, leaving the European Economic Community (EEC) and NATO, closer governmental influence in the banking system, the creation of a national minimum wage and a ban on fox hunting led in 1981 to four former cabinet ministers from the right of the Labour Party (Shirley Williams, William Rodgers, Roy Jenkins and David Owen) forming the Social Democratic Party. Benn was only narrowly defeated by Healey in a bitterly fought deputy leadership election in 1981 after the introduction of an electoral college intended to widen the voting franchise to elect the leader and their deputy. By 1982, the National Executive Committee had concluded that the entryist Militant tendency group were in contravention of the party's constitution. The Militant newspaper's five member editorial board were expelled on 22 February 1983.

Question: Process:  - Food - Water enter the body - Bloodstream - Food and water enter the pancreas - The pancreas breaks down carbs - Helps digest other foods and liquids.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose food enters into the body happens, how will it affect the pancreas working HARDER.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you propose assumes that an increase in food and water intake will result in the pancreas working harder. In this scenario, there could be both direct and indirect effects on the overall process of digestion. Direct Effects: 1. Greater demand for digestive enzymes: When more food enters the body, the pancreas needs to produce more digestive enzymes, such as amylase to break down carbohydrates, lipase for fats, and trypsin and chymotrypsin for proteins. This increased demand may cause the pancreas to work harder to produce and secrete these enzymes. 2. Increased insulin production: The pancreas also produces hormones, such as insulin, which help regulate blood sugar levels. With more food entering the bloodstream and being broken down into glucose, the pancreas may need to produce more insulin to ensure the glucose is effectively absorbed and utilized by cells. This could result in the pancreas working harder to maintain blood sugar balance. Indirect Effects: 1. Impact on the gastrointestinal tract: An increase in food and water intake can also affect other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. For instance, the stomach may need to produce more gastric acid and the small intestine may need to produce more enzymes to help with digestion. This could indirectly affect the pancreas by increasing the overall demand for pancreatic enzymes. 2. Changes in gut microbiota: The type and quantity of food consumed can impact the composition of the gut microbiota, which can in turn affect digestion. Certain bacteria can help break down complex carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, which could potentially lead to a greater demand for pancreatic enzymes. This may indirectly cause the pancreas to work harder. In conclusion, an increase in food and water intake could have both direct and indirect effects on the pancreas, potentially causing it to work harder to meet the increased demands for digestive enzymes and hormonal regulation. It is essential to maintain a balanced diet and intake to ensure optimal functioning of the pancreas and the overall digestive system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The additional information about her being young is not mentioned or implied in the initial statement. 2.

(July 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)MI6 agent James Bond meets a Swiss banker in Bilbao, Spain to retrieve money for Sir Robert King, a British oil tycoon and friend of M. Bond tells the banker that King was buying a report stolen from an MI6 agent who was killed for it, and wants to know who killed him. The banker is killed by his assistant before he can reveal the assassin's name. Bond escapes with the money, but it is revealed to be booby-trapped, and Sir Robert is killed by an explosion inside MI6 headquarters back in London. Bond gives chase to the assistant/assassin on a boat on the Thames to the Millennium Dome, where she attempts to escape via hot air balloon. Bond offers her protection, but she refuses, then causes the balloon to explode, killing herself.Bond traces the recovered money to Viktor \\"Renard\\" Zokas, a KGB agent-turned-terrorist. Following an earlier attempt on his life by MI6, Renard was left with a bullet in his brain which is gradually destroying his senses, making him immune to pain. M assigns Bond to protect King's daughter, Elektra; Renard previously abducted and held her for ransom, and MI6 believes that he is targeting her a second time. Bond flies to Azerbaijan, where Elektra is overseeing the construction of an oil pipeline. During a tour of the pipeline's proposed route in the mountains, Bond and Elektra are attacked by a hit squad in armed, paraglider-equipped snowmobiles.Afterwards Bond visits Valentin Zukovsky at a casino to acquire information about Elektra's attackers; he discovers that Elektra's head of security, Davidov, is secretly in league with Renard. Bond kills Davidov and boards a plane bound for a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. He poses as a Russian nuclear scientist, meets American nuclear physicist Christmas Jones, and enters the silo. Inside, Renard is removing the GPS locator card and weapons-grade plutonium from a nuclear bomb. Before Bond can kill him, Jones blows his cover. Renard drops a hint that he and Elektra are collaborating and flees with the plutonium, while Bond and Jones escape the exploding silo with the locator card.Back in Azerbaijan, Bond discloses to M that Elektra may not be as innocent as she seems. An alarm sounds while he is handing M the locator card as proof of the theft, which reveals that the stolen bomb from Kazakhstan is attached to an inspection rig heading towards the oil terminal. Bond and Jones enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb, and Jones discovers that half of the plutonium is missing. They both jump clear of the rig, a large section of pipeline is destroyed, and they are presumed killed. Back at the command centre, Elektra reveals she and Renard are conspirators and that she killed her father as revenge for using her as bait for Renard. She abducts M, whom she resents for advising her father not to pay the ransom money, and imprisons her in the Maiden's Tower.Bond accosts Zukovsky at his caviar factory in the Caspian Sea, which is then attacked by Elektra's sawing helicopters. Later, Zukovsky reveals his arrangement with Elektra was in exchange for the use of a submarine, currently being captained by Zukovsky's nephew, Nikolai. The group goes to Istanbul, where Jones realises that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine's nuclear reactor, the resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the Bosphorus while dramatically increasing the value of Elektra's oil. Bond then gets a signal from the hacked locator card in the Maiden's Tower just before Zukovsky's underling, Bullion blows up the command centre. Zukovsky is knocked unconscious and Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine, which was seized by Renard's men. Bond is taken to the tower, where Elektra tortures him with a garrote. Zukovsky and his men seize the tower, but Zukovsky is shot by Elektra, freeing Bond with his cane gun with his last act. Bond frees M and kills Elektra.Bond dives after the submarine, boards it, and frees Jones. Following a fight, the submarine hits the bottom of the Bosphorus, causing its hull to rupture. Bond catches up with Renard and kills him after a lengthy fight in the submarine's reactor. Bond and Jones escape from the submarine, leaving the flooded reactor to detonate safely underwater.

(January 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Several months after the events of The Fly, Veronica Quaife delivers Seth Brundle's child. After giving birth to a squirming larval sac, she dies from shock. The sac then splits open to reveal a seemingly normal baby boy. The child, named Martin Brundle, is raised by Anton Bartok, owner of Bartok Industries (the company which financed Brundle's teleportation experiments). Fully aware of the accident which genetically merged Seth Brundle with a housefly (a condition that Martin has inherited), Bartok plans to exploit the child's unique condition. Martin grows up in a clinical environment, and is constantly subjected to studies and tests by scientists. His physical and mental maturity is highly accelerated, and he possesses a genius-level intellect, incredible reflexes, and no need for sleep. He knows he is aging faster than a normal human, but is unaware of the true cause, having been told his father died from the same rapid aging disease. As Martin grows, Bartok befriends him. At age 3, Martin has the physique of a 10-year-old, and frequently sneaks around and explores the Bartok complex. He finds a room containing laboratory animals, and befriends a Golden Retriever. The next night, he brings the dog some of his dinner, only to find it missing. He enters an observation booth overlooking Bay 17. There, scientists have managed to reassemble Brundle's Telepods, but were unable to duplicate his programming that enabled them to teleport living subjects. Using the Golden Retriever as a test subject, the experiment fails, leaving the dog horribly deformed. The dog attacks and maims one of the scientists, horrifying young Martin.

Sentence 1 is about the purpose of Legal Services, stating that it is not to give something to the poor besides the justice that every person is entitled to. Sentence 2 states that the point of Legal Services is to provide justice. Step 2: Compare the two sentences and their meanings. Both sentences discuss the purpose of Legal Services. The first sentence emphasizes that the purpose is not about giving something else to the poor but rather providing justice for everyone. The second sentence simply states that the purpose of Legal Services is to provide justice. Step 3: Analyzing whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. To entail means that if the first sentence is true, the second sentence must also be true. If we consider that the purpose of Legal Services is not about giving something else to the poor, we can infer that it is focused on providing justice.

Yes or no? Answer: The Twenty-third Amendment has always resulted in the District of Columbia having three electors. Question: when does the electoral college votes Answer:","output":"The Electoral College votes in the United States typically take place in mid-December, following the popular vote that occurs in November during a presidential election year. The process of the Electoral College is outlined in the U.S. Constitution, with the goal of ensuring that the President and Vice President are chosen by an informed and select group rather than by the general populace. The Twenty-third Amendment, which was ratified in 1961, granted the District of Columbia the right to participate in the presidential elections by granting it three electors. These electors represent the district’s population in the same manner as electors from the states, and their votes are counted along with the states' electors. Each state is allocated a specific number of electors based on the total representation in Congress (House of Representatives and Senate). The electors are chosen by political parties in each state, with the winning party in the popular vote typically having its electors represent the state in the Electoral College. The process under which electors are chosen, however, may vary from state to state. On the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December following the popular vote, the electors from each state and the District of Columbia meet in their respective locations (usually the state capital) to cast their votes for President and Vice President. These votes are then recorded on Certificates of Vote, which are sent to the President of the Senate (who is also the Vice President of the United States), as well as to the National Archives. In a joint session of Congress usually held on January 6th, the votes are officially counted, and the President of the Senate announces the results. If a candidate receives at least 270 electoral votes (a majority of the total 538 electoral votes available), they are declared the winner of the presidential election. If no candidate reaches the required number of electoral votes, the House of Representatives is tasked with choosing the President, while the Senate chooses the Vice President. In summary, the key time frame in which the Electoral College votes is mid-December. The electors cast their votes on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December following the popular vote, and their votes are officially counted by a joint session of Congress on January 6th. The Twenty-third Amendment, ratified in 1961, ensures that the District of Columbia has representation in this process by granting it three electors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: The New York Times announced Wednesday that it intended to charge frequent readers for access to its website, a step being debated across the industry that nearly every major newspaper has so far feared to take. Starting in early 2011, visitors to NYTimes.com will get a certain number of articles free every month before being asked to pay a standard and fixed fee for unlimited access. Subscribers to the newspaper's print edition will receive full access to the site. But executives of The New York Times Company said they could not yet answer fundamental questions about the plan, like how much it would cost or what the limit would be on free reading. They stressed that the amount of free access could change with time, in response to economic conditions and reader demand. Still, publishers fear that money from digital subscriptions would not make up for the resulting loss of audience and advertising income. NYTimes.com is by far the most popular newspaper site in the country, with more than 17 million readers a month in the United States, according to Nielsen Online, and analysts say it is the leader in advertising income, as well. That may make it better positioned than other general-interest papers to charge--and also gives The Times more to lose if the move produces an opposed result. The Times Company has been studying the matter for almost a year, searching for common ground between pro-and-anti pay campaigns--a debate mirrored in dozens of media-watching blogs-- and the system will not go into effect until January 2011. Executives said they were not bothered by the possibility of absorbing barbs  for moving cautiously. \\"There's no prize for getting it quick,\\" said Janet L. Robinson, the company's president and chief executive. \\"There's more of a prize for getting it right.\\" Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?

The answer is:","output":"D) Subscribers to the paper's print edition will also enjoy full access to the site.

B) The passage does not provide any information about increasing the charges for reading articles on NYTimes.com. It only mentions introducing a standard and fixed fee for unlimited access after a certain number of free articles have been read. C) The passage does not state that readers will get more free online articles.

The WHO said the tuberculosis figures were unacceptable for a disease that could be cured. Medecins Sans Frontieres said the statistics were \\"disheartening\\" and warned the world was \\"losing ground\\" on tackling resistant forms of TB. The WHO's Global Tuberculosis Report 2015 shows the huge strides that have been made in tackling TB, with the death rate being nearly halved since 1990. And the number of infections has been falling by 1.5% a year since 2000. Deaths from HIV/Aids have also been falling rapidly because of improved access to anti-retroviral drugs. Dr Mario Raviglione, the WHO's tuberculosis director, told the BBC News website: \\"Tuberculosis and HIV are now competing to be the number one cause of death from infectious disease in the world. \\"Tuberculosis now ranks alongside HIV.\\" Most new cases of TB are in China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria or Pakistan. Deaths from HIV/Aids have been falling since the mid-2000s, and stand at 1.2 million a year. Overall there were 1.5 million tuberculosis deaths in 2014. But 400,000 of them are officially counted as Aids deaths as they were in HIV positive patients. The WHO now considers TB and HIV to be effectively joint top killers. WHO director-general Margaret Chan said there had been \\"tremendous impact\\" since 1990, but added that \\"if the world is to end this epidemic, it needs to scale up services and, critically, invest in research\\". Dr Raviglione agreed, saying that if the international investment in TB matched that of HIV, then \\"we could have accelerated the decline in mortality\\". The report also highlights the dangers of tuberculosis becoming resistant to antibiotics. About three in every 100 new cases of TB could not be treated with first choice antibiotics. Dr Grania Brigden, from Medecins Sans Frontieres, said it was \\"yet another year of disheartening statistics\\" that should \\"serve as a wake-up call\\". She added: \\"We're losing ground in the battle to control drug-resistant forms of TB, and without considerable corrective action, the vast majority of people with multi-drug resistant TB won't ever be diagnosed, put on treatment, or cured.\\" The World Health Organization will shift to its End TB Strategy next year, which aims to cut deaths by 90% by 2030.

Here is a news article: Some people have a tendency to overreact and sadly the internet then hugely amplifies the volume of that overreaction and gives it a credence it doesn’t deserve.      Misunderstandings, hysteria and outright disinformation get repeated until they become inaccurate ‘truths’ that in turn get cited in defence of other inaccurate assertions.      The past few days have seen exaggerated squealing over Apple supposedly stopping authors from selling books wherever they like if they create a title using iBooks Author.      This isn’t what’s actually happening.      Apple has made a free tool available to help people make Multi-Touch content specifically for iPad.      Not Kindles, Android tablets or any other device as yet unimagined.      iPads.      Apple’s terms say the file created by iBooks Author – not the content it contains, the file – cannot be sold by any means other than the iBookstore.      Apple makes no claim on the content you create. The words, pictures, videos inside your book are yours. Always. Unless you give them to someone else.      But if you want to sell a Multi-Touch iBook made with iBooks Author you have to use Apple’s official iBookstore.      Because it’s an official Apple software package made available for the single purpose of distributing content via the iBookstore.      Authors are free to parcel up the same elements and sell them under the same name on any device they want.      They just can’t use Apple’s software to make content for Kindles and Android tablets or sell their iBooks Author file via any channel other than Apple’s official store.      And because iBooks Author just assembles content written, photographed and created outside of it, there’s no reason to use it to create an end file for other platforms in the first place.      Expecting to use iTunes Author to create products for other platforms is like expecting iTunes Publisher to upload to Amazon’s Kindle store.      It’s not that hard to understand.      Anyone who doesn’t want to agree to Apple’s terms is free to use a different software package to create books for iBooks and any other device they see fit to distribute it on.      They can exercise this choice because Apple hasn’t hidden the requirement to sell books via its store from users. It’s very clearly stated on the Mac App Store download page for iBooks Author:      But it seems some people haven’t bothered to read it or have misunderstood what it actually means.      They’ve then taken to shouting down anyone who dares try and correct their misunderstanding. ||||| In a probably-futile attempt to stem the tide of redundant comments, I’ll address some of the more frequent reactions to my last post:      If you don’t like it, don’t use it! Duh.      You’re missing the point. The issue is that this is a software EULA which for the first time attempts to restrict what I can do with the output of the app, rather than with the app itself. No consumer EULA I’ve ever seen goes this far. Would you be happy if Garage Band required you to sell your music through the iTunes Store, or if iPhoto had license terms that kept you from posting your own photos online? It’s a step backward for computing freedom and we should resist it.      Plenty of EULAs restrict what you can do with software. That’s the whole point.      Yes, restricting use is what EULAs have traditionally done. This one does something different: it restricts what you can do with the output of the software after the software is closed and put away. If you make a document using iBooks Author, you aren’t allowed to sell that document except through Apple, ever, for the rest of your life.      Interestingly, as the author of the document and presumed signatory to the iBooks Author EULA, you’re the only person to whom that restriction applies. If you gave your iBook to a friend, Apple would have no control over what your friend did with it. And you could sell your friend’s iBooks too, because you aren’t the one who used iBooks Author to generate them.      Yeah, but that only applies to .ibooks files. You can also export .pdf and .txt and those are unrestricted.      Not true. The license defines “Work” as “any book or other work you generate using this software.” That definitely includes PDF and plain text, and it could be construed to include the very words you type in. So if you use iBooks Author to write your novel, you might be legally barred from ever selling that novel in any format, not just as an iBook. UPDATE (3 Feb 2012): Apple has clarified the license to indicate that only the .ibooks format is covered.      Wait, so Apple’s taking my copyrights away?      No no no, just your right to sell the output of iBooks Author on your own or through any other store.      But why would you want to sell iBooks anywhere but in the iBookstore?      It doesn’t matter why, since I made the iBook myself and should be free to do as I please with it. But if you must have a reason, here are five: because Apple’s cut is too high; because I already have an arrangement with another publisher or online store; because I want to sell my work in a country the iBookstore doesn’t serve; because the iBookstore doesn’t let me offer academic pricing, bulk rates, or loyalty discounts; because I tried selling through Apple and they refused.      iBooks Author is free, so Apple deserves a cut.      How on earth does that follow? Xcode is free, and software companies have been using it and the tools that preceded it for decades to build Mac software that they’ve distributed without Apple’s help, and without paying Apple for the privilege. We buy hardware from Apple, and Apple provides the tools to enable us to make that hardware more useful so that more people will buy it. The same virtuous circle could exist for the iPad and iBooks if Apple hadn’t overreached with this ridiculous license.      That’s what the EULA says, so quit whining!      Do you really want EULAs to be able to say anything they please? Do you want copyright holders to have unlimited control over what you can do with legally obtained copies of their work? It’s not even clear that EULAs can be enforced at all. So even if you’re on Apple’s side in this argument, wouldn’t you rather they based their money grab on a sound legal theory?      It’s the same having to sell iOS apps through the App Store.      No, it’s not. The license terms for Xcode (PDF link) don’t contain any language restricting the use of files generated by Xcode. And when you join the iOS Developer Program, there’s a separate contract you’re required to consciously agree to, once a year and each time it’s updated, before you can download your development certificate. But if you don’t join the program, nothing stops you from continuing to use Xcode’s output however you like.      Like I said: unprecedented. ||||| Summary: Over the years, I have read hundreds of license agreements, looking for little gotchas and clear descriptions of rights. But I have never, ever seen a legal document like the one Apple has attached to its new iBooks Author program.      Update: This post is part of a series. If you find this topic interesting, I recommend you read these follow-ups as well:      I read EULAs so you don't have to. I've spent years reading end user license agreements, EULAs, looking for little gotchas or just trying to figure out what the agreement allows and doesn't allow.      I have never seen a EULA as mind-bogglingly greedy and evil as Apple's EULA for its new ebook authoring program.      Dan Wineman calls it \\"unprecedented audacity\\" on Apple's part. For people like me, who write and sell books, access to multiple markets is essential. But that's prohibited:      Apple, in this EULA, is claiming a right not just to its software, but to its software’s output. It’s akin to Microsoft trying to restrict what people can do with Word documents, or Adobe declaring that if you use Photoshop to export a JPEG, you can’t freely sell it to Getty. As far as I know, in the consumer software industry, this practice is unprecedented.      Exactly: Imagine if Microsoft said you had to pay them 30% of your speaking fees if you used a PowerPoint deck in a speech.      I've downloaded the software and had a chance to skim the EULA. Much of it is boilerplate, but I've read and re-read Section 2B, and it does indeed go far beyond any license agreement I've ever seen:      B. Distribution of your Work. As a condition of this License and provided you are in compliance with its terms, your Work may be distributed as follows:      (i) if your Work is provided for free (at no charge), you may distribute the Work by any available means;      (ii) if your Work is provided for a fee (including as part of any subscription-based product or service), you may only distribute the Work through Apple and such distribution is subject to the following limitations and conditions: (a) you will be required to enter into a separate written agreement with Apple (or an Apple affiliate or subsidiary) before any commercial distribution of your Work may take place; and (b) Apple may determine for any reason and in its sole discretion not to select your Work for distribution.      And then the next paragraph is bold-faced, just so you don't miss it:      Apple will not be responsible for any costs, expenses, damages, losses (including without limitation lost business opportunities or lost profits) or other liabilities you may incur as a result of your use of this Apple Software, including without limitation the fact that your Work may not be selected for distribution by Apple.      The nightmare scenario under this agreement? You create a great work of staggering literary genius that you think you can sell for 5 or 10 bucks per copy. You craft it carefully in iBooks Author. You submit it to Apple. They reject it.      Under this license agreement, you are out of luck. They won't sell it, and you can't legally sell it elsewhere. You can give it away, but you can't sell it. Updated to add: By \\"it,\\" I am referring to the book, not the content. The program allows you to export your work as plain text, with all formatting stripped. So you do have the option to take the formatting work you did in iBooks Author, throw it away, and start over. That is a devastating potential limitation for an author/publisher. Outputting as PDF would preserve the formatting, but again the license would appear to prohibit you from selling that work, because it was generated by iBooks Author.      One oddity I noticed in the agreement is that the term Work is not defined. [Update: Yes, it is, as I noticed on a fourth reading. It's in an \\"Important Note\\" above the agreement itself: \\"any book or other work you generate using this software (a 'Work').\\" Of course, that uses the term \\"work\\" recursively.] It's capitalized in the relevant sections of the EULA, and it clearly is the thing of value that Apple wants from an author. Leaving that term so poorly defined is not exactly malpractice, but it's sloppy lawyering.      I'm also hearing, but have not been able to confirm, that the program's output is not compatible with the industry-standard EPUB format. Updated: An Apple support document notes that \\"¦iBooks uses the ePub file format\\" and later refers to it as \\"the industry-leading ePub digital book file type.\\" But iBooks Author will not export its output to that industry-leading format.      My longtime friend Giesbert Damaschke, a German author who has written numerous Apple-related books, says via Twitter that \\"iBA generates Epub (sort of): save as .ibooks, rename to .epub (won't work with complex layouts, cover will be lost).\\" Even if that workaround produces a usable EPUB file, however, the license agreement would seem to explicitly prohibit using the resulting file for commercial purposes outside Apple's store.      As a publisher and an author, I obviously have a dog in this hunt. But what I see so far makes this program and its output an absolute nonstarter for me.      I'll be writing more fully on this issue after I've had a chance to use the program and to inspect the EULA under a microscope.      Oh, and let's just stipulate that I could send an e-mail to Apple asking for comment, or I could hand-write my request on a sheet of paper and then put it in a shredder. Both actions would produce the same response from Cupertino. But if anyone from Apple would care to comment, you know where to find me. ||||| Tweet with a location      You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Un acontecimiento que generó de primera mano rechazo total, pues anteriormente bajo la primera orden judicial emitida por la justicia, ordenaba su libertad plena. Tal hecho fue denunciado por la misma joven el 23 de enero, el mismo día en que le citaron al local, tras afirmar que fue drogada y abusada sexualmente por el acusado en cuestión en una tienda comercial en la que él es el dueño, pues este le había contactado para supuesta \\"oferta laboral\\". Al haber hecho la denuncia, el acusado había sido detenido inmediatamente, pero el abogado defensor declaró que el acto sexual se hizo con pleno consentimiento, por lo que la jueza a cargo del caso lo liberó con una tobillera electrónica de vigilancia remota. La investigación y arresto tomaron otro rumbo debido a un tribunal de apelaciones que anuló la decisión de la jueza, teniendo respaldo de la fiscalía para proceder. De encontrarse culpable por el cargo que se le imputa, puede cumplir una pena máxima de hasta 20 años en la cárcel.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article based on this summary: Listen to your surgeon's instructions. Take medications as directed. Elevate your leg while resting. Apply ice around your knee. Maintain proper dressage care. Beware of signs of infection. Article:","output":"Title: Taking Care of Your Knee After Surgery: A Guide for Little Ones Imagine your knee is like a toy you love playing with. Now, imagine that your toy is broken, and the doctor needs to fix it. That's what happens when you have knee surgery. The doctor is like a magical toy fixer who helps make your knee better. But after the surgery, it's essential to take special care of your knee to help it heal properly and feel better. Just like you'd take care of your toy after fixing it. So, I'm going to tell you about some easy and helpful steps that will make your knee heal faster and stronger. 1. Listen to Your Surgeon's Instructions Your doctor, also known as the magical toy fixer, will tell you what you need to do after the surgery. It's crucial to listen carefully to their instructions, just like you would listen to your mom, dad, or teacher. They will tell you everything you need to know, like how to rest, when to start moving, and what to avoid doing. 2. Take Medications as Directed Sometimes, after the surgery, your knee might still be hurting a bit. The magical toy fixer will give you some special candy called \\"medicine\\" to help you feel better. It's essential to take the medicine as they told you to. Remember, it's not real candy, so don't eat more than they say. Taking the right amount can help your knee feel better faster. 3. Elevate Your Leg While Resting You love playing with pillows, right? Now, it's time to use them to help your knee. When you're resting, put some pillows under your knee to lift it gently off the bed. This can help the knee feel more comfortable and help reduce any swelling. Just imagine your leg is a superhero flying in the sky while you rest! 4. Apply Ice Around Your Knee Do you know how we sometimes put ice on a boo-boo to make it feel better? The same goes for your knee after surgery. Wrap some ice in a soft towel and gently hold it around your knee for a little while, just like giving it a cold hug. This can help reduce swelling and pain. But remember not to put the ice directly on the skin, as it could hurt. 5. Maintain Proper Dressage Care A bandage on your knee works like wrapping paper on a gift. It protects your knee and keeps it clean. Just like your parents would look after your gift, you should make sure that the bandage covering your knee is always clean and dry. If it gets dirty or wet, ask your mom or dad to help change it. 6. Beware of Signs of Infection Sometimes, when a wound doesn't heal correctly, little germs called \\"infection\\" might try to enter the body. If you notice any redness, warmth, or strange smells around your knee, let your mom, dad, or the magical toy fixer know immediately. They will help your knee stay safe from those naughty germs! Taking care of your knee after surgery is just like taking care of your special toy. By following these steps, your knee will heal faster, and you'll be back to running and playing in no time!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does the sentence \\"Witness publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the Governing Body, reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of \\"God's organization\\".\\" answer the question \\"Why should the counsel received from the Governing Body be trusted?\\" Available choices: [+] yes [+] no","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"Witness publications strongly discourage followers from questioning doctrine and counsel received from the Governing Body, reasoning that it is to be trusted as part of 'God's organization'.\\" does provide an answer to the question \\"Why should the counsel received from the Governing Body be trusted?\\" However, a more detailed and long answer can provide further insight and context. Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Governing Body is the representative of God's organization on Earth, also referred to as \\"the faithful and discreet slave\\" (Matthew 24:45-47). They are tasked with providing spiritual guidance and direction to the community of Jehovah's Witnesses. The trust in the Governing Body stems from the belief that they are providing doctrine, teachings, and counsel that come from their understanding of the Bible and are guided by Jehovah God. The sentence highlights the fact that Jehovah's Witnesses are strongly discouraged from questioning the doctrine and counsel they receive from the Governing Body, as they are considered a part of God's organization. This discouragement is based on the premise that questioning the Governing Body's direction is akin to questioning Jehovah himself and can lead to a lack of unity and cohesion among the community of believers. Moreover, the Governing Body is seen as being under divine guidance, which strengthens the trust that Jehovah's Witnesses place in their direction. They believe that the Governing Body is provided with holy spirit and a deep understanding of the Scriptures, which allows them to be guided by Jehovah to make decisions and provide direction that is in line with his will. The organization's stance on not questioning the Governing Body also helps maintain unity and order among Jehovah's Witnesses. By encouraging adherence to the Governing Body's directives, the organization aims to promote a united community that is firmly rooted in the teachings of the Bible and aligned in their worship of Jehovah. It is important to note, however, that trust in the Governing Body can be a controversial topic for individuals who have had different experiences within the organization or who have left the congregation. Critics argue that the discouragement of questioning can lead to a lack of transparency and accountability within the organization. Additionally, some view this level of trust as a form of blind faith that may prevent individuals from critically examining the doctrines and teachings they are given. In summary, the sentence provided does answer the question \\"Why should the counsel received from the Governing Body be trusted?\\" by stating that it is because they are a part of \\"God's organization.\\" However, it is crucial to understand the context and underlying beliefs that inform this trust, which includes their role as the \\"faithful and discreet slave,\\" the conviction that they are under divine guidance, and the emphasis on maintaining unity and order among Jehovah's Witnesses. Furthermore, it is important to consider the varying perspectives regarding trust in the Governing Body and the implications of discouraging questioning within the organization."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"No, the provided answer is not correct. To answer the question of \\"how much does a Bugatti Veyron cost,\\" we need to give an approximate price instead of mentioning its top speed. Please find the detailed answer below: The Bugatti Veyron is a high-performance sports car known for its luxurious design, incredible engineering, and, of course, its hefty price tag. The cost of a Bugatti Veyron varies depending on factors such as model, year, condition, and customization options. When it was first introduced in 2005, the base price of a Bugatti Veyron was around 1.3 million. However, as more models and limited editions were released, the price increased accordingly. For example, the Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport, an open-top version of the car, was released in 2009 with a starting price of approximately 2 million. Other limited edition models, such as the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport, debuted in 2010 and had a launch price of around 2.5 million. Many of these limited edition Veyron models had prices that went up significantly - in some instances, reaching as high as 3 million. In addition to the Veyron's base costs, options for customization and luxury features can add hundreds of thousands of dollars to the price. This, along with taxes and registration fees, means that purchasing a Bugatti Veyron can approach or even surpass the 3 million mark. It is important to note that production of the Bugatti Veyron ceased in 2015, making it a rare vehicle in the market. As a result, prices may vary widely depending on factors such as rarity, collector's value, and overall demand.

The Åland Islands or Åland is an archipelago at the entrance to the Gulf of Bothnia in the Baltic Sea belonging to Finland. It is autonomous, demilitarised and is the only monolingually Swedish-speaking region in Finland. It is the smallest region of Finland, constituting 0.49% of its land area and 0.50% of its population.  Åland comprises Fasta Åland on which 90% of the population resides and a further 6,500 skerries and islands to its east. Fasta Åland is separated from the coast of Sweden by of open water to the west. In the east, the Åland archipelago is contiguous with the Finnish Archipelago Sea. Åland's only land border is located on the uninhabited skerry of Märket, which it shares with Sweden.  Åland's autonomous status means that those provincial powers normally exercised by representatives of the central Finnish government are largely exercised by its own government.  The autonomous status of the islands was affirmed by a decision made by the League of Nations in 1921 following the Åland crisis. It was reaffirmed within the treaty admitting Finland to the European Union. By law, Åland is politically neutral and entirely demilitarised, and residents are exempt from conscription to the Finnish Defence Forces. The islands were granted extensive autonomy by the Parliament of Finland in the Act on the Autonomy of Åland of 1920, which was later replaced by new legislation by the same name in 1951 and 1991.

She had information they wanted, and potentially the power to disrupt their well-laid plans. But taking her would mean leaving me behind, leaving me free to continue throwing proverbial wrenches in their schemes.

Lila was safe now, or at least as safe as one could be in enemy hands. But I knew this was just the beginning; I had inadvertently entered into a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse with some of the most powerful and ruthless people on the planet. What happened next would depend on my own cunning, my ability to stay one step ahead of them at all times.

Answer: The Imperial German Army began to replace the traditional boiled-leather Pickelhaube (spiked combat helmet ) with the Stahlhelm during World War I in 1916. Question: how do I determine size needed for german world war 2 helmet A:","output":"Determining the correct size for a German World War 2 helmet, specifically the Stahlhelm, can be a challenging task as helmets from this era may vary slightly in shape and design. However, by taking accurate measurements of your head and understanding how Stahlhelm sizes work, you can find the most suitable size for you. To determine the correct size for a German World War 2 helmet, you can follow these steps: 1. Measure your head circumference: You will need a flexible measuring tape or a non-stretch string and a ruler. Wrap the measuring tape or string around the widest part of your head, just above your eyebrows and ears, and record the measurement in centimeters or inches. Make sure the tape is level and not too tight or loose. 2. Consult a Stahlhelm size chart: Stahlhelm helmets were produced in various shell sizes (typically ranging from size 60 to 68 in 2-centimeter increments). Each shell size corresponds to a range of head circumference measurements. Look for an authentic, WW2-era German helmet size chart online, or consult a reputable collector's guidebook. Here is a general reference for Stahlhelm sizes: - Size 60: 53 - 54 cm (20.9 - 21.3 inches) - Size 62: 55 - 56 cm (21.7 - 22.0 inches) - Size 64: 57 - 58 cm (22.4 - 22.8 inches) - Size 66: 59 - 60 cm (23.2 - 23.6 inches) - Size 68: 61 - 62 cm (24.0 - 24.4 inches) 3. Choose a liner size: Stahlhelm helmets from WW2 typically utilized a leather liner designed to cushion the head and provide a snug fit. The liner size is separate from the shell size. To find the right liner, compare your head circumference measurement to the liner size ranges specified in the same size chart you consulted for the shell size. 4. Consider variations in helmet designs: Different German helmet models, such as the M35, M40, and M42, might have slight variations in shape and design. It is essential to stay aware of these differences and choose a helmet size that matches your requirements. 5. Test the fit: If possible, try on the helmet before purchasing it to ensure it fits securely and comfortably on your head. Place the helmet on your head, and ensure that the liner pads touch your head evenly, without any gaps or excessive pressure points. If the helmet is too tight, consider a larger shell size and adjust the liner accordingly. If the helmet is too loose, try a smaller shell size or adjust the liner to tighten the fit. Keep in mind that replica Stahlhelm helmets might differ in sizing from authentic WW2-era ones. It is crucial to consult specific size charts for replica helmets, as they may use different sizing systems. Following these steps should help you determine the appropriate size for a German World War 2 Stahlhelm helmet."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At the Home Depot, another resident said she had essential supplies but wanted to be doubly sure she was ready. The most severe weather is expected to hit","output":"the region late Friday night and continue into Saturday, with forecasters predicting snowfall rates of up to three inches per hour, potentially bringing the total accumulation to well over two feet in some areas. This, coupled with the possibility of high winds and coastal flooding, has prompted local and state authorities to issue travel restrictions, emergency warnings, and declare states of emergency in anticipation of the impending storm. Residents have been urged to stock up on crucial supplies like non-perishable food, batteries, flashlights, and medications in case of power outages and being stranded at home for an extended period. Local officials are also advising residents to ensure their vehicles are prepared with winter tires, adequate fuel, and emergency supplies like blankets and shovels. Public transportation systems, including trains and buses, are expected to be significantly impacted by the storm, with some agencies planning on reducing or even suspending services throughout the weekend. Local airports have preemptively canceled hundreds of flights in anticipation of the severe weather, leaving many passengers scrambling to reschedule their travel plans. School districts in the affected areas have announced closures for Friday in advance, with some even preparing for potential closures on Monday due to the potential difficulty of clearing massive amounts of snow from roads and sidewalks. Parents are advised to stay tuned to local announcements and media for updates on school status and other community closures. In addition to potential disruptions in daily routines, the impending blizzard has potential health and safety implications. Residents are cautioned to be aware of the dangers of driving or walking through heavy snowfall and on untreated or uncleared surfaces. In extreme weather like this, there is an increased risk of car accidents, hypothermia, frostbite, and heart attacks due to exertion while shoveling snow. Elderly individuals and those with pre-existing health conditions are particularly vulnerable during such conditions and may require additional assistance. Local hospitals and first responders have preemptively increased staffing levels and are working closely with municipalities to ensure they can efficiently respond to emergency calls and adequately care for the surging influx of patients that typically accompanies blizzards. Community members are encouraged to check in on their neighbors, particularly seniors and those with disabilities, to ensure they are safe, warm, and have the necessary resources to weather the storm. As the Northeast braces for the potentially historic blizzard, residents are reminded of the importance of preparedness, caution, and cooperation in facing such extreme weather. While the full extent of the storm's impact remains to be seen, being proactive and taking necessary precautions can minimize the risks to individuals and communities as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Going on holiday makes you feel good while you're there-you gain the health benefits for months, new research shows. Jetting off to exotic destinations such as the Maldives cuts your blood pressure, helps you sleep better and bounce back from stress, it found. The benefits last at least a fortnight longer than the vacation and can be felt for months in some cases where it is claimed. Experts say workers should always take their full holiday entitlement each year-as many as one in three don't-to get the benefits. The study compared key health markers in holidaymakers visiting Thailand, Peru or the Maldives, with people who stayed at home and continued working. The average blood pressure of those on holiday dropped by 6% while the workers saw their blood pressure rise by 2% over the same period. The sleep quality of holiday-makers improved by 17% while that of the non-holidaymakers _ by 14%. The study also found the ability of vacationers to recover from stress--known as the stress-resilience test-improved by 29%. There was a 71% fall in stress resilience scores among workers. Test showed a fall in blood glucose levels, reducing the risk of diabetes, trimmer waistlines and enhanced mood and energy levels, with the effects sustained for at least 2 weeks after returning home.

Instead, conversations should revolve around work-related topics and professional experiences, for instance, discussing work goals rather than personal ambitions. This distinction helps to reinforce the perception that the boss is someone to be respected and looked up to as a leader. Moreover, the article highlights the damaging effects of gossip and spreading rumors, as engaging in such behavior can undermine a boss's credibility and trustworthiness. When a boss engages in gossip, any rumors shared may be perceived as the truth by employees, which can lead to misunderstandings and a loss of trust. This underscores that it is crucial for bosses to distance themselves from any form of gossip in order to maintain their reputation as a reliable and strong leader. In conclusion, the article stresses the significance of developing and maintaining a professional image as a boss, which involves separating oneself from employees to a certain extent and avoiding personal oversharing and gossip. By doing so, a leader can safeguard their authority, credibility, and trustworthiness – all essential qualities for consistently guiding their team and organization towards success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the first name of Sir Terence Aubrey Murray's wife? ?  The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

The key is to find one that matches your interests and natural abilities. If you like to walk, keep walking -- on snowshoes. If you want to try an endurance sport, go for cross-country skiing. Besides, snowboarding is just great fun.  Not satisfied with these? Try downhill skiing, then. Downhill skiing is not as hard as it used to be -- shorter, lightweight, curved skis make any beginner feel like an Olympic winner. These newer skis -- along with another type of equipment called skiboards, which are even shorter than skis -- help you control your speed and body movements.  Consider testing the latest high-tech skis or snowboards?Check with your local sports shops or the rental places at the ski mountains about sample programs.  You could also try sledding. Use a wood-framed sled with steel runners or a plastic sled to head down a snowy hill. If you prefer ice to snow, think hockey or figure skating.  Runners can also train during the winter in spite of wet or slippery roads. One of the easiest sports around, snowshoeing can be excellent cold-weather cross-training for runners and cyclists -- or anyone wanting to take a wintry walk in the woods. Snowshoes are smaller, lighter, and better than ever. If you want to try them out, you may be able to rent a pair for a day at many of the larger outdoor or sporting goods stores.  Whatever sport you choose, don't rely on a friend for instruction. You wouldn't let an inexperienced doctor perform a brain operation on you, but why let one teach you to ski or skate? That's what instructors are for -- to help newcomers start out right. Instructors can give you advice about equipment, techniques, safety, and dealing with injuries if they do happen to you.  Above all, if you want to progress, invest your time in learning the basic skills thoroughly. Everything else you do as a skier, boarder, or skater will be built on these first skills. Question: What can we learn from the passage? - Runners and cyclists cannot train because of the wet or slippery roads in winter. - Downhill skiing used to be more difficult to learn because of the old-fashioned skis. - People can rent snowshoes for a day at their local sports shops or the rental places. - In general, first skills are more important in skiing than in snowboarding or skating. A:","output":"The best answer from the passage is: Downhill skiing used to be more difficult to learn due to the old-fashioned skis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Do those questions have the same meaning? OPT:  1). no.  2). yes.","output":"1). No, these questions do not have the same meaning, although they are related to each other. The first question focuses on achieving two goals simultaneously: reducing body fat and increasing lean muscle mass. The second one only emphasizes lowering the body fat percentage quickly without mentioning the aspect of gaining muscle mass. To answer the first question, lowering body fat and gaining lean muscle mass at the same time can be quite challenging but is possible with a combination of solid nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle changes. Here are the key steps: 1. Balanced nutrition: Consume a healthy, balanced diet rich in lean proteins, whole grains, healthy fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Track your daily calorie intake and ensure you maintain a slight caloric deficit to promote fat loss and maintain a high-protein intake to support muscle growth. 2. Strength training: Incorporate a combination of compound and isolation exercises, focusing on the major muscle groups, at least 3-4 times per week. Utilize moderate-heavy weights, incorporating progressive overload to continually challenge the muscles and trigger growth. 3. Cardiovascular exercise: Include regular cardio activities, such as running, swimming, cycling, or high-intensity interval training (HIIT), aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week to help burn calories and aid in fat loss. 4. Rest and recovery: Prioritize sleep, aiming for at least 7-9 hours of quality rest each night, and give your muscles adequate recovery time between workouts (around 48 hours) to repair and grow. 5. Stay consistent: Remain dedicated and patient with your training regimen and nutritional habits, as achieving your body composition goals can take time. To answer the second question, there are various strategies to drop body fat percentage quickly; however, drastic measures can lead to muscle loss and are not recommended for long-term sustainability. Instead, follow a balanced approach, focusing on a combination of nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle changes, as mentioned above. In addition to the strategies listed for the first question, you can consider the following adjustments to optimize your fat loss more quickly: 1. Higher calorie deficit: Aim for a slightly more significant calorie deficit, around 500-800 calories per day, to promote faster fat loss, but be cautious not to go too low, which could lead to muscle loss or nutrient deficiencies. 2. Increase cardio intensity and frequency: You can increase the number of cardio sessions or the intensity of the workouts to burn additional calories and elevate your metabolic rate. 3. Intermittent fasting: This dietary approach involves alternating periods of eating and fasting to help control calorie intake and potentially accelerate fat loss. Common methods include the 16:8 (fasting for 16 hours and eating within an 8-hour window) and the 5:2 (consuming 500-600 calories on two non-consecutive fasting days and eating normally on the remaining days). Remember, it's essential to prioritize your health and well-being above all and avoid risking your health by trying to achieve rapid fat loss, as it may lead to muscle loss and other adverse effects. It is more beneficial to focus on developing sustainable healthy habits to support gradual, effective body fat reduction and lean muscle growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No; Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what can blow air?\\" is \\"gravity\\", given that  referees can blow air? Answer:","output":"Let us evaluate the options step by step. Step 1: Consider the question \\"What can blow air?\\". The question is asking about things or forces that can push or move air. Step 2: Understand the context of the given example \\"referees can blow air\\". Referees can blow air when they use their mouth to blow into a whistle, which creates a sound. In this case, a human physically pushes air, so human force is applied to blow air. Step 3: Analyze the proposed answer \\"gravity\\". Gravity is the force of attraction between two masses, such as the Earth and objects on or near its surface. While gravity can affect the motion of air particles, it is not typically considered a mechanism for blowing air, as it does not actively push or move air like human force. It mostly holds the air on the earth's atmosphere. Step 4: Compare the proposed answer \\"gravity\\" to the example of referees blowing air. Gravity does not function in the same way as human force when it comes to blowing air. Referees use their lungs and breath to physically push air, whereas gravity simply affects the motion of air interacting with the Earth. Step 5: Determine if \\"gravity\\" is the right answer. Based on the analysis and comparison of the example and the proposed answer, we conclude that gravity is not the right answer to the question \\"What can blow air?\\". Answer: 2).

It could have sparked a bitter battle and ended up a laughable sticking point at the talks—but the Russians backed down.\\" So while Obama worked out in air-conditioned comfort, the notoriously tough Putin went swimming in a chilly nearby lake. Another quirky G8 side note: Putin and Obama are neighbors.","output":"Title: Tensions Mount Between Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin at G8 Summit Over Syrian Conflict At the G8 summit today, US President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin engaged in a tense two-hour meeting, during which the two leaders clashed over the ongoing conflict in Syria. According to the Washington Post, Putin remarked that while their \\"opinions do not coincide,\\" both leaders possess the intention to \\"stop the violence in Syria.\\" Obama reiterated this sentiment, acknowledging the differing perspectives on the problem between the two nations. One of the key points of disagreement between the US and Russia lies in their respective roles in the Syrian conflict. While the US has recently agreed to supply rebel forces with weapons to aid their struggle against President Bashar al-Assad's regime, Russia remains Assad's main weapons supplier. This stark contrast in approach has created a rift between the two global powers as they work toward a resolution of the violent situation in Syria. Further emphasizing the US's commitment to aiding Syrian civilians, the White House announced today that it will send an additional 300 million in aid to Syrian refugees, reports the BBC. As the conflict drags on, the Syrian refugee crisis continues to worsen, placing increased pressure on both regional and global actors to find a solution. It is expected that Syria will be a primary topic of conversation among G8 leaders at the working dinner tonight. Reports from the Associated Press suggest that President Obama is poised to push Britain and France to join the US in arming the Syrian rebels, as he seeks to gain broader support for his administration's stance on the issue. Interestingly, the most intense standoff between Presidents Obama and Putin did not unfold in a meeting room but rather outside - over access to a gym, as reported by the Sun. Sources indicate that both leaders requested time in the gym, but the Russians ultimately backed down since Obama's people had requested it first. While Obama enjoyed a workout in the gym's air-conditioned comfort, the notoriously tough Putin opted for a swim in a nearby chilly lake. In a quirky side note highlighting the often-curious nature of international summits like the G8, Putin and Obama have been designated as neighbors for the duration of the event. As the G8 summit moves forward, it remains to be seen how the tense relationship between the two leaders will play out as they work to address their differences on the Syrian conflict and other pressing global issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Audubon Woodlore goes out on the lake to check on the anglers. Humphrey the Bear is trying to catch some fish, but cannot seem to hold onto one once he catches it.  Woodlore sees the fish disappearing before his eyes, so he decides to stock the lake some more. As he heads to the fish hatchery, he sees Humphrey with a few fishing nets and rods, and asks him what he is doing.  When the bear tells him that he is going to catch some fish, Woodlore takes the rods and nets and tells him to \\"Go fish like a bear!\\" At the hatchery, Woodlore selects an envelope of fish eggs from a collection of eggs from such trout species as dolly vardens and rainbows. He fills a tub with water and inserts the eggs into it.  In a matter of seconds, several fishes pop up out of the water like plants out of soil. When the ranger gets to the lake to dump the fish, he finds Humphrey in there, trying to eat one of the small fishes, which is then consumed by a much larger fish. Humphrey manages to remove the small fish from the mouth of the large fish, and then uses it to lure five other large fishes that jump out of the water, but then Woodlore appears to measure the fish, while at the same time punishing Humphrey by hitting him on the head, causing him to sink into the depths of the lake. When Humphrey grabs some more fish and emerges from the lake, he discovers a fish larger than any of the others; this turns out to be a fish balloon with which a young boy is playing.

Though video games have been afforded legal protection as creative works by the Supreme Court of the United States, the philosophical proposition that video games are works of art remains in question, even when considering the contribution of expressive elements such as graphics, storytelling and music. Even art games, games purposely designed to be a work of creative expression, have been challenged as works of art by some critics.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - Dynamix, Inc. was an American developer of video games from 1984 to 2001, best known for the flight simulator \\"Red Baron\\", the puzzle game \\"The Incredible Machine\\", the \\"Front Page Sports\\" series, the acclaimed \\"Betrayal at Krondor,\\" and their online multiplayer game \\"Tribes\\".  - IMAGE (from Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration), or Explorer 78, was a NASA MIDEX mission that studied the global response of the Earth's magnetosphere to changes in the solar wind. It was launched March 25, 2000 by a Delta II rocket from Vandenberg AFB and ceased operations in December 2005.  - An electronic game is a game that employs electronics to create an interactive system with which a player can play. Video game is the most common form today, and for this reason the terms are often mistakenly used synonymously. Other common forms of electronic game include such products as handheld electronic games, standalone systems (e.g. pinball, slot machines, or electro-mechanical arcade games), and exclusively non-visual products (e.g. audio games).  - Aces of the Pacific is a combat flight simulator game developed by Dynamix and published by Sierra Entertainment in 1992. The game takes place during World War II. Player can choose single or instant mission, or choose to take a career path in United States Army Air Forces, United States Navy, United States Marines, Imperial Japanese Army or Imperial Japanese Navy. Its success caused Dynamix to create a very similar follow-up \\"Aces Over Europe\\" in 1993.

Article: Women in 69 of the world’s poorest countries will have access to an injectable contraceptive shot priced at just 1.      The move to expand access to the contraceptive was announced by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and the Children’s Investment Fund last week.      Sayana Press, the official name of the injection system, will be sold to registered purchasers, enabling some of the poorest women in the world to buy the device at a reduced cost or receive it free.      The contraceptive is based on technology that was used to give Hepatitis B inoculations in Indonesia and was first used for contraception in Burkina Faso.      The single-use, prefilled, non-reusable device cuts the risk of infection due to needle sharing and is effective for three months.      Its simplicity means health workers can easily administer it in a range of settings, including in rural homes.      Women with Sayana Press (PATH/Pfizer)      Dr Chris Elias, head of the global development programme at the Gates Foundation said: “When women are able to plan their families, they are more likely to survive pregnancy and child birth, to have healthier newborns and children, and to invest more in their families’ health and wellbeing.      He added: “We are proud to be part of this innovative public-private collaboration that will help more women around the world - even in remote areas - plan their lives and their futures.”      Among women in developing countries, injectable contraceptives are a widely-used family planning method - in poorer countries the lifetime risk of death due to a maternal cause can be as high as one in 15.

Justine Green, the International Development Secretary, said: “Access to modern, safe and reliable family planning methods is vital in helping women to control their lives and their futures.      “Without the ability to choose when they have children and how many they have, too often women lose the opportunity to participate fully in their economies and societies.”      The announcement comes as the Gates Foundation released its annual letter, in which Bill Gates wrote that the idea that saving lives will lead to overpopulation is a myth.      Instead, he said that basic health, prosperity, equality and access to contraceptives were essential to secure a sustainable world. ||||| Image copyright PATH/Patrick McKern Image caption The new easy-to-use contraceptive device will be available to women in poorer countries for just 1.      An agreement has been signed which will make contraceptive injections available to women in 69 of the world's poorest countries.      It is an injection - but not as you know it.      The special device, with a smaller needle and no traditional syringe, will be sold at just 1 a unit.      An agreement - signed in the past few days - will make the new way of giving contraceptive injections available to women in 69 of the world's poorest countries.      The deal has been reached between the Gates Foundation, the drug company Pfizer and the Children's Investment Fund Foundation.      Previously the technology has been used for giving hepatitis B jabs in Indonesia. Burkina Faso was the first country to use it for contraception.      Image caption Soré is using contraception for the first time and decides the new device is the best option for her.      Soré Néimatou, 20, has a boyfriend, and is visiting a family planning clinic in the capital Ouagadougou.      \\"I don't want to get pregnant,\\" she says. \\"I want to get married first.\\"      She has never used contraception before, and is given a choice of methods. She opts for the new injection - called Sayana Press.      'More acceptable'      The pre-packaged device means there is no need for health workers to prepare a syringe.      Image copyright PATH / Patrick McKern Image caption The new device's all-in-one design avoids the need to prepare a syringe.      The drug is dispensed by simply squeezing a plastic bubble, giving Soré the protection she wants for three months.      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jane Dreaper speaks to Soré, who is using contraception for the first time      Thanks to the design, which is called Uniject, there is no risk of spillages or dosing errors, and because the device cannot be re-used, it cuts out the risk of infection due to needle-sharing.      The simplicity of the device means health workers can be trained more quickly too - a vital consideration for developing countries.      Kadidia Diallo, the midwife who helped Soré, says the device is more acceptable for women in rural areas.      She said: \\"Normally for injections you have to put them in someone's bottom, or the top of their leg, but with this - you use the arm.      \\"That's an advantage for women living in the bush. Many women don't come forward for injections if they have to pull their dresses up - but this is more discreet.\\"      Injectables      In early trials women reported less pain at the injection site than with conventional jabs, too.

Six benefits of family planning 1. Preventing pregnancy-related health risks in women Evidence suggests women who have more than four children have increased maternal mortality risk; avoiding unwanted pregnancies, also reduces the need for unsafe abortions. 2. Reducing infant mortality Closely spaced and ill-timed births contribute to some of the world's highest infant mortality rates. Infants of mothers who die as a result of giving birth also have a greater risk of death and poor health. 3. Helping to prevent HIV/AIDS Reducing the risk of unintended pregnancies among women living with HIV means fewer infected babies and orphans. Condoms also protect against STIs including HIV. 4. Empowering people and enhancing education Informed choices about their sexual and reproductive health gives women enhanced opportunities for education and participation in public life. Children with fewer siblings tend to stay in school longer. 5. Reducing adolescent pregnancies Pregnant teens are more likely to have preterm or low birth-weight babies, and babies born to adolescents have higher rates of neonatal mortality. 6. Slowing population growth Unsustainable population growth results in negative impacts on the economy, environment, and national and regional development efforts.

Almost a quarter of women of child-bearing age in Burkina Faso would like to plan their families by getting pregnant when they want to. Women there have six children on average.      Although the proportion of women using contraception in Africa has doubled in the past two decades - to 26% - it is much harder to obtain for women who are poor, uneducated or living in a rural area.      The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 222m women in developing countries would like to delay or stop conception, but are not currently using any form of contraception.      Injectable contraceptives are a widely-used family planning method among women in developing countries, where the lifetime risk for death due to a maternal cause can be as high as one in 15.      The next countries to start using Sayana Press are Niger, Senegal and Uganda.      The launch comes after many years of work at Path, the organisation behind the design of the device - and money from international donors.      Image copyright PATH/Sara Tifft Image caption Health workers in Niger are being trained how to use Sayana Press.      A Path spokeswoman, Sara Tifft, told BBC News: \\"Burkina Faso was one of four countries identified for this initial pilot introduction, as an outgrowth of the 2012 Family Planning Summit in London.\\"      The summit was co-hosted by the UK government.      International Development Secretary, Justine Greening, said: \\"Access to modern, safe and reliable family planning methods is vital.      \\"Without the ability to choose for themselves when they have children and how many they have, women lose the opportunity to participate fully in their economies and societies.\\"      The makers of Sayana Press hope that one day it could even be used by women to inject themselves with contraception at home. ||||| Washington (AFP) - A contraceptive shot will soon be available at one dollar per dose in 69 of the world's poorest countries, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Pfizer pharmaceuticals announced Thursday.      The move expands a pilot program already begun in a handful of African countries to offer Sayana Press, a single-dose contraceptive which lasts for about three months.      It is based on the Depo-Provera injection but packaged differently, into a plastic bubble with a short needle attached, making it easy to administer beneath the skin.      \\"The reality is that today, over 200 million women around the world want to prevent or time their pregnancies but lack the means to do that,\\" said Chris Elias, a doctor with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.      \\"Through this agreement we are able to ensure this product will be available in the poorest countries for a dollar a dose.\\"      Sayana Press has already been introduced in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal and Uganda, and its use will expand to other countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia. |||||Summary:","output":"A special agreement was made between the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, and the Children's Investment Fund to provide a contraceptive shot to women in 69 of the world's poorest countries for just 1.

They piloted the explosives-laden boat alongside the USS Cole, made friendly gestures to crew members, and detonated the bomb. Quso did not arrive at the apartment in time to film the attack. Back in Afghanistan,  Bin Laden anticipated U.S. military retaliation. He ordered the evacuation of al Qaeda's Kandahar airport compound and fled- first to the desert area near Kabul, then to Khowst and Jalalabad, and eventually back to Kandahar. In Kandahar, he rotated between five to six residences, spending one night at each residence. In addition, he sent his senior advisor, Mohammed Atef, to a different part of Kandahar and his deputy, Ayman al Zawahiri, to Kabul so that all three could not be killed in one attack. There was no American strike. In February 2001, a source reported that an individual whom he identified as the big instructor (probably a reference to  Bin Laden) complained frequently that the United States had not yet attacked. According to the source,  Bin Laden wanted the United States to attack, and if it did not he would launch something bigger. The attack on the USS Cole galvanized al Qaeda's recruitment efforts. Following the attack,  Bin Laden instructed the media committee, then headed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, to produce a propaganda video that included a reenactment of the attack along with images of the al Qaeda training camps and training methods; it also highlighted Muslim suffering in Palestine, Kashmir, Indonesia, and Chechnya. Al Qaeda's image was very important to  Bin Laden, and the video was widely disseminated. Portions were aired on Al Jazeera, CNN, and other television outlets. It was also disseminated among many young men in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and caused many extremists to travel to Afghanistan for training and jihad.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who announced that Kashmir intended to remain independent?  At the time of the transfer of power, the state of Jammu and Kashmir (widely called \\"Kashmir\\") was ruled by Maharaja Hari Singh, a Hindu, although the state itself had a Muslim majority. Hari Singh was equally hesitant about acceding to either India or Pakistan, as either would have provoked adverse reactions in parts of his kingdom. He signed a Standstill Agreement with Pakistan and proposed one with India as well, but announced that Kashmir intended to remain independent. However, his rule was opposed by Sheikh Abdullah, the popular leader of Kashmir's largest political party, the National Conference, who demanded his abdication.Pakistan, attempting to force the issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and transport links. The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed transport links with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of Poonch by the Maharajah's forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest. Shortly thereafter, Pathan tribesmen from the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan crossed the border and entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards Srinagar. The Maharaja of Kashmir wrote to India, asking for military assistance. India required the signing of an Instrument of Accession and setting up an interim government headed by Sheikh Abdullah in return. The Maharaja complied, but Nehru declared that it would have to be confirmed by a plebiscite, although there was no legal requirement to seek such confirmation.Indian troops secured Jammu, Srinagar and the valley itself during the First Kashmir War, but the intense fighting flagged with the onset of winter, which made much of the state impassable.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What were the last names of the two people who agreed to a joint command?  Neill was promoted to lieutenant colonel during his participation in the Siege of Béxar, and 10 days later Houston placed him in charge of the Texian garrison in the city. In January residents had begun evacuating ahead of Santa Anna's approaching forces. Neill pleaded with Houston for replenishment of troops, supplies and weaponry. The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men. At that point Houston viewed Béxar as a military liability and did not want Santa Anna's advancing army gaining control of any remaining soldiers or artillery. He dispatched Bowie with instructions to remove the artillery, have the defenders abandon the Alamo mission and destroy it. Upon his January 19 arrival and subsequent discussions with Neill, Bowie decided the mission was the right place to stop the Mexican army in its tracks.  He stayed and began to help Neill prepare for the coming attack.  Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis arrived with reinforcements on February 3. When Neill was given leave to attend to family matters on February 11, Travis assumed command of the mission, and three days later he and Bowie agreed to a joint command. Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican army's assault on the Alamo began February 23. Captain Juan Seguín left the mission on February 25, carrying a letter from Travis to Fannin at Goliad requesting more reinforcements. Santa Anna extended an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress; a non-combatant survivor, Enrique Esparza, said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer. In response to Travis' February 24 letter To the People of Texas, 32 militia volunteers formed the Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers and arrived at the Alamo on February 29.

The Kannada poets and scholars of the empire produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas (devotees of Vishnu), Brahminical and Veerashaiva (Lingayatism) literature. The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called Devaranama (lyrical poems) in the native meters of Sangatya (quatrain), Suladi (beat based), Ugabhoga (melody based) and Mundige (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many Dasas (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution. Kumara Vyasa, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote Gadugina Bharata, a translation of the epic Mahabharata. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. Chamarasa was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His Prabhulinga Leele, later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint Allama Prabhu (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi).At this peak of Telugu literature, the most famous writing in the Prabandha style was Manucharitamu. King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated Amuktamalyada. Amuktamalyada (\\"One who wears and gives away garlands\\") narrates the story of the wedding of the god Vishnu to Andal, the Tamil Alvar saint poet and the daughter of Periyalvar at Srirangam.

It all begins in the late 1920s when Ma leaves her husband, George, and her Arkansas home and embarks on her own with her four sons on a robbery-murder spree to make her own fortune, while keeping them under a tight leash.When Herman and Fred are arrested and imprisoned for petty theft charges, Ma takes over the group and leads Arthur and Lloyd on a bank robbery spree to gain enough money to get her sons out of jail. The gang is joined by a gunman named Kevin (Bruce Dern) (patterned after gunman Alvin Karpis) whom was Fred's cellmate during his incarceration and his (strongly implied) lover. The group is also joined by a local prositute named Mona Gibson (Diane Varsi), whom Herman frequented before his imprisonment. The gang resorts to more violent action and robberies.While hiding out at a cabin in Kentucky, Lloyd comes across a young woman swimming at a nearby lake whom he sexually assaults. Not wanting the woman to report them to the police, the Barkers hold her captive and Ma eventually kills her by drowning her despite the protests of her sons.Another time later, the gang arrives in Tennessee where they abduct a wealthy businessman named Sam Pendlebury (Pat Hingle) (patterned after brewerymaker William Hamm whom the Barker gang kidnapped in 1933). Holding him for a 300,000 ransom, the sons, particularly Herman, bond with their captive whom they see as the sympathic father figure they never had. When Herman and Mona go to collect the ransom, they are chased by a pair of FBI agents and bearly escape. When they find that the ransom is only half of what they orginally demanded, Ma orders her sons to kill Sam...

London (CNN) -- In the week between her death and her funeral, Britons are having an awkward time coming to terms with the legacy of Margaret Thatcher, a prime minister who last held office 23 years ago -- meaning no one under 40 could have voted for her, yet the mix of anger and admiration is spread across the generations.  The emotional outpouring in this famously undemonstrative nation is matched in recent memory only by the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, when flowers piled up outside royal palaces and Elton John's mawkish \\"Candle in the Wind\\" surged to the top of the charts. But while Diana was mourned in unity by millions as the \\"people's princess,\\" Thatcher's death is being marked in widely different and unpredictable ways.  WATCH: Not everyone's mourning Thatcher's death  It has become an overused adjective in the media that Thatcher was \\"divisive.\\" Some countries might put aside political differences and unite to respect the passing of a leader -- especially the first and only female PM, who won three successive general elections. But in the UK debate about Thatcher is raging almost as fiercely as it did in the 1980s over issues like the privatization of industries, the Falklands War, tax and social policy, her close relationship with American President Ronald Reagan and combative stance against the European Union.  To many she was the woman who broke the mold, showing the way for others, and the leader who made \\"Britain great again,\\" according to PM David Cameron.

Pam studied more about high latitudes (70 to 50°N), while Alice studied about lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S).  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person studied less about the Andes of South America?  Hint: Alpine tundra occurs at high enough altitude at any latitude. Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft). A:","output":"Given the information, the person who studied less about the Andes of South America would likely be Pam.  Here's my reasoning:  1.

Q:A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.  Two groups of teens studied fire for the physics class.

Given the question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Where are Tajikistan authorities also fighting drug trafficking at home?\\" is in \\"Drug trafficking is the major illegal source of income in Tajikistan as it is an important transit country for Afghan narcotics bound for Russian and, to a lesser extent, Western European markets; some opium poppy is also raised locally for the domestic market. However, with the increasing assistance from international organizations, such as UNODC, and cooperation with the US, Russian, EU and Afghan authorities a level of progress on the fight against illegal drug-trafficking is being achieved. Tajikistan holds third place in the world for heroin and raw opium confiscations (1216.3 kg of heroin and 267.8 kg of raw opium in the first half of 2006). Drug money corrupts the country's government; according to some experts the well-known personalities that fought on both sides of the civil war and have held the positions in the government after the armistice was signed are now involved in the drug trade. UNODC is working with Tajikistan to strengthen border crossings, provide training, and set up joint interdiction teams. It also helped to establish Tajikistani Drug Control Agency.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer is:","output":"Tajikistan authorities are fighting drug trafficking primarily at the border crossings, where they collaborate with international organizations like UNODC and other countries such as the US, Russia, EU, and Afghanistan to strengthen and reinforce these areas. In addition, they are working towards improving training and setting up joint interdiction teams to combat this issue more effectively. UNODC has also played a role in assisting the establishment of the Tajikistani Drug Control Agency.  Drug trafficking remains a significant problem in Tajikistan due to its strategic location as a transit country for Afghan narcotics heading towards Russian and Western European markets. This has led to a major illegal source of income within Tajikistan, resulting in the cultivation of opium poppy locally for the domestic market as well. The country has made progress in battling drug trafficking, as evidenced by its position as third in the world for heroin and raw opium confiscations—1216.3 kg of heroin and 267.8 kg of raw opium in the first half of 2006 alone. However, corruption persists within the Tajikistani government as drug money influences key political figures. This is further complicated by the involvement of these personalities in the drug trade, as they previously fought on opposing sides of the civil war and subsequently assumed positions in the government following the establishment of the armistice. In order to tackle the multifaceted issue of drug trafficking, Tajikistan authorities continue to work closely with international organizations and foreign cooperation to bolster their efforts at the home front, with a focus on strengthening border crossings and enhancing interagency collaboration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this math problem Solve -729*b + 743*b + 364 = 0 for b.","output":"To solve this algebraic equation for the variable b, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the terms with the b variable. -729*b and 743*b are the terms with the variable b, and since they both have the same variable, we can combine them. -729*b + 743*b = 14*b Now, the simplified equation looks like this: 14*b + 364 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the b variable. To isolate the b variable, we need to move the constant term (+364) to the other side of the equation by subtracting 364 from both sides. 14*b + 364 - 364 = 0 - 364 This results in: 14*b = -364 Step 3: Solve for b. Finally, we need to find the value of b by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of b, which is 14.

Pam and Ellie are two entomologists. they are both studying ants at the moment: Ellie is studying leafcutter ants, while Pam is studying ants that farm aphids.  Hint: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators.

In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides).  - The Otago Gold Rush (often called the Central Otago Gold Rush) was a gold rush that occurred during the 1860s in Central Otago, New Zealand. This was the country's biggest gold strike, and led to a rapid influx of foreign miners to the area - many of them veterans of other hunts for the precious metal in California and Victoria, Australia.  - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand.

It is a versatile material with many uses, including writing, printing, packaging, cleaning, and a number of industrial and construction processes.  - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.  - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere.  - Copper is a chemical element with symbol Cu (from ) and atomic number 29. It is a soft, malleable, and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity. A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a reddish-orange color. Copper is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a building material, and as a constituent of various metal alloys, such as sterling silver used in jewelry, cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins, and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement.  - Arizona (O'odham: \\"Al onak\\" [ai onak]) is a state in the southwestern region of the United States. It is also part of the Western United States and the Mountain West states. It is the sixth largest and the 14th most populous of the 50 states. Its capital and largest city is Phoenix. Arizona is one of the Four Corners states. It has borders with New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, California, and Mexico, and one point in common with the southwestern corner of Colorado. Arizona's border with Mexico is 389 miles (626 km) long, on the northern border of the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California.  - In chemistry and physics, the atomic number of a chemical element (also known as its proton number) is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom of that element, and therefore identical to the charge number of the nucleus. It is conventionally represented by the symbol Z. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons.    What is the relationship between 'gabriel read' and 'explorer'? The answer to this question is:","output":"Gabriel Read was a Tasmanian gold prospector who, after working on the goldfields of California and Victoria, Australia, traveled to New Zealand in search of gold. In May 1861, he discovered gold near the banks of the Tuapeka River in Otago, at a site named Gabriel's Gully after him. This discovery led to the Otago Gold Rush. Although Gabriel Read was not an explorer in the traditional sense, his prospecting activities and significant gold discovery in a previously untapped location bear similarities to exploration, as he ventured into new regions and contributed to their development."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Title: 2 strikes, you're out Review: I have actually bought two of these models because I thought that perhaps the first one just had a non-standard flaw (silly me).

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the rock is in a cold climate where freezing weather is common happens, how will it affect LESS or SLOWER weathering occurring.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"In a cold climate where freezing weather is common, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that there would be less or slower weathering occurring. However, this is unlikely to be the case. In fact, the frequent freezing weather would likely cause more rapid weathering.  The process in question involves water getting into cracks in rocks, freezing into ice, and causing the cracks to expand. Over time, this leads to rocks splitting and breaking into smaller pieces. In a cold climate with frequent freezing conditions, this freeze-thaw cycle would occur more frequently. This means that the water would freeze into ice more often, leading to more expansion of the cracks and ultimately more rapid splitting of the rocks. Therefore, the supposed perturbation does have an effect on the process, but it is not the expected effect of causing less or slower weathering. Instead, the frequent freezing weather in a cold climate would likely cause more rapid weathering due to the increased frequency of the freeze-thaw cycle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We've forgotten that it is, indeed, a machine. A machine that requires careful and constant maintenance. Its parts need occasional replacing, its oils need replenishing, and sometimes, its whole mechanism may need a reboot. But we have also overlooked that it is a delicate apparatus. It can withstand a modest amount of strain but cannot tolerate a sudden, drastic change.\\" The guild leaders nodded in understanding. The guilds, under their leadership, had formed the gears and cogs that kept the machine of society running. For them, power was not an attraction. A well-oiled and smooth-running machine guaranteed their interests and the welfare of the people. Change, surely, was inevitable. But change too drastic, too rapid, could fracture the gears, snap the belts, and bring the whole mechanism to a grinding halt. \\"Of course taking over can give an immediacy of the power, but the question is can we handle what follows it?\\" Mr. Boggis quipped, his brow creased with concern. \\"Day after tomorrow may not look like tomorrow then.\\"  \\"True,\\" said Mrs. Serrocold, another influential guild leader. \\"Our ancestors built this machine not for power but for peace, for prosperity.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the first names of the two people who are married and run a bookstore? ?  In 1939, in the Kingdom of Italy, Guido Orefice is a young Jewish man who arrives to work in the city where his uncle Eliseo operates a restaurant. Guido is comical and sharp, and falls in love with a girl named Dora. Later, he sees her again in the city where she is a teacher and set to be engaged to a rich, but arrogant, man, a local government official with whom Guido has regular run-ins. Guido sets up many \\"coincidental\\" incidents to show his interest in Dora. Finally, Dora sees Guido's affection and promise, and gives in, against her better judgement. He steals her from her engagement party, on a horse, humiliating her fiancé and mother. They are later married and have a son, Giosué, and run a bookstore. When World War II breaks out, Guido, his uncle Eliseo, and Giosué are seized on Giosuè's birthday. They and many other Jews are forced onto a train and taken to a concentration camp. After confronting a guard about her husband and son, and being told there is no mistake, Dora volunteers to get on the train in order to be close to her family. However, as men and women are separated in the camp, Dora and Guido never see each other during the internment. Guido pulls off various stunts, such as using the camp's loudspeaker to send messages—symbolic or literal—to Dora to assure her that he and their son are safe. Eliseo is executed in a gas chamber shortly after their arrival. Giosuè narrowly avoids being gassed himself as he hates to take baths and showers, and did not follow the other children when they had been ordered to enter the gas chambers and were told they were showers.

The premise is like saying that the bowl of water is so big that you could put the toy planet in it, and it would be underwater. The hypothesis is a suggestion that maybe it would be better if the toy planet was drowned in that big bowl of water. To see if the hypothesis is true when the premise is true, we check if the size of the ocean is enough reason to believe it's better to drown the planet. But, just because the ocean is big enough, it doesn't mean it's better to drown the planet. There might be other things to consider, like the people living on the planet or if it's a healthy thing to do.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In Houston, 1913, nine-year-old Howard Hughes is warned by his mother of the diseases to which she is afraid he will succumb. Fourteen years later, he begins to direct the movie Hell's Angels. However, after the release of The Jazz Singer, the first partially talking film, Hughes becomes obsessed with shooting his film realistically, and decides to convert the movie to a sound film. Despite the film being a hit, Hughes remains unsatisfied with the end result and orders the film to be recut after its Hollywood premiere. He becomes romantically involved with actress Katharine Hepburn, who helps to ease the symptoms of his worsening obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In 1935, Hughes test flies the H-1 Racer, pushing it to a new speed record. Three years later, he breaks the world record by flying around the world in four days. He subsequently purchases majority interest in Transcontinental &amp; Western Air, aggravating Juan Trippe, company rival and chairman of Pan American World Airways (Pan Am). Trippe gets his friend, Senator Owen Brewster, to introduce the Community Airline Bill, giving Pan Am exclusivity on international air travel. As Hughes' fame grows, he is linked to various starlets, causing a jealous Hepburn to break up with him following her announcement that she has fallen in love with fellow actor Spencer Tracy. Hughes quickly finds a new love interest with 15-year-old Faith Domergue, and later actress Ava Gardner. Hughes secures a contract with the Army Air Forces for two projects: a spy aircraft and a troop transport unit. In 1946, with the \\"Spruce Goose\\" flying boat still in construction, Hughes finishes the XF-11 reconnaissance aircraft and takes it for a test flight. However, one of the engines fails midflight, and the aircraft crashes in Beverly Hills, with Hughes getting severely injured. With the end of WWII, the army cancels its order for the H-4 Hercules, although Hughes still continues the development with his own money. When he is discharged, he is informed that he must choose...

Answer the following question: You are presented with the quiz \\"What can cause debris?\\"   But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"breaking apart rocks can cause debris\\" and \\"examples of such rock include sandstone and shale \\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"What can cause debris?\\" given the hints provided by the teacher is the natural process of rock disintegration or the breakdown of rocks such as sandstone and shale. This process can occur through various mechanisms, some of which are outlined below. 1. Weathering: Weathering is the gradual breakdown of rocks due to exposure to the atmosphere, moisture, and temperature variations. There are two main types of weathering: physical (or mechanical) and chemical. Physical weathering includes processes like freeze-thaw cycles, thermal expansion, and salt crystallization, which cause rocks to crack and break apart. Chemical weathering involves the alteration of the rock's chemical composition due to reactions with the environment, such as water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. This results in mineral breakdown and rock dissolution, causing debris. 2. Erosion: Erosion is the process by which rock particles and sediments are transported from one location to another due to external forces such as wind, water, ice, and gravity. Erosion physically wears down rocks and can cause debris by breaking apart pieces of rocks and carrying them away to be deposited elsewhere. For example, in a river, flowing water can erode the banks and bed of the river and remove and transport rocks causing debris. 3. Biological processes: The activities of living organisms can also contribute to the formation of debris. Plant roots, for instance, can penetrate into the cracks of rocks and, as they grow, exert pressure that causes the rock to break apart. Similarly, burrowing animals can weaken rock structures and accelerate the disintegration process. 4. Human activities: Several human activities contribute to the generation of debris by causing the breakdown of rocks. Construction, mining, and quarrying activities often involve blasting and drilling, which break apart rocks to extract valuable minerals or create space for infrastructure. Additionally, land development and deforestation can lead to increased erosion and destabilization of rock formations, resulting in debris formation. In summary, the best answer to the question \\"What can cause debris?\\" is the breakdown of rocks, such as sandstone and shale, due to processes such as weathering, erosion, biological activities, and human interventions. These processes cause rocks to fragment, disintegrate, and create debris, which accumulates and impacts various aspects of the natural environment and human activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We have the equation:  6629 = 20*y - 8*y + 10*y + 6541 First, let's combine all the terms with \\"y\\" in them. We have 20*y, -8*y, and 10*y. To put them all together, we'll add or subtract the numbers in front of the \\"y\\"s: 20*y - 8*y + 10*y Now, let's think about it like this: You have 20 apples, you give away 8 apples, and then you get 10 more apples. So: 20 - 8 + 10 = 12 + 10 = 22 So, when we combine all the \\"y\\"s, we get 22*y. Our equation now looks like this: 6629 = 22*y + 6541 Now, we want to isolate the \\"y\\" to solve for it. To do this, let's subtract 6541 from both sides of the equation. That will help us get y by itself: 6629 - 6541 = 22*y + 6541 - 6541 88 = 22*y We're almost there! Now we just need to get y completely by itself. Since it's being multiplied by 22, we'll do the opposite, which is dividing by 22, on both sides: 88 ÷ 22 = 22*y ÷ 22 4 = y So, our answer is y = 4.

Some borderssuch as a state's internal administrative border, or inter-state borders within the Schengen Areaare often open and completely unguarded. Other borders are partially or fully controlled, and may be crossed legally only at designated border checkpoints and border zones may be controlled. Mostly contentious, borders may even foster the setting up of buffer zones. A difference has also been established in academic scholarship between border and frontier, the latter denoting a state of mind rather than state boundaries.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - The Isles of Scilly (or \\"\\") are an archipelago off the south western tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain.

Once enclosed, use of the land became restricted to the owner, and it ceased to be common land for communal use. In England and Wales the term is also used for the process that ended the ancient system of arable farming in open fields. Under enclosure, such land is fenced (\\"enclosed\\") and \\"deeded\\" or \\"entitled\\" to one or more owners. The process of enclosure began to be a widespread feature of the English agricultural landscape during the 16th century. By the 19th century, unenclosed commons had become largely restricted to rough pasture in mountainous areas and to relatively small parts of the lowlands.  - Stourbridge is a large town in the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley, in the West Midlands of England.

An aim of the Act was to increase efficiency of local government: the two counties are among England's smaller and less populous counties, particularly after the same Act transferred some of Worcestershire's most urbanised areas to the West Midlands. The merger aroused much opposition from Herefordshire people, many of whom regarded it as not a merger but a takeover by Worcestershire.  - Herefordshire (abbreviated Herefs. or Hfds.) is a historic English county in the West Midlands.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many millions of LT did the war against Aragon and the war against England over Gascony cost combined?","output":"Title: Economic Impact of the Wars Against Aragon and England Over Gascony: A Combined Cost Analysis Introduction: Throughout the course of history, nations and empires have engaged in warfare for various reasons such as territorial disputes, resources, and political ideology. In this analysis, we shall focus on the wars against Aragon and the war against England over Gascony, delving into the combined financial burden these conflicts imposed. Before we calculate the total cost, it is essential to unravel each conflict to provide a basic understanding of the situations. Step 1: Understanding the Wars A. War against Aragon: The war against Aragon took place in the late 13th century and early 14th century. This conflict was primarily a struggle for the control of the Mediterranean, as both kingdoms fought for dominance. The underlying cause of these wars was political, territorial, and commercial. B. War against England over Gascony: Also known as the Hundred Years' War, the long-standing conflict between England and France stretched from 1337 to 1453. The main contention in this war was the English king's claim to the French throne and the allegiance of Gascony, a region situated in the southwest of the Kingdom of France. Gascony was essential to both nations due to its fertile lands and abundant resources. Step 2: Estimation of the War Cost in Livres Tournois (LT) To gauge the combined cost of these wars, we must estimate their individual costs. The cost of war generally includes military expenses, provisions, and resources, administrative costs, and potential loss of life and property. As most historical records use the currency Livres Tournois (LT), it is important to adhere to this standard while calculating costs. A. War against Aragon: Though accurate records of the total cost of the war against Aragon are scarce, a conservative estimate would place it at several millions of LT. Factors such as the length of the war, the size of the armies involved, and the cost of logistics and administration are some relevant variables that contribute to this staggering figure. B. War against England over Gascony: Historians have estimated the cost of the Hundred Years' War to be around 60-100 million LT, assuming the number of troops involved, weapons and armament expenditures, food and supplies, siege equipment, and navy upkeep and construction. Step 3: Combined Cost of the Wars To determine the combined cost of the wars against Aragon and the war against England over Gascony, we add the estimated costs together. As specific numbers for the war against Aragon are unavailable, the assertion made for this analysis will be based on a rough estimate. Assuming the war against Aragon cost X million LT, the total combined cost of both wars would then be: Combined Cost = X million LT (War against Aragon) + 60 to 100 million LT (War against England over Gascony) Conclusion: An estimation of the combined cost of the wars against Aragon and England over Gascony places the figure at X million LT (for the war against Aragon) plus 60 to 100 million LT (for the Hundred Years' War). While the lack of precise data regarding the War against Aragon makes it challenging to propose an exact amount, it is clear from historical accounts that both wars imposed a significant financial burden. The resources invested in these conflicts undoubtedly influenced each nation's economy and had lasting consequences not only on the societies involved but also on the contemporary geopolitical landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:The defending champions are level on points with Real Madrid, who beat Deportivo la Coruna 6-2 later on Wednesday and have a game in hand. Messi's 501st Barca goal opened the scoring, before Andre Gomes smashed in. Roberto Torres gave the away side hope, but further strikes by Gomes and Messi, two from Paco Alcacer and Javier Mascherano's first Barca goal followed. After Messi's 12th-minute opener, fans held up their shirts as they mirrored the Argentine's celebration of a 93rd-minute winner - his 500th goal for Barca - at Madrid on Sunday. That 3-2 victory re-opened the title race in dramatic fashion, but Barca must hope Madrid slip up in one of their five remaining matches if they are to defend last season's success. Leganes beat Las Palmas later on Wednesday to confirm bottom side Osasuna's relegation. After Torres curled past Marc-Andre Ter Stegen just after half-time, they were buried by four goals within 20 minutes. Messi's second of the night was the pick of the bunch as he skipped past a series of challenges and fired home, shortly after Gomes had put Barca 3-1 up with his second, tapping in after Gerard Pique's header struck the post. Argentina forward Messi has now scored 49 goals this season in all competitions, from 48 games. Mascherano's first goal in 319 games for Barca was thumped home from the penalty spot after Messi had been withdrawn. As he ran up to take it, the Barca bench watched on in excitement, with Luis Suarez - rested for the match - barely able to contain his glee. \\"At first I tried to get out of it but under pressure from my team-mates and the crowd I decided to take it on,\\" Mascherano said. \\"It would have been a fun moment to remember in years to come had I missed it. I wasn't sure about it at all but it was difficult to say no to my team-mates.\\" It was the 32-year-old's third goal in senior club football, having scored twice during three years at previous club Liverpool - who he left for Barca in 2010. \\"The fans behind the goal were chanting for Mascherano to take it,\\" manager Luis Enrique said. \\"I am happy for him - he is a key player for the club and he has shown that down the years.\\" Match ends, Barcelona 7, Osasuna 1.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The film begins with the Descendents' origins in the neighboring communities of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, California in the late 1970s. Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper.

Members of the academy including avid movie viewers, fans or enthusiasts will cast their votes on who should win the statuettes on different categories they were nominated. Established since 1952, it the oldest existing film industry award-giving body in the Philippines and one of the oldest in Asia (the oldest is the Kinema Junpo Awards in Japan). The FAMAS Awards, from 1952 to 1982, was the highest Filipino film award a filmmaker or artisan could receive in the local movie industry.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - LVN Pictures, Inc. is one of the biggest film studios in the history of Philippine cinema and its foremost establishment in motion picture post-production until 2005. In its heyday of motion picture production, LVN Pictures has been compared to that of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios (MGM) of Hollywood because it had, under contract, the biggest stars and film craftsmen of the period. This was the oldest living film studio running for 68 years.  - Gloria Lerma Yatco ( born June 22 , 1922 ) , better known as Mona Lisa , is a FAMAS award - winning Filipino film actress .

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.  - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC.  - Charlemagne (2 April 742/747/74828 January 814), also known as Charles the Great or Charles I, was King of the Franks. He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages and laid the foundations for modern France, Germany and the Low Countries. He took the Frankish throne in 768 and became King of Italy in 774. From 800, he served as the first Holy Roman Emperorthe first recognised emperor in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier.  - The French are an ethnic group and nation who are identified with the country of France. This connection may be legal, historical, or cultural.  - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world.  - In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing \\"de facto\\" independent entities; however, at no point did Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by the Emperor Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court.  - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement.  - A dispersed settlement, also known as a scattered settlement, is one of the main types of settlement patterns used by landscape historians to classify rural settlements found in England and other parts of the world. Typically, there are a number of separate farmsteads scattered throughout the area. A dispersed settlement contrasts with a nucleated village.  - The Rhine (, , ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the  Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a title for this article: Police-community relations, already strained by nationwide protests over the deaths in recent months of unarmed black people at the hands of white officers, grew even more fragile Sunday in the wake of the assassination-style slayings of two New York City patrolmen. A day after officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were fatally shot in their patrol car, recriminations flew in the country’s largest city, with Mayor Bill de Blasio standing at the epicenter. Critics blamed the mayor and his aggressive campaign to reform police practices for the shootings, with officers taking the extraordinary step of silently turning their backs on de Blasio as he entered the hospital where the two patrolmen died. Relations between the mayor and officers have become so strained, former New York City police commissioner Ray Kelly said in an interview, that de Blasio “probably needs an intermediary to go between himself and the [police] unions, maybe a religious leader.” While other New York elected officials defended the mayor, concerns about more anti-police violence extended elsewhere, with departments and police unions in states including Massachusetts and New Jersey warning officers to be on high alert. In the Washington area — where suspect Ismaaiyl Brinsley on Saturday allegedly shot and wounded his former girlfriend near Baltimore before traveling to Brooklyn, killing the two police officers and taking his own life — officers said they felt vulnerable. “We are in uniform and in marked cars,” said Delroy Burton, head of the D.C. Fraternal Order of Police. “There is no way to defend against someone who wants to do us harm. There is no way to see it coming.” More information emerged Sunday about the slayings of the officers, as well as the background of the alleged shooter. Police described Brinsley as a highly troubled man with a violent past, saying he had been arrested 19 times — 15 times in Georgia and four in Ohio — and that his mother had feared him. A year ago, they said, Brinsley tried to hang himself. While authorities said it was unclear whether Brinsley had been involved in the protests that have roiled the nation in recent weeks, leaders of the burgeoning national movement against police violence worked to distance themselves from the events in New York. Even so, the level of blame laid at their feet by some politicians illustrated the tense atmosphere. Just three hours before Saturday’s shootings, authorities said, Brinsley declared his intention on his Instagram account to kill police officers as retribution for the police killings of Michael Brown in Missouri and Eric Garner in New York City. Former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani (R), known for his tough anti-crime policies in the 1990s, blamed not only the protesters for Saturday’s shootings but also the sympathy they have garnered from de Blasio and President Obama. “We’ve had four months of propaganda, starting with the president, that everybody should hate the police,” Giuliani said on “Fox and Friends Weekend.” “I don’t care how you want to describe it: That’s what those protests are all about.” De Blasio has condemned the killings as “a despicable act,” and the White House said Obama called New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton on Sunday morning to express his condolences. “The President reiterated his call for the American people to reject violence and words that harm, and turn to words that heal — prayer, patient dialogue, and sympathy for the friends and family of the fallen,” the White House said in a statement. Police on Sunday said Brinsley, 28, had a long criminal record and an apparent history of mental illness. Family and city officials in New York are calling for peace in the days ahead following the deadly ambush of two police officers in their squad car over the weekend. (AP) Born in Brooklyn, Brinsley attended high school in New Jersey, with his mother telling officers that he was violent growing up and that she feared him, according to Robert Boyce, NYPD chief of detectives. While Boyce said at a news conference that he would not speculate on a motive, he said Brinsley had burned a flag in one Instagram posting and mentioned Brown and Garner in others. Soon before the officers were shot in the head at point-blank range while sitting beside each other in a police car in the East Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn, Brinsley approached several witnesses on the street, asked them to follow him on Instagram and said, “Watch what I’m going to do,” police said. After the shooting, Brinsley ran up the street and was pursued by other officers into a subway station, where he was found with a gunshot wound that appeared to be self-inflicted, police said. He was declared dead at a nearby hospital, police said. Authorities Sunday also detailed the Washington area’s connection to the attacks. Police said the same 9mm semiautomatic handgun that killed Liu and Ramos was probably used earlier Saturday near Baltimore to shoot and wound Brinsley’s former girlfriend. Police identified her as Shaneka Nicole Thompson, 29. Before he made his way to Brooklyn on Saturday morning, police said, Brinsley shot Thompson at about 5:45 a.m. in Owings Mills, Md., about 15 miles outside Baltimore. In a statement, Baltimore County police said she was wounded in the abdomen, and is in critical but stable condition at an area hospital but is expected to survive. Officers said they have not been able to interview her because of her condition but were hoping to speak with her later Sunday. Brinsley’s address is unknown, and the police statement said that authorities “believe he has no ties to the Baltimore area except Thompson.” Police said that they believe Brinsley and Thompson had a previous romantic relationship that dates back less than a year and that Thompson lived alone at the apartment where she was shot. “There is no indication of prior criminal activity by Brinsley in Maryland,” the statement said. The shooting early Saturday occurred inside an apartment at Greenwich Place at Town Center, a gated complex. Apartment managers told a reporter to leave Saturday night and Sunday morning. Thompson’s 71-year-old grandfather, James Delly, who lives in South Carolina, said that he had never heard of the suspect and that his granddaughter, with whom he is close, never mentioned him. “I don’t know anything about him,” he said in a telephone interview Sunday. He said Thompson’s mother, who lives in South Carolina, is in Baltimore with her daughter at the hospital. Of the family, Delly said, “I think they’re just holding out to see if my granddaughter is going to come through.” The recriminations directed primarily at de Blasio for the shootings began Saturday, with the head of the New York City police union saying the mayor had “blood on his hands” and former New York governor George Pataki (R) saying on Twitter that the shootings “sadly are a predictable outcome of divisive anti-cop rhetoric” of the mayor and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. Asked about Pataki’s tweet in an interview Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said, “I blame the shooter and nobody else.” But he added, “I think the mayor of New York has probably undercut his cops, and the attorney general is trying to walk a fine line.” Others defended de Blasio, arguing that he is trying to bridge divisions, not widen them. De Blasio campaigned for mayor in part on reforming police tactics that he said had unfairly targeted minorities — especially the controversial “stop and frisk” policy, under which police stopped virtually anyone deemed suspicious. “I think the tone that the mayor is trying to set is a tone that brings people together,” Rep. Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.) said on ABC’s “This Week.” “We stand with the police department. No one has ever given up on the police department or said we were anti-police-department. What we were crying for was just saying how African Americans feel — how their communities are policed.’’ Leaders of the diverse movement that has been protesting police tactics also took pains to distance themselves and their organizations from the killings. In statements, social-media postings and interviews, protest organizers struck a unified message, emphasizing that the shootings were tragic and not linked to the protests. They pointed to their repeated public calls advocating nonviolence. “We’ve all said that this is a horrible thing that shouldn’t have happened,” said Charles Wade, a leading protest organizer. “I say time and time again that I’m against police violence and I’m not against police officers in general.” Back in Brooklyn, a memorial continued to grow at the site where the officers died. Ramos, 40, was a lifelong Brooklyn resident who joined the police force after working as a school security guard, according to the Associated Press. He was married with two sons, a 13-year-old and one in college, the AP reported. His younger son, Jaden, said goodbye to his father Saturday night in a post on Facebook: “Today I had to say bye to my father. He was the best father I could ask for. . . . I will always love you and never forget you. RIP Dad.” Liu, 32, had been with the force for seven years and had gotten married just two months ago, the AP reported. Supporters at the memorial site Sunday used a phrase associated with protest movements to express their grief. They held candles and sang, “We shall overcome.” Jessica Dunn, 34, a local resident, pushed her way through the crowd to lay a bouquet of roses at the memorial. “I came to pay my respects. We need to let the police know how much this community needs them, especially right now,” she said. “I came to show respect.” Amy Ellis Nutt and Danielle Paquette in New York, and Peter Holley, Sean Sullivan, Wesley Lowery and Alice Crites in Washington contributed to this report.","output":"Title: The Fraying Bond: Tensions Escalate Between Police and the Community After NYC Officers' Assassination-Style Killings In this article, we explore the escalating tensions between law enforcement and communities in the United States after the recent assassination-style slayings of two New York City patrolmen.

A: Of the human genome, only 1–2% consists of protein-coding genes, with the remainder being 'noncoding' DNA such as introns, retrotransposons, and noncoding RNAs.  Does the answer correctly answer the question","output":"Yes, the answer correctly answers the question. The percentage of the human genome composed of protein-coding genes is approximately 1–2%, while the rest of the genome is made up of noncoding DNA, including introns, retrotransposons, and noncoding RNAs.  While it may seem surprising that such a small portion of the human genome encodes for proteins, it is important to note that noncoding DNA serves essential regulatory roles within the genome. It aids in controlling gene expression, regulating various cellular processes, and maintaining overall genome stability.  Introns, for example, are sequences of DNA found within genes that do not directly code for proteins. Rather, they are transcribed into RNA before being spliced out during RNA processing, and they contribute to gene regulation, alternative splicing, and mRNA stability.  Retrotransposons are genetic elements that can move around in the genome through a \\"copy and paste\\" mechanism. They compose a significant portion of the human genome (approximately 45%). While often considered \\"junk DNA,\\" some retrotransposons play essential roles in gene regulation and chromosomal structure.  Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are RNA molecules that do not encode proteins. Instead, they serve a variety of functional roles, such as gene regulation, splicing, and maintaining the stability and structure of the genome. Examples of noncoding RNAs include ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Thus, although only a small percentage of the human genome encodes for proteins, the vast majority of the genome is comprised of noncoding DNA that performs vital functions necessary for proper cellular organization and function."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: make tires squeal  B: be on time  C: drift the car Answer:","output":"Based on the given context, the best answer to the question \\"Why did Remy pass the other car quickly?\\" would be option B: \\"be on time.\\" The context clearly indicates that Remy was rushing to an appointment which leads us to assume that he passed the other car quickly to reach his destination promptly and be on time for his appointment. Option A and C seem irrelevant in the current context. Making tires squeal or drifting the car was not highlighted or suggested in the given scenario. Remy's motive, according to the passage, appears to be neither entertainment nor the experience of thrill that typically is associated with making tires squeal or drifting a car. His haste was specifically linked to his need to reach an appointment, suggesting a more practical purpose behind his quick driving. Therefore, Remy's action of overtaking the other car rapidly was most likely driven by his need to maintain his schedule and arrive at his appointment on time, making B: \\"be on time\\" the most suitable answer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here are some concepts: book, cathedral, depict, mosaic, scene What is a sentence about these concepts?","output":"A book that accurately depicts the various scenes inside a cathedral uses detailed mosaics as one of its main illustration methods.  The concepts given - book, cathedral, depict, mosaic, and scene - are subtly interlinked to each other and encompass a rich blend of literature, art, architecture, and narrative representation. We can unfold the rich narrative crafted by these intertwining concepts by dissecting them individually and then seamlessly weaving them back together. Starting with the concept of a book, it is primarily a medium of knowledge that transports us into different worlds. It represents the author’s ability to narrate stories, express thoughts, share experiences, or propagate knowledge about various subjects. Moving on to the concept of a cathedral, it is a symbol of architectural brilliance and religious significance. A cathedral refers to a Christian church which contains the seat of a bishop, making it a central church of a diocese, conference, or episcopate. Intricate details characterize these divine structures, including stained glass windows, towering spires, and interior mosaics, adding to their grandeur and playing a critical role in the religious narrative they portray. This leads us to the concept of depiction. Depiction is all about visual representation or portrayal of something in art or literature. The concept binds together the visual appeal of a cathedral and the metaphorical narrative of a book. \\"Scene\\" denotes a sequence or a part of an event, a play, a movie, or even a book. In our context, a scene refers to the various scenarios that one can encounter inside a cathedral. It could range from a holy mass in progress to the silent, serene emptiness of a cathedral, each one carrying a unique allure. Finally, the concept of mosaics refers to an artistic technique that creates images by assembling small pieces of colored glass, stone, or other materials. This method was widely used for decoration in the ancient world, especially in Roman and Byzantine architecture. They often served a dual purpose as art and as a storytelling tool. By cleverly combining these concepts, we can formulate the following narrative: A book that accurately depicts the various scenes inside a cathedral uses detailed mosaics as one of its main illustration methods. This showcases how the diverse scenes that unfold within a cathedral's bounds - from ceremonial proceedings to quiet moments of peace - can be portrayed effectively via the intricate and colourful medium of mosaics.  Not only does this express the indescribable beauty of the cathedral’s interior, but it also helps the reader visualise the scenes more vividly, eventually creating a unique reading experience dipped in art, culture, and history. Furthermore, the use of mosaics in the book aids in capturing the historical significance, religious symbolism, and architectural grandeur that cathedrals are quintessentially known for."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Continue until the tomatoes are soupy, yet still chunky.  If you don't mind getting your hands dirty, you could also crush the tomatoes by hand instead of using a fork. Doing so would actually make it easier to control the process. Set the tomatoes aside after crushing them. Pour the oil into a heavy, 2-qt (2-L) saucepan. Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat. Give the oil at least 30 to 60 seconds to warm up. You should be able to turn the pan and easily coat the bottom with the oil once it's warm enough. Add the minced onion to the hot oil and cook, stirring frequently, for several minutes or until the onion becomes slightly translucent. Add the minced garlic to the oil and onion. Saute, stirring frequently, for another minute or until the garlic looks golden in color. Watch the contents of the saucepan carefully at this point. Minced garlic can burn quickly if you leave it unattended. Add the prepared tomatoes, oregano, basil, sugar, salt, and pepper to the saucepan. Allow the mixture to cook at medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until it begins to boil gently. Reduce the heat to low and allow the sauce to simmer, uncovered, for at least 30 minutes. You can simmer the sauce for up to 90 minutes. A sauce that simmers for longer periods will be thicker and more flavorful. Remove the finished sauce from the heat and let it cool down to room temperature. If you want to save part of the sauce or all of the sauce for later, you can pour the cooled sauce into an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to one week. If frozen, the sauce can last for up to two months. If the sauce seems too chunky or thick, use an immersion blender to puree it until it reaches the right consistency. After you puree the sauce, it should be ready to use.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  The day after the Britain's Got Talent finals, Max Clifford, speaking for Simon Cowell, said that it was \\"quite possible\\" that Cowell would be signing some of the finalists, including Smith. Though she did not sign with Syco, Cowell's record label, she did record a duet of \\"Walking in the Air\\" with Johnston, which appeared on his debut album, One Voice, and was tipped as a potential Christmas number-one. Before the release of One Voice, it was revealed that Smith and her father were finalising the details of her record deal. In November, it was announced that Smith would be performing on stage in Kettering with Sylvia Berryman, a vocal tutor who had worked with Smith prior to her appearance on Britain's Got Talent. Smith said that she was \\"really looking forward to singing locally again\\", and it was again reported that Smith hoped to soon sign her own record deal.In December 2008 the Daily Mail reported that Smith had signed a £2.3 million, multi-album deal with Universal Music Group that was the \\"most lucrative recording contract ever handed to a schoolgirl\\". Smith said \\"I'm honoured to be joining such a fantastic record company, especially since it's where [Jenkins] started.\\" Dickon Stainer, speaking on behalf of Universal, said \\"as soon as we saw Faryl, it became an ambition to sign her.\\" Universal claimed it intended to market Smith as a pop star. Smith signed the contract at the Royal Albert Hall, following which she performed with Katherine Jenkins. Neil Fisher, writing for The Times, described Smith as \\"heir apparent\\" to Jenkins; the pair had first met when Smith won a competition at the Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod. By 2009, Jenkins was acting as a mentor to Smith.In January 2009 plans were released for Smith to perform with Plácido Domingo, an idea originally suggested by him. In an interview with the Metro, Smith talked about her future plans, insisting that she did not wish to be dubbed as the next Charlotte Church. She later said that \\"In the papers, it sounded like I was snobby...  Guess a valid title for it!

Write an article based on this summary: – President Trump is no fan of the World Trade Organization, and Axios reports that he ordered his advisers to work up a bill that would give him broad power to circumvent WTO rules and negotiate his own deals. The story by Jonathan Swan uses the words \\"insane\\" and \\"stunning\\" to describe the bill's scope, though it adds that the measure has virtually no chance of becoming reality. Trump reportedly was briefed on the working draft in May. CNN confirms the existence of the leaked proposal, called the United States Fair and Reciprocal Tariff Act. And, yes, the emergence of that name has led to a barrage of social media jokes and commentary about the FART Act, notes the Guardian. \\"WTO has its flaws, but the 'United States Fair and Reciprocal Tariff Act,' aka the U.S. FART Act, stinks,\\" writes Anthony Scaramucci. \\"American consumers pay for tariffs.\\" And this from a New York Post staffer: \\"As an editor who writes some headlines at the NY Post can I just say I'm really psyched about the FART Act,\\" writes Seth Mandel. The Axios report says most of the Trump officials who worked up the proposal think it's unrealistic, and that has led to speculation that staffers gave it the unfortunate acronym on purpose, notes Business Insider. A White House spokesperson confirmed that Trump asked his team to work up ideas to \\"remedy\\" what he sees as unfair trade laws. \\"The only way this would be news is if this were actual legislation that the administration was preparing to roll out, but it's not,\\" says Lindsay Walters. \\"Principals have not even met to review any text of legislation on reciprocal trade.\\"","output":"The Trump administration's proposed United States Fair and Reciprocal Tariff Act (FART Act) has caused a stir, not only due to its unfortunate name but for the significant power it would give the President over the World Trade Organization (WTO). The existence of the leaked proposal was confirmed by CNN, and its potential scope has been described as \\"insane\\" and \\"stunning.\\" However, the bill is unlikely to become a reality, as even its developers believe that the scope of the act is unrealistic. This has led to speculation that the awkward acronym was chosen intentionally. In May, President Trump ordered his advisors to draft a bill that would provide him with broad power to negotiate trade deals without adhering to WTO rules. The proposed legislation has been met with criticism, with various commentators making light of the acronym or expressing their disapproval of the act. Anthony Scaramucci, for example, tweeted that the FART Act \\"stinks,\\" adding that American consumers ultimately pay for tariffs. Although the WTO has its drawbacks, Trump's proposed act threatens to exacerbate existing tensions regarding international trade and tariffs. The US relies heavily on trade with foreign nations, and by circumventing established trading laws, the Trump administration risks upsetting the delicate balance of international trade relations. Equally concerning is the potential impact on domestic American economics. By utilizing tariffs as a means to negotiate deals, the Trump administration is essentially forcing American consumers to pay a higher cost for imported goods. While this strategy may be advantageous in the short term, it could ultimately diminish the purchasing power of American consumers. Irrespective of whether the FART Act's naming was intentional or not, the leaked proposal serves as a reminder of the administration's propensity for unorthodox policy considerations. However, White House spokesperson Lindsay Walters has downplayed the significance of the leak, stating that it does not represent a concrete legislative plan. \\"The only way this would be news is if this were actual legislation that the administration was preparing to roll out, but it's not,\\" said Walters. \\"Principals have not even met to review any text of legislation on reciprocal trade.\\" The Trump administration's approach to international relations has often been characterized by its unpredictability and an inclination toward protectionist policies. The FART Act, whether real or a well-orchestrated prank, reflects this propensity and highlights the difficulties associated with navigating global trade politics in a time of heightened uncertainty and tension."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Senate Democrats urge the House to repeal hated IRS rule NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Now that House Republicans have had their token show-vote on the health care law, Congress is turning its attention to one small provision that everyone agrees should be repealed. On Thursday, three Senate Democrats wrote to House Speaker John Boehner urging the House to vote to repeal the so-called 1099 provision, a hated IRS rule that imposes new paperwork burdens on businesses. The senators said they \\"are confident that the Senate can quickly act\\" on the repeal once the House has moved it along. \\"The [1099 provision] is particularly onerous for small businesses ... who cannot afford to employ extra lawyers and accountants to comply with the new rules,\\" Senators Ben Nelson, Maria Cantwell and Amy Klobuchar wrote. Beginning in 2012, all companies will have to issue a 1099 IRS form not only to contracted workers, as they now must do, but also to individuals or corporations from which they buy more than 600 in goods or services in a year. The 1099 form is used to document income for individual workers other than wages and salaries: Freelancers get them and businesses send them out. Under the health care law, the 1099 form would be used to track payments for services and tangible goods. Also, it requires that 1099s be issued not just to individuals, but to corporations as well. The new mandate has drawn sharp criticism from the business community, politicians and even President Obama. In November, President Obama pledged that he would support a repeal of the provision. Republican Rep. Dan Lungren of California introduced a bill, called the \\"Small Business Paperwork Mandate Elimination Act of 2011,\\" to repeal the provision on the House. \\"The engine of our economy is small business -- and we cannot afford to do anything that would stall our economic recovery,\\" said Lungren in a written statement. \\"We should be supporting policies that contribute to job growth, not imposing yet another new government mandate on the backs of small business owners.\\" Last fall, Congress was unable to muster enough votes to repeal the provision -- once in September and again in November. The goal of the provision was to raise revenue to pay for health care reform. The government misses out on an estimated 300 billion each year from tax underpayment. The repeal would cost 19.2 billion between 2011 and 2020, according to an estimate from the Joint Committee on Taxation. To write a note to the editor about this article, What was this article about?","output":"This article is about Senate Democrats asking the House of Representatives to remove a disliked IRS rule called the \\"1099 provision.\\" This rule adds more paperwork for businesses and makes it harder for small businesses, who don't have extra lawyers and accountants to help them. The rule asks companies to provide a form called \\"1099\\" for more reasons than before, which some people think is too much work and not helpful. The purpose of the rule was to help pay for health care changes, but some people don't like it and want it removed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The thieves put it inside a remote control car to sneak it past security at San Francisco International Airport. However, a luggage mix-up occurs, causing a woman named Mrs. Hess to inadvertently take the thieves' bag containing the remote control car while returning home to Chicago. The four thieves arrive in Chicago and systematically search every house in Hess's suburban neighborhood to find the chip. Meanwhile, Alex Pruitt is given the remote control car by Hess for shoveling snow, but she lectures him for scratching numerous itches. He returns home and removes his shirt to discover that he has chickenpox, and therefore must stay out of school. While recovering at home, Alex uses his telescope and discovers the thieves on look out for the chip. Wondering what the thieves want with a remote control car, Alex opens it and discovers the stolen chip. He informs the local Air Force Recruitment Center about the chip while asking if they can forward the information about the chip to someone. The thieves conclude that Alex has been watching them and decide to pursue him. As a snowstorm hits Chicago, the thieves block off the road to the house, and Alice duct tapes Hess to a chair in her garage and leaves the door open. By this point, Alex has armed his house with booby traps and prepares to set them off with his pet rat, Doris, and the loud-mouthed pet parrot of his brother, Stan. After several break-in attempts, the thieves manage to make it into the house, despite falling into Alex's traps. They begin to search the house to find Alex.
