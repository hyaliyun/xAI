Emergency workers hauling large concrete slabs from a collapsed... (Associated Press)      As authorities buried the bodies of 18 unidentified workers killed in the collapse, Pope Francis and European Union officials criticized working conditions in the nation's 20 billion a year garment industry, which supplies many European and American retailers.      Francis said he was shocked by a headline from the building collapse that said some of the workers were living on 38 euros a month.      \`'This was the payment of these people who have died ... And this is called \`slave labor,'\\" he said. Vatican Radio said the pope made the remarks during a private Mass Wednesday morning at the Vatican.      EU officials said they are considering action including changes to Bangladesh's duty-free and quota-free access to the giant EU market to \\"incentivize\\" responsible management of the nation's garment industry. Catherine Ashton, the EU's foreign affairs chief, and its trade commissioner, Karel De Gucht, called in a statement for Bangladesh authorities to act immediately to ensure factories comply with international labor standards.      Pressure built inside Bangladesh as well, as a raucous procession of workers on foot, pickup trucks and motorcycles wound its way through central Dhaka on Wednesday. They waved the national flag and banners, beat drums and chanted \\"direct action!\\" and \\"death penalty!\\"      From a loudspeaker on the back of a truck, a participant spoke for the group: \\"My brother has died. My sister has died. Their blood will not be valueless.\\"      May Day protests, customarily an opportunity for workers in this impoverished South Asian nation to vent their grievances, have taken on a poignant significance this year following the April 24 disaster.      Five garment factories were housed in the illegally constructed, eight-story Rana Plaza that collapsed in this Dhaka suburb. Five months after a fire killed 112 people at another clothing factory, the collapse again exposed safety problems in Bangladesh's garment industry.      The death toll from the collapse passed 400 Wednesday, with 399 bodies pulled from the rubble and three of the injured dying in the hospital, police said.      Several hundred people attended a mass funeral in a Dhaka suburb for 18 unidentified workers who died in the building collapse. The bodies, rotting in the spring heat, were brought to the graveyard on the back of a flatbed truck. One woman wailed that one of the bodies was her sister's and begged to take it.      More than 80 additional graves have been prepared, with authorities expected scores of more bodies to remain unclaimed.      The owner of the building, Mohammed Sohel Rana, is being questioned by police while under arrest. He is expected to be charged with negligence, illegal construction and forcing workers to join work, which is punishable by a maximum of seven years in jail. Authorities have not said if more serious crimes will be added.      Workers protesting Wednesday demanded capital punishment for the 38-year-old Rana, a small-time political operative with the ruling Awami League party.      \\"I want the death penalty for the owner of the building. We want regular salaries, raises and absolutely we want better safety in our factories,\\" said Mongidul Islam Rana, 18, who works in a garment factory that was not located in Rana Plaza.      The Bangladesh High Court has ordered the government to confiscate Rana's property and to freeze the assets of the owners of the factories in Rana Plaza so the money can be used to pay the salaries of their workers.      Rana had permission to build five stories but added three more floors illegally. When huge cracks appeared in the building a day before its collapse, police ordered an evacuation, but Rana told tenants that it was safe and they should go back in. The next day, a bank and some shops refused to occupy the premises but factory managers told their workers to go back in. A couple of hours later the building came down in a heap of concrete and bricks.      Some 2,500 people escaped with injuries. Rescue workers expect the death toll to rise, because they believe many bodies are still buried on the ground level.      There is confusion over how many people remain missing.      Zillur Rahman Chowdhury, a Dhaka district administrator, said so far 149 people have been listed missing. A police official, Aminur Rahman, said police have recorded up to 1,300 names as missing, but he cautioned that many may be duplicates. \\"We will now have to screen the names by computer to find the actual number,\\" he said.      Rescuers estimate that the building turned into 600 tons of rubble, of which 350 tons has been removed.      Anxious relatives were still looking for their loved ones missing. Kulsum, who uses one name, was looking for her husband, holding his photograph among several hundred people at a nearby school ground.      \\"My husband was inside the building on the fifth floor,\\" said Kulsum. \\"I haven't found him. Neither alive nor dead.\\"      The garment-factory fire in November brought widespread pledges to improve worker-safety standards in Bangladesh. But since then, very little has changed.      \\"I think it is a wakeup call for the nation, a wakeup call for the industry and for the trade unions,\\" said Shirin Akter, founding president of Karmojibi Nari, a Dhaka-based Bangladeshi group that lobbies for the rights of women in the workplace.      Bangladesh's garment industry was the third-largest in the world in 2011, after China and Italy.      Among the garment makers in the building were Phantom Apparels, Phantom Tac, Ether Tex, New Wave Style and New Wave Bottoms. Altogether, they produced several million shirts, pants and other garments a year.      The New Wave companies, according to their website, make clothing for several major North American and European retailers. Britain's Primark has acknowledged it was using a factory in Rana Plaza. It said in a statement Monday that it is providing emergency aid and will pay compensation to victims who worked for its supplier.      \\"Primark notes the fact that its supplier shared the building with those of other retailers. We are fully aware of our responsibility. We urge these other retailers to come forward and offer assistance,\\" it said.      Canadian company Loblaw Inc., which also got its Joe Fresh clothing line made in Rana Plaza, said Monday it will ensure that victims and their families \\"receive benefits now and in the future.\\"      Spokeswoman Julija Hunter said the company is still working out the details, but plans to deliver support \\"in the best and most meaningful way possible.\\"      Wal-Mart said none of its clothing had been authorized to be made in the Rana Plaza facility, but it is investigating whether there was any unauthorized production.      ___      Associated Press writers Julhas Alam in Dhaka and Cassandra Vinograd in London contributed to this report. ||||| Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story      SAVAR, Bangladesh — Barely 20 miles from the national capital, this gritty suburb is now a dusty, chaotic industrial center littered with factories that produce clothes for leading Western brands. Building codes are often unenforced, regulatory oversight is flimsy and the men wielding power often travel with armed guards.                              And perhaps no one wielded power more brazenly than Sohel Rana. He traveled by motorcycle, as untouchable as a mafia don, trailed by his own biker gang. Local officials and the Bangladeshi news media say he was involved in illegal drugs and guns, but he also had a building, Rana Plaza, that housed five factories.      Upstairs, workers earned as little as 40 a month making clothes for retailers like J. C. Penney. Downstairs, Mr. Rana hosted local politicians, playing pool, drinking and, the officials say, indulging in drugs.      Now Mr. Rana, 35, is under arrest, the most reviled man in Bangladesh after the horrific collapse of Rana Plaza last week left nearly 400 people dead, with many others still missing. On Tuesday, a top Bangladeshi court seized his assets, as the public bayed for his execution, especially as it appears that the tragedy could have been averted if the frantic warnings of an engineer who examined the building the day before had been heeded.      Photo      But if Mr. Rana has been vilified, he is partly a creation of the garment era in Bangladesh, during which global businesses have arrived in search of cheap labor to keep profits high and costs low. Directly or indirectly, international brands are now sometimes interlinked with men like Mr. Rana, and placed at risk by them.      Global apparel companies often depict their international supply chains as tightly scrutinized systems to ensure that clothing sold to American buyers is produced in safe, monitored factories. Yet their inspectors usually check safety factors and working conditions, but not the soundness of the buildings themselves, and the companies often have little control over the subcontractors who do much of the work.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Criminality and politics have long intersected in Bangladesh, especially at the local level. But the garment industry has introduced what had mostly been the missing element: money. Savar land values soared as new factories hurriedly opened to meet the new Western demand.      To build Rana Plaza, Mr. Rana and his father bullied adjacent landowners, the landowners themselves say, and ultimately took their property by force. His political allies gave him a construction permit, despite his dubious claims of title to the land, and a second permit later to add upper floors that may have destabilized the building.      Mr. Rana existed largely above scrutiny. Many local people say his political clout was such that not even the police dared to confront him. Television stations reported the cracks in the building the night before it collapsed, but no local authority prevented Mr. Rana from opening the building the next morning.      “Money is his power,” said Ashraf Uddin Khan, a former mayor of Savar, who accused Mr. Rana of being deeply involved in the drug trade. “Illegal money.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Before Rana Plaza collapsed, Bangladesh was already in turmoil, as opposition political parties were staging nationwide strikes, known as hartals, that paralyzed the country and placed huge pressure on factory owners to meet deadlines. Weeks earlier, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association warned that the hartals had cost Bangladesh as much as 500 million in business.      Hartals were part of Mr. Rana’s résumé. He held what appeared to be an innocuous position as secretary of the local student wing for the Awami League, the country’s majority political party. But that position translated into influence and helped him mobilize people. He developed a following that local people say he used as political muscle, sometimes to enforce strikes, sometimes to defy them.      “He had a criminal gang,” said Mohammed Khorshed Alam, an elected councilman in Savar and a member of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party. He said Mr. Rana and his men carried weapons and were part of a network involved in the local drug trade.      Politics are rough in Savar. Mr. Alam walks through the city with an entourage of eight men, including a bodyguard with a sawed-off shotgun. Local officials say drug sales are widespread, though the city’s police chief says he has stamped out the problem. One of the busiest drug dens, he said, used to exist behind Rana Plaza.      Land helped create Mr. Rana’s power. His father had been a poor peasant who sold his plot in a village and bought a small parcel in Savar. As prices began to rise, the father sold a portion of that land and used his profits to start a small factory making mustard oil. He also became involved in politics with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, then in power, and slowly grew richer.      By 2000, land prices were rising, and Mr. Rana was helping his father. They could see other hurriedly constructed buildings rising in Savar, and they decided to build Rana Plaza — except they did not have clear title to all the land.      Rabindranath Sarkar, who had bought land in partnership with Mr. Rana’s father, said the family sent thugs to seize part of his share of the land and then retaliated when he filed a complaint with the local police.      “Rana chased me through Savar with weapons,” he said. “The police wouldn’t even dare to protect me. The police were always scared of them.”      Another adjacent family said Mr. Rana sent representatives to try to persuade them to sell a plot, including a small pond, beside Mr. Rana’s land. By 2005, a year before construction started on Rana Plaza, the family said Mr. Rana simply falsified a land deed to take possession of the pond.      Bangladesh initially sought to attract foreign investment by creating special Export Processing Zones, which had higher quality buildings and tighter regulations. But as demand from foreign buyers rose, factories began sprouting across the country, including quickly built structures to accommodate the small operators who did subcontract work on tight margins.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      By 2011, Mr. Rana had rented out the existing five floors and gotten a permit from the local mayor, a political ally, to build additional floors. Mr. Khan, the former mayor, said this practice created serious risks, since officials were handing out permits, often for bribes, without insisting on the necessary safeguards.      “For the garment industry, Savar grew quickly, and in an unplanned manner,” he said. “There are so many buildings like Rana Plaza in Savar.”      Mr. Rana found factory owners to rent his new upper floors and appeared to be gaining in influence. Then on April 23, a problem arose. Workers on the third floor were stitching clothing when they were startled by a noise that sounded like an explosion. Cracks had appeared in the building. Workers rushed outside in terror.      By late morning, Mr. Rana’s representatives had brought in Abdur Razzaque Khan, an engineer. Taken to the third floor, Mr. Khan examined three support pillars, and became horrified at the cracks he found.      “I became scared,” Mr. Khan said. “It was not safe to stay inside this building.”      He rushed downstairs and told one of Mr. Rana’s administrators that the building needed to be closed immediately. But Mr. Rana was apparently not impressed; he was holding court with about a dozen local journalists.      “This is not a crack,” he said, according to Shamim Hossain, a local newspaper reporter. “The plaster on the wall is broken, nothing more. It is not a problem.”      But it was. The next morning, Rana Plaza collapsed. Mr. Rana managed to escape from his basement office, but was eventually discovered hiding near the Indian border. He was flown by helicopter to Dhaka and thrust before the news media, looking dazed and disheveled.      Neither Mr. Rana nor a representative was available for comment. He has previously said it was the factory owners who insisted on opening for business the day of the collapse, and several of the owners have been arrested, as was Mr. Rana’s father.      Even now, many people in Savar remained unconvinced that Mr. Rana will be punished, or that his style of business will be cleaned up. “Rana is not the only one,” said Mr. Sarkar, the man whose land was taken. “Now, we have so many Ranas.” ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| Story highlights Mourners attend a funeral for 32 unidentified victims      Officials say 412 people have been confirmed dead, 2,443 recovered alive      A military official says about 149 people are still missing      Pope Francis condemns worker exploitation and \\"slave labor\\" in a Mass      A week after a building containing thousands of Bangladeshi garment workers came crashing down around them, the death toll from the South Asian nation's deadliest industrial disaster rose above 400.      Workers using heavy machinery are gradually picking apart the huge, splintered slabs of concrete at the scene of the collapse in Savar, a suburb of the capital, Dhaka. They continue to find and remove bodies, many of them decomposed and difficult to recognize.      Meanwhile, throngs of mourners attended a funeral for 32 unidentified victims whose bodies were unclaimed.      And Pope Francis, speaking at a Mass on Wednesday, referred to the building collapse in a sharp condemnation of worker exploitation and \\"slave labor.\\"      \\"Not paying a just (wage), not providing work, focusing exclusively on the balance books, on financial statements, only looking at making personal profit. That goes against God!\\" he said, quoted on the Vatican Radio website.      The collapse of the building has caused widespread anger among Bangladesh's millions of garment workers about the risky conditions in which many of them must work.      13 photos: Photos: Bangladeshis protest building collapse 13 photos: Photos: Bangladeshis protest building collapse Bangladeshis protest building collapse – Marching Bangladeshis hold up portraits of relatives missing in the Rana Plaza building collapse on Tuesday, May 14.

MUST WATCH Did Western brands fail factory workers? 03:30      Frequent protests, some of them involving violent clashes with police, have taken place in Dhaka and nearby manufacturing districts since the disaster.      On Wednesday, when workers around the world were holding May Day rallies, thousands of Bangladeshis took to the streets once again, although no clashes were initially reported.      As trucks carrying rubble leave the scene of the catastrophe, people search desperately for missing relatives crowd around them, wanting to make sure they're not mistakenly taking away the bodies of their loved ones, said Maj. Gen. Hassan Sarwardy, the military official leading the recovery efforts.      There was confusion earlier about exactly how many people were still unaccounted for in the collapse, Sarwardy said at a news briefing Wednesday. Authorities were waiting for the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association to provide a list of all the people who were inside the five garment factories in the building when it caved in, he said.      When that information was obtained, Sarwardy said it appeared about 149 people were still missing.      \\"It is very unlikely that someone is still alive under the rubble on the seventh day of the building collapse ... but the almighty Allah knows better,\\" the military official said.      Authorities say the number of people confirmed dead so far is 412, while 2,443 people have been recovered alive, according to the official Bangladesh State News Agency.      And so, the search for the human remains still entombed within the ruins goes on amid the stench of death that pervades the site.      Those involved in the search are using face masks and cans of air freshener to try to block out the smell, and electronic sensors and sniffer dogs to try to find the bodies.      Col. Shayekh Jaman, one of the officials involved in the operation, said Wednesday that he believed the grueling, painstaking efforts could continue for about 10 more days.      \\"It is a delicate and time-consuming operation, but we are doing everything we can,\\" he said.      Lost relatives      Meanwhile, hundreds of people such as Sheikh Nasir Uddin are left in limbo.      At the school playground in Savar where bodies recovered from the wreckage are initially brought for identification, Uddin said he had being looking for his nephew, Abul Kalam Azad, for the past week.      He said visits to all the hospitals in Savar and Dhaka where the injured and the dead were taken had proved fruitless.      \\"Nobody can tell me about my nephew, who was working at an apparel factory in the building,\\" he said.      Much of the rage voiced in protests has been directed at Sohel Rana, the owner of the building, who was arrested near the Indian border over the weekend. Protesters have called for him to be hanged.      Rana and the owners of the factories in his building have been accused of ordering workers to enter the premises on the day of the collapse, despite the discovery of large cracks the day before.      The Bangladeshi government is also coming under criticism for lax enforcement of safety regulations in factories and claims by Britain and the United Nations that it refused offers of help with rescue efforts.      Home Minister Mahiuddin Khan Alamgir said Tuesday that the rejection was because Bangladesh had only wanted equipment to be sent, not the additional search and rescue experts offered by the outside agencies.      EU considers trade action      In a sign of the growing international pressure on Dhaka to improve labor conditions, the European Union said Tuesday that it was considering trade action against Bangladesh. The statement carries weight, since the EU is Bangladesh's largest trade partner.      The Bangladeshi government said this week that it would begin inspecting the safety and security of all garment factories in the country.      Major Western retailers and clothing brands, some of which sourced products from the factories in the collapsed building, are also facing difficult questions about how closely they scrutinize working conditions at their suppliers.      \\"We understand that businesses operating in this building appear to have links to numerous companies in the U.S. and Europe and so we'll continue to engage with U.S. companies to discuss what role they can play in improving working conditions, including in Bangladesh,\\" U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said Wednesday.      The catastrophic building collapse happened about five months after a fire at Tazreen Fashions Factory, a garment maker in another suburb of Dhaka, killed at least 112 people. |||||","output":"On May 1st, thousands of workers paraded in Dhaka to demand safer working conditions and the death penalty for the owner of a building housing garment factories that collapsed, killing at least 402 people and injuring 2,500.

Mounting fossil evidence of feathers and protofeathers on several T. rex cousins has intensified the debate. But without direct proof that T. rex had feathers, some scientists decided to hunt for clues in the next-best place: fossilized skin. They examined the world’s only known fossils of T. rex skin—from the neck, pelvis, and tail of a long-dead dino named Wyrex, stored since 2006 at the Houston Museum of Natural Science in Texas (above). They found no sign of feathers; just smooth, scaly skin. They also analyzed skin impressions from large tyrannosaurs that lived around the same time, such as Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus. Like Wyrex, those dinosaurs were covered in scales, they report today in Biology Letters . So if these large tyrannosaurs had any feathers at all, says the team, their fluff would have been limited to their backs—the only body part for which they were lacking fossil impressions.Because their earlier cousins did have feathers, it’s likely that the large tyrannosaurs lost them somewhere along the way, the team suggests.

Answer the following question: Former President Barack Obama unveiled plans for his future presidential library and museum on the south side of Chicago where he raised his family and launched his political career. The designs show a complex of modern buildings, with a library, museum and event center, plus a community garden, a children's play area and possibly an athletic field. \\"What we want this to be is the world-premiere institution for training young people and leadership to make a difference in their communities, in their countries and in the world,\\" he told the crowd that included Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, his one-time chief of staff. Flanked by drawings and renderings, Obama also announced that he and former first lady Michelle Obama will be donating 2 million to fund a Chicago summer jobs program. The museum, the tallest of the three buildings, will hold exhibition space, public spaces, offices and education and meeting rooms, according to the Obama Foundation. The forum and library buildings are intended to be used for study and foundation programming. Obama said his foundation, which is overseeing the project, is also looking into the possibility of locating a Chicago Public Library branch on the site. Obama said he envisioned recording studios where musicians could help young people work on music, and space for movie directors who could take on community storytelling. The center will also have exhibits with campaign memorabilia and personal artifacts. \\"Let's face it, we want to see Michelle's dresses,\\" the former president joked. Obama also squashed any notion that the library was ever going to be elsewhere. Multiple locations in three states — Illinois, New York and Hawaii — had initially pitched proposals. \\"The best things that have happened to me in my life happened in this community,\\" he said. \\"Although we had a formal bidding process to determine where the presidential library was going to be, the fact of the matter was it had to be right here on the south side of Chicago.\\" According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Understand the context of the premise: The premise implies that the Pentagon prefers to work with a definitive number rather than an estimation. 2. Identify the subject matter: The subject matter in this case is a preference for a definite number over an estimation. 3. Compare the premise and the hypothesis: The hypothesis suggests that having a definite number is superior in general, whereas the premise focuses on the preference of a specific organization, the Pentagon.  4. Evaluate the hypothesis with respect to the premise: Since the premise primarily deals with the Pentagon's preference, it can't be concluded that the hypothesis is universally true, as it could be organization-specific or situation-specific. In conclusion, while the premise demonstrates that the Pentagon prefers a definitive number over an estimation, it is not sufficient to confirm that the hypothesis— \\"Having a definite number is preferable to an estimation\\"—is universally true.

In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084–1105) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century.

Question: \\"How did the political leader of the coutnry affect religion?\\"  Context: \\"Towards the end of the Republic, religious and political offices became more closely intertwined; the office of pontifex maximus became a de facto consular prerogative. Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political, military and priestly powers; at first temporarily, then for his lifetime. He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome's major priesthoods, including that of pontifex maximus; as he invented none, he could claim them as traditional honours. His reforms were represented as adaptive, restorative and regulatory, rather than innovative; most notably his elevation (and membership) of the ancient Arvales, his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality. Augustus obtained the pax deorum, maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation. This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The political leader of the country, in this context referring to Augustus, had a significant impact on religion in ancient Rome. As the first emperor of the Roman Empire, Augustus was able to establish a tight control over religious practices, merging political and religious powers in a way that would shape the Empire's future. To understand the impact, it is essential to look at the various ways Augustus influenced and controlled religious practices. 1. Office of Pontifex Maximus: Augustus assumed the title of \\"Pontifex Maximus,\\" which was the highest religious authority in Rome. By merging this religious role with his political power, Augustus was able to consolidate authority, control the interpretation of religious rituals, and reinforce his political agenda. 2. Extraordinary Powers: Augustus was vested with an unprecedented number of Rome's major priesthoods, which allowed him to control and manipulate religious practices to suit his political agenda. This control enabled him to change the way the religious institutions were governed and functioned. 3. Adaptive Reforms: Augustus portrayed his religious reforms as adaptive, restorative, and regulatory rather than innovative, which helped to create an image of tradition-based continuity. Through his promotion of ancient religious orders, such as the Arvales and the Compitalia, and his patronage of the Vestals, Augustus strengthened the link between Roman religion and the state. 4. Pax Deorum: Augustus obtained the Pax Deorum, or \\"Peace of the Gods,\\" which was an understanding between the Roman government and the deities to maintain a stable and peaceful relationship. By maintaining the Pax Deorum throughout his reign, Augustus ensured the continuation of religious stability and demonstrated that he was god-favored, which further legitimized his rule. 5. The Succession System: Augustus laid the groundwork for a succession system where the emperors would adopt their successors, ensuring a smooth transfer of both political and religious powers from one emperor to the next. This continuity was essential to preserving the status quo and maintaining the Pax Deorum, remaining a crucial factor in the Roman Empire's continued success. In summary, the political leader of the country, Augustus, had a profound impact on religion in ancient Rome. By consolidating political and religious powers, Augustus was able to steer religious practices to benefit his rule and maintain stability in the Empire. His reforms set a precedence for future emperors, ensuring a steady relationship between the Roman Empire's political and religious realms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan Movie plot: Borat Sagdiyev is a TV reporter of a popular show in Kazakhstan. The movie opens when Borat is in his hometown of Kusak in Kazakhstan. He is introducing the entire town to the documentary movie he is going to be filming. There's people like the town mechanic / abortionist, the town rapist, his annoying neighbor, his wife Oxana, and so on and so forth. Borat also talks about his home and his hobbies. Hobbies include ping pong, which he plays rather poorly, and traveling to capital city where he watches women as they do their business. Borat takes you through his home where you meet his wife Oxana and his sons Huey and Lewis, and introduces us to his annoying neighbor Yusuf. Borat and Yusuf have been engaged in a game of coveted goods, where everything Borat gets, Yusuf attempts to get as well, but since Yusuf doesn't have the money that Borat has, everything Yusuf buys is of significantly less quality.Borat is hailed as a hero in his town as he is contracted by the government of Kazakhstan to travel to America to make a documentary which will bring together, hopefully, the cultures of America and Kazakhstan. Borat is to travel to America with his most venerable producer Azamat Bagatov, who will handle all the behind the scenes work of this documentary. After a rather lengthy flight with multiple stops and connections, Borat finally arrives in New York City. On the subway to his hotel, his pet chicken escapes his bag and wrecks havoc on the subway. Borat's attempts to introduce himself to the native New Yorkers is also a complete failure.At the hotel, Borat attempts to bargain with the hotel owners about his negotiated room rate, only to be met with another failure as the hotel has a set rate in which it can rent rooms out. He has apparently never been in an elevator which he thinks is his actual hotel room. The next series of footage shows Borat attempting to integrate his life into New York City.

His leadership has often been a subject of criticism for allegations of widespread corruption and suppression of political dissent.

Have you been doing Internet shopping rather than going to the stores? What can't you be bothered to do? A study into how lazy British people are has found more than half of the adults are so idle   that they'd catch the lift rather than climb two flights of stairs. Just over 2,000 people were quizzed by independent researchers at Nuffield Health, Britain's largest health center. The results were extremely surprising. About one in six people questioned said if their remote control was broken, they would continue watching the same channel rather than get up. More than one third of those questioned said they would not run to catch a bus. Worryingly, of the 654 respondents with children, 64% said they were often too tired to play with them. This led the report to conclude that it's no wonder that one in six children in the UK are classified as obese (very fat) before they start school. Dr Sarah Dauncey, medical director of Nuffield Health, said, \\"People need to get fitter, not just for their own sake, but for the sake of their families, friends and evidently (;) their pets too.\\" \\"If we don't start to take control of this problem, a whole generation will become too unfit to perform even the most fundamental tasks.\\" And Scotland's largest city, Glasgow, was shamed as the most idle city in the UK, with 75% questioned admitting they do not get enough exercise, followed closely by Birmingham and Southampton, both with 67%. The results bring serious challenges for the National Health Service, where obesity-related illnesses such as heart disease and cancer have been on a steady increase for the past 40 years and are costing billions of pounds every year.

She then proceeds to share some insightful tips on how to make the process as smooth and stress-free as possible for both the cat and its owner. First, she emphasizes the importance of introducing the cat to the claw trimmer early on, allowing them to familiarize themselves with the tool in a relaxed and controlled setting. She suggests offering treats and praise, creating a positive association between the cat and the trimmer.  Next, she discusses the best techniques to hold the cat throughout the process, explaining that keeping a gentle yet firm grip is crucial in maintaining control and ensuring the cat's safety. An ideal position is to have the cat comfortably resting on your lap or on a stable surface with its paws accessible for easy trimming.  Moreover, she highlights the significance of trimming the nails at the appropriate angle, usually around 45 degrees, to avoid cutting into the quick – the pink, sensitive part of the cat's nail that contains blood vessels and nerves. Cutting the quick could result in bleeding and discomfort for the cat, which may make future claw trimming sessions more challenging. In addition, she advises that the trimming session should be kept brief and not rushed. This helps keep the cat calm and prevents them from becoming overwhelmed or agitated. If the cat starts to struggle, it is better to take a break and resume the session at a later time. Lastly, she stresses the importance of providing positive reinforcement, such as petting, praise, and treats once the process is complete. This helps elevate the cat's experience from an unpleasant chore to a manageable and potentially enjoyable task. In conclusion, taking the time to properly trim a cat's nails not only ensures the cat's wellbeing but also fosters a strong bond between the pet and its owner. By implementing these tips and maintaining a consistent grooming schedule, cat owners can ensure that both their feline friends and their household remain safe and happy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This year's slate of honorees are similarly eclectic, though with a distinctly musical bent. Singer-songwriter Neil Diamond has sold more than 125 million records and scored 39 top-10 singles -- including \\"Cracklin' Rosie,\\" \\"Sweet Caroline\\" and \\"America\\" -- according to a biography posted on the Kennedy Center's website. Legendary saxophonist and composer Sonny Rollins has long stood out on the jazz scene even while playing alongside luminaries such as Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie.

In Iceland, the actions of its people lead to a loss of animal and plant species. Denmark tried to keep the environment untouched as they understood its importance and the climate was unaffected.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which country had a more dramatic influence on the food web?  Hint: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat.  The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible.  Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1] The answer to this question is:","output":"Iceland had a more dramatic influence on the food web, as the actions of its people led to a loss of animal and plant species, which adversely affected the food chain and overall biodiversity."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Like the NFL, the NHL sometimes schedules exhibition games for cities without their own NHL teams, often at a club's minor league affiliate (e.g. Carolina Hurricanes games at Time Warner Cable Arena in Charlotte, home of their AHL affiliate; Los Angeles Kings games at Citizens Business Bank Arena in Ontario, California, home of their ECHL affiliate; Montreal Canadiens games at Colisée Pepsi in Quebec City, which has no pro hockey but used to have an NHL team until 1995; Washington Capitals at 1st Mariner Arena in the Baltimore Hockey Classic; various Western Canada teams at Credit Union Centre in Saskatoon, a potential NHL expansion venue). Since the 2000s, some preseason games have been played in Europe against European teams, as part of the NHL Challenge and NHL Premiere series.

OPTIONS: + be complacent; + sign the contract; + get a pen to sign the contract; Q: I heard that Quinn read the terms of the contract and finally agreed to it with a signature.  And I was wondering Why did Quinn do this? A:","output":"Quinn's action of reading the contract thoroughly, agreeing to the terms and then signing it can be attributed to a multitude of potential reasons. Firstly, it is essential to understand that signing a contract is a responsible and serious action. A contract signifies a legal agreement between two or more parties, each of whom are agreeing to undertake certain obligations or duties as stated in the contract. Failure to fulfill these obligations can often lead to legal repercussions. Therefore, before signing a contract, one must ensure that they fully understand and agree to all the terms mentioned in it. One potential reason for Quinn's action could be the fact that the contract offered benefits that aligned with Quinn's needs or interests. The contract could have been related to a job offer, a business deal, a lease agreement or any other arrangement, and Quinn presumably believed that signing it would be advantageous or necessary for them. They must have seen potential in the contract that could benefit them or help them achieve their goals effectively.  Another reason could be that Quinn may have engaged in negotiations before agreeing to the contract. Sometimes, the initial terms of a contract may not be entirely favorable to one party. In such situations, this party can engage in discussions or negotiations with the other party or parties involved in the contract to alter the terms to a certain degree. If these negotiations resulted in an agreement that was satisfactory to Quinn, this could explain why they agreed to sign the contract. Also, the thorough reading of the contract signifies a cautious approach from Quinn. They wanted to make sure they understood every element of what they were entering into. This could imply a couple of things: one, Quinn understands the potential consequences of entering a contract blindly; and two, they have a respect for the process and wish to ensure transparency and fairness. Reading it in detail allows Quinn to clarify any ambiguity, understand obligations, measure feasibility, and assess risk factors. Finally, Quinn not opting for complacency reflects their seriousness and understanding of the implications of signing a contract. Complacency in such scenarios can lead to overlooking certain aspects which may not be in one's favor and can lead to detrimental effects later on. Hence, by not choosing to be complacent, Quinn exhibits conscientiousness and prudence. In conclusion, Quinn's actions represent a well thought out decision process. They indicate a proper understanding and seriousness towards legal obligations, a desire for personal or professional growth, the skill to negotiate, a careful approach towards assessing potential risks, and a non-complacent attitude."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth - The air travels into the windpipe - The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes - The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body - Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body - The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide is exhaled.  Question: suppose the person does not have a lung disease happens, how will it affect the lungs will oxygenate more blood.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"A: more If a person does not have a lung disease, it typically means that their lungs are functioning normally and efficiently. In this situation, the lungs will be more effective in oxygenating and providing a consistent supply of oxygen to the blood as compared to someone with lung disease. Lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, can impair lung function and negatively affect the oxygenation process. In a healthy individual, the process of respiration occurs smoothly, following the steps you provided. Air is taken into the body through the nose or mouth, filtered, warmed, and humidified as it travels down the windpipe and into the bronchial tubes. These tubes branch out further into smaller airways called bronchioles, ultimately leading to the tiny air sacs or alveoli, which are responsible for gas exchange. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the blood vessels surrounding these tiny sacs, and carbon dioxide, a waste product from cellular metabolism, diffuses from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled. When the lungs are functioning optimally without any disease, they are capable of providing the body with a sufficient amount of oxygen to meet the energy requirements of all vital organs and tissues. This results in more efficient blood oxygenation and overall better functioning of the circulatory and respiratory systems. Conversely, if a person has a lung disease, such as COPD, their lung function is compromised, making it harder for them to efficiently oxygenate the blood. This can lead to shortness of breath, fatigue, and other signs of oxygen deprivation. Lung diseases create obstacles in the airways (such as inflammation, mucus production, or airway constriction) that hinder the passage of air, making it increasingly difficult for the person to breathe and take in sufficient amounts of oxygen. Therefore, option A (more) would be the accurate choice. A person without any lung disease would have healthier, more efficient lungs compared to someone with a lung disease, allowing them to oxygenate more blood and maintain optimal energy levels throughout the body."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue.  - Golden Globe Awards are accolades bestowed by the 93 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, recognizing excellence in film and television, both domestic and foreign.  - Who's the Boss? is an American sitcom created by Martin Cohan and Blake Hunter, which aired on ABC from September 20, 1984 to April 25, 1992.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Mordred or Modred (Medrod, etc.) is a character in the Arthurian legend, known as a notorious traitor who fought King Arthur at the Battle of Camlann, where he was killed and Arthur fatally wounded. Tradition varies on his relationship to Arthur, but he is best known today as Arthur's illegitimate son by his half-sister Morgause, though in many modern adaptations Morgause is merged with the character of Morgan le Fay. In earlier literature, he was considered the legitimate son of Morgause, also known as Anna, with her husband King Lot of Orkney. His brothers or half-brothers are Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and Gareth. The name (from either Old Welsh Medraut, Cornish Modred, or Old Breton Modrot) is ultimately derived from Latin \\"Modertus\\".  - Sir Gareth (Old French: Guerrehet) was a Knight of the Round Table in Arthurian legend. He is nicknamed \\"Beaumains\\" in Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\". He was the youngest son of Lot and of Morgause, King Arthur's half-sister, thus making him Arthur's nephew, as well as brother to Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and half-brother to Mordred.  - Lot or Loth is the king of Lothian in the Arthurian legend. He is best known as the father of Sir Gawain. Such a ruler first appeared late in the 1st millennium's hagiographical material concerning Saint Kentigern (also known as Saint Mungo), which feature a \\"Leudonus\\", king of \\"Leudonia\\", a Latin name for Lothian. In the 12th century, Geoffrey of Monmouth adapted this to Lot, king of Lothian, in his influential chronicle \\"Historia Regum Britanniae\\", portraying him as King Arthur's brother-in-law and ally. In the wake of Geoffrey's writings, Lot appeared regularly in later romance.  - The Eagle is the final novel in the A Dream of Eagles series ( published in the United States as the Camulod Chronicles ) . The Eagle follows the continuing story of Clothar ( Lancelot ) from when he meets Arthur Pendragon , to , and possibly after , King Arthur 's death . It also is noted for having a sympathetic portrait of Mordred . The novel was released on November 19 , 2005 in Canada and was released in the United States in 2007 .  - Jack Whyte (born 1940) is a Scottish-Canadian novelist of historical fiction. Born and raised in Scotland, Whyte has been living in Canada since 1967. He resides in Kelowna, British Columbia.  - A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly united state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC.  - A Dream of Eagles is a historical novel series written by the Canadian author Jack Whyte. It was published in the United States as the Camulod Chronicles.  - Sir Lancelot du Lac (meaning Lancelot of the lake, baptised as Galahad) was one of the Knights of the Round Table in the Arthurian legend. He typically features as King Arthur's greatest companion, the lord of Joyous Gard and the greatest swordsman and jouster of the age  until his adultery with Queen Guinevere is discovered, causing a civil war exploited by Mordred which brings about the end of Arthur's kingdom.  - Morgause is a character in later Arthurian traditions, appearing in Thomas Malory's 15th-century text \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" as the mother of Gawain and Mordred, both key players in the story of King Arthur and his downfall. Mordred is the offspring of Arthur's inadvertent incest with Morgause, the king's estranged half-sister. She is also a sister of Morgan le Fay and the wife of King Lot of Orkney, as well as the mother of Gareth, Agravain, and Gaheris.  - Sir Galahad (sometime referred to as Galeas or Galath ), in Arthurian legend, is a knight of King Arthur's Round Table and one of the three achievers of the Holy Grail. He is the illegitimate son of Sir Lancelot and Elaine of Corbenic, and is renowned for his gallantry and purity. Emerging quite late in the medieval Arthurian tradition, Sir Galahad first appears in the LancelotGrail cycle, and his story is taken up in later works such as the Post-Vulgate Cycle and Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\".  - Sir Agravain (sometimes spelled Agravaine) is a Knight of the Round Table in Arthurian Legend. In Chrétien de Troyes, the Vulgate, Post-Vulgate cycles and Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\", he is the second eldest son of King Lot of Orkney with Anna/Morgause/Morgan (Arthur's sister), thus nephew of King Arthur, and brother to Sir Gawain, Gaheris, and Gareth, and half-brother to Mordred.

When Austerity Fails I often complain, with reason, about the state of economic discussion in the United States. And the irresponsibility of certain politicians — like those Republicans claiming that defaulting on U.S. debt would be no big deal — is scary. But at least in America members of the pain caucus, those who claim that raising interest rates and slashing government spending in the face of mass unemployment will somehow make things better instead of worse, get some pushback from the Federal Reserve and the Obama administration. In Europe, by contrast, the pain caucus has been in control for more than a year, insisting that sound money and balanced budgets are the answer to all problems. Underlying this insistence have been economic fantasies, in particular belief in the confidence fairy — that is, belief that slashing spending will actually create jobs, because fiscal austerity will improve private-sector confidence. Unfortunately, the confidence fairy keeps refusing to make an appearance. And a dispute over how to handle inconvenient reality threatens to make Europe the flashpoint of a new financial crisis. After the creation of the euro in 1999, European nations that had previously been considered risky, and that therefore faced limits on the amount they could borrow, began experiencing huge inflows of capital. After all, investors apparently thought, Greece/Portugal/Ireland/Spain were members of a European monetary union, so what could go wrong? The answer to that question is now, of course, painfully apparent. Greece’s government, finding itself able to borrow at rates only slightly higher than those facing Germany, took on far too much debt. The governments of Ireland and Spain didn’t (Portugal is somewhere in between) — but their banks did, and when the bubble burst, taxpayers found themselves on the hook for bank debts. The problem was made worse by the fact that the 1999-2007 boom left prices and costs in the debtor nations far out of line with those of their neighbors. What to do? European leaders offered emergency loans to nations in crisis, but only in exchange for promises to impose savage austerity programs, mainly consisting of huge spending cuts. Objections that these programs would be self-defeating — not only would they impose large direct pain, but they also would, by worsening the economic slump, reduce revenues — were waved away. Austerity would actually be expansionary, it was claimed, because it would improve confidence. Nobody bought into the doctrine of expansionary austerity more thoroughly than Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, or E.C.B. Under his leadership the bank began preaching austerity as a universal economic elixir that should be imposed immediately everywhere, including in countries like Britain and the United States that still have high unemployment and aren’t facing any pressure from the financial markets. But as I said, the confidence fairy hasn’t shown up. Europe’s troubled debtor nations are, as we should have expected, suffering further economic decline thanks to those austerity programs, and confidence is plunging instead of rising. It’s now clear that Greece, Ireland and Portugal can’t and won’t repay their debts in full, although Spain might manage to tough it out. Realistically, then, Europe needs to prepare for some kind of debt reduction, involving a combination of aid from stronger economies and “haircuts” imposed on private creditors, who will have to accept less than full repayment. Realism, however, appears to be in short supply. On one side, Germany is taking a hard line against anything resembling aid to its troubled neighbors, even though one important motivation for the current rescue program was an attempt to shield German banks from losses. On the other side, the E.C.B. is acting as if it is determined to provoke a financial crisis. It has started to raise interest rates despite the terrible state of many European economies. And E.C.B. officials have been warning against any form of debt relief — in fact, last week one member of the governing council suggested that even a mild restructuring of Greek bonds would cause the E.C.B. to stop accepting those bonds as collateral for loans to Greek banks. This amounted to a declaration that if Greece seeks debt relief, the E.C.B. will pull the plug on the Greek banking system, which is crucially dependent on those loans. If Greek banks collapse, that might well force Greece out of the euro area — and it’s all too easy to see how it could start financial dominoes falling across much of Europe. So what is the E.C.B. thinking? My guess is that it’s just not willing to face up to the failure of its fantasies. And if this sounds incredibly foolish, well, who ever said that wisdom rules the world? What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses the failure of austerity measures in Europe and the negative consequences of continued insistence on fiscal austerity. The European Central Bank (E.C.B.) has been an avid supporter of austerity measures, but these measures have not resulted in increased confidence or economic growth. Instead, debtor nations like Greece, Ireland, and Portugal are experiencing further economic decline, and it is becoming clear that they cannot fully repay their debts. Despite these realities, Germany and the E.C.B. are resistant to providing aid or debt relief to these struggling countries, potentially leading to a financial crisis in Europe."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 2009, Darryl Layne Woods bought the luxury digs with some 381,000 of the 1 million given to Mainstreet Bank in Ashland, Mo., where he was the chairman at the time, the New York Times reports. \\"At a time when many other Americans were losing their homes, he was siphoning off public funds to buy a luxury vacation condo in Florida,\\" says a US attorney. His punishment? At most, a year in federal prison and a 100,000 fine, reports the Huffington Post. According to prosecutors, Woods also tried to cover his crime up. Per the Times, when a TARP investigator asked him to account for how the money had been spent, he sent a letter saying: \\"We are a small central Missouri community bank and while I would like to be able to provide you with very specific and quantitative responses we are currently operating under the assumption that the worst scenario could occur and the TARP proceeds will provide vitally needed infusions to a bleeding patient.\\" Woods has not yet received his sentence, but at the very least, he will be banned from working in the banking industry again. Expand this summary.","output":"Darryl Layne Woods, a former bank executive, has recently pleaded guilty to using bailout money to purchase a waterfront condo. In 2009, Woods, who was the chairman of Mainstreet Bank in Ashland, Missouri, at the time, used approximately 381,000 of the 1 million bailout fund that the bank received to buy a luxury condo in Florida. This happened during a time when countless Americans were losing their homes due to the economic crisis, further emphasizing the severity and immorality of his actions. The New York Times reports that Woods tried to cover up his crime by appealing to the circumstances that prompted the need for the bailout money in the first place. He attempted to paint a picture of a small, struggling community bank in central Missouri that was in desperate need of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds to keep them afloat. In a letter to the TARP investigator, Woods wrote: \\"We are a small central Missouri community bank and while I would like to be able to provide you with very specific and quantitative responses, we are currently operating under the assumption that the worst scenario could occur and the TARP proceeds will provide vitally needed infusions to a bleeding patient.\\" It seems that Woods was trying to evoke sympathy for his bank, while simultaneously diverting attention from his illicit use of bailout money to fund a personal luxury. Woods' actions represent a betrayal of trust and a breach of the responsibilities expected of someone in his position. The purpose of the bailout money was to help stabilize banks and institutions during the financial crisis, not to fund the personal desires of bank executives. This misuse of public funds represents a prime example of the kind of greed and corruption that led to the housing market and economic collapse in the first place. For his crime, Woods faces a maximum sentence of one year in federal prison, as well as a fine of up to 100,000. Though these penalties may seem relatively light compared to the gravity of his actions, it is important to note that at the very least, Woods will be banned from working in the banking industry ever again, stripping him of the power to abuse public funds for personal gain in the future. It is hoped that his conviction will serve as a reminder to other financial professionals of the importance of adhering to ethical standards, responsible practices, and the lawful use of public funds. In conclusion, the case of Darryl Layne Woods is a glaring example of the greed and corruption that can exist within the financial industry. Fortunately, Woods was caught and has pleaded guilty to the charges against him. While his punishment may not seem severe enough to some, it does send a strong message about the consequences of abusing public trust and misusing taxpayer dollars. It also highlights the need for constant vigilance and rigorous oversight within the banking industry to prevent similar instances of corruption and greed from occurring in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background: Robert Joseph Cousy (born August 9, 1928) is an American retired professional basketball player. Cousy played point guard with the Boston Celtics from 1950 to 1963 and briefly with the Cincinnati Royals in the 1969-70 season. Making his high school varsity squad as a junior, he went on to earn a scholarship to the College of the Holy Cross, where he led the Crusaders to berths in the 1948 NCAA Tournament and 1950 NCAA Tournament and was named an NCAA All-American for 3 seasons. Cousy was initially drafted by the Tri-Cities Blackhawks as the third overall pick in the first round of the 1950 NBA draft, but after he refused to report, he was picked up by Boston. Context: After retiring as a player, Cousy published his autobiography Basketball Is My Life in 1963, and in the same year became coach at Boston College. In the 1965 ECAC Holiday Basketball Festival at Madison Square Garden, Providence defeated Boston College 91-86 in the title game, when the Friars were led by Tourney MVP and All-American Jimmy Walker. Providence was coached by Joe Mullaney, who was Cousy's teammate at Holy Cross when the two men were players there in 1947. In his six seasons there, he had a record of 117 wins and 38 losses and was named New England Coach of the Year for 1968 and 1969. Cousy led the Eagles to three NIT appearances, including a berth in the 1969 NIT Championship and two National Collegiate Athletic Association tournaments, including the 1967 Eastern Regional Finals.  Cousy grew bored with college basketball and returned to the NBA as coach of the Cincinnati Royals, team of fellow Hall-of-Fame point guard Oscar Robertson. He later said about this engagement, \\"I did it for the money. I was made an offer I couldn't refuse.\\" In 1970, the 41-year-old Cousy even made a late-season comeback as a player to boost ticket sales. Despite his meager output of 5 points in 34 minutes of playing time in seven games, ticket sales jumped by 77 percent. He continued as coach of the team after it moved from Cincinnati to Kansas City/Omaha, but stepped down as the Kings' coach early in the 1973-74 NBA season with a 141-209 record.  In later life, Cousy was Commissioner of the American Soccer League from 1974 to 1979. He has been a color analyst on Celtics telecasts since the 1980s.\\" In addition, Cousy had a role in the basketball film Blue Chips in 1993, in which he played a college athletic director. Today he is a marketing consultant for the Celtics, and occasionally makes broadcast appearances with Mike Gorman and ex-Celtic teammate Tom Heinsohn. Question: Did he win any other awards as coach? Answer:","output":"Yes, Bob Cousy won several awards as a coach. During his time at Boston College, he was named New England Coach of the Year for 1968 and 1969. He led the Eagles to three NIT appearances, including a berth in the 1969 NIT Championship, and two National Collegiate Athletic Association tournaments, including the 1967 Eastern Regional Finals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What weapon will aim for the nose of an aircraft? Possible A: upper respiratory tract, missile, boomerang, head, aircraft  Why is \\"missile\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Missile\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is a weapon specifically designed for aiming and targeting various objects, including aircraft. Out of the mentioned options, it is the most logical and reasonable choice. Let's break down the other options to give a better understanding: 1. Upper respiratory tract: This refers to the part of the respiratory system, including the nose, nasal passages, and throat. It is not a weapon and has no relevance to targeting aircraft.   2. Boomerang: Although it is an object that flies and can be considered a primitive weapon, it is not designed to target the nose of an aircraft. Boomerangs were traditionally used by Indigenous Australians for hunting, sport, and entertainment. They are not meant for or effective against modern aircraft. 3. Head: This is not a weapon at all and is irrelevant to the context of targeting an aircraft. It may refer to the human head or the head of an animal, neither of which would be aiming for an aircraft's nose. 4. Aircraft: An aircraft itself is not a weapon that aims for the nose of another aircraft. While there are military aircraft designed to carry weapons, such as missiles or guns, the aircraft itself is not the weapon used to target another aircraft's nose. Considering these explanations, \\"missile\\" is the most appropriate answer aligned with human common sense as it refers to an actual weapon used in modern warfare to target and engage enemy aircraft. Missiles can be guided to aim at specific parts of an aircraft, such as the nose, to cause maximum damage and ensure the most effective engagement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 2: How is social sciences related to organizational behavior? Choose your answer from:  (A). no;  (B). yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Answer to Question 1: The difference between social science and organizational behavior can be explained as follows: Social science is a broad field of study that encompasses various disciplines that investigate human society, relationships, interactions, and behavior. It includes areas such as sociology, psychology, economics, political science, anthropology, and history. Social scientists aim to understand the underlying principles, patterns, and dynamics of human behavior, both at individual and collective levels. Their studies involve empirical research and the application of various theories and methodologies to explain social phenomena. Organizational behavior, on the other hand, is a specialized branch of social science that focuses on the behavior of individuals and groups within organizational settings. It combines elements of psychology, sociology, and management to explore how people interact with one another in workplaces, how these interactions influence individuals' attitudes, job performance, and well-being, and how organizations function effectively. Factors that may impact organizational behavior are leadership, motivation, communication, decision-making, teamwork, and organizational culture. Researchers in this field often study the relationships between employees and management, aiming to develop strategies for fostering a positive, productive work environment. Answer to Question 2: The relationship between social sciences and organizational behavior can be explained as follows: Organizational behavior is a sub-discipline of social science, and it draws on the theories and methodologies of several social science fields to understand and explain human behavior in organizations. Here are some ways in which social sciences are related to organizational behavior: 1. Psychology: Organizational behavior relies on psychological theories to explore individual and group behavior, attitudes, perceptions, and motivation in the workplace. Concepts from social psychology, such as group dynamics, conformity, and social identity, can be applied to analyze the way people behave in organizational contexts. 2. Sociology: Sociological theories and methods help organizational behavior researchers examine social structures, roles, norms, and networks within organizations. Organizational sociologists study the ways in which individuals' affiliations and social relations impact their work performance, job satisfaction, and opportunities for advancement. 3. Economics: Organizational behavior is also influenced by principles from behavioral economics, which seeks to understand how people make decisions in the context of available resources, incentives, and constraints. Ideas from industrial-organizational psychology and labor economics are incorporated to study compensation, incentives, wage structures, and productivity. 4. Anthropology: Anthropological perspectives on culture, rituals, and symbols can be employed in examining organizational culture, values, and norms. Organizational anthropologists investigate how cultural meanings and practices shape employees' interactions and affect their sense of belonging and engaged within the workplace. 5. Political Science: Organizational behavior takes into consideration concepts from political science when analyzing power dynamics, decision-making processes, rivalry, conflict resolution, and negotiation within organizations. Overall, organizational behavior is deeply connected to and influenced by social sciences due to the overlapping concepts and methodologies that together help explain the intricacies of human behavior within organizational settings. Regarding the selection between options (A) No and (B) Yes: Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing? (A) No The two questions address different aspects of the relationship between social science and organizational behavior. Question 1 asks about the difference between the two areas, while Question 2 is more focused on the connection between social sciences and organizational behavior."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"Although resulting damages must be proven in order to recover compensation in a negligence action, the nature and extent of those damages are not the primary focus of negligence cases.\\" be a reasonable answer? Options: -No -Yes Answer:","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Although resulting damages must be proven in order to recover compensation in a negligence action, the nature and extent of those damages are not the primary focus of negligence cases.\\" is a reasonable answer, but it does not fully explain what negligence in tort law is. Let's take a detailed look at negligence in tort law. Negligence in tort law is a legal concept that forms part of the broader area of civil law. It refers to a situation where an individual, who owes a duty of care to another, fails to act reasonably, and this breach of duty causes harm or injury to the other person. Negligence could be an act, or sometimes a failure to act, that leads to the victim suffering a loss or injury. There are four key elements in establishing negligence in tort law: 1. Duty of care: The plaintiff must prove that the defendant owed them a duty of care. A duty of care is a legal responsibility that one person owes to another to exercise reasonable care to avoid causing injury or harm. The relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant must be such that the harm to the plaintiff was reasonably foreseeable if the defendant failed to act with care. 2. Breach of duty: The plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant breached their duty of care. A breach occurs when the defendant fails to take reasonable steps that a reasonably prudent person would take in the same situation. This can include active wrongdoing or a lack of action, which would constitute an unreasonable omission. 3. Causation: The plaintiff must prove that the defendant's breach of duty directly caused their loss or injury. They should establish that the harm would not have occurred but for the defendant's negligence.  4. Damages: Finally, the plaintiff must show that they have suffered harm or injury due to the defendant's actions. These damages can include physical injury, property damage, financial loss, pain and suffering, or emotional distress. So, while proving the nature and extent of damages is an important aspect of a negligence case, it is not the only focus. The primary objectives of negligence cases are to determine whether a defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff, breached that duty, and whether that breach caused the plaintiff's damages. The damages are the means to measure the extent of harm caused by the negligence and form the basis for determining the compensation needed to make the plaintiff whole again. In summary, negligence in tort law is the failure to exercise reasonable care in fulfilling a duty owed to another person, which causes them harm or injury. The statement mentioned at the beginning of the question pertains specifically to the damages aspect of negligence cases and is reasonable in that regard. However, to fully understand negligence, it is essential to also consider the aspects of duty of care, breach of duty, and causation as part of the bigger picture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What he doesn't expect is that instead of his group of friends, he's suddenly surrounded by his mother's aging friends at his party. As the night goes on, Willard must navigate this unconventional birthday celebration and uncover the reason behind their presence. Plot: Act 1: Willard is excited for his 27th birthday - his mom, Martha, has offered to set up a surprise gathering. He invites his closest friends and anticipates a relaxed evening. On the day of the party, Willard arrives at the venue and is stunned to see it filled with his mother's elderly friends instead of his own. Confused, Willard tries to understand the mix-up and begins to mingle with the older guests. One of the attendees, a woman named Agatha, starts to tell Willard about a mystery that's been bothering her group of friends. They believe that one of their own, a once-famous socialite named Lady Victoria, knows the secret to aging well and is withholding this information from them. They have sought out the help of Willard to uncover the truth. Act 2: Willard, still puzzled by his unusual birthday party, decides to make the best of the situation and play detective. He begins to investigate Lady Victoria and discovers that many of the older guests were once part of a high-society clique in their younger days. With this newfound information, he uncovers the secret of Lady Victoria's aging well – a healthy lifestyle, exercise, and a dash of vanity. Although Willard reveals this mundane secret to the aging friends, they refuse to accept it. Convinced there must be a hidden elixir or some magical formula, they encourage Willard to dig deeper. Act 3: As the night goes on, more mysteries and secrets begin to unravel among the group of friends. Willard learns about past romances, betrayals, and feuds that have been buried over the years. Taking matters into his own hands, Willard brings them all together and encourages them to address their long-standing issues. In the process, he helps them all realize that their bond as friends, along with a strong sense of forgiveness, is the best way to grow old gracefully. In the end, Willard's mother reveals to him that she intentionally set him up with her friends, knowing their current situation and believing that he would be the perfect catalyst to bring them together. The film concludes with Willard's real friends arriving at the party, making it a night to remember for everyone. The Mystery of Willard's 27th Birthday is a wholesome story about friendship, acceptance, and growth. While Willard starts the night expecting a celebration with his friends, he ends up discovering the true meaning of friendship, understanding, and acceptance among his mother's age-old friends."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

You can either flip the chair upside down on a table or on another chair so that you can more easily access the problem area. This will also prevent any unwanted pressure on the legs or back of the chair when you are working. There are many types of strong wood glue products you can purchase to stabilize loose leg joints. When you locate a loose joint, push wood glue into the joint and let it dry completely before flipping the chair back over. Wipe away any access glue that comes out of the joint with a wet rag. To create a thicker wood glue consistency, try adding wood filler to the glue. A thicker mixture can better help stabilize wobbly chair legs. For very loose legs that seem to need more than glue, remove the chair leg completely, and use a wood-swelling liquid. Sometimes, dowels can shrink, causing chair parts to become loose. When you apply a wood-swelling liquid to the dowel, it will allow the dowel to once again become secure in the chair. If the hardware in the chair seem to be loose or no good anymore, you can replace them with new ones. Even if you don't want to remove the existing hardware, you can add reinforcement with more nails or bracket hinges to make the chair sturdy.

The proper reference should be John Ashcroft, who served as the 79th United States Attorney General from 2001 to 2005 under President George W. Bush.

Dunn asked the teens to turn down their music, and Jordan disrespected him, saying \\"F*** that n****r\\" -- nothing more -- and for that, Dunn opened fire, hitting Jordan three times. It was a markedly different account from that of defense attorney Cory Strolla, who told jurors that the music was so loud, it was rattling the windows of the teens' SUV, and when Dunn politely asked one of them to turn it down, Jordan uttered the three-word explicit phrase, demanded his pal turn the music back up and began jawing with Dunn. \\"Jordan Davis was sitting in his car seat with the door closed with nothing in his hands,\\" OPTIONS: - Cory Strolla told the jury. - Davis told the jury. - Dunn told the jury. - Florida told the jury. - Jacksonville told the jury. - John Guy told the jury. - Jordan told the jury. - Jordan Davis told the jury. - Michael Dunn told the jury. - Thanksgiving told the jury.","output":"John Guy told the jury.  The trial of Michael Dunn, who killed Jordan Davis, showcased two significantly different narratives presented by the prosecution and the defense in their opening statements. Assistant State Attorney John Guy, representing the prosecution, described the four teenagers as being innocent and engaged in typical leisurely activities during Thanksgiving break in 2012, stopping at a Jacksonville, Florida, gas station for gum and cigarettes. According to Guy, Dunn asked the teens to lower their music, and Jordan only responded with a disrespectful comment without further aggressiveness. Despite this, Dunn shot at Jordan, hitting him three times. On the other hand, defense attorney Cory Strolla presented a different perspective, arguing that the loud music from the teenagers' SUV was causing the windows to rattle. When Dunn asked them to turn down the volume, Jordan responded with an expletive, told his friend to increase the volume, and then engaged in a verbal altercation with Dunn.

Article: BEIJING, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- Commander-in-chief of China's manned space program Chang Wanquan announced Thursday night that the launch of Tiangong-1 space lab module is successful. China's first space lab module Tiangong-1 blasted off at 9:16 p.m. Beijing Time (1316 GMT) Thursday from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest desert area. The unmanned module, carried by Long March-2FT1 rocket, will test space docking with a spacecraft later this year, _ the way for China to become the third country in the world to operate a permanent space station around 2020. The Tiangong-1 will orbit the Earth for about one month to await Shenzhou-8 unmanned spacecraft. Once the two vehicles successfully rendezvous , they will conduct the first space docking at a height of 340 kilometers above Earth surface. After two docking tests, Tiangong-1 will await Shenzhou-9 and Shenzhou-10 in the next two years, according to a plan of China's manned space program. The 8.5-tonne Tiangong-1, with a length of 10.4 meters and maximum diameter of 3.35 meters, provides a room of 15 cubic meters for two to three astronauts to live and work. Zhang Shancong, deputy chief designer of the Tiangong-1, told Xinhua that the module carries special cameras which will take hyperspectral  images of China's vast farmlands to detect heavy metal pollution and pesticide residue as well as plant disease. Moreover, scientists on the ground will also conduct experiments on photonic crystal , a new material expected to revolutionize information technology, in the low-gravity environment inside the Tiangong-1 as these experiments would be extremely difficult to conduct on Earth's surface. \\"China is clearly becoming a global power and its investments in areas like technology and space exploration reflect this,\\" said Peter Singer, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. \\"It is a natural result of the growth in political and economic power and is to be expected,\\" said Zhou Jianping, chief designer of China's manned space program,...

Article: Settled by the Celts, invaded by the Romans and the Normans, and ruled by the English, Wales' population has regularly changed over the ages. Wales, particularly South Wales, became a melting pot of European nationalities and cultures. At first workers from England, Ireland and the rural areas of Wales rushed into the coalfields of South Wales. By 1911, workers from Ireland, Italy and Spain had joined the industrial workforce there. Many of these newcomers were prepared to work for less pay. But during this period, workers, dissatisfied with regular pay cuts, poor safety, the growing trend of employers to pay workers with tokens  , which could only be spent in the company store, returned to the land. In 1891, the rural population of Wales was about 616,000 and by 1911 just over 649,000 people lived and worked in these areas. The rural population continues to grow slowly even today. People from richer parts of the UK, particularly southern England, are buying holiday or retirement homes in Wales. In some areas this has led to a shortage of affordable housing for local people. This, combined with the lack of employment prospects in rural Welsh communities, has started a new movement of people in search of jobs and homes into the towns and cities of Wales and to other parts of the UK and Europe. As so many Welsh people have migrated to other countries over the last 200 years, it's really no surprise that many visitors come to see friends and  s -- there were 229,000 visitors in 1998. These visitors strengthen their links to their land of origin and continue to support the Welsh economy. During the hot summer days, about 28% of the visitors visit the countryside and nearly 70% visit the seaside. Question: What would be the best title for the passage?

OBJECTIVE To compare the outcome of pregnancy in cohorts of women with singleton pregnancy and history of preterm birth and sonographic short cervix managed with different treatment protocols, namely cerclage, vaginal progesterone or cervical pessary.     METHODS This was a comparison of three management protocols for women with singleton pregnancy and a high risk of preterm birth because of a prior spontaneous preterm birth before 34 weeks and a shortened cervical length detected by transvaginal ultrasound. The study included 142 women who were initially treated with cerclage (USA), 59 with vaginal progesterone (UK) and 42 with cervical pessary (Spain). Perinatal outcomes were compared between the three cohorts.     RESULTS There were no statistically significant differences in perinatal losses, neonatal morbidity and preterm births among the three groups, apart from a higher rate of preterm birth before 34 weeks' gestation after treatment with vaginal progesterone in comparison with treatment with cervical pessary (32% vs 12%; relative risk (RR) = 2.70; 95% CI, 1.10-6.67). When only the subgroups of women with cervical length < 25 mm, irrespective of gestational age, were compared, the difference between these two cohorts was not statistically significant (RR = 2.21; 95% CI, 0.83-5.89).     CONCLUSION Cerclage, vaginal progesterone and pessary appear to have similar effectiveness as management strategies in women with singleton pregnancy, previous spontaneous preterm birth and short cervix.

This means the (A) marble (B) rock has stronger gravity  Choose the answer between \\"marble\\" and \\"rock\\". Answer:","output":"The answer to the given logic test is: (B) rock.  Here's the explanation for the answer: In the question, we are provided with the information that Jimbo knows that his marble has a lesser mass than his rock. From a physics perspective, gravity is a force that occurs between objects with mass. The strength of this gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, as stated by Newton's law of universal gravitation: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 Where F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between them. Now, let's consider Jimbo's marble and rock. Since the rock has more mass than the marble, it will naturally have a stronger gravitational force associated with it, as mentioned in Newton's law. The magnitude of the force will be greater when considering the rock as one of the objects due to its higher mass. Consequently, the rock will have a stronger gravity than the marble. Thus, the answer to the logic test is that the rock (choice B) has a stronger gravity than the marble."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Born in Jamaica, she moved when she was 13, along with her siblings, to live with her parents in Syracuse, New York. Jones began her modelling career in New York state, then in Paris, working for fashion houses such as Yves St. Laurent and Kenzo, and appearing on the covers of Elle and Vogue. She worked with photographers such as Jean-Paul Goude, Helmut Newton, Guy Bourdin, and Hans Feurer, and became known for her distinctive androgynous appearance and bold features. Jones was signed by Island Records, who put her in the studio with disco record producer, Tom Moulton. Moulton worked at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, and Portfolio, was released in 1977. The album featured three songs from Broadway musicals, \\"Send in the Clowns\\" by Stephen Sondheim from A Little Night Music, \\"What I Did for Love\\" from A Chorus Line and \\"Tomorrow\\" from Annie. The second side of the album opens up with a seven-minute reinterpretation of Edith Piaf's \\"La Vie en rose\\" followed by three new recordings, two of which were co-written by Jones, \\"Sorry\\", and \\"That's the Trouble\\". The album finished with \\"I Need a Man\\", Jones' first club hit. The artwork to the album was designed by Richard Bernstein, an artist for Interview.  In 1978, Jones and Moulton made Fame, an immediate follow-up to Portfolio, also recorded at Sigma Sound Studios. The album featured another reinterpretation of a French classic, \\"Autumn Leaves\\" by Jacques Prevert. The Canadian edition of the vinyl album included another French language track, \\"Comme un oiseau qui s'envole\\", which replaced \\"All on a Summers Night\\"; in most locations this song served as the B-side of the single \\"Do or Die\\". In the North American club scene, Fame was a hit album and the \\"Do or Die\\"/\\"Pride\\"/\\"Fame\\" side reached top 10 on both the US Hot Dance Club Play and Canadian Dance/Urban charts. The album was released on compact disc in the early 1990s, but soon went out of print. In 2011, it was released and remastered by Gold Legion, a record company that specialises in reissuing classic disco albums on CD. Jones' live shows were highly sexualized and flamboyant, leading her to be called \\"Queen of the Gay Discos.\\"  Muse was the last of Jones' disco albums. The album features a re-recorded version \\"I'll Find My Way to You\\", which Jones released three years prior to Muse. Originally appearing in the 1976 Italian film, Colt 38 Special Squad in which Jones had a role as a club singer, Jones also recorded a song called \\"Again and Again\\" that was featured in the film. Both songs were produced by composer Stelvio Cipriani. Icelandic keyboardist Thor Baldursson arranged most of the album and also sang duet with Jones on the track \\"Suffer\\". Like the last two albums, the cover art is by Richard Bernstein. Like Fame, Muse was later released by Gold Legion.

The original information indicates that Mar-a-Lago is a 62,500-square-foot house, but this information reflects the total area of the property, not the number of rooms. A square foot is a unit of area used mostly in the United States and other countries that utilize the imperial system of measurement. It measures the area in terms of the space a square with 1 foot per side would occupy. It doesn't directly convert into the number of rooms.  On the other hand, the description also mentions that Mar-a-Lago is a 126-room house. This suggests that the property is expansive and houses numerous facilities, not simply being a typical residential property. The 126 rooms presumably include a mix of bedrooms, bathrooms, and several types of common areas. Further, the property also functions as a club with hotel-style amenities. Hence, the 126 rooms likely encompass culinary facilities like dining rooms and kitchens, recreational facilities like lounges and a spa, operational rooms like offices and storage, as well as service areas for staff. Elsewhere on the large property, which has been used as a private club and a residence by Donald Trump, there are likely many guest rooms among these facilities, since it is in operation as a club where people can stay.

(CNN) -- Japanese car manufacturer Honda is returning to Formula One in 2015 as an engine partner with British racing team McLaren, a deal which will renew one of the most successful partnerships in motorsport's elite class. Their previous five-year collaboration powered Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost to a clean sweep of world titles between 1988 and 1992. The 1988 car, the McLaren-Honda MP/4, has gone down in F1 legend after winning all but one of the 16 races that season.

Given the question: Process: - Adult mushrooms produce spores - Release them into the air by process of sporulation - Spores are carried by the wind - Land in a hospitable growing environment - The spores germinate into the soil - The mushroom starts growing - The adult mushroom produce spores of its own to repeat the process.  Question: suppose people and governments make effective changes that drastically lower the emission of greenhouse gas atoms happens, how will it affect more spores land in a growing environment.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"The answer is: less effect. To fully understand how the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions could lead to a decrease in spores landing in a growing environment, it is necessary to first understand the connections between greenhouse gas emissions, climate change, and mushroom growth. Greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide) trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming and climate change. Climate change, in turn, impacts various aspects of the environment, such as temperature, precipitation patterns, and humidity. These factors have significant influence on the growth and distribution of various fungal species, including mushrooms. Mushroom spores rely on air currents and wind to disperse and find suitable environments for germination and growth. Climate change, caused by high greenhouse gas emissions, can lead to alterations in wind patterns and weather conditions that affect the development of air currents. An adequate reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would potentially mitigate these negative impacts on the environment, thereby restoring wind patterns and air circulation closer to their natural states. If people and governments make effective changes that drastically lower the emission of greenhouse gas atoms, this will likely stabilize the Earth's climate and diminish the disturbances in wind patterns and air currents that disperse mushroom spores. This stabilization would result in fewer spores being carried away from suitable growing conditions, reducing the likelihood of spore deposition in non-ideal environments. Moreover, climate change has been known to cause extreme weather events such as intense storms, flooding, and droughts. These events can severely impact the germination and growth of mushroom spores. The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions could potentially alleviate the prevalence and severity of such extreme weather events, thereby providing a more stable and hospitable growing environment for mushrooms. In summary, if people and governments make effective changes that drastically lower greenhouse gas emissions, there will likely be a reduction in the negative effects of climate change on mushroom spore distribution and a more stable environment for mushrooms to grow. This, in turn, would lead to a lessening in the number of spores being carried away and a higher probability that spores will land in favorable growing conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Write some highlights for the following article: President Barack Obama will speak to the nation Tuesday, trying to build public support for a military strike against Syria. His request to Congress to endorse action reaches the House and Senate at an extraordinarily difficult moment. Vote counts suggest that the president might not win the support he is seeking. Democrats and Republicans are uncertain about backing the president. The public remains skeptical as well. According to one NBC poll, only 42% of the public endorsed using military force against Syria. After Afghanistan and Iraq, the nation is weary of war. The bar has been raised for further intervention. Although presidential speeches rarely are able to fundamentally reshape public opinion, Obama must give his strongest effort if he does not want to end up in an embarrassing situation for his administration and one that could undercut the military effort that he is proposing. If Obama is going to deliver a speech that matters, he must answer some basic questions about the Syrian intervention:. Why are we entering this conflict? For many Americans, the arguments behind American intervention in Syria remain murky. This is not just about Syria being a confusing and complex situation, but also has to do with a general uncertainty about the objectives of American foreign policy in 2013. In each era of foreign policy, policymakers have put forth strong ideological arguments that framed public policy about war and peace. Each period had substantial numbers of dissenters, but at least there was something concrete to argue about. During the 1930s and early 1940s, the fight against fascism was the driving force behind decisions about intervention. \\"Yesterday, December 7, 1941 -- a date which will live in infamy -- the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan,\\" President Franklin D. Roosevelt explained the next day, when asking Congress for a declaration of war. From the mid-1940s through the late 1980s, the fight against communism was the focal point of policy. Since that time, the objectives of American foreign policy have been less clear. When President Truman asked for congressional support to use military power in Korea in July 1950, he said that the conflict in Korea \\"has made it clear, beyond all doubt, that the international Communist movement is willing to use armed invasion, to conquer independent nations.\\" In the early 1990s, policymakers turned their attention to rogue states such as Iraq that were said to pose dangers to the stability of key regions. After 9/11, attention turned to international terrorist networks like al Qaeda. On September 20, 2001, President Bush told the nation, \\"The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends. It is not our many Arab friends. Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them.\\" The larger framework surrounding the Syrian intervention is less clear. The administration has offered a number of arguments as to why the United States needs to intervene, from the message it would send to Iran about nuclear weapons, to the urgency of responding to gross violations of human rights. The president must offer a compelling reason why a situation such as this deserves national resources. If humanitarian interventions are to become a new norm, the president should make the case and offer a set of coherent principles for future conflicts. What is the justification for this intervention and is it based on sound intelligence? One of the main sources of public cynicism about American foreign policy comes from the fact that presidents have often used incorrect information or purposely flawed data to justify military operations that result in huge human and financial costs. American history is filled with such examples. The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution in 1964, which provided President Lyndon Johnson the blanket authority he needed to expand America's presence in Vietnam and the region, was based on spurious data about alleged attacks on U.S. Navy destroyers by the North Vietnamese. Congress gave Johnson wide-ranging authority to conduct military operations. It was \\"like grandma's nightshirt, it covered everything,\\" he later said. President George W. Bush's request to Congress for the authorization to use force in Iraq in 2003 was justified through incorrect intelligence about the presence of weapons of mass destruction and untrue reports of connections between Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden. Obama, who ran his 2008 campaign based on criticism of all the problems with Bush's war, needs to demonstrate to the public that he has made a decision based on the soundest of evidence. The revelations about the National Security Agency have already raised public skepticism about the discrepancy between what Obama says in public and what he does behind the scenes. Without revealing sensitive information to the public, it is important that the president make a convincing case that the intelligence behind this decision is sound, that it has been examined and cross-examined, that the Syrian government did use chemical weapons and that the Syrians do pose a substantial threat to the region. He needs to explain why chemical weapons pose a threat that deserves a military strike as opposed to other weapons or mechanisms of mass destruction. Why act here, but not with regard to other atrocities or risks? The nation cannot afford another war based on false premises. What is the mission? Presidents have gone into many wars without a clear sense of what they hope to achieve. Once troops are sent into a war or even after the Air Force is sent in to strike targets, conflicts can take unpredictable turns and escalate quickly. If the administration doesn't articulate a clear sense of what it hopes to accomplish at the outset, it allows for open-ended possibilities for escalation. When President George H.W. Bush went to war with Iraq in 1990, the confusion over the objectives led to great frustration when Americans saw that Hussein remained in power after the celebrations of U.S. victory had taken place. Bush's son's war in Iraq proved even more frustrating, as there was growing awareness that the administration was entering into a much broader mission of nation-building than many Americans had anticipated. When the new government that emerged from the rubble in Iraq remained unstable and the U.S. seemed to be pouring endless resources into the country, many Americans were left with a sense that the operation had not been worthwhile. Obama can't afford to make the the mistake of leaving his objectives ill-defined. It is possible that quick and targeted airstrikes will destroy the chemical weapons capacity of the Syrians, though that would still leave in place a dictator whom the president has  characterized as inhumane and brutal. It is also possible that airstrikes would result in retaliation that would trigger a bigger conflict, which would in turn create greater pressure for regime change. The president did the right thing by engaging Congress in this decision rather than trying to circumvent the legislative branch. But in this case, with the memories of Iraq looming large, he won't have luck just asking for blind support. In his speech, the president must answer these questions in simple and direct terms. This would do a great deal to build confidence in the operation, and to build a foundation for longer term support of this intervention should it be needed.","output":"Highlights: 1.

OPTIONS: A). unacceptable; B). acceptable;...I think the answer is","output":"B). acceptable.  From a linguistic perspective, the sentence \\"Calvin will not eat the beef waffles\\" follows all the rules of English syntax and morphology and is grammatically correct. Each part of speech aligns with the standard English sentence structure of subject (noun), auxiliary verb, negation, verb, article, and object (noun phrase), i.e., \\"Calvin/will/not/eat/the/beef waffles\\". It is clear, concise, and intelligible, leaving no room for ambiguity in its intention to communicate that a person named Calvin has either refused to or is unable to eat what is identified as beef waffles.  The subject of the sentence is \\"Calvin\\", named and identified as the person who will not be consuming the beef waffles. The auxiliary verb \\"will\\" is used correctly in this sentence, determining the main verb tense, mood, voice, aspect, and negation. \\"Not\\" is used as a standard negation in English, and is appropriately used here to show a negative future action. The verb \\"eat\\" is a correct choice to describe the action that the subject (Calvin) is refusing to do. \\"The beef waffles\\" is acting as the object in this sentence, further qualifying what specifically Calvin will not eat. Moreover, the subject and verb agree in terms of number (singular/singular), which is a standard requirement for English sentence structure. The tenses are also consistent and correctly used. The use of the auxiliary \\"will\\" indicates a future action, suggesting that the eating (or not eating, in this case) will occur at some point after the present time. Therefore, a linguist would rate this sentence as acceptable linguistically. This rating is not related to meaning or the real-world feelings or reasoning of \\"Calvin\\", it's solely based on the structural and grammatical components of the sentence. Linguists aim to describe and understand the rules and structure of language, rather than prescribing what should or should not be said based on personal feelings or societal norms.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: While the story of a troubled kid turning to boxing for self-respect and anger management is hardly a new thing, the story is given a fresh twist here when the protagonist is a girl instead of a boy. Diana has trouble at school. She just can't stay away from fighting. At home her father is constantly putting her down. Her brother trains boxing at a gym and one day when she picks him up she decides she also wants to train. It would be easy to call this movie a \\"Rocky with girls\\" i guess. But that is not at all what this is about. The story actually benefits very much from the main character being a girl rather than a boy. That way you can deal with more problems at once. First the problem of her not being accepted because she's not a girlie-girl, and then when she comes to the boxing gym because she's a girl at all. It's also a story about how a purpose can change someones life. How positive things can make you grow. I don't want this to sound pretentious, because the movie doesn't feel pretentious at all, but what i'm saying is true. Also Michelle Rodriguez is very good in the lead. It's a shame really that she has become stuck in the \\"tough girl\\" typecasting now, because that's really not what her part in \\"Girlfight\\" is all about. Sure she's a female boxer, but rather it's the more sensitive moments that really makes her shine. So maybe this is basically your average underdog story with a twist, but it's lifted way above the crowd by Rodriguez' performance. I rate this 7/10.","output":"To analyze the sentiment of this review, let's break it down step by step: 1. The reviewer mentions that the story of a troubled kid turning to boxing is not new but is given a fresh twist with a female protagonist. This indicates that the reviewer found this aspect interesting and refreshing. 2. The reviewer talks about how the story benefits from the main character being a girl because it deals with additional challenges like gender stereotypes and societal norms.

Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: The Devil's Teeth Product review: My thought after reading this book was \\" I wish I could get my money back.\\" I didn't like it at all. It had less to do with sharks and more to do with Susan's plights on the island itself.I found the most interesting part the history of the island itself. The shark parts were not that great and actually take a second seat to her stay on the island. She does illustrate that each shark in itself is a unique animal with personality. If you like this kind of drivel you might like the book. But if your looking for hardcore shark data, biological data you will be disappointed. Answer:","output":"This review would likely decrease the chances of you buying the product, especially if you were looking forward to reading an in-depth study on sharks.  Firstly, the reviewer explicitly states the wish to have their money back, indicating they regret the purchase. This comment would serve as a strong deterrent for future buyers. The reviewer’s statement of disliking the book further amplifies the negative tone of the review and may discourage the reader from making the purchase. Secondly, the reviewer mentions that the book does not meet the expectation for a book supposedly centered on shark study. It rather focuses more on the author's trials and tribulations on the island, which could dissuade potential buyers hoping to learn more comprehensive knowledge about sharks. It's clear from the review that any potential buyer with an interest in gaining an understanding of sharks from a biological or scientific perspective will be particularly disappointed, as the reviewer claims these topics are largely absent from the book's content. Furthermore, the reviewer pointedly uses the term \\"drivel\\" to describe the book. Such a term is generally used to reference meaningless or unimportant information, which strongly suggests that they did not find the content of the book valuable or absorbing.  One of the few positive points mentioned in the review is that the reviewer found the history of the island interesting, but even that seems to be seen as a minor compensation for the overall disappointment.  Thus, overall, this type of review will presumably dissuade potential buyers who sought a detailed book about sharks, due to the reviewer's highly negative tone, critique of the book's central focus, and regret over their own purchase. However, those who are intrigued by the author's personal journey and the island's history might still consider making a purchase despite the reviewer's objections. In conclusion, the direction tends to a higher decrease than an increase in the chances of buying the product based strictly on this review."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Born on November 11, 1821, Dostoevsky became one of the most prominent and influential novelists in the world of literature, particularly known for his deep psychological analyses and exploration of human nature. Dostoevsky's literary career began with the publication of his first novel, \\"Poor Folk,\\" in 1846, which was well received by critics. However, the path to success and recognition wasn't without challenges. In 1849, he was arrested for his involvement in the Petrashevsky Circle, a group of intellectuals discussing radical ideas. After a mock execution, he was sentenced to four years of hard labor in Siberia, followed by compulsory military service. This experience had a profound impact on his writing, influencing the themes and characters that populate his later works. Dostoevsky's most famous novels include \\"Crime and Punishment\\" (1866), \\"The Idiot\\" (1869), \\"Demons\\" (1872), and \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" (1880). Throughout his career, he explored themes like religion, moral dilemmas, political ideologies, and individual freedom, often addressing the complexities and contradictions of human nature through deeply introspective characters. \\"The Brothers Karamazov,\\" considered one of his greatest masterpieces, tells the story of the turbulent relationships between a father, Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov, and his three sons, Dmitri, Ivan, and Alexei. Although the novel primarily focuses on family tensions, it also delves into broader philosophical and religious debates, covering topics like faith, doubt, free will, and morality. In the years following its publication, \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" has been the subject of numerous adaptations, academic studies, and critical analyses, remaining a significant work in world literature. Sadly, Fyodor Dostoevsky did not have the chance to witness the lasting impact of his final work, as he died on February 9, 1881, just a few months after the novel's publication. With \\"The Brothers Karamazov,\\" Dostoevsky cemented his legacy as an exceptional writer whose works continue to captivate and challenge readers to this day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Coming off their easy home win over the Bears, the Vikings flew to the desert for a Week 13 Sunday Night duel with the defending NFC champion Arizona Cardinals. In the first quarter, Minnesota got on the board with quarterback Brett Favre completing a 3-yard TD pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. It was originally ruled an incomplete pass as Shiancoe stepped out of bounds, but Minnesota challenged and won based on the fact that Shiancoe had both feet in bounds and the referee counted Shiancoe's third step, thereby making the original ruling on the field to be overturned. The Cardinals then responded with quarterback Kurt Warner finding wide receiver Anquan Boldin on a 2-yard TD pass. In the second quarter, Arizona took the lead with Warner finding Boldin again on a 39-yard TD pass. The Vikings responded with kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 25-yard field goal. However, the Cardinals took the lead at halftime when Warner completed a 34-yard TD pass to wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald. In the third quarter, Arizona increased their lead when kicker Neil Rackers kicked field goals of 31 and 30 yards. In the fourth quarter, Arizona kicker Neil Rackers nailed a 29-yard field goal. However, the Vikings tried to rally with Favre hooking up with rookie wide receiver Percy Harvin on a 31-yard TD pass. The Vikings tried an onside kick, which they did not recover and Arizona ran out the clock to seal their win. With only their second loss of the season, the Vikings not only fell to 10-2, but they lost starting linebacker E. J. Henderson to a season-ending broken leg.

To determine the difference in the number of field goals made by both kickers, simply subtract Longwell's field goals from Rackers' field goals: Rackers' Field Goals - Longwell's Field Goals = Difference 4 - 1 = 3 Thus, Neil Rackers kicked 3 more field goals than Ryan Longwell in the game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Most Intimate Dance: Elinor Carucci’s Photos of Motherhood This project, the third monograph by Elinor Carucci, follows a logical trajectory from her earlier work. Closer (2002), chronicled her tumultuous relationship with her husband and parents through incidences of infidelity (hers), too much dope (her husband’s) and her parents fractious relationship and eventual divorce. The mood was gentle, though, with plenty of high notes; the everyday ebb and flow of relationships were lovingly and lavishly documented, while the larger narratives played out in the background. Diary of a Dancer (2008) changed direction slightly and concentrated on Carrucci’s life as a professional Middle Eastern dancer, acting as the hired entertainment for weddings and Bar Mitzvahs around the five boroughs of New York. It showed the loneliness, physicality and endurance of endless subway rides and blistered feet between the sparkle and exoticism of her performances. Courtesy of Prestel/Verlagsgruppe Random House Mother shifts gear again. It starts with her pregnant with twins and concludes when they are 8 years old – a moment when Caruccci saw a change and a growing independence in her children. The intimacy and sensuality for which she has become so well known is amplified and, as she says in her introduction, she has never seen so much as she does as a mother. Her gaze has certainly become more intense, and her actions stronger, as she hugs, dresses, holds, licks, pulls, feeds, caresses and cares for her children. The little-discussed eroticism that so often exists between mother and child is played out honestly and easily – a beautiful, fluid link between generations. As with Carucci’s other work, the everyday is the focus of and propulsive force behind the book, as multiple layers of reality unfold in her concentration on detail. Meals, parties, subway journeys, daydreams, fights — they’re all chronicled here. But the book is also an exploration of national identity and how having children in a different country from your own makes one look at that country more acutely. It makes an immigrant engage in one’s adopted home in a way that was easy to avoid before. Both Closer and Diary of a Dancer were their best when the photos were indoors and intimate, but led by her children Carucci is forced out of doors, to the streets, playgrounds and school. It opens her up to document life in the city, meaning that in some elemental ways, the book is as much about New York as it is about her family. There are photos made in McDonald’s, and outside Duane Reade. Resolutely American holidays like Halloween and quintessentially New York giant pretzels from street vendors feature in a way that would have been unimaginable in her earlier work. Her children are American; she has lived in New York for nearly 20 years (she emigrated from Israel), and the differences between the two cultures are implicitly infuse the pictures. Photographically, having children allows her to look at the city afresh and her wonderment and pleasure in photographing is palpable. The sidewalks and subway stations are places where emotions are expressed just as openly as behind closed doors – something one has to very quickly get used to as a parent in New York. In this, Carucci continues to do what she does best: namely, dealing seamlessly with the collapse of private and public space. In his 2005 novel, Saturday, Ian McEwan writes beautifully about the inevitable letting go that parents must enact as children grow older and more independent. The book’s narrator, a middle-aged neurosurgeon, feels that wrenching sense of loss as he watches his son’s fingers slipping through his own as his son walks up a flight of stairs, away from his father. Carucci captures much of that same profound, inevitable sense of loss in her photographs. But in Mother, rather than dwelling on melancholy, the images celebrate the connection between twin brother and sister, and a mother’s attempts to see, feel and express her enduring relationship with her children. Elinor Carucci is an Israeli-American photographer based in New York. Her third monograph, Mother, is available through Prestel. LightBox previously profiled Carucci’s earlier work here. Susan Bright is a New York-based writer and curator. Her upcoming book, Home Truths: Photography and Motherhood, is available through Art/Books from November 30, 2013.

Watching That Lady In Ermine I was wondering what Betty Grable was doing in a project that seemed to be aimed for Marlene Dietrich to do. Someone over at 20th Century Fox may have decided one sex symbol is as good as another. Darryl F. Zanuck should have known better. Betty plays a 19th century Italian countess whose domain has been invaded by a troop of Hungarian Hussars captained by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Her ghostly ancestor whose portrait hangs in the palace hall along with the rest of her distinguished family tree, sees no small resemblance in Doug now and another invader some 300 years earlier whom she dealt with when armies failed. Besides that the current Betty has just been married to Cesar Romero and the invasion has come at a most inopportune moment, before things have been consummated. That's going to give anyone a bad attitude, I guarantee. Fresh, wholesome all American Betty is NOT the actress to do seductive and mysterious. Marlene Dietrich might have put this over, but with Betty it falls flatter than yesterday's presidential candidate. She and Fairbanks have no chemistry at all, though Doug is as charming as ever and someone I can watch in anything. Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin wrote the score for this film and This Is The Moment got an Oscar nomination for Best Song. That Lady In Ermine's one chance for Oscar glory fell to Buttons And Bows. Ernest Lubitsch died midway during the film and Otto Preminger finished That Lady In Ermine.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Your German Shepherd may have a hard time pumping blood throughout his body if his aorta is deformed. The aorta is the main artery leaving the heart. If the valve into the aorta is narrowed, as in AS, a backpressure is created in the heart making your dog work harder to circulate blood. Medication is the most common treatment for AS, which treats the irregular heart rhythm and may include antibiotics to prevent infection. Surgery is not recommended. Your German Shepherd may have a heart deformity that's causing a heart murmur or another health condition (like problems eating or with blood circulation). These deformities may include:  Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA): This is a temporary blood vessel in a fetal puppy that should close shortly after he's born. If it stays open, blood may bypass your dog's lungs. Vascular ring anomaly (also known as persistent right aortic arch): This is another blood vessel that should close before your dog is born. If it stays open after birth, the vessel traps your dog's esophagus which makes it hard for him to swallow food down into his stomach.  Mitral or tricuspid valve disease: These valves separate the heart's atria from the ventricles. If they don't fit perfectly together, then blood can leak in the wrong direction, causing a heart murmur. If your dog has abnormalities in the heart muscle itself, he may have dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. With Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), the heart muscle tires and becomes baggy. With hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle thickens, causing the chambers to get smaller and hold less blood. Treatment usually focuses on improving your dog's diet and exercise habits. Most vets don't recommend surgery unless your German Shepherd develops congestive heart failure. Older German Shepherds are prone to a vascular tumor (hemangiosarcoma) that attacks the vessels lining the heart. This tumor is the most common type in dogs and usually isn't noticed until it gets big enough to cause complications. Your dog may have abdominal swelling, irregular heartbeat, and anemia. Treatment for hemangiosarcoma is difficult. Veterinarians usually recommend chemotherapy and possibly draining the site of the tumor. Because the tumor is on the heart, treatment may only be able to add a few months to your dog's life.

While Kayla and her boyfriend Derek are sorting out items for a garage sale, the garage door inexplicably opens and closes.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (June 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) A young boy, Mikey, sets newspapers on fire in his basement. He blames his younger sister, Beth, when his foster mother admonishes him. His foster mother Grace Kelvin disciplines him and he yells at Beth, taking her doll and throwing it in the pool. When Beth reaches to get it, Mikey causes her to fall into the pool and drown. Mikey is secretly taping everything. He goes upstairs and overhears his mother telling a friend on the phone that adopting Mikey was a bad idea. The phone dies and Mikey walks in. Startled, his mother yells at him to get out. Mikey picks up her blow dryer and turns it on, and begins to taunt her. He throws it and she is instantly electrocuted. Mikey goes downstairs and pours a bunch of marbles onto the floor. When his foster father Harold arrives home, he rushed out to greet him as if nothing has happened. They sit and chat for a moment when he sees his dead daughter floating lifeless in the pool. In a frantic state he rushes towards the door but slips on the marbles Mikey had laid down earlier. Mikey proceeds to beat him in the head with a baseball bat. Soon after, the police have arrived to find Mikey \\"hiding\\" in a closet. He tells them a man came in and killed his family. A psychiatrist recommends that Mikey get fostered as soon as possible. His foster mother's sister is put forward as a prospective foster carer, but she does not want anything to do with Mikey. She states that he was adopted and that it was suspected that he was abused by members of his family. She does not present as somebody who is overly interested in taking care of a young child. He is then sent to a new family, Neil and Rachel Trenton, who don't know anything about Mikey's past. Mikey presents himself as an amiable and loving child.

Title: Alexander Nevsky Movie plot: The Teutonic Knights invade and conquer the city of Pskov with the help of the traitor Tverdilo and massacre its population. In the face of resistance by the boyars and merchants of Novgorod (urged on by the monk Ananias), Nevsky rallies the common people of Novgorod and in a decisive Battle of the Ice, on the surface of the frozen Lake Peipus or Chudskoe, they defeat the Teutonic knights. The story ends in the retaken Pskov where the ordinary foot-soldiers are set free, the surviving Teutonic knights will be held for ransom and Tverdilo is swarmed over by the vengeful people (and supposedly torn to pieces). A subplot throughout the film concerns Vasili Buslai and Gavrilo Oleksich, two famous warriors from Novgorod and friends, who become commanders of the Novgorod forces and who engage in a contest of courage and fighting skill throughout the Battle on the Ice in order to decide which of them will win the hand of Olga Danilovna, a Novgorod maiden whom both of them are courting. Vasilisa, the daughter of a boyar of Pskov killed by the Germans, joins the Novgorod forces as a front-line soldier, and she and Buslai fight side by side (which makes a strong impression on Buslai); she also personally slays the traitor Ananias. After both Gavrilo and Buslai have been seriously wounded, Buslai publicly states that neither he nor Gavrilo was the bravest in battle: that honor goes to Vasilisa, and that after her came Gavrilo.

Article: Some prenatal gender tests that use mom's blood are very accurate at determining baby's sex, a new study finds. But curious parents-to-be should be wary of online marketers that claim to be able to figure out fetal gender using just a woman's urine.      New research to be published Aug. 10 in the Journal of the American Medical Association finds that after seven weeks into a pregnancy, tests that analyze mom's blood for fetal DNA can correctly identify a male fetus 95.4 percent of the time and a female fetus 98.6 percent of the time on average. In comparison, tests that analyzed DNA from urine instead of blood were only accurate 41 percent of the time, said study researcher Diana Bianchi, a reproductive geneticist at Tufts University School of Medicine.      \\"It was worse than flipping a coin,\\" Bianchi told LiveScience.      Why baby's sex matters      Ultrasound imaging can sometimes reveal the sex of a baby as early as 11 weeks into pregnancy, though the results are wrong as much as 40 percent of the time. Most pregnant women in the United States get an ultrasound between 18 and 22 weeks of pregnancy that looks for fetal anomalies. At that point, the fetus' sex can be determined with high accuracy. [5 Myths About Women's Bodies]      Some people don't like to wait that long. Chelsea Gladden, who blogs at breezymama.com, told LiveScience that she and her \\"swollen ankles\\" needed the excitement of finding out her baby's sex about halfway through the pregnancy, but said she would have found out earlier if she could have.      \\"I was definitely consumed with finding out,\\" Gladden said.      But curiosity isn't the only reason for earlier gender testing. Certain genetic disorders are linked to the X chromosome, so they overwhelmingly affect males, whose XY sex chromosomes mean they lack the \\"backup\\" X that women have. Families at risk for these disorders can now opt to have amniocentesis, in which the fluid that cushions the fetus in the womb is extracted and tested, or a procedure called chorionic villus sampling, both of which carry a small risk of miscarriage.      A non-invasive blood test would cut down on such testing by 50 percent because moms carrying female babies wouldn't need to worry, said Bianchi. Bianchi is on the advisory board and holds stock options in the biotechnology company Verinata Health, Inc., which has the goal of developing non-invasive fetal abnormality tests.      Another disorder, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or CAH, disrupts hormone balance, resulting in a female fetus taking on masculine traits. Moms carrying fetuses with CAH take steroids during their pregnancies, which can have unpleasant side effects. If fetal sex were known earlier, Bianchi said, the moms carrying male fetuses with CAH would be able to skip the steroids.      Chromosome-based diagnoses of gender are also important to parents whose children are born with ambiguous genitalia. If an ultrasound reveals genitals that could be male or female, Bianchi said, knowing the baby is XX or XY can give parents a road map for what gender to raise the child. [The Truth About Genderless Babies]      It's a boy! (or girl)      Blood tests for fetal gender aren't available clinically in the United States, Bianchi said, though they are used in Europe for diagnosis in high-risk pregnancies. A number of companies do sell blood and urine tests of fetal sex to parents online for several hundred dollars.      Bianchi and her colleagues combed through the scientific literature to find studies on those blood and urine tests that use fetal DNA from mom's blood to identify sex. Only males have Y chromosomes, so if Y chromosomes are found in mom's blood, she's likely carrying a baby boy. If no Y chromosomes are found, she's probably expecting a daughter.      After excluding studies that lacked data or were too small, Bianchi and her team came up with 57 studies of prenatal sex tests to analyze. They found that urine tests were extremely unreliable, possibly because by the time fetal DNA is filtered from the blood into the urine, it's been broken down.      Blood tests, on the other hand, revealed fetal DNA quite early. Before seven weeks, blood tests correctly identified male fetuses only 74.5 percent of the time. After seven weeks, however, accuracy went up. Tests conducted between seven and 20 weeks of pregnancy accurately identified baby boys about 95 percent of the time and baby girls about 99 percent of the time. After 20 weeks, these test were extremely accurate, pegging boys as boys 99 percent of the time and girls as girls 99.6 percent of the time.      Parents of at-risk pregnancies should talk with their doctors, Bianchi said, because blood tests could help prevent more invasive procedures down the road. Bianchi said she sends samples to the U.K. when she really needs a test done.      But for moms and dads who just want to know what color to paint the nursery, Bianchi recommends patience.      \\"Currently, they would have to go to the Internet, and I would say that they should be wary,\\" she said. \\"There is not a whole lot of transparency in those methods or the actual performance results.\\"      The study was funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute.

The appeal of the test, which analyzes fetal DNA found in the mother’s blood, is that it can establish sex weeks earlier than other options, like ultrasound, and is noninvasive, unlike amniocentesis and other procedures that carry small risks of miscarriage. The finding came in a study published online Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association.      The tests have been available to consumers in drugstore chains and online for a few years, but their use has been limited, partly because their accuracy was unclear. One company, which guaranteed 99.9 percent accuracy as early as five weeks into pregnancy, filed for bankruptcy after a lawsuit by scores of women whose tests showed the opposite sex of the baby they ended up having.      European doctors now routinely use the tests to help expectant parents whose offspring are at risk for rare gender-linked disorders determine whether they need invasive and costly genetic testing. For example, Duchenne muscular dystrophy affects boys, but if the fetus is not the at-risk sex, such tests are unnecessary. But doctors in the United States generally have not prescribed the tests because they are unregulated and medical labs are not yet federally certified to use them.      That and other aspects of the pregnancy landscape could change as a result of the new study. The journal study analyzed reams of research on fetal DNA tests — 57 studies involving about 6,500 pregnancies — and found that carefully conducted tests could determine sex with accuracy of 95 percent at 7 weeks to 99 percent at 20 weeks.      The study “has wide-reaching implications,” said Dr. Louise Wilkins-Haug, director for maternal-fetal medicine and reproductive genetics at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, who was not involved in the research. “Individuals need to be careful” to ensure that companies use rigorous laboratory procedures and support accuracy claims with data, she added.      One potential worry is that women might abort fetuses of an undesired sex. Several companies do not sell tests in China or India, where boys are prized over girls and fetuses found to be female have been aborted. While sex selection is not considered a widespread objective in the United States, companies say that occasionally customers expressed that interest, and have been denied the test. A recent study of third pregnancies in the journal Prenatal Diagnosis found that in some Asian-American groups, more boys than girls are born in ratios that are “strongly suggesting prenatal sex selection,” the authors said.      At least one company, Consumer Genetics, which sells the Pink or Blue test, requires customers to sign a waiver saying they are not using the test for that purpose. “We don’t want this technology to be used as a method of gender selection,” said the company’s executive vice president, Terry Carmichael. Sex-determination tests are part of a new frontier of fetal DNA testing, which can be used to determine paternity and blood type, and is being used to develop early screening tests for genetic diseases or disorders like Down syndrome.      The new study found that to be reliable, the sex-determination tests had to be performed after at least seven weeks of gestation. Most tests that were highly accurate were conducted on a mother’s blood, not urine. And certain rigorous laboratory procedures had to be followed. For the blood tests, women prick their fingers and send blood samples to labs. If the Y chromosome is detected, the fetus is male. Absence of a Y chromosome would probably mean the fetus is female, but could mean that fetal DNA was not found in that sample.      The tests are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration because they are not used for medical purposes, a spokeswoman said, but the agency is investigating the explosion of home genetic tests like these and genome-sequencing kits.      Dr. Diana Bianchi, executive director of the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center in Boston and the lead author of the sex-determination report, said, “A very important aspect of the study is how this advances prenatal care.”      But there are potential concerns too, she said, including that women may spend more than 250 for the tests when they don’t have insurance for prenatal care. A typical blood test like Pink or Blue, for example, costs 25 for the kit. Lab fees and shipping costs, which vary, bring the total expense to 265 to 330.      Dr. Bianchi is conducting another study to “try to find out why people are buying these things and what are the consequences,” she said. “It’s very important to educate health care providers that pregnant women are buying these tests.”      Another type of test not studied by the researchers has become popular because it is cheaper and can be done at home. These tests analyze hormones in women’s urine, a method that several experts said has not been studied as rigorously as DNA. Rebecca Griffin, a founder of the biggest seller, Intelligender, said two independent studies found it 90 percent accurate at 10 weeks.      Another company, TrovaGene, has developed a DNA test using urine, which, according to Gabriele Cerrone, TrovaGene’s co-founder and director, is 95 percent accurate at predicting boys at seven weeks, and 88 percent accurate at predicting girls. TrovaGene is also developing a test for Down syndrome.      Most DNA tests on the market use blood.      Raylene Lewis, 34, of College Station, Tex., had a frustrating experience with a now-defunct company, Acu-Gen, which guaranteed 99.9 percent accuracy with its blood tests. In 2005, she was told she was having a boy, and she chose a name, bought boy clothes and told everyone. When an ultrasound revealed she was carrying a girl, “I was absolutely shocked,“ she said. She was not unhappy, she said, but “it was like the baby boy disappeared.”      When the Lewises complained to Acu-Gen’s president, they were told, “We are very sure that genetically you are having a male,” she said, reading a transcript of the conversation, which they recorded. The official suggested that the baby might be “what a baby girl looks like on the outside,” but that “we’re giving you the results on the inside.”      Ms. Lewis, who sued Acu-Gen, said she ultimately received a refund. Lawyers for Acu-Gen could not be reached for comment.      The Pink or Blue test, which claims 95 percent accuracy at seven weeks and gives refunds for wrong results, appears to meet the standards described in the new study.      Chelsea Wallace, 23, of Okeechobee, Fla., was thrilled early this year when the test she took at seven weeks said she was having a boy, a result confirmed weeks later by ultrasound. Ms. Wallace, who has a 3-year-old daughter, said she also would have been happy with a girl, but that since she and her fiancé could not agree on a boy’s name, finding out early gave them time to choose the name Layton. It also helped her plan, she said.      “As soon as I found out I was pregnant,” said Ms. Wallace, whose son is due in September, “I wanted to know what I was having.” ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association finds that prenatal gender tests analyzing a mother's blood for fetal DNA can accurately identify a male fetus 95.4% of the time and a female fetus 98.6% of the time, on average, after seven weeks into a pregnancy. This is in contrast to tests that analyze DNA from urine, which were found to be accurate only 41% of the time. Blood tests for fetal gender are currently not available clinically in the United States, but they are used in Europe for diagnosis in high-risk pregnancies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? Will the Bloodborne universe or story be related to Demon's Souls? Is Bloodborne hard?","output":"No, these questions do not have the same meaning. They address different aspects of Bloodborne, a popular action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware. Let's address each question separately to provide detailed explanations. 1. Will the Bloodborne universe or story be related to Demon's Souls? This question seeks to understand whether Bloodborne shares any connections in terms of lore or storytelling with Demon's Souls, another game developed by FromSoftware. It aims to identify potential crossovers, references, or shared elements between the two game universes. To answer this question, while both games are developed by FromSoftware and bear significant similarities in terms of gameplay mechanics, aesthetics, and even thematic elements, they are not directly connected in terms of story and universe. Bloodborne's story is set in the 19th-century-inspired Gothic city of Yharnam, whereas Demon's Souls takes place in the medieval fantasy kingdom of Boletaria. Each game develops its own narrative, characters, and world. There might be some subtle references to Demon's Souls in Bloodborne, but they are chiefly neat Easter eggs rather than clear indications of a shared universe. The game director Hidetaka Miyazaki has not confirmed any direct links between the universes, and each title can be experienced independently. 2. Is Bloodborne hard? This question tackles the difficulty level of Bloodborne as a game and could be especially relevant for a potential player who wants to know what to expect in terms of challenges and progression. The inquiry could also be essential for players familiar with other FromSoftware titles, such as Demon's Souls, and who are wondering about the relative difficulty of Bloodborne. Bloodborne is known for its challenging and often punishing gameplay. Players must navigate an oppressive atmosphere filled with relentless enemies and demanding boss battles. The game rewards tactical thinking, perseverance, and the ability to learn from mistakes. Although the difficulty level is considered high, many players find it an essential aspect of the game experience. It fosters a sense of accomplishment upon the completion of difficult sections or the defeat of powerful adversaries, thus eliciting profound satisfaction. Some might argue that Bloodborne could be harder than Demon's Souls due to its combat system, which rewards an aggressive playstyle, pushing the player to constantly be on the offensive and not rely solely on defense. However, difficulty is a subjective matter, and different players may have diverse opinions on which game is more challenging. In conclusion, these questions address separate aspects of Bloodborne. The first questions the connection between Bloodborne and Demon's Souls, while the second focuses on the game's difficulty. The answers provided clarify that the two games are not directly linked in terms of story and universe, and that Bloodborne is indeed known for its challenging gameplay."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Emily Blunt(The Devil Wears Prada) is the star of the film, bringing Victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first Oscar nomination for her performance. Rupert Friend is almost bland as Prince Albert but he has great chemistry with Emily Blunt. Paul Bettany is also solid as Lord Melbourne although i expected more of him.

At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster. The same principle explains why storing food in a cold refrigerator reduces the rate at which food spoils (see Figure below ). Both food frying and food spoiling are chemical reactions that happen faster at higher temperatures.  Please answer this question : Which person studied about a slower reaction rate?","output":"Paul studied about a slower reaction rate in comparison to Ned. The hint provided states that when the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster, as the particles of the reactants have more energy, move faster, and are more likely to bump into one another and collide with greater force. Since Ned learned about reactions at higher temperatures for his physics class, he studied faster reactions.  On the other hand, Paul had to learn about reactions at lower temperatures. The same principle applies to these reactions, but in the opposite direction. At lower temperatures, the particles of the reactants have less energy and move slower, leading to fewer and less forceful collisions. Consequently, the reaction rate would be slower at lower temperatures, which is the topic Paul studied.

Answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Who directed the film that was a remake of the 1920 silent film of the same name,starring A popular supporting player of the late 1930s? Answer:","output":"The film you're referring to is likely \\"The Mark of Zorro,\\" a 1940 sound remake of the 1920 silent film of the same name. The popular supporting player from the late 1930s you've noted is likely referring to actor Basil Rathbone, who starred as the villainous Captain Esteban Pasquale in the 1940 version. This iconic swashbuckling adventure film was directed by Rouben Mamoulian. Rouben Mamoulian was an acclaimed Georgian-American film and theatre director. Born in Tbilisi, Georgia, in 1897, Mamoulian moved to England in the 1920s and then to the United States, where he made a significant mark in both theatre and film. Mamoulian was known for his innovative use of camera movements and sound, as well as his attention to the elaborate visuals and detailed character development. \\"The Mark of Zorro\\" is one of Rouben Mamoulian's most popular and enduring films. The 1940 version of this film, starring Tyrone Power as Zorro/don Diego Vega alongside Basil Rathbone and Linda Darnell, was a significant improvement upon the silent 1920 version, capturing a new audience with the charm and grandeur of Hollywood's Golden Age. The story revolves around the character of Don Diego Vega (Tyrone Power), the seemingly lazy son of a wealthy landowner in early 19th century Spanish California. Unknown to anyone but his deaf-mute servant, Vega is actually Zorro, a masked vigilante fighting to protect the oppressed from the tyranny of the local governor. Basil Rathbone played his adversary, delivering an excellent performance that significantly contributed to the film's success.  Rouben Mamoulian's direction in \\"The Mark of Zorro\\" resulted in a rhythmic, action-packed film that successfully combined aspects of romance, comedy, and adventure. It is often noted for its exceptional fencing scenes, most notably the thrilling confrontation between Power and Rathbone, which remains one of the best-remembered scenes in classic cinema. So, to bring it back to your original question, Rouben Mamoulian was the director of the 1940 film \\"The Mark of Zorro,\\" a remake of the silent 1920 film of the same name, and it starred Basil Rathbone, a popular supporting player of the late 1930s. This film is a notable example of Mamoulian's directorial skills, solidifying his legacy in Hollywood history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Obama, Romney reverse roles as election looms\\"","output":"Title: Obama, Romney Reverse Roles as Election Looms Introduction: As the highly anticipated presidential election draws near, the political landscape has taken a dramatic turn. Former President Barack Obama and Republican powerhouse Mitt Romney find themselves in an unprecedented role reversal, forcing a reevaluation of their respective political strategies and public personas. In this article, we will examine the contributing factors surrounding this unique phenomenon and how it may ultimately impact the outcome of the election. Historical Context: In 2012, the American people witnessed a heated election race between incumbent President Obama, seeking reelection for a second term, and Romney, former governor of Massachusetts and Republican nominee. The two candidates stood in stark contrast to each other, with Obama emphasizing social issues, such as healthcare and income inequality, while Romney championed a platform of conservative economic policies. However, the tables have turned in recent years, with the two men trading their typical political personas and finding unexpected common ground across party lines. The Catalyst for Change: The Trump Administration Upon reflection, it is clear that the most significant contributing factor to this role reversal lies in the election and subsequent presidency of Donald Trump. As the 45th President of the United States, Trump has been a polarizing and divisive figure, both domestically and abroad, largely due to his unique leadership style and penchant for social media. In response to the perceived chaos of the Trump administration, Romney has emerged as an advocate for traditional Republican values, such as rule of law, democratic norms, and constitutional order, deviating from his prior championing of economic conservatism. Meanwhile, Obama has transitioned into the role of elder statesman, opting for caution and experience when discussing potential solutions for the myriad challenges facing the nation. Impact on the Election But how exactly will this role reversal affect the outcome of the upcoming election? Undoubtedly, these shifts have prompted a reassessment of strategies by both political parties. For the Republicans, with Romney at the helm of the party's more traditional guard, they find themselves grappling with a need to distance themselves from the controversial Trump presidency, while simultaneously not alienating Trump's passionate base. This delicate balancing act could have a significant impact on voter turnout and party unity, as the Republicans seek to reestablish their foundational principles and values amid turbulent times. On the other hand, the Democrats may find strength in Obama's newfound role as a calm and unifying figurehead. With the nation struggling to overcome the challenges of a global pandemic, economic downturn, and social unrest, Obama's emphasis on unity, experience, and stability could resonate with voters seeking reassurances from their political leaders. However, Democrats also face the challenge of appeasing the more progressive wings of the party, who may view Obama's cautiousness as a hindrance to pushing forward bold, transformative policies. Conclusion In a world marked by uncertainty, the role reversal of Obama and Romney proves that politics is anything but predictable. As the election draws nearer, both Democrats and Republicans will need to mobilize voters and present a clear vision for the future in order to garner the support needed to secure the presidency. This unexpected role reversal has placed both Romney and Obama at the forefront of a shifting political narrative, as they struggle to navigate and adapt to the ever-evolving circumstances. The implications of this change are numerous, and one can only wonder how the eventual outcome of the election will reflect these historical revisions and realignments. Ultimately, the presidential election will likely be determined by the party that best communicates its ideals and aspirations, while effectively navigating this uncharted political territory. As the clock ticks down, all eyes will remain on these influential figures as they continue to redefine their roles and, quite possibly, the future of American politics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Stitch: While this option might seem relevant to the context since it involves the idea of repairing or sewing, it falls short as it's too literal in comparison with the figurative context of the given statement. 4. Heal: Healing represents the process of recovery, both physically and emotionally. This option is the most relevant to the context since it refers to the idea that the emotional or psychological scars from making that particular decision will never recover or improve. 5. Paste: This option doesn't fit either, as pasting implies attaching or sticking something, which doesn't connect with the emotional context of the question. Based on this analysis, the correct choice is \\"heal\\" because it is the one that best fits the context, answering the question in a way that is consistent with the intended meaning. The person in the question will never heal from the figurative scars left by the cut, indicating that they will continue to experience the emotional impact of that decision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Nazarbayev Looks to Have Won Re-Election as Kazakhstan President SEMEY, Kazakhstan — This spring’s hasty campaign season in Kazakhstan has sometimes felt like a pep rally for Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, the steelworker-turned-Communist-Party-boss who has ruled the country since 1989. That impression was heightened on Sunday when one of the president’s three challengers acknowledged that he, too, had voted for Mr. Nazarbayev. “I am sure that the current president will be the victor, so I am giving him my vote as well,” the challenger, Mels Yeleusizov, an environmental activist, told the Interfax news service as he emerged from a polling station in the city of Almaty. He said his family was voting for Mr. Nazarbayev as well. The president, who called snap elections two years ahead of schedule, won by 94.8 percent, according to an exit poll by the Association of Sociologists and Political Scientists of Kazakhstan. Meanwhile, early results from the Central Election Committee suggested that turnout was an extraordinarily high 89.9 percent, despite opposition leaders who denounced the election as a farce and encouraged voters to stay home. Mr. Nazarbayev, 70, is credited with making oil-rich Kazakhstan into Central Asia’s island of stability, but he has drawn criticism from the West for stifling dissent. In February, seeking to shore up his reputation as an international statesman, Mr. Nazarbayev abruptly rejected the idea of a referendum that would have granted him the presidency until 2020. The election provided an even playing field, he told reporters on Sunday. “All candidates had equal opportunities to visit regions and had access to mass media,” Mr. Nazarbayev said on Sunday, as he emerged from the country’s National Academic Library, a grandiose new structure that is shaped like a Möbius strip. “They expressed their ideas and unveiled their messages to the people of Kazakhstan. There are some valuable thoughts that we have to keep in mind. We are open to our society.” In Semey, a university city near the border with Siberia, students showed up in large numbers in a snowstorm on Sunday morning, and poll workers said there were already lines when they opened the doors at 7 a.m. Tolebay K. Rakhypbekov, rector of the Semey State Medical University, said political competition would come to Kazakhstan — but only gradually. “There is none now,” he said. “But what competition can there be against our president? We all love him.” Lyudmila A. Lyapunova, 60, said voters were there because they risked losing their jobs or university spots if they did not show up. As a retiree, she said, she could afford to openly denounce the process, and planned to cross out every name on the ballot: an improvised version of “against all,” a traditional option that was omitted from this year’s poll. But virtually all voters said they were casting ballots for the president. Ada G. Komanova, 76, raved over the services provided to the elderly through the Nazarbayev Fund: a health clinic, concerts, a senior center “so cozy, it’s like a fairy tale.” Kanat, a construction worker who would not give his last name, said he had voted for Mr. Nazarbayev, even though he thought the president and his family had enriched themselves fabulously over the last two decades. “They already have everything they need,” he said. “They can afford to think about the public.”","output":"Kazakhstan's incumbent President, Nursultan A.

Question: \\"Which of the following is not considered a great Liberal: Burke, Macaulay, or Hirst?\\"  Context: \\"The 19th-century Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone considered Burke \\"a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America\\" and in his diary recorded: \\"Made many extracts from Burke—sometimes almost divine\\". The Radical MP and anti-Corn Law activist Richard Cobden often praised Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity. The Liberal historian Lord Acton considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with William Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: \\"I have now finished reading again most of Burke's works. Admirable! The greatest man since Milton\\". The Gladstonian Liberal MP John Morley published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice. The Cobdenite Radical Francis Hirst thought Burke deserved \\"a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate. In politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site\\". Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France was controversial at the time of its publication, but after his death, it was to become his best known and most influential work, and a manifesto for Conservative thinking.\\"  Answer:","output":"Based on the given context, it can be inferred that the person who is not considered a great liberal among Edmund Burke, Thomas Babington Macaulay, and Francis Hirst would be Hirst. Edmund Burke, an Irish statesman and philosopher, was regarded by a number of 19th-century liberal thinkers, such as Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone and the Radical MP Richard Cobden, as a source of wisdom, particularly on matters concerning Ireland and America. Lord Acton even counted him as one of the three greatest liberals alongside Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Burke's work, specifically his 'Reflections on the Revolution in France', was seen as a conservative manifesto and gained considerable influence after his death. Thomas Babington Macaulay, a British historian and Whig politician, is also counted among the greatest liberals by Lord Acton. Lord Macaulay himself was an admirer of Burke, referring to him as the \\"greatest man since Milton.\\" Macaulay's involvement in politics and his contributions as a historian made him an influential figure in 19th-century liberalism. Francis Hirst, however, was a Cobdenite Radical who did recognize the value of Burke's contributions, despite acknowledging that he was \\"the most conservative\\" of all reformers and libertarians. In Hirst's view, Burke was more focused on preserving and renovating existing systems, rather than embracing innovation or creating new ones. This indicates that, although Hirst appreciated some aspects of Burke's thinking, he did not fully align with the liberal values espoused by Burke, Macaulay, and others. In conclusion, the individual who is not considered a great liberal among Edmund Burke, Thomas Babington Macaulay, and Francis Hirst is Francis Hirst. While Hirst recognized some merits in Burke's works, his own stance as a radical, rather than a liberal, sets him apart from the other two figures, who enjoyed a significantly greater reputation and influence within the liberal movement."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: The White House's public comment telephone line isn't accepting calls amid the ongoing government shutdown, and its recently updated recorded message blames it on Democrats.      Upon calling the comment line Sunday morning at (202) 456-1111, a woman's voice reads the following message:      “Thank you for calling the White House. Unfortunately, we cannot answer your call today because congressional Democrats are holding government funding, including funding for our troops and other national security priorities, hostage to an unrelated immigration debate,\\" she says.

We look forward to taking your calls as soon as the government reopens.”      The call then disconnects.      The government shutdown stretched into its second day on Sunday, with no clear indication that an agreement to reopen it is imminent.      Meanwhile, Republicans and Democrats have steadfastly blamed the other side for causing the shutdown.      Democrats have opposed any funding measure that doesn't include assurances for addressing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Republicans have argued that by doing so, Democrats are holding government funding hostage.      Democrats have pinned the blame on Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, and President Trump Donald John TrumpThe Memo: Ayers decision casts harsh light on Trump NASA offers to show Stephen Curry evidence from moon landings Freedom Caucus calls on leadership to include wall funding, end to 'catch and release' in funding bill MORE in particular, saying the president changes his positions too frequently to be a reliable negotiating partner. ||||| Party leaders and rank-and-file senators spent all day Sunday haggling over a deal to reopen the government. But Washington's painful shutdown will nonetheless drag into Day Three.      Shortly after 9 p.m. Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the chamber would vote on a plan at noon Monday to fund the government through Feb. 8. In an attempted concession to Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, McConnell said he would take up legislation to protect some young immigrants from deportation if a deal to address their status is not reached by the time funding expires in early February.      Story Continued Below      But Democrats were not ready to call it a deal, even as McConnell implored the Senate to vote Sunday night to reopen the government. \\"The shutdown should stop today,\\" he said.      Schumer said further negotiations were needed and spurned McConnell's request, pushing a vote until Monday, when hundreds of thousands of federal employees will be furloughed.      \\"Talks will continue, but we have yet to reach an agreement on a path forward that would be acceptable for both sides,\\" Schumer said.      The vote Monday is expected to fail absent further progress between the two party leaders before then.      Senate Republicans will have a conference meeting at 11 a.m. Monday to discuss the state of play, aides said.      The late-night exchange capped a furious round of negotiations Sunday between Schumer and McConnell, as well as a group of deal-making senators desperate to reopen the shuttered government. Senators from both parties took a proposal to the party leaders after the centrists met for 90 minutes on Sunday afternoon.      Their proposal would reopen the government through Feb. 8 and have McConnell commit on the Senate floor to holding an immigration vote before that date — a commitment that McConnell approached but did not definitively agree to, in part because Republicans worry they could not complete an immigration debate before the next funding deadline.      Keeping the shutdown going given McConnell’s stated goal of an immigration vote would be “counterproductive,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) as the Senate adjourned for the night. As for Democrats’ push for a more firm immigration commitment from the GOP leader, Graham suggested McConnell’s Sunday night statement would have to suffice: “I assume if we get a deal, it will be more formal.”      Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who along with Graham is meeting with roughly 20 senators in both parties, said he hoped the group would meet again.      After not speaking on Saturday, McConnell and Schumer met privately for more than 30 minutes on Sunday. Schumer, however, did not talk to the president, an aide said.

Flake said the Senate needs to move independently of the White House at this point to resolve the confrontation that's produced the first shutdown in more than four years.      “The important thing is breaking with the White House on this and not relying on the White House to give its approval,\\" Flake said.      Despite his public thaw after two days of lashing Democrats, it remains to be seen whether McConnell can provide enough reassurance to Democrats to win their votes. Some Democrats said they need to know the House would take action on an immigration bill, too.      “We have to have in our own mind some way to ensure that the House feels a need to bring up the issue as well,” said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.).      The centrists are eager to end the brinkmanship that has erupted at the one-year mark of Donald Trump’s presidency. Democrats insist that any funding legislation extend Obama-era protections for undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, while Republicans have said they won’t negotiate on immigration until the government reopens.      The group of roughly 20 moderates includes Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Flake, Graham, Mark Warner (D-Va.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.).      Some liberals are still wary. They fear that Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) could repeat the exercise of 2013, when the Senate passed an immigration bill and the House didn't take it up.      “It depends on whether it’s part of a must-pass bill. That is my strong preference. The goal is to have the [DREAM] Act passed,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) in an interview. “I have no confidence, zero, in Paul Ryan bringing that bill to the floor.\\"      Republican leaders are also skeptical. They believe committing to an immigration vote would just throw Democrats a lifeline and prefer to negotiate on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program only after the government reopens.      “Does that mean if we have an agreement by [Feb.] 15 that that’s not good enough?” Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) said of the plan to hold an immigration vote by Feb. 8. “I just think people are nervous because they shut down the government and are looking for face-saving.”      Still, McConnell listened to the presentation by a group of GOP senators to allow such a vote by Feb. 8. He thanked those Republicans on the floor Sunday evening.      So far, House Republican leaders have rejected the idea of committing to holding an immigration vote on the House floor and are refusing to negotiate on anything beyond a three-week continuing resolution. Ryan said Sunday the House will accept a short-term bill through Feb. 8 but will commit only to an immigration bill “that the president supports to fix this problem.”      poster=\\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201801/526/1155968404_5716672082001_5716668620001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\\" true      Lawmakers had hoped to reach a deal before Monday, when federal employees would normally return to work, to lessen the impact of the shutdown.      Though negotiations in the Senate gained some traction, both parties continued to execute their public relations strategies. Democrats blasted Trump, blaming him for walking away from an immigration deal with Schumer on Friday that they say could have prevented the shutdown.      “How can you negotiate with the president under those circumstances where he agrees face-to-face to move forward with a certain path and then within two hours calls back and pulls the plug?” Durbin said on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.”      Schumer offered Trump support for the border wall in exchange for a deal to protect the nearly 700,000 so-called Dreamers facing deportation. But since then, Republicans and Democrats have publicly sparred over whether Schumer was offering full funding for the wall or not.      Republicans, meanwhile, accused Democrats of taking “hostages” in order to strong-arm the GOP into an immigration deal that has eluded Congress for years.      “This is the Democrats trying to hold our military hostage for an issue that has been with us for decades,” House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) said on ABC. “I think we need to resolve it — the president wants to resolve it — but you don’t do that in the middle of a shutdown.”      But even Republicans seemed uncomfortable defending a Trump campaign ad saying Democratic leaders would be “complicit” in murders committed by undocumented immigrants during the shutdown. Republican leaders know they will need Democratic cooperation to break the shutdown logjam.      “I don’t know if that’s necessarily productive,\\" Ryan said of the Trump ad.      So far, Trump has not called for a meeting with the “Big Four” congressional leaders — McConnell, Schumer, Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) — and Republicans on the Sunday news shows gave no indication he would do so. But White House legislative affairs director Marc Short said Trump has been in touch with GOP leaders throughout the weekend.      \\"The president has been involved,\\" Short said on NBC's \\"Meet the Press.\\" \\"Yesterday he was speaking to Leader McConnell, Leader Ryan. He also spoke to Kevin McCarthy.\\"      John Bresnahan and Rachael Bade contributed to this report.       |||||","output":"There's a problem with the White House's phone line right now.

Help as much as you can. What station played Läther?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Zappa's relationship with long-time manager Herb Cohen ended in 1976. Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands.

The extant members of this group are: dromedary camels, Bactrian camels, wild Bactrian camels, llamas, alpacas, vicuñas, and guanacos.  - Vicugna is a genus containing two South American camelids , the vicuña and the alpaca . Previously thought to be descended from the llama , the alpaca was reclassified as part of Vicugna after a 2001 paper on alpaca DNA . The paper showed that the alpaca is descended from the vicuña , not the guanaco .  - An alpaca (\\"Vicugna pacos\\") is a domesticated species of South American camelid. It resembles a small llama in appearance.  - The vicuña (\\"Vicugna vicugna\\") or vicugna (both ) is one of two wild South American camelids which live in the high alpine areas of the Andes, the other being the guanaco. It is a relative of the llama, and is now believed to be the wild ancestor of domesticated alpacas, which are raised for their coats. Vicuñas produce small amounts of extremely fine wool, which is very expensive because the animal can only be shorn every three years, and has to be caught from the wild. When knitted together, the product of the vicuña's wool is very soft and warm. The Inca valued vicuñas highly for their wool, and it was against the law for anyone but royalty to wear vicuña garments; today the vicuña is the national animal of Peru and appears in the Peruvian coat of arms.  - The llama (Lama glama) is a domesticated South American camelid, widely used as a meat and pack animal by Andean cultures since the Pre-Columbian era.  - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile.  - A camel is an even-toed ungulate within the genus Camelus, bearing distinctive fatty deposits known as \\"humps\\" on its back. The three surviving species of camel are the dromedary, or one-humped camel (\\"C. dromedarius\\"), which inhabits the Middle East and the Horn of Africa; the Bactrian, or two-humped camel (\\"C. bactrianus\\"), which inhabits Central Asia; and the critically endangered wild Bactrian camel (\\"C. ferus\\") that has limited populations in remote areas of northwest China and Mongolia. Bactrian camels take their name from the historical Bactria region of Central Asia (Yam & Khomeiri, 2015). Both the dromedary and the Bactrian camels have been domesticated; they provide milk, meat, hair for textiles or goods such as felted pouches, and are working animals with tasks ranging from human transport to bearing loads.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.

The plan was put forward after Gates came to London to watch the game between US teen player Ariel Hsing and Chinese Li Xiaoxia on Sunday, Sharara told Xinhua in an interview. Sharara didn't disclose the details, but said that Gates offered to help after watching Hsing's match, in which the 16-year-old girl nearly pulled off one of the biggest upsets in Olympic table tennis history, pushing No. 2 seed Li to the limit before losing 4-2 in six tight sets. \\"Gates was surprised to see the young American girl played so well.

Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The quiet coastal town of Midwich, California is invaded by an unseen force which leaves ten women mysteriously pregnant. Nine months later, the babies are born simultaneously on one night, except for one which is stillborn. At first, they all appear to be normal, but it does not take the parents long to realize that their children are anything but normal. As they grow older, the children are shown to have pale skin, platinum-white hair, fierce intellect and steely, cobalt eyes. The emotionless children display eerie psychic abilities and remarkable powers, which they use with deadly consequences, unleashing a reign of terror. When they actively use their mind-controlled powers, their irises or their entire eyes glow in different colours, mostly reddish-orange, but also green, yellow, violet, blue or pure white.There are some story differences from the earlier adaptation. In this version, the children \\"paired off\\", but one of the children, David (Thomas Dekker), loses his partner after she dies at birth. As a result, he shows human compassion while still resembling the other children and retaining some degree of psychic powers. This leads to him not fitting in well with the children. Their ruthless leader, Mara (Lindsey Haun) (\\"daughter\\" of a local doctor, Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve); her mother, Barbara (Karen Kahn), commits suicide by walking off an ocean cliff), considers him less important due to his expression of emotions.

I could smell the expensive Dior perfume as soon as I opened the door, which surprised me, because my mom was usually fastidious about not getting perfume on her clothes. She was wearing her bug glasses--huge dark things with lenses that bulged out like fly eyes and reflected my face like a fun-house mirror. She had tied a yellow silk scarf around her hair and was taking deep pulls on a cigarette held between two immaculately manicured fingers. Only I knew about the nicotine stains she carefully covered with her special order \\"forest sable\\" cream each morning. Tiffany, a stupid but vicious senator's daughter who I had the misfortune of sharing a classroom with, suddenly dashed from inside the school, her face flushed. \\"Hello, Mrs. Wilson,\\" she called.

Do you want to know about my staying in America? Well, to tell you the truth, it is really an eye-opening experience here. In China, I had English classes five times a week since Grade Five. But I didn't know textbook English could be so different from everyday English until I came to Hotchkiss School, Connecticut. When I first studied English, I was told to say \\"I'm fine.\\" when people say \\"How are you?\\" But in the USA, I found that people say \\"I'm good.\\" or \\"I'm tired.\\" One day, someone greeted   me with \\"What's up?\\" It made me _ I thought for a moment and then smiled because I didn't know what to say. Since then, I have learnt more and more differences between Chinese and American cultures. To my surprise, American girls spend a lot of time in the burning sun getting a tan  .

Context: The Department of Health and Human Services lost track of nearly 1,500 migrant children it placed with sponsors in the United States, an agency official told a Senate subcommittee Thursday. The children were taken into government care after they showed up alone at the Southwest border. Most of the children are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, and were fleeing drug cartels, gang violence and domestic abuse. The agency learned the 1,475 children could not be found after making follow-up calls to check on their safety, the committee was told. The news has raised concern that the children could fall into the hands of human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives. “You are the worst foster parents in the world. You don’t even know where they are,” said Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. “We are failing. I don’t think there is any doubt about it. And when we fail kids, that makes me angry.” Since the dramatic surge of border crossings in 2013, the federal government has placed more than 180,000 unaccompanied minors with parents or other adult sponsors who are expected to care for the children and help them attend school while they seek legal status in immigration court. An AP investigation in 2016 found that more than two dozen of those children had been sent to homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay. Since then, the Department Health and Human Services has boosted outreach to at-risk children deemed to need extra protection, and last year offered post-placement services to about one-third of unaccompanied minors. But advocates say it is hard to know how many minors may be in dangerous conditions, in part because some disappear before social workers can follow up with them, and they never show up in court. Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio gave HHS and the Department of Homeland Security until Monday to deliver a time frame for improving monitoring. “These kids, regardless of their immigration status, deserve to...

Question: Title: Fry's Dark Side Review: This is definately not the usual laugh out loud Fry novel. Still enjoyable! Fry definately has a gift for words...My only complaint is that I had a hard time being sympathetic with any of the main characters. Ned Maddstone, who were are supposed to root and feel sorry for, I think, actually becomes very unlikable after a time and the rest of the characters I was either neutraltowards or hated, such as Ashley Garland.Worth the read even if short on the laughs I'd come to expect after Moab is my Washpot. Fry is a mixed lot, and can apparently write a pretty serious novel too, complete with descriptions of an asylum, a bloodthirsting for revenge, and diabolical, and dirty politician whose sins have gone unpaid too long.

Q:Information:  - Folk music includes both traditional music and the genre that evolved from it during the 20th century folk revival. The term originated in the 19th century but is often applied to music that is older than that. Some types of folk music are also called world music. \\"Traditional folk music\\" has been defined in several ways: as music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers, or music performed by custom over a long period of time. It has been contrasted with commercial and classical styles.  - The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. It is headquartered at Broadcasting House in London, is the world's oldest national broadcasting organisation, and is the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees, with over 20,950 staff in total, of whom 16,672 are in public sector broadcasting; including part-time, flexible as well as fixed contract staff, the total number is 35,402.  - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.  - The V Shows is a live album/DVD recorded at the London Astoria by rock band Mostly Autumn. It was recorded on the tour supporting their 2003 release \\"Passengers\\". The DVD for this show was also included in their 2005 DVD release \\"Pink Floyd Revisited\\". Also, this is the first Mostly Autumn release to feature drummer Andrew Jennings.  - Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London. They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music. Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in the history of popular music.  - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards.  - Psychedelic music (sometimes psychedelia) covers a range of popular music styles and genres influenced by the 1960s psychedelic culture, a subculture of people who used psychedelic drugs such as LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, mescaline and DMT to experience visual and auditory hallucinations, synesthesia and altered states of consciousness. Psychedelic music attempted to replicate the hallucinogenic experience of using these drugs or enhance the experience of using them. Psychedelic music emerged during the mid-1960s among folk rock and blues rock bands in the United States and Britain.  - The London Astoria was a music venue, located at 157 Charing Cross Road, in London, England. It had been leased and run by Festival Republic since 2000. It was closed on 15 January 2009 and has since been demolished. The venue is still seen today as an iconic music establishment, as it helped to launch the careers of many British rock bands and also played a part in the UK success of many international acts. It was also a famous venue in Britain's LGBT scene, for holding London's biggest gay new year parties along with G-A-Y.  - Mostly Autumn are an English rock band. The group formed in 1995 and have built their reputation through constant touring, never signing to a major label. They produce music heavily influenced by 1970s progressive rock. According to the BBC, Mostly Autumn \\"fuse the music of Genesis and Pink Floyd with Celtic themes, hard rock and strong, emotional melodies\\". They have also been compared with other progressive bands such as Jethro Tull and Camel, blended with traditional folk music. Later albums also include more contemporary influences.  - Pink Floyd Revisited is a live DVD recorded by rock band Mostly Autumn in 2004 . This was a recording of a one - off concert at the Civic Hall in Stratford - Upon - Avon where they played a whole set of Pink Floyd covers . It was only available for a limited period of time and has become quite sought after by Mostly Autumn fans . The V Shows DVD was also included in the same box making it a double DVD set .

Article: Thorough medical knowledge and swift, accurate diagnoses are clearly important, but the well-being of patients relies on much more than merely that.  Taking the time to assess patient satisfaction means improving the communication between physicians and the patients they treat.  Surveys and similar assessment practices can make patients feel more listened to and cared for. This makes it easier for patients to trust their physicians and open up to medical staff about health issues. Patient satisfaction surveys also give medical practices an understanding of what they need to do to improve overall. This includes things like physical surroundings, timeliness of staff, duration of time taken to receive test results, waiting time, hand hygiene, friendliness of staff, etc. Conducting a patient satisfaction survey can be a good thing, but you need to make sure that everyone involved is interested in actively improving.  Everyone involved with your medical practice must be brought on board. This includes those actively involved with patients (physicians, nurses, nursing assistants, other office staff) as well as those who run things behind the scenes. Quality work must be at the center of your practice's mission and vision. Keep in mind that patients have lots of choices when it comes to healthcare, so make sure that all of your staff members understand the importance of maintaining and enhancing patient satisfaction. Determine how much you can afford to spend on this project before you embark on it. The rest of your decisions concerning the project will need to be based on that figure.  Customer satisfaction surveys that are operated completely in-house are much more affordable in monetary terms, but they will require a greater time investment. Most large healthcare corporations hire large healthcare satisfaction companies to asses patient satisfaction. This allows for objective studies without any bias associated with the results. Conducting a survey through an outside vendor will save time, but it will cost you more money. Expect to pay at least 300 to 400 per physician if your practice has at least three physicians associated with it.  You also need to consider the cost of analysis. If you are confident that someone in the practice has the time and skill to analyze the results quantitatively and accurately, you can save money by doing this in-house. If this isn't the case, though, you will need to outsource the analysis of results to a firm that specializes in the analysis of healthcare related data. Written surveys are the most popular and, under most circumstances, the most accurate.  Other options used can include phone surveys, focus groups, and personal interviews. The areas you assess will be the same regardless of the tool you decide on, even though the exact questions you might ask could vary between formats. The right choice mostly depends on cost and practicality for your specific circumstances. Make sure that all of your staff and professional colleagues know what to expect from the survey.  Explain your reasons for embarking on a patient satisfaction assessment. These may include improvement in performance, timeliness, physical aesthetics, reception staff impression. etc. Point out that patients deserve to have a say in provider performance. Also, mention that patients may comment on any aspect of care, from check-in to following up with test results. Also point out that it is important to be consistent with quality care and to ensure that everyone is following protocols, policies, and national guidelines. Also explain how the results will be evaluated and acted upon. This step will need to be done continually throughout the entire process. In other words, everyone involved should be kept updated from start to finish. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article is that patient satisfaction is an essential aspect of healthcare, and it goes beyond accurate diagnoses and medical knowledge. Implementing patient satisfaction surveys helps improve communication and trust between patients and healthcare providers. To conduct such surveys, it's crucial to involve the entire medical practice team and ensure everyone's commitment to improvement. Costs associated with conducting these surveys and analyzing the results need to be considered and should influence the chosen methods, such as written surveys, phone surveys, focus groups, or personal interviews. Keeping the staff informed about the survey's objectives and goals, as well as consistently updating them about the process, can lead to better outcomes and overall improvements in patient care and satisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.  Question: \\"Who was the first emperor to notice the commercial potential to Melaka?\\" Answer: \\"Emperor Chu Ti\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Yes, the answer \\"Emperor Chu Ti\\" is correct. According to the paragraph, in 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. This shows that Emperor Chu Ti was the first emperor to notice the commercial potential of Melaka."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I've been in some of the grandest houses in America, and it's readily apparent that no one lives there. Earlier this year, I had dinner in a mud hut in Ethiopia, where we sat on chairs next to the hostess's bed --- a home that had more warmth than any house I've been in since. Now John Edwards is exploring what makes a house a home in his just-released Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. There Edwards writes, \\"This is a book about homes, the values they rest on, the dreams they are filled with, and the people they have shaped. The houses and circumstances are different, but much of what you find inside will be familiar.\\"  Whether you're sitting in an airport right now, waiting to fly to your childhood home for Thanksgiving, or in your own home waiting for the  s to arrive, you know what he's talking about.   We've lived in our townhouse for 21 years. The loose windows make noise in the wind. The fireplace is so shallow it holds only one log. The kitchen window offers a view of the world passing by. It's where friends sit on the kitchen counter drinking wine while dinner is being fixed. I lived there for only 18 years, but it will always be my true home. Even the lamp in the west living room window, which I could see far down the road when driving home late at night, still shines.     While all this talk about childhood memories can be warm and comforting, home is whom you're with, not where you are. As Edwards writes, \\"Home is family. Home is safety.

After several small tests to determine Rodrigo's trustworthiness, he suggests a partnership, to which Rodrigo quickly agrees. Although Rodrigo distrusts Richard greatly, he agrees to partner him on a gigantic scam, provided he gets a percentage of the money gained to help his ailing father, who is in trouble because of his gambling debts.

The feed was launched just over a month ago as part of a promotional push for their upcoming movie, \\"Muppets Most Wanted.\\" But in between quippy posters and ads for the film, which is a sequel to 2011's blockbuster \\"The Muppets\\" with Jason Segel, there are ingenious \\"selfies\\" from the Muppets crew. In fact, the first post was a coy snapshot from Kermit, Miss Piggy and Gonzo, with a filter in full effect: And the selfies grew more adorable -- and more hilarious -- from there: We now have evidence of the time Animal burst in on Beaker in the bathroom. And we know what Gonzo does after a hard day of stunts. \\"Gonzo treated himself to a massage today to try to work out all of his stuntman kinks. Even weirdos need pampering. #bougielife #yolo,\\" reads the caption to this pic: The Muppets' curmudgeonly yet lovable critics, Statler and Waldorf, are still trying to get the hang of taking the perfect selfie -- \\"This is the fanciest calculator we've ever seen!\\" they were heard saying when the photo was taken -- while Rowlf is clearly a selfie king. From the Swedish Chef to Miss Piggy's evil alter ego, everyone has gotten in on the first-person photo sessions.

Would \\"This was expanded when Ireland entered the European Economic Community in 1972.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"Ireland's journey to becoming a republic has a complex history that can be traced back to various events, leading up to the official declaration of the Republic of Ireland in 1949. The roots of the Irish republican movement date back to the late 18th century when organizations such as the Society of United Irishmen sought to break free from British rule. However, the decisive moment began with the 1916 Easter Rising, a week-long rebellion against British occupation. Although the uprising was suppressed in just a few days, it played a pivotal role in igniting the Irish War of Independence (1919-1921). Following the war, the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 led to the formation of the Irish Free State, a 26-county dominion within the British Commonwealth that exercised its powers between 1922 and 1937. This arrangement, however, did not satisfy the demands of Irish republicans, as the Free State still maintained some allegiance to the British Crown. Subsequently, in 1937, the new constitution, known as Bunreacht na hÉireann, introduced the term \\"Éire\\" and redefined the state's internal and external relations. Although it did not explicitly declare Ireland as a republic, it removed most links to the British monarchy, increasing its political autonomy. Finally, on April 18, 1949, the Republic of Ireland Act of 1948 came into effect, and Ireland was officially declared a republic, cutting all remaining ties with the British monarchy. This marked the formal end of Ireland's status as a British dominion and laid the foundation for its present-day status as a sovereign, democratic republic. As for your suggested sentence, it is worth noting that the implications of the Republic of Ireland's entry into the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973 are unrelated to the declaration of the republic in 1949. The entry into the EEC was indeed an expansion and further integration of Ireland into the European economy and political landscape. However, it would not be considered a direct continuation of the process of becoming a republic that occurred several decades earlier. Instead, Ireland's EEC membership might be better framed as a milestone in its economic and political development post-republic status."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a \\"b.\\" movie review (Available choices: a. negative b. positive).","output":"Title: \\"Invasion of the Cosmic Avocados\\" Review: A Breathtaking Journey Through Space and Absurdity B-movies have a long-standing tradition of campiness, hyperbolized drama, and borderline ridiculous storylines. Among the pantheon of these cult classics, few stand out as genuinely extraordinary – but the largely overlooked \\"Invasion of the Cosmic Avocados\\" is one exception. \\"Invasion of the Cosmic Avocados\\" is a delightful interstellar romp that pays homage to the golden age of cheesy science fiction. It explores an improbable universe where gigantic avocados from space threaten to destroy planet Earth, and a group of quirky, misfit heroes must band together to fend off the extraterrestrial menace. The film opens with stunning shots of outer space, boasting surprisingly impressive special effects that instantly capture the viewer's attention. The looming celestial bodies, coupled with the intoxicating synthesized score, paints a vivid and otherworldly picture that sets the stage for the adventure to come. As the malicious avocados descend from the heavens, the audience can't help but be drawn into the absurd but endearing narrative. Our heroes, united by fate and their shared love of intergalactic danger, represent a colorful cast of characters that bring life and levity to the film. The group is led by the fearless Captain Max Rocketman (played with great charisma by Jack McFlash), a square-jawed hero with delusions of grandeur as large as his actual heroics. Accidentally roping in the brilliant but bumbling scientist, Dr. Melvin Theorist (played with delightful neurotic energy by Buddy Crimson), Captain Rocketman's plan to thwart the cosmic invasion quickly spirals into a wild and unpredictable farce. Rounding out the eclectic crew, we have Max's long-suffering yet capable girlfriend, Sally Teaspoon (played by the charming Mandy Mystery) and a wisecracking extraterrestrial pilot, Zippo XJ-3 (voiced by the talented Norman Nerve, whose hilarious quips and one-liners provide ample comic relief). Together, this team of unlikely heroes embarks on a journey filled with unexpected challenges, twists, and turns. While the overall plot can certainly be described as ludicrous – enormous space avocados bent on world domination is certainly no everyday fare – it is the unapologetic embrace of this silliness that makes \\"Invasion of the Cosmic Avocados\\" so utterly enjoyable. The sheer dedication of the cast and crew to fully exploring this bizarre premise is nothing short of inspiring. The cinematography, which seamlessly blends practical effects with CGI, allows the movie to maintain a visual flair that is as captivating as it is campy. Meanwhile, the witty and well-paced script keeps the action flowing, and the tongue-in-cheek humor ensures that no opportunity for comedic excess is missed. The climax of \\"Invasion of the Cosmic Avocados\\" is a satisfying and exhilarating spectacle that perfectly encapsulates what makes the B-movie subgenre so endearing to fans: earnest performances, absurd storylines, and an unwavering commitment to reveling in the strange and imaginative. In conclusion, \\"Invasion of the Cosmic Avocados\\" is a delightful and entertaining gem of B-movie cinema. Embracing its absurd premise with gusto and unabashed enthusiasm, the film serves up a unique, engaging, and adventurous experience that begs to be watched with a group of friends and a hearty sense of humor. While it may not conform to the standards of traditional filmmaking, \\"Invasion of the Cosmic Avocados\\" is an undeniably joyous experience that harks back to a time when imagination knew no bounds. Highly recommended for those who enjoy the peculiar, the outlandish, and the wonderfully campy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So I said to myself one day, “let me take a walk to the park and have this situation out with myself once and for all.” Two blocks from my house was this wonderful neo classical park with beautiful stairs leading from level to level. I walked up and down the stairs and basically said to myself “this was a failure. I am having a failure experience. But I have a choice of how I look at this.

At a higher level are areas in the midbrain, such as the red nucleus, which is responsible for coordinating movements of the arms and legs. At a higher level yet is the primary motor cortex, a strip of tissue located at the posterior edge of the frontal lobe. The primary motor cortex sends projections to the subcortical motor areas, but also sends a massive projection directly to the spinal cord, through the pyramidal tract.

The Insular Celtic languages of the Goidelic sub-group (Irish, Manx and Scottish Gaelic) and the Brittonic sub-group (Cornish, Welsh and Breton, spoken in north-western France) are the only remaining Celtic languages—the last of their continental relations becoming extinct before the 7th century. The Norman languages of Guernésiais, Jèrriais and Sarkese spoken in the Channel Islands are similar to French. A cant, called Shelta, is spoken by Irish Travellers, often as a means to conceal meaning from those outside the group. However, English, sometimes in the form of Scots, is the dominant language, with few monoglots remaining in the other languages of the region. The Norn language of Orkney and Shetland became extinct around 1880. Question: What are the remaining Cetic languages that are still used today?","output":"The remaining Celtic languages that are still used today belong to the Insular Celtic languages group, which consists of two sub-groups: the Goidelic sub-group and the Brittonic sub-group.  1. Goidelic sub-group:    a. Irish (also known as Irish Gaelic): Spoken mainly in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, with an estimated 1.7 million speakers. Irish is recognized as an official language in the Republic of Ireland and is taught in schools.    b. Manx (Manx Gaelic): Indigenous to the Isle of Man, the language saw a decline in the 20th century, but efforts have been made to revive it, including the establishment of a Manx language school. The number of Manx speakers is small, but it continues to grow.    c. Scottish Gaelic: Primarily spoken in the Highlands and the Western Isles of Scotland, Scottish Gaelic is estimated to have around 58,000 speakers. It is an officially recognized language in Scotland, and there are programs and initiatives to promote and preserve the language. 2. Brittonic sub-group:    a. Cornish: Once considered extinct, Cornish experienced a revitalization in the 20th century. Spoken mainly in Cornwall, the number of Cornish speakers is relatively small but growing, with efforts in place to promote the language.    b. Welsh: Spoken mainly in Wales, Welsh is the most widely spoken Celtic language, with approximately 900,000 speakers. It is an officially recognized language in Wales, being used in administration, education, and media. Welsh-medium education is also provided in schools.    c. Breton: Primarily spoken in the Brittany region of north-western France, Breton has around 200,000 speakers. Although not recognized as an official language by the French government, efforts are being made to preserve and promote the language, including the establishment of bilingual schools. These six languages constitute the remaining Celtic languages that are still in use today, with various degrees of vitality and support from their respective communities and governments.

I looked into a keypad accessory, but no accessories are available for such an old model. As a result, I decided to upgrade and pulled the trigger on two of these openers. This product is five star fantastic. Quality product that is smoother, quieter, brighter (two 100W bulbs), and just a giant leap forward for everyone in our household to use. I researched and shopped around and no one beats Amazon on this. It's laughable to see people paying 20 - 50 more (higher price, sales taxes, shipping, etc.) from other online retailers or brick and mortar big box home improvement stores like it's still 1993.

Question: Given the following context:  Sam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \\"Death doesn't like to be cheated,\\" and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense. Later, Candice goes to the gym to practice with Peter, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge, and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand. She manages to free herself just as Sam and Molly arrive to save her, but trips and falls out of the window onto a car below. Later, Sam learns that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge, and realize that Nathan is next.  answer the following question:  Who is Jim Block going to watch? Answer:","output":"Jim Block, the FBI agent, is going to watch Sam Lawton. He doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse but promises to keep an eye on him after Sam's premonition about the bridge collapsing comes true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Article: A blind baby is doubly handicapped. Not only is it unable to see, but because it cannot receive the visual stimulus from its environment that a sighted child does, it is likely to be slow in intellectual development. Now the ten-month old son of Dr. and Mrs. Dennis Daughters is the subject of an unusual psychological experiment designed to prevent a lag in the learning process. With the aid of a sonar-type electronic that he wears on his head, infant  Dennis is learning to identify the people and objects in the world around him by means of echoes . The device is an improvement of the \\"Sonicguide\\", an instrument produced by Telesensory Systems, Inc., of Palo Alto, Calif, and used by blind adults in addition to a smart or guide dog. As adapted for Dennis, it consists of a battery-powered system about the size of a half dollar that is on a headgear. A transmitter sends out an ultrasonic  pulse that creates an 80 degree cone of sound at 6 feet. Echoes from objects within the cone are perceived (felt) as sounds that vary in pitch  and volume  with the size and distance of the object. The closer an object is, the lower the pitch, and the larger the object, the louder the signal. Hard surfaces produce a sharp ping, while soft ones send back signals with a slightly fuzzy quality. An object slightly to the right of Denny's sends back a louder sound to his right ear than to the left. Thus , by simply moving his head right and left and up and down, he can not only locate an object but also get some notion of its shape and size, thanks to the varying qualities of sounds reaching his ears as the cone of ultrasound  passes _ . Dennis likes to use the device to play a kind of peek-a-boo with his mother. Standing on her knee and facing her directly, he receives a strong signal in both ears. By turning his head away, he makes her seem to disappear. \\"From the first time he wore it,\\" says Mrs. Daughters, \\"it was like a light going on in his head.\\" What remains to be determined is how well the device will help Dennis cope with... Question: What can we learn about infant Dennis' device? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Its first design was designed for blind adults.\\"?

The tax firm helps people who have disputes with the IRS. It spends some 9 million a year on radio advertising, according to ratings firm Nielsen, and its website carries endorsement from conservative talk radio personalities Glenn Beck, Sean Hannity, as well as Limbaugh himself.      \\"You don't need to fight this fight alone,\\" Limbaugh is quoted as saying on the Tax Resolution site. His endorsement was still up on Tax Resolution's site on Monday afternoon.      CEO Michael Rozbruch said the statement about dropping Limbaugh was easily issued _ but changing the website will require a meeting later in the week.      Limbaugh apologized over the weekend for his comments about Georgetown law student Sandra Fluke after she testified to congressional Democrats that her Jesuit college's health plan should cover her birth control.      KPUA, an AM station in Hilo, Hawaii, said it is dropping Limbaugh's show immediately.

His on-air contract runs through 2016.      Premiere Radio said in a statement Monday that it respects Limbaugh's right to express his opinions.

The advertisers that have backed away from Limbaugh's program represent a broad range of industries, from technology to financial services to retailers.      AOL, an Internet portal that runs the TechCrunch blog and the Huffington Post, said Monday that Limbaugh's comments \\"are not in line with our values.\\"      Other companies that say they have left the show include flower delivery service ProFlowers, mortgage lender Quicken Loans, the maker of Sleep Number beds, mattress retailer Sleep Train, software maker Citrix Systems Inc., online data backup service provider Carbonite and online legal document services company LegalZoom.

No more districts have been taken over since then, but there are currently three under state leadership: Lawrence, Holyoke and the most recent, Southbridge, a town of about 16,000 people in the central part of the state, on the border with Connecticut. ||||| Following the nationwide uproar over Rush Limbaugh‘s controversial comments about Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke, Hilo, Hawaii’s KPUA-AM 670 has decided to drop his program.      “It may be the first radio station nationally to cancel airings of the program,” the Honolulu Star-Advertiser’s Erika Engle reports. “Regardless of the political views being discussed, New West Broadcasting Corp. President and General Manger Chris Leonard felt the initially degrading comments about Georgetown University student Sandra Fluke, and the escalating comments that followed, were ‘egregious,’ and that ‘decency and responsibility’ dictated the show’s cancellation.”      “I spent a good part of the weekend deliberating this issue,” Leonard said. “Had this been one of my disc jockeys that had made this comment, they would have been terminated.”      Leonard explained further why he felt the show had to be taken off the air:      “We have always encouraged spirited discussion about national and local issues on KPUA and from time to time those discussions may be deemed by some to be objectionable. We are strong believers in the first amendment and have recognized Mr. Limbaugh’s right to express opinions that often times differ from our own, but it has never been our goal to allow our station to be used for personal attacks and intolerance. The most recent incident has crossed a line of decency and a standard that we expect of programming on KPUA whether it is locally produced or a syndicated program like the Rush Limbaugh show. While much of the national debate regarding this issue is now being framed in political terms, the decision for us is one of decency and responsibility. Regardless of one’s political views on the issue being discussed, we feel the delivery was degrading and the continued comments over several days to be egregious. As a result, we are discontinuing the Rush Limbaugh program on KPUA effective immediately.”      UPDATE: Another radio station in Pittsfield, Massachusetts– WBEC– also says it is dropping the Rush Limbaugh show.      WBEC’s General Manager Peter Barry says his station hadn’t yet lost any advertisers as a result of Rush’s comments, and no more than a handful of callers had voiced complaints. But he says over the years he and station staff have grown increasingly uncomfortable with Limbaugh’s rhetoric. “The nature of Rush’s programming has always presented challenges for us and he’s always pushed the envelope. But this time he’s taken it too far.”      (h/t HSA)      Editor’s note: This post has been edited since its original posting – Jon Nicosia ||||| By Erika Engle      and Associated Press      The nationally syndicated Rush Limbaugh radio show has been pulled from Hilo radio station KPUA-AM 670 in the aftermath of his offensive remarks about a woman who spoke in favor of health plan coverage for contraception.

Options:  A. accomplishment  B. injuries  C. enemies  D. rivalry  E. death Answer:","output":"A. Accomplishment People compete in sports primarily for a sense of accomplishment and numerous other reasons that offer both physical and psychological benefits. Sports offer a platform for individuals to challenge themselves, improve their skills, and showcase their talents. Participation in sports provides opportunities for personal growth, building character, and developing social skills. Here is an in-depth analysis of why people compete in sports: 1. Personal achievement: Sports enable people to set goals, work hard, and achieve their objectives. The feeling of accomplishment that comes with breaking one's own records or surpassing rivals can be highly gratifying and fulfilling. 2. Physical fitness: Engaging in sports promotes physical fitness and overall health. The rigorous training and conditioning regimens help to develop strength, flexibility, and stamina. Consequently, people who compete in sports tend to have improved cardiovascular and immune systems, reduced body fat, and increased muscle mass. 3. Stress relief: The physical exertion and mental focus required during sports competition can help relieve stress and serve as an emotional outlet. Engaging in sports helps clear one's mind, release tension, and reduce anxiety. As a result, people who participate in sports often experience overall improvements in their mental health. 4. Skill development: Sports encourage the development of physical techniques and strategic thinking, making people more proficient in their chosen disciplines. Athletes gain self-confidence from successfully executing difficult moves or overcoming challenges, which can translate into success in other areas of life. 5. Social connections: Sports provide endless opportunities for people to build relationships and establish social networks. Team sports encourage camaraderie, friendship, and a sense of community among participants, as they work together towards a common goal. Even individual sports offer a platform for connections, as rivals can forge friendships through mutual respect and admiration. 6. Discipline and time-management: Sports demand regular training, focus, and commitment. Over time, these requirements help athletes build self-discipline, organization, and time-management skills. These traits not only contribute to athletes' success in sports but also benefit them in other aspects of life, such as school or work. 7. Recognition and rewards: Successful athletes often receive recognition and accolades, which can boost their self-esteem and standing among their peers. Additionally, many sports offer valuable prizes for top performers, which can motivate athletes to strive for excellence. 8. Academic and career prospects: Many colleges and universities scout promising athletes and provide scholarships for those who excel in sports. These opportunities can pave the way for successful academic pursuits and future careers, in and outside of the field of athletics. In conclusion, people compete in sports to achieve a sense of accomplishment, improve their physical and mental health, develop skills, and cultivate social connections. Sports foster discipline, teamwork, and focus, providing an avenue for personal growth and opportunities that extend beyond the playing field. Consequently, the desire to compete in sports is not only fueled by the innate drive to excel but also by the plethora of benefits athletes garner in their personal, social, and professional lives."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Information:  - A short film is any film not long enough to be considered a feature film.

I don't know if there have been different releases and updates, but the disks we rented had a 2000 copyright on them, if that means anything. Anyway, the sound mixing on these DVD's was absolutely horrible. The levels often yo-yo-ed up and down; when the scene cut to a battlefield panorama, the orchestral track would thunder so loudly that I didn't know which would blow out first -- my eardrums or my speakers. When it was time for dialog, the volume would usually drop to something barely audible. Occasionally, the orchestra and Foley-work would stay loud while the dialog was superimposed at a much lesser level. My wife and I found that the only way we could watch this movie at all from these DVD's was if one of us kept a hand on the remote to continuously modulate the volume. And, like another user has already commented, when we selected English audio the dialog kept switching back and forth between Russian and English; and occasionally when the characters spoke in French on the native track the dubbing was in Russian, so you're SOL if you understand neither.

That's the DNA report my sister got from Ancestry.com. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they focus on different subjects. The first question revolves around the \\"European Jewish\\" component of your sister's DNA results on AncestryDNA.com, while the second question inquires about the possibility of having zero Native American blood if your great grandfather was full Cherokee. To address the first question, the \\"European Jewish\\" component found in your sister's DNA results on AncestryDNA.com refers to the genetic lineage tied to Jewish populations primarily from Central and Eastern Europe. These populations, known as Ashkenazi Jews, have a long history that spans over a thousand years. Their origin traces back to the ancient Israelites in the Levant (the geographical region that includes present-day Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan, and parts of Syria). The Jewish diaspora, a series of migrations and dispersals throughout various regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa, has led to different groups of Jewish populations forming distinct genetic markers. The Ashkenazi Jewish population, in particular, experienced a significant growth in Central and Eastern Europe during the late Middle Ages. Over time, the Ashkenazim have developed unique genetic characteristics due to a combination of endogamy (marrying within their own communities), founder effects (a small number of initial settlers contributing to the gene pool), and population bottlenecks (a temporary reduction in population size, limiting genetic diversity). As a result, the \\"European Jewish\\" designation in your sister's DNA results points to her having a genetic connection, albeit potentially distant, to this specific Jewish population. As for the second question, regarding the possibility of having zero Native American blood despite having a great-grandfather who was full Cherokee, the answer is not straightforward. DNA inheritance is complex due to the nature of the recombination process that occurs when genetic material is passed down from one generation to another. During the formation of an individual's chromosomes, a random reshuffling of genetic information happens, resulting in children receiving a combination of DNA from both of their parents in an unpredictable manner. While it might seem surprising, it is possible for an individual to inherit little or no DNA from their great-grandparents. Generally, the further back in the family tree, the higher the chances of an ancestor's DNA \\"washing out\\" or becoming undetectable. In the case of your sister's AncestryDNA.com report showing zero Native American ancestry, it is plausible that due to the random and complex nature of DNA inheritance, she did not inherit a detectable amount of Cherokee DNA from her great-grandfather. However, it is important to note that DNA tests offered by various companies have varying levels of accuracy and depend on the size and diversity of their reference populations. Different companies may yield slightly different results for the same individual. It might be helpful to test with another reputable company or confirm your family's historical records to have a more comprehensive understanding of your sister's ancestry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The venture, financed by John Quiller Rowett, is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier.  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the person that had to change plans when money was withheld?

For bigger rivers (e.g. B). Coir netting can be purchased online or from specialty landscaping and yardwork stores. Depending on the climate conditions in your area, coir netting can last from 24 to 48 months. C). If the water flow is moderate (0 %), bring the netting to a local bank. The netting holds water in, preventing it from coming out. D). Find coir netting at a local hardware store or online. Mix a strong capful of regular super dish dish soap into the water and you're ready to work.","output":"B). Coir netting can be purchased online or from specialty landscaping and yardwork stores. Depending on the climate conditions in your area, coir netting can last from 24 to 48 months. The use of coir netting is an effective method to control erosion on river banks. This biodegradable and environmentally friendly solution helps to stabilize the soil, allow vegetation growth, and prevent soil from being washed away by the water flow. Additionally, coir netting acts as a barrier against water, reducing the impact of waves and currents on the river banks. To stop erosion on a river bank using coir netting, follow these steps: 1. Assess the erosional problem: Take note of the size of the area experiencing erosion, the slope of the land, the type of soil, and the severity of the erosion. This information will help you determine the appropriate coir netting weight (700-900 gsm) to be used, as well as whether normal or heavy-duty netting is required. 2. Prepare the site: Remove any debris or large rocks from the eroded area. This will ensure that the coir netting will make proper contact with the soil. You may also need to grade the land or install a drainage system to manage water flow effectively. 3. Purchase the coir netting: Choose the appropriate coir netting for your project based on the size of the area, the type of soil, and the severity of the erosion. As mentioned earlier, coir netting can be purchased online or from specialty landscaping and yardwork stores. 4. Install the coir netting: Unroll the coir netting perpendicular to the water flow, starting from the upper portion of the river bank and moving towards the water. Make sure to anchor the netting firmly into the ground using landscape staples or stakes, maintaining a tight and even tension along the surface of the soil. Overlap the edges of the netting to create a more robust barrier against erosion. 5. Plant vegetation: To further reinforce the stability of the river bank, consider planting native plants or grasses. The roots of these plants will help to bind the soil together and create a more solid structure, reducing the chances of erosion. Make sure to choose plants that can thrive in wet conditions and are compatible with the local ecosystem. 6. Monitor and maintain: Periodically check the coir netting to ensure that it remains effectively anchored and is not damaged by any external factors. Repair or replace any sections of netting that show signs of wear. Additionally, monitor the growth of the vegetation planted earlier and remove any invasive species that may hinder the growth of native plants. By following these steps and using coir netting as a solution, you can successfully stop erosion on river banks and promote stability, ultimately protecting the surrounding environment and preventing further damage to the river ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on \\"report cites cuts as cause of errors accidents\\" Text:","output":"Title: Comprehensive Report Identifies Budget Cuts as the Primary Cause of Errors and Accidents Introduction: The recent Comprehensive Report on Errors and Accidents, published by the National Safety and Accident Analysis Institute (NSAAI), has identified significant budget cuts across various industries as the main cause of errors and accidents in the workplace. The findings of this report showcase the stark reality of the risks that budget constraints can impose on the safety and well-being of workers, businesses, and the general public. The adverse impact on infrastructure maintenance, employee training, and overall operational efficiency has led to lowered safety standards and increased mishaps in several sectors. Budget Cuts and Their Implications: Over the past decade, both private and public organizations have been forced to reassess their finances and implement cost-cutting measures. Despite the potential economic benefits of these cost-saving strategies, a considerable downside has become clear from the NSAAI's research: reduced funding is leading to inadequate maintenance, poor training, and a lack of accountability, ultimately leading to a growing number of accidents and errors. Inadequate Maintenance: One of the most significant findings of the report is the decline in infrastructure maintenance due to budget cuts. In the transportation sector, for instance, roads, bridges, and railways have faced diminished maintenance budgets, leaving them increasingly susceptible to accidents. Structural issues, such as corroding bridges and potholes on roads, have not only put the lives of commuters at risk but also contributed to long-term wear and tear on vehicles, increasing the likelihood of accidents and injuries. Similarly, industrial sectors have seen a surge in equipment malfunctions and breakdowns due to a lack of necessary maintenance. In power plants, oil refineries, and manufacturing facilities, reduced investment in safety checks and proactive maintenance has led to increased potential for catastrophic failures, putting both workers and local communities at risk. Insufficient Training: The report also highlights the negative impact of budget cuts on employee training. Companies and government organizations that reduce their investment in training have left staff inadequately equipped to handle problems and emergencies. This skill gap often accounts for errors in judgment and actions, which can lead to accidents or dangerous situations. For instance, a lack of proper training in the construction industry can result in workers failing to follow essential safety protocols, while in the medical sector, it can lead to an increase in medical errors and patient injuries. Public service organizations, such as firefighting and law enforcement agencies, can also suffer from poor training - a risk factor that can pose serious harm not only to these professionals but also to the communities they serve. Lack of Accountability: The NSAAI report emphasizes that the repercussions of budget cuts extend beyond material resources and training; they also harm organizational accountability and oversight. When financial limitations force staff reductions or stretch the responsibilities of remaining employees too thin, little to no room is left for effective supervision or the proper enforcement of safety standards. Numerous overlooked errors, non-adherence to best practices, and undocumented safety violations can culminate in accidents that could have been avoided with sufficient resources and active monitoring of procedures. Conclusion: The Comprehensive Report on Errors and Accidents underscores the dangers associated with budget cuts, which negatively impact infrastructure maintenance, employee training, and organizational accountability. In order to mitigate the risk of errors and accidents, both private businesses and public organizations must reconsider their cost-saving measures and prioritize investments that support safer working conditions and a stronger infrastructure. This renewed focus on safety will not only help reduce the potential for accidents but also contribute to a healthier economy and improved public welfare for everyone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Explosions erupted in Tripoli for a second consecutive night Wednesday into Thursday morning as NATO jets struck a vocational secondary school, a Libyan government official said. \\"We're not in a position to independently confirm that allegation,\\" a NATO official said. The attacks got under way hours after a Pentagon spokesman acknowledged that the United States is providing munitions for allies to use in the air campaign against Libya. \\"We have provided material support, including munitions, to allies and partners engaged in operations in Libya,\\" Col. Dave Lapan said in a statement. But, as President Barack Obama warned Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi on Wednesday that there would be \\"no letup\\" in NATO airstrikes, Russia lashed out against the air campaign, calling the bombing of certain Tripoli targets a \\"flagrant deviation\\" from the United Nations mandate.

This statement highlights the primary goal of NATO's intervention in Libya, which is to safeguard the civilian population from the violent actions carried out by Gadhafi's forces. By focusing on Gadhafi's capabilities, President Obama underscores the need to dismantle the oppressive regime that has been causing immense suffering to the Libyan people. The airstrikes and support provided by NATO members, including the United States, are aimed at weakening Gadhafi's authoritarian grip on the nation, thus allowing for a safer environment for civilians and the emergence of a more democratic and stable political landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to German: The long period of retention of data in the United States also continues to be a problem.","output":"Die lange Dauer der Datenspeicherung in den Vereinigten Staaten stellt nach wie vor ein Problem dar.  Let's break down the translation: 1. \\"The long period of retention\\" is translated to \\"Die lange Dauer der Datenspeicherung\\". In this context, \\"retention\\" refers to the act of keeping or storing something, and in German, this is best expressed through the term \\"Datenspeicherung\\" (data storage). The phrase \\"long period of\\" is translated to \\"lange Dauer\\" which means 'long duration'. 2. \\"of data\\" is translated to \\"der Daten\\". In English, the preposition \\"of\\" typically translates to \\"von\\" in German. However, in the context of ownership or belonging, the genitive case is often used in German. So, \\"of data\\" becomes \\"der Daten\\". 3. “in the United States” is translated to \\"in den Vereinigten Staaten\\". The United States is \\"die Vereinigten Staaten\\" in German. However, when a country name is preceded by the preposition \\"in\\" indicating location, the name usually takes the dative case in German. And in the dative case, the definite article \\"die\\" changes to \\"den\\". So, \\"in the United States\\" becomes \\"in den Vereinigten Staaten\\". 4. \\"also continues\\" is translated to \\"stellt nach wie vor\\". Literally, \\"also\\" is translated  as \\"auch\\" and \\"continues\\" as \\"fortsetzen\\". However, the phrase \\"also continues\\" isn't as commonly used in German as it is in English. The idiom \\"nach wie vor\\" covers the same meaning and is more idiomatic in German. 5. “to be a problem” is translated to \\"ein Problem dar\\". In German, the verb “darstellen” is often used to express the English “to be” when used in the sense of constituting or representing something. So “to be a problem” translates to “ein Problem darstellen”, but it’s more usual in German to put the verb at the end of the sentence, hence “ein Problem dar”. So, putting it all together: \\"The long period of retention of data in the United States also continues to be a problem\\" translates to \\"Die lange Dauer der Datenspeicherung in den Vereinigten Staaten stellt nach wie vor ein Problem dar.\\" in German."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

How to look like a rocker  Find the right bottoms.  Looking like a rocker is all about finding the right combination for an outfit, and a large part of that is picking a pair of bottoms-such as pants or skirts.  Jeans, especially ripped and worn ones, are an excellent choice for most rocker outfits, no matter what subgenre you're going for.","output":"Choose the appropriate top. After selecting the right bottoms, the next step in looking like a rocker is choosing an appropriate top to complement your jeans or skirt.  1.

Leather jackets: A well-fitted leather jacket can significantly enhance your rocker look, as it adds an edgy and rebellious touch. Look for jackets with zippers, studs, or other hardware that amplifies the rock vibe. 3. Layered clothing: Rockers are known for layering their outfits with items like flannel shirts, vests, cardigans, or denim jackets. This approach not only adds visual interest to your outfit but also allows you to adjust your look based on the weather and venue. 4.

In March 2017, NFL team owners voted nearly unanimously to approve the Raiders' relocation from Oakland to Las Vegas, with 31 owners voting in favor and only one opposing. This decision led to the construction of the currently named Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada, which is designed to serve as the home stadium for both the Las Vegas Raiders and the UNLV Rebels football team. The move to Las Vegas was completed in 2020, and the Raiders played their inaugural home game at Allegiant Stadium on September 21, 2020.

The state-of-the-art facility features a translucent roof, a large retractable wall facing the Las Vegas Strip, and a natural grass field for the UNLV Rebels football team to use while the Raiders play on an artificial turf surface.  As the relocation of the Raiders from Oakland to Las Vegas marks the arrival of the first major professional sports team in the city, it is quite a significant and historical event.

Total shocker on \\"The Voice's\\" live quarterfinals Monday night, on which Teams Blake and Christina performed. And I'm not talking about when Christina Aguilera appeared without pants to sing \\"Fighter\\" with her team and a high school choir. The last time Jesse Campbell performed on \\"The Voice,\\" he was \\"the one to beat,\\" according to Adam Levine, who, alas, was not his coach. And the time before that he was the one who made us love him by stutter-singing the word \\"b-b-b-baby\\" with such style in the B-b-b-battle Rounds.This time, he was the one his coach, Aguilera, sent home. And I, for one, totally didn't see his insta-ouster coming. Campbell, who had overcome homelessness and had a lovely young daughter and a fluidly expressive voice, was one of my early favorites. Now – without the audience weighing in on his performance of \\"Halo,\\" a song picked by Aguilera that was not a good fit -- he's gone, and to quote Jordis Unga, who was also sent home in a flash, \\"I'm sad.\\"Actually, what Unga said was \\"I'm sad, but I understand,\\" because her coach, Blake Shelton, explained why he'd made the choice he'd made. It wasn't personal or even really much of a judgment call. Faced with making a decision he didn't want to and apparently hadn't expected to have to make, he decided to \\"revert to America's vote,\\" and send home the person he'd saved from elimination two weeks before. That was a rationale we could probably all understand. His team – sassy, boot-stompin' country girl RaeLynn; soulful belter Erin Willett; Alicia Keys' spotlight-worthy former backup singer Jermaine Paul; and vulnerable rocker Unga – had all given more or less top-notch performances Monday night, though Willett had unfortunately been saddled with an Adele song, \\"Set Fire to the Rain,\\" and no one really shines like Adele when singing Adele. \\"You had big shoes to fill,\\" Aguilera told her. But Willett did manage to use the song to highlight her own strengths. RaeLynn growled and shimmied winningly on \\"She’s Country,\\" which was a perfect song for her. Paul showed off his supple voice and commanding stage presence on \\"Against All Odds.\\" Shelton predicted Paul would look back on the performance as a turning point in his career. And Unga – in a glamorous, form-fitting white evening gown that showed off her impressive arm tats – got vulnerable and a little bit weepy with \\"A Little Bit Stronger.\\" So what was Shelton to do? Someone had to go, and for some reason, after he had let himself bond and become a big brother figure to these four starry-eyed hopefuls (their group performance of \\"Heartache Tonight\\" was like a bunch of old pals sitting around a campfire), it turned out that he, unexpectedly, it seems, had to decide who that person would be. \\"I didn't see this coming tonight,\\" he said of the judge eliminations at the outset of Monday's performance show. \\"This instant elimination thing has caught us all off tonight,\\" adding that if he knew \\"who to kick\\" he \\"would kick 'em.\\" I might kick the producers for the \\"instant elimination\\" idea. At this point in the competition, \\"Voice\\" voters feel like we should have a chance to weigh in with our favorites. We should be consulted. And this immediate response on the judges' part fails to factor in our preferences. Adam Levine, who with Maroon 5 and Wiz Khalifa debuted the song \\"Payphone\\" during the show, said at the outset he felt the judge-weighted elimination format was a \\"good\\" one. \\"Wouldn't you rather control it than everyone else?\\" he asked the other judges. \\"Maybe I'm just a control freak, but I think it's OK.\\" It was hard to read Levine's or the other judges' reactions when Aguilera's decided to eliminate Campbell, though they had responded more favorably to his performance Monday than Aguilera had herself. (\\"It really surprised me,\\" Green later he was \\"shocked\\" by both choices.) She complimented the emotion Campbell, who had seemed to struggle with pitch in parts, he'd brought to the Beyonce song. Later, she praised Paul's flexibility in a way that seemed, even at the time, possibly pointed, as did, particularly in retrospect, her contention that the other three of her contestants had shown \\"growth\\" over the weeks. Team Christina's fresh-faced Ashley De La Rosa, whom Aguilera had saved from elimination during the first live rounds and who was celebrating her 18th birthday, had moments both good and bad with \\"Foolish Games.\\" But she'd wept when Aguilera had sung to her during rehearsals, called Aguilera her idol and inspiration, and apparently reminded Aguilera of herself, which is likely the highest sort of Aguilera praise. Coffee-shop curiosity Lindsey Pavao, who sort of looks like Katy Perry, sang a Katy Perry song she had selected that Cee Lo Green said he hadn't ever heard before, \\"Part of Me,\\" and showed us a fiery part of her we may not have heard before. And classically trained opera singer Chris Mann was compelled by coach Aguilera to \\"branch out\\" of his \\"comfort zone\\" with Coldplay's \\"Viva La Vida.\\" \\"I have an excited nervousness,\\" he said, anticipating his risk-taking performance. \\"It's like I'm stripping onstage … a little bit naked, but I'm pretty excited about it.\\" Note perfect, it was nevertheless … odd. But ultimately Aguilera, who had been persuaded into a song switch by Pavao, felt it was Campbell, whom she had pressed into singing the song she had chosen, despite his expressed discomfort, felt it was Campbell who had to go. Two more contestants will be sent home by voters Tuesday night. Who do you think should go?

By Tara Brady Rachel Burke, 28, was scheduled to spend three weeks in Nepal on the hiking holiday which had been branded as ¿high risk¿ A super fit Naval worker who died on an adventure trip through a notorious ‘Valley of Death’ in the Himalayas was so sick she was unable to tie her own shoelaces, an inquest heard today. Rachel Burke, 28, was scheduled to spend three weeks in Nepal on the hiking holiday which had been branded as ‘high risk’ by the UK based The Adventure Company. She flew into Kathmandu with two friends on 15 April, 2011 and began to travel on foot to base camp Mount Everest, Southwark Coroner’s Court was told. ‘I had a cough, I felt tired but","output":"nothing too serious,’ Rachel wrote in her diary during the early days of the trip. However, as the journey progressed, her condition began to rapidly deteriorate. The expedition would take the group through the Khumbu valley - a treacherous stretch of land known as the ‘Valley of Death’ due to the high number of fatalities recorded among hikers in the area. This nickname has been earned primarily due to the extreme altitude, harsh weather conditions, and challenging terrain. The inquest heard that Rachel had been quite fit and active, as part of her job at the Royal Navy involved regular physical training. It was clear that she did not expect the trouble she faced during the trek. As the group reached higher altitudes, Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS) became a real threat. AMS is a potentially fatal condition caused by the decrease in oxygen levels at high altitudes, leading to headaches, nausea, and exhaustion, among other symptoms. Despite her initial enthusiasm and determination, Rachel's condition continued to worsen. By the time the group reached Dingboche, a small village at an altitude of over 14,000 feet, Rachel was unable to tie her own shoelaces and had developed a severe cough. Concerns among the group grew as some noticed her lips had turned blue, an unmistakable sign of oxygen deprivation. The group's doctor, who was responsible for assessing the hiker's health, had given Rachel permission to continue with the trek. However, as her condition did not improve, they ultimately decided that she should be evacuated from the site. In her diary, Rachel expressed her frustration and disappointment, stating, ‘I cannot believe I am going home due to a cough.’ Unfortunately, Rachel's case had been much more severe than initially thought. On April 27, 2011, just twelve days after the start of the fateful expedition, Rachel Burke passed away due to High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE). HAPE is a severe form of AMS, which occurs when fluid accumulates within the lungs due to the increase in altitude. The condition often remains undiagnosed until it is too late, making it particularly dangerous for hikers. The Adventure Company, which organized the trek, was grilled about its procedures regarding the safety and assessment of its hikers at the inquest. The company emphasized their commitment to safety and highlighted their extensive briefing and training processes prior to the trip. However, this tragic incident has raised questions about how thoroughly the potential risks and dangers of such expeditions are assessed and communicated to participants. In hindsight, Rachel's untimely death serves as a stark reminder of the perils that can arise during adventure trips, especially in high-altitude environments. It also underscores the importance of proper health monitoring, early detection of AMS, and efficient emergency response systems in preventing such tragedies from occurring in the future. In conclusion, the inquest into Rachel Burke's death is a reminder to adventure seekers and organizers alike of the inherent risks involved in high-altitude treks and the crucial importance of effective measures to assess and manage these risks. Her passing highlights the responsibility that organizers have in ensuring participants' safety, as well as the need for individuals to be candid about their health and promptly report any signs of illness during such excursions."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: Among the massed ranks, a portrait of his late father held out in front of him, was President Vladimir Putin. This surprise appearance amid crowds in Moscow honouring ordinary people who served in World War Two seems to be part of a change of image for the Russian president - portraying him more as a down-to-Earth man of the people, rather than the all-action hero TV viewers have become used to seeing. For over 30 seconds, TV commentators made no reference to his surprise appearance. But then anchor Vladimir Solovyev supplied the meaning of what was undoubtedly a carefully choreographed media event. \\"There were no loud announcements and no commotion. Why?\\" said Mr Solovyev. \\"Because this is an amazing event at which politics moves into the background. It is a day when all are equal.\\" Brand Putin still in fashion In pictures: Russian WW2 Victory Day Not everything went completely smoothly. As the president paused for a short interview surrounded by his security entourage, an old man button-holed him to ask about the benefits he was due as someone affected by the 1986 nuclear disaster in Chernobyl. The cameras quickly moved away. But Solovyev continued in the same lyrical vein. \\"Victory Day - everyone is equal. People just come up to the president of the Russian Federation and talk to him.\\" The message of the people's president was reinforced in other parts of the media. \\"Putin acted like an ordinary man,\\" proclaimed a headline on the popular news website Gazeta.ru. Commentator Aleksey Malashenko described it as a political masterstroke. \\"I would not be surprised if at that moment the president's rating had reached 100%. Yes, it was populism, but sincere populism,\\" he blogged on the Ekho Moskvy radio station website. Putin as man of the people was also one of the key themes of Prezident, a 150-minute film recently shown on official channel Rossiya 1 to mark the 15th anniversary of the beginning of his rule in 2000. The film dwelt on the Russian leader's humble origins and his attachment to his late parents. \\"He comes from a working family in the suburbs, just like millions of others, millions of his compatriots, same as me, same as you,\\" popular singer Nikolay Rastorguyev said over footage of Putin discussing people's problems in the street. In the film, President Putin himself stressed that he was not from an \\"elite background\\". \\"This connection with the people and sense of closeness to them, to ordinary people, are hugely important and a great help to me in my work,\\" he said. Prezident also featured an episode from 2006 in which Putin visited a coffee shop in Dresden and stood in the corner with his coffee and cake, apparently unnoticed by other customers. The sequence was shown without commentary as if its only purpose was to reinforce the idea of Putin as the \\"ordinary man\\". This portrayal of Putin is in marked contrast to the image of the derring-do hero of the TV stunts for which he has become famous - the bare-chested hunting expeditions, the dive for Greek wine vats in the Black Sea and saving journalists by shooting a Siberian tiger with a tranquilizer, to name but a few. But it has been some time since Russian TV viewers were treated to Putin in full-blown action-man mode and is a far cry from the image given by a film aired three years ago to mark his 60th birthday. That NTV film showed the president working late at night, alone in his office, breakfasting on health foods and swimming and exercising in his private gym, watched over by his beloved black labrador Koni. Media academic Anna Kachkayeva believes it portrayed a person who \\"for a long time has been living in the special dimension of power and has, of course, lost touch with reality\\". The wish to show President Putin as an \\"ordinary man\\" may be related to the political imperatives of Russia's current economic difficulties. But there may also be a more personal element. At the end of \\"Prezident\\", Vladimir Solovyev asks Mr Putin what he has had to give up as leader of his country. The president sighs deeply, frowns and answers: \\"A normal, everyday life.\\" One journalist, Oleg Kashin, suggested the film may have been less about propaganda than psychotherapy.

The media played a significant role in helping highlight Putin's humble roots and connections with the common people. This recent trend in portraying Putin's image contrasts with the past, where he was famously known for his daring adventures, such as bare-chested hunting expeditions, diving for Greek wine vats in the Black Sea, and saving journalists by shooting a Siberian tiger with a tranquilizer. The shift in portrayal appears to be a calculated move to make Putin appear more relatable and sympathetic in light of Russia's current economic difficulties."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The deportation was given the code name Operation Ulusy. In it, a total of 93,139 Kalmyks were uprooted. They were packed into Cattle wagon and dispatched in some 46 trains. One witness recalled that they traveled for two weeks. Many Kalmyks were dirty and unwashed upon arrival; upon exiting, the snow became black from their dirt. The deportation was completed on 31 December. A majority of them (91,919) were deported by the end of the year, though an additional 1,014 people were also evicted in January 1944. Resolution no. 1432 425 of the Soviet of Peoples Commissars, which determined that this ethnic group should be resettled, was adopted on 28 December 1943 and signed by Vyacheslav Molotov, but not made public. The entire operation was guided by the NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria and his Deputy Commissar Ivan Serov. Other officials who participated in it included Victor Grigorievich Nasedkin, Head of the Gulag and Commissar of the State Security of the 3rd degree, and Dmitri Vasilevich Arkadiev, the Head of the Transport Department of the USSR NKVD. The Kalmyks were sent to various locations in Siberia—by January 1944, 24,352 were sent to the Omsk Oblast, 21,164 to Krasnoyarsk Krai, 20,858 to Altai Krai, and 18,333 to Novosibirsk Oblast. Alternative sources indicate that, beginning in 1944, 6,167 Kalmyk families were in the Altai, 7,525 in the Krasnoyarsk, 5,435 in Novosibirsk and 8,353 in the Omsk Region. 660 families were also located in the Tomsk Region, 648 in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, 522 in Tobolsk, 2,796 in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug and 1,760 in the  Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug.

Q: Passage: In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the hook-billed vanga in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected on the island of Madagascar. He used the French name L'écorcheur de Madagascar and the Latin Collurio Madagascariensis. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the hook-billed vanga. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Lanius curvirostris and cited Brisson's work. It is now the only species placed in the genus Vanga that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1816. The specific name curvirostris is from Latin curvus \\"curved\\" and -rostrum \\"billed\\". The word \\"vanga\\" is the Malagasy name for the species. Two subspecies are recognised.

It is hoped that the new type of phone will encourage users to recycle. Scientists have come up with a new material over the last five years. It looks like any other plastic and can be hard or soft, and able to change shape. Overtime it can also break down into the soil without giving out any poisonous chemicals.

Pidgeon was the first person to do this via the Panama Canal, and the first person to solo circumnavigate the world twice. On both trips, he sailed a 34-foot yawl named the \\"Islander\\", which Pidgeon constructed by himself. Prior to his first trip, Pidgeon had no prior experience sailing. He accounts for his adventures in his book, \\"Around the World Single-Handed: The Cruise of the \\"Islander\\"\\" (1932). Biography. Harry Clifford Pidgeon was born 31 August 1869 on a farm in Iowa. His father, Isaac Marion Pidgeon, was married 3 times and had a total of 12 children. The family were Quakers. At the age of 15, he set out for California where he found work on a ranch. Before long, he traveled north to Alaska, where he took a raft down the Yukon River and spent some time sailing among the small islands of the southeastern Alaskan coast. Later, he returned to California and traveled and worked in the Sierra Nevada mountains, taking up a career in photography.  - Sailing Alone Around the World is a sailing memoir by Joshua Slocum in 1900 about his single-handed global circumnavigation aboard the sloop \\"Spray\\".

(A vessel with a larger mizzen located in a more forward position is called a ketch; see below: Yawl versus ketch.) The mizzen sail (smaller than the mainsail) is hoisted on the mizzen mast.  - Joshua Slocum (February 20, 1844  on or shortly after November 14, 1909) was the first man to sail single-handedly around the world. He was a Nova Scotian born, naturalised American seaman and adventurer, and a noted writer. In 1900 he wrote a book about his journey \\"Sailing Alone Around the World\\", which became an international best-seller. He disappeared in November 1909 while aboard his boat, the \\"Spray\\".  - A ketch is a sailing craft with two masts. The distinguishing characteristic of a ketch is that the forward of the two masts (the \\"mainmast\\") is larger than the after mast (the \\"mizzen\\"). Historically the ketch was a square-rigged vessel, most commonly used as a freighter or fishing boat in northern Europe, particularly in the Baltic and North seas. In modern usage, the ketch is a fore-and-aft rigged vessel used as a yacht or pleasure craft.    'islander ' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'instance of'?

Instead, his father showed Jack that by creating a more favorable environment (in this case, warming the tortoise near the fireplace), the tortoise would naturally do what Jack wanted it to do – in this case, move and come out of its shell. The moral of the story is that we cannot force people to do things they don't like or do not feel comfortable doing. Trying to force someone to act in a certain way or do something against their will often results in resistance and reluctance. Instead, the best approach is to create an environment or situation where people feel comfortable, safe, and encouraged to take action on their own accord. This can involve providing support, understanding, and empathy, while respecting their feelings and desires. As demonstrated by the father's wise words and actions, one cannot simply coerce or force someone into compliance or cooperation when they are not willing to do so. True cooperation and understanding come from a place of respect, empathy, and consideration for the other person's desires and motivations. By creating an environment in which people feel understood and encouraged to share their true thoughts and feelings, we can foster positive and productive communication and relationships. Thus, the writer wants to convey the message that we cannot make people do things they don't like, but rather we should try to understand and respect their desires and preferences, and work together in a more supportive and cooperative manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: Quibbling that evil leaders are to blame, not the institution of government itself, is a pathetic evasion, reminiscent of an NRA bumper sticker that reads, Governments don't kill people, only criminal leaders kill people. Hypothesis: It is considered courageous to think that evil leaders, not the government, are responsible. Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Select from: [a]. yes [b]. it is not possible to tell [c]. no","output":"[c]. no The premise does not entail the hypothesis. Let's break down both the premise and the hypothesis to better understand why they are not connected. Premise:  The given premise argues that blaming evil leaders instead of the institution of government is an insufficient and weak argument. It compares this mindset to a slogan that suggests only criminal leaders are responsible for killing people, rather than acknowledging a larger systemic issue with governments. Essentially, this statement dismisses the idea that only evil leaders are to blame, implying that there are inherent problems in the institution of government that can lead to detrimental outcomes. Hypothesis:  The hypothesis claims that it is considered courageous to believe that evil leaders, rather than the government itself, are responsible for causing harm. This statement appears to be promoting the argument that blaming individual leaders for problems is a brave stance. Contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis: The main contradiction lies in the attitudes towards the argument that evil leaders, not the government, are responsible. The premise strongly criticizes this argument as an evasion and being reminiscent of an NRA bumper sticker, pointing to underlying issues within the institution of government. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that holding this belief is considered courageous. As a result, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the two statements contrast in their evaluation of whether attributing blame to evil leaders or the government itself is valid or courageous. The premise presents the belief as inadequate, while the hypothesis perceives it as a commendable viewpoint."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Hypothesis: The men that did this to her are animals.  Does the premise entail the hypothesis? Options: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no","output":"In order to discuss whether the premise entails the hypothesis, it is important to analyze the provided information and the context of the statements. The statement given as a premise describes a horrific and brutal act of violence against a woman. The hypothesis is a figurative statement that implies the men who committed this act behave like animals and lack human empathy, moral values, or civilized behavior. The question is if the premise, entailing the brutal act, logically leads to or supports the hypothesis, which is a judgment on the men's nature. Option 1: Yes One might argue that the premise does entail the hypothesis because the gang-rape and the subsequent butchering of the woman are such savage and inhumane acts that the men responsible cannot be considered as part of normal human society. The use of the word \\"animals\\" is a way of distancing them from the general human population, emphasizing their deviation from ordinary human morals and values. The fact that the men went beyond just sexually assaulting the woman and mutilated her shows that they have a disregard for human life and suffering, which some may argue, is a characteristic of animals or the basest behavior of a human being. This horrendous act seems to imply a lack of empathy and understanding of the consequences of their actions, lending support to the hypothesis that the men are \\"animals.\\" Option 2: It is not possible to tell On the other hand, some might argue that it is not possible to tell if the premise entails the hypothesis because the comparison to animals is a metaphor and depends on personal interpretation. Additionally, the information given only provides a brief description of the incident and does not provide any insights into the mental state, past experiences, or motivations of the men involved. Furthermore, it could be argued that labeling the perpetrators as \\"animals\\" is unfair to actual animals, as many animals show instances of empathy and cooperation within their species, and even across different species. What the men did was horrific and despicable, but attributing their actions to just being \\"animals\\" may oversimplify the complex reasons for their transgressions. Option 3: No One could argue that the premise does not entail the hypothesis because people are responsible for their choices and actions, and attributing such heinous crimes to being \\"animalistic\\" does not encompass the entire scope of the issue. Moreover, humans are rational beings and are fully aware of the consequences of their decisions, thereby making them responsible for their actions. The argument of labeling the men as animals does not adequately address the underlying factors behind their actions, such as the influence of social environment, upbringing, or possible psychological disorders. Conclusion: Given the complexity of the issue and the varying interpretations of the given statements, it would be appropriate to say that it is not possible to tell for certain if the premise entails the hypothesis. The comparison to animals is a metaphorical statement that may not accurately depict the true nature or reasons behind the men's actions. Understanding the underlying factors that led these men to commit such heinous acts is essential for a more accurate and insightful assessment of their behavior."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Shinedown is an American rock band from Jacksonville, Florida formed by singer Brent Smith in 2001 after the dissolution of his previous band. Smith, still under contract with record label Atlantic Records, recruited the band's original lineup of Jasin Todd as guitarist, Brad Stewart on bass, and Barry Kerch on drums. Consistent for the first two album cycles, a few lineup changes followed in the late 2000s, eventually stabilizing with Smith and Kerch alongside Zach Myers on guitar and Eric Bass on bass. The group has released five studio albums: The band didn't start work on a follow up album until 2005, with the band finding the touring lifestyle too hectic to start writing or recording material. This however, left the band with limited time to record new music, with their record label pressuring the band to get the album out in a six-month time period. Despite the time restrictions, the label did not pressure the band on the album's musical direction after the commercial success of Leave a Whisper. The band worked with music producer Tony Battaglia, and chose to go in a more \\"mature\\" and \\"stripped down\\" direction for the album's sound, Kerch describing it as just \\"pure rock\\". During the same time, the band was also approached by Hollywood Records to record a song for a tribute album for the band Queen, something the band agreed to out of their respect for the band. They recorded a cover of the track \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\", which was released on Killer Queen: A Tribute to Queen, released in August 2005.  The band released their second studio album, Us and Them, on October 4, 2005. The album debuted higher than Leave a Whisper on the Billboard 200 chart, peaking at number 23 versus Leave a Whisper's number 53 peak, but the album ultimately sold less than its predecessor. Despite this, the band's three singles from the album, \\"Save Me,\\" \\"I Dare You,\\" and \\"Heroes\\", ended up being more successful than their prior album's singles. The lead single, \\"Save Me\\" was the band's first to reach the number one spot on the Mainstream Rock Charts, and held the position for twelve weeks in a row. The second single, \\"I Dare You\\", also peaked at number 2 on the same chart. Notably, both songs were also the band's first to have crossover success on the Billboard Hot 100 charts, hitting 72 and 88 respectively.  The band again toured heavily in support of the album, including the 2006 iteration of the SnoCore Tour with Seether, Flyleaf, and Halestorm, and later opening for the Godsmack and Rob Zombie co-headlining tour of North America. Promotional support came from other areas as well; then-American Idol contestant Chris Daughtry performed \\"I Dare You\\" live on the show, helping its crossover appeal, and was used as a theme song for WrestleMania 22. The success of the singles helped propel sales of the album in the long run, ultimately being certified gold by the RIAA on November 13, 2006. and as of 2013, Smith had estimated that sales sat at approximately 990,000 copies sold.

The pair are arguing over how much time they spent there before the split. Mr Justice Mostyn said the wife was entitled to continue her fight in England. Article:","output":"Title: Saudi Couple's Divorce Battle Over London Penthouse Continues in England Introduction: The divorce battle between Sheikh Abdul Maksoud Khoja, 89, and his ex-wife Melina Abuchian, 63, continues as they fight over the ownership of their penthouse flat in London's prestigious Regents Park. The Saudi couple, who have two children together, ended their union for the second time in May. Now, the legal dispute moves to England. Step 1: Detailing the couple's marital history and their respective claims Sheikh Abdul Maksoud Khoja and Melina Abuchian's relationship has been marred by separation, with the couple divorcing twice in the past. Mrs. Abuchian asserts that she is entitled to keep the luxurious penthouse, while her ex-husband claims it is his property and wants to put it up for sale. Step 2: Discussing the arguments and justification from both parties A significant aspect of the dispute centers around the time the couple spent in the London flat prior to their split. This factor is crucial in establishing which party has a stronger claim to the property. Both Sheikh Khoja and Mrs. Abuchian are expected to present evidence to support their cases and potentially persuade the presiding judge in their favor. Step 3: Mentioning the involvement of the English courts Despite the couple's Saudi origin, England's legal system is now involved in the resolution of this intensely personal matter. The involvement of the English courts indicates that the outcome of this case could potentially have international implications and set a precedent for similar disputes between high-net-worth individuals from different countries. Step 4: Quoting Mr. Justice Mostyn's statement As the case progresses in England, Mr. Justice Mostyn has given his verdict on the matter. He stated that Mrs. Abuchian is entitled to continue her fight for the London penthouse in the English courts. This decision gives hope to Mrs. Abuchian, who seeks to secure the contested property for herself. Conclusion: As the high-stakes divorce battle between Sheikh Abdul Maksoud Khoja and his ex-wife Melina Abuchian unfolds, the focus remains on the contested London penthouse in Regents Park. With both parties adamant about their claims to the luxurious asset, the English courts will play a crucial role in determining the fate of this opulent property. The outcome of this case could potentially serve as a benchmark for future disputes between wealthy international couples.

Waste Management devised a strategy to save money on diesel-fuel costs: it is buying trucks that will run on cheaper natural gas. Leslie Eaton has details on The News Hub. Photo: Alison Yin for the Wall Street Journal. Rising diesel costs last year forced Waste Management Inc. to charge customers an extra 169 million, just to keep its garbage trucks fueled. This year, the nation's biggest trash hauler has a new defensive strategy: it is buying trucks that will run on cheaper natural gas. In fact, the company says 80% of the trucks it purchases during the next five years will be fueled by natural gas. Though the vehicles cost about 30,000 more than conventional diesel models, each will save 27,000-a-year or more in fuel, says Eric Woods, head of fleet logistics for Waste Management. By 2017, the company expects to burn more natural gas than diesel. \\"The economics favoring natural gas are overwhelming,\\" says Scott Perry, a vice president at Ryder Systems Inc., one of the nation's largest truck-leasing companies and a transporter for the grocery, automotive, electronics and retail industries. The shale gas revolution, which cut the price of natural gas by about 45% over the past year, already has triggered a shift by the utility industry to natural gas from coal. Vast amounts of natural gas in shale rock formations have been unlocked by improved drilling techniques, making the fuel cheap and plentiful across the U.S. Darrold Withrow, 41, is a certified fueler and mechanic at Waste Management, and he fills up a truck with liquefied natural gas in Oakland, Calif. Now the shale-gas boom is rippling through transportation. Never before has the price gap between natural gas and diesel been so large, suddenly making natural-gas-powered trucks an alluring option for company fleets, rather than an impractical idea pushed mainly by natural-gas boosters like T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman. Railroad operators also are being affected as coal shipments decline. Many fleet operators, particularly long-haul truckers, remain concerned about a scarcity of refueling stations. Other challenges include the bulky tanks for compressed gas and the hazards of handling liquefied gas. In the past, the volatility of natural-gas prices also hampered wider use. But today, truck manufacturers are embracing natural gas for everything from bi-fuel pickup trucks like the Chevy Silverado HD to eighteen-wheelers that can burn natural gas either compressed, called CNG, or super-chilled, called LNG. Navistar International Corp., Cummins Inc. and General Motors Co. all are courting the market with new natural-gas powered trucks or engines. Navistar's goal is to \\"expand to a full range of products using natural gas in the next 18 months,\\" says Eric Tech, president of Navistar's engine business. This year, the Illinois company is introducing delivery trucks burning natural gas. Next year, it is adding long-haul trucks with its biggest engines. Mr. Tech says in a couple of years, one in three Navistar trucks sold will burn natural gas. \\"This is not a subsidy-driven market,\\" Mr. Tech says. \\"It's developing on its own because the economics are compelling.\\" Companies like United Parcel Service Inc. and AT&T Inc. are buying the vehicles. AT&T recently ordered 1,200 Chevrolet Express cargo vans equipped to run on compressed natural gas, which GM said was its largest CNG vehicle order ever. Ryder Systems began renting out natural gas trucks in California last yea. The response has been so strong Ryder is expanding the program to Michigan and Arizona. And it is introducing them in truck clusters it operates for big box retailers like Staples Inc. and manufacturers including carpet-maker Mohawk Industries Inc. For years, a barrel of oil cost about as much as six units of natural gas and their prices moved in tandem, notes Don Mason, a gas-industry consultant in Ohio. Today, a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude costs more than 33 times as much as a unit of natural gas in the U.S. At the pump, a gallon of diesel often costs more than twice as much as CNG, on a diesel-gallon-equivalent basis. \\"I think we're at a turning point, even if it's a slow, wide turn,\\" Mr. Mason says. Refueling a Waste Management truck in Oakland, Calif., with LNG. Although the U.S. has loads of natural gas, adoption of natural gas vehicles has been spotty. Less than 0.1% of vehicles on American roads burn the fuel today and the percentage sagged slightly from 2005 to 2010, when federal policies encouraging their use waned. The number began edging up last year, lifted by market forces. Meanwhile, in the Asia-Pacific region, natural gas vehicle sales have grown at an average annual clip of 42% during the past decade, according to NGV Global, a trade group formed in 1986 to promote gas-friendly policies. Pakistan led the list in 2010 with 2.7 million natural gas vehicles, though many are tiny tuk-tuks, out of a total of 13 million natural gas vehicles worldwide. The U.S. came in 14th with 112,000 natural gas vehicles. Many people are trying to figure out whether natural gas really has legs as a transportation fuel. Greg Burns, chairman and chief executive of PLS Logistics Services Inc. in Pittsburgh decided this year to ask 100 trucking company executives. The result: eight in 10 respondents said natural gas in its densest form, as LNG, has potential for highway use. Nearly a third said they were actively researching it for their own companies. But 54% said current infrastructure is inadequate and 23% worried about the higher cost of the trucks. Mr. Burns' conclusion: \\"If you have a long-enough time frame, it's a pretty bullish picture.\\" Some truckers soon will have the ability to hedge their bets. That is because the Environmental Protection Agency recently approved retrofit technology for big rigs that lets them burn LNG and diesel.Kathryn Clay, executive director of the Drive Natural Gas initiative of the American Gas Association, says \\"the new technology is really game changing because the trucker can run on either fuel, eliminating refueling anxiety.\\" The potential market is enormous. The 3.2 million big rigs on U.S. roads today burn some 25 billion gallons of diesel annually. Almost 7 million single-unit trucks, such as UPS or FedEx Corp. trucks, consume another 10 billion gallons of diesel. Converting even a modest number of these trucks, which often get 5 to 8 miles a gallon, to natural gas could save significant amounts of money. Tailpipe emissions also would drop, since natural gas burns cleaner than diesel or gasoline. If large numbers of fleet operators decided to embrace natural gas, it could rev up truck manufacturing, which slowed dramatically during the recession. North American heavy duty truck sales peaked in 2006 with 360,000 units, just ahead of tighter emission standards, and plunged to 110,000 units in 2009. Noel Perry, principal at Transport Fundamentals Inc., a trucking research company in Lebanon, Penn., says one disadvantage of natural gas is that it isn't as dense as diesel. CNG is only 25% as dense and LNG is 60% as dense. That means trucks need more tanks or bigger tanks to go as far, or they must refuel more often. That's not a big deal for city buses or delivery trucks that go back to home base each night, where they can refuel. But it's a problem for trucks that drive unpredictable routes or venture out into the hinterland. Ann Duignan, managing director at J.P. Morgan Equity Research, says \\"there's huge excitement\\" about natural gas but infrastructure immaturity will depress truck sales. She expects fastest adoption among fleets that can run on CNG and return home each night but is skeptical about long-haul trucking. \\"It will be slow, steady, one-fleet-at-a-time type growth,\\" she says. Write to Rebecca Smith at rebecca.smith@wsj.com A version of this article appeared May 24, 2012, on page B1 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: Will Truckers Ditch Diesel?. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The increasing cost of diesel fuel has led Waste Management Inc. to devise a strategy to save expenses by investing in trucks that run on cheaper natural gas. By 2017, the company expects to burn more natural gas than diesel and aims for 80% of the trucks it purchases over the next five years to be fueled by natural gas. Although natural gas vehicles cost approximately 30,000 more than conventional diesel models, the fuel savings amount to 27,000 per year or more. The shale gas revolution has reduced the price of natural gas by about 45% over the past year, prompting the utility industry to shift from coal to natural gas. The transportation sector is also experiencing a natural gas boom, as the large price gap between natural gas and diesel makes natural gas-powered trucks an attractive option. Major truck manufacturers are now producing natural gas-fueled trucks, contributing to the market growth. Challenges to natural gas adoption include concerns about a scarcity of refueling stations and the volatility of natural gas prices. However, the economics of switching to natural gas are becoming increasingly compelling, and converting even a fraction of diesel-consuming trucks to natural gas could lead to significant cost savings and reduced emissions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Alexander is heating up water in his kitchen because he is preparing to make pasta. He has split the water into two containers, container A and container B. Container A has been heating up for a long amount time, while container B has only been heating up for a short amount of time.  Which container has particles with lower average kinetic energy?  Hint: As a liquid is heated, the average kinetic energy of its particles increases. The rate of evaporation increases as more and more molecules are able to escape the liquid’s surface into the vapor phase. Eventually a point is reached when the molecules all throughout the liquid have enough kinetic energy to vaporize . At this point the liquid begins to boil. The boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure of a liquid is equal to the external pressure. The Figure below illustrates the boiling of liquid. A:","output":"Based on the given information and the hint provided, container B has particles with lower average kinetic energy.  Here's an explanation: As a liquid is heated, the average kinetic energy of its particles increases. This is because the particles gain energy as heat is applied, which in turn causes them to move faster. The rate of evaporation also increases, as more molecules now have enough energy to escape the liquid's surface and enter the vapor phase. Since container A has been heating up for a longer time compared to container B, the particles in container A would have gained more energy, resulting in a higher average kinetic energy. Container B, on the other hand, has been heating up for a shorter time, so its particles would have gained less energy, and therefore, would have a lower average kinetic energy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There are four regular compact honeycombs in the hyperbolic 3D space : There are four hyperbolic honeycombs in regular 3D space .","output":"While both statements refer to honeycombs in three-dimensional spaces and use similar terms, they do not mean the same thing. In order to understand why, we need to unpack the terminology and concepts in each sentence. 1. \\"There are four regular compact honeycombs in the hyperbolic 3D space.\\" In this statement, \\"regular compact honeycombs\\" refer to honeycomb structures in which every cell is a regular polyhedron and the honeycomb is compact, meaning it is finite in size, not extending infinitely in any direction. The term \\"hyperbolic 3D space\\" denotes a three-dimensional geometry with constant negative curvature (a hyperbolic space), as opposed to the flat space of traditional Euclidean geometry. So, this statement is talking about four distinct types of evenly shaped structures that fit together perfectly without gaps and without extending infinitely, all within a hyperbolic geometry context. 2. \\"There are four hyperbolic honeycombs in regular 3D space.\\" In this case, the statement refers to \\"hyperbolic honeycombs,\\" which are honeycomb structures with constant negative curvature embedded within their cells. The term \\"regular 3D space\\" most likely refers to the familiar three-dimensional Euclidean geometry and not specifically to the regularity of the polyhedra forming the honeycombs. This statement is talking about honeycombs with characteristics of hyperbolic geometry that exist in a traditional three-dimensional flat space (Euclidean). However, it is important to note that hyperbolic honeycombs cannot truly be embedded in a regular flat 3D space without distortions, as they originate from a space with negative curvature. Alternatively, the term \\"regular 3D space\\" in this context might simply be a misinterpretation or an error, and the author intended to target a hyperbolic 3D space instead. To summarize, the first statement discusses regular compact honeycombs in a hyperbolic 3D space, while the second statement attempts to describe hyperbolic honeycombs within a regular 3D space. Although both touch upon hyperbolic honeycombs and 3D spaces, the ordering and meaning attributed to each element differ, making them distinct statements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. Question: Why is Trump trying to pass this tax plan?

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What did Handel orignally write in da capo but shorten to dal segno?, using the article: The opening soprano solo in E major, \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is one of the few numbers in the oratorio that has remained unrevised from its original form. Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: \\"Behold, I tell you a mystery\\", then the long aria \\"The trumpet shall sound\\", marked pomposo ma non-allegro (\\"dignified but not fast\\"). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of \\"incorruptible\\" may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he \\"could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required\\". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, \\"O death, where is thy sting?\\"  The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata Se tu non-lasci amore, and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus \\"But thanks be to God\\".The reflective soprano solo \\"If God be for us\\" (originally written for alto) quotes Luther's chorale Aus tiefer Not. It ushers in the D major choral finale: \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\", leading to the apocalyptic \\"Amen\\" in which, says Hogwood, \\"the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven\\". Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer \\"rising still higher\\" than in \\"that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus\\". Young writes that the \\"Amen\\"  should, in the manner of Palestrina, \\"be delivered as though through the aisles and..., what would be the answer ?

The text highlights that Knight is an American actor and musician, known for playing roles in \\"17 Again\\", \\"Sonny with a Chance\\", \\"So Random!\\", \\"Melissa & Joey\\", and \\"Starstruck\\". These productions are popular, especially within the Disney Channel audience, but there is no concrete evidence or statistics provided to support the claim that he has been seen by billions of people. Typically, television series and movies, even those associated with popular networks like Disney Channel, do not accumulate billions of viewers. Popularity in terms of television viewership is often measured in millions, rather than billions. For example, global hits such as \\"Game of Thrones\\" had around 44 million viewers per episode during its peak. Only a few major global events have been known to reach the billion-viewer mark, such as the FIFA World Cup or the Olympics. Given that the projects Sterling Knight has been involved in primarily cater to specific demographics and are limited by the reach of the Disney Channel, it is unlikely that he has been seen by billions of viewers. The claim might be an exaggeration of his popularity, and to accurately determine the truth behind it, we would need to obtain more precise data on the viewership for each project he participated in and their potential reach internationally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Is cell Y moving up or down the concentration gradient?  Gary is a high school student examining two cells under a microscope for his biology class. In a petri dish, marked Cell X, Gary sees that substances inside the cell are spreading apart from each other making it less concentrated. In the dish marked Cell Y, Gary sees substances coming together and moving into close proximity to one another.  Hint: Active transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane with the help of extra energy. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is less concentrated to an area where it is more concentrated. This is the opposite of diffusion. The substance moves up, instead of down, the concentration gradient. Like rolling a ball uphill, this requires an input of energy. The energy comes from the molecule named ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The energy allows special transport proteins called pumps to move substances to areas of higher concentration. An example is the sodium-potassium pump. The answer to this question is:","output":"Cell Y is moving up the concentration gradient."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","output":"Title: London Underground Offers Part-time Staff and Salary Increase for Night Tube Service Introduction: The London Underground (LU) has proposed a solution to efficiently manage and operate the Night Tube service, a much-anticipated public transportation expansion in the city. As part of the plan, the organization has offered to enlist part-time staff and implement a salary increase for workers involved in running this new around-the-clock service. Addressing the Need for Night Tube Service: As London is a bustling city that never sleeps, the demand for reliable transportation options during late hours has surged in recent years. Recognizing this need, LU has introduced the Night Tube service, aimed at providing commuters with a safe, convenient, and efficient mode of transportation during nighttime hours. This service will benefit not only passengers who travel late at night for work, leisure, and social purposes but also businesses and the city's economy as a whole. Solution: Part-time Staff and Salary Increase: To effectively manage the added workload and maintain optimal service standards, LU has proposed employing part-time staff to assist in the operation of the Night Tube service. This new staffing approach offers flexibility for both the organization and potential employees, as it creates opportunities for part-time work that fits in well with other commitments. In addition to employing part-time staff, LU has also presented the prospect of a salary increase for those engaged in operating the Night Tube service. This incentive will not only make current employees more invested in the success of the service but also attract future talent to join the team. In turn, this will boost the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the new service, ensuring that customers' needs are met and promoting a positive experience for all. Impact on Services and Passengers: By employing part-time staff and offering salary increases, LU aims to deliver a high-quality Night Tube service that meets public demands and expectations. This initiative will undoubtedly reduce waiting times and alleviate crowdedness on late-night bus routes, ultimately improving passengers' overall travel experience. Final Thoughts: London Underground's proposal to utilize part-time staff and provide a salary increase for Night Tube service workers is a strategic move to cater to the needs of the growing nighttime commuter population. As LU continues to address the increasing demand for public transportation during late hours, the city's transportation landscape will only become more efficient and accommodating for both residents and visitors alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is conterminous with Bilbao and Basauri in the north , with Ugao - Miraballes and Zeberio in the south , with Zaratamo in the east and with Arrankudiaga and Alonsotegi in the west .  - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\".  - Bilbao  is a municipality and city in Spain, a major city in the province of Biscay in the autonomous community of the Basque Country. It is the largest municipality of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country and the tenth largest in Spain, with a population of 353,187 in 2010.

The current name of Alonsotegui was manifest in the 1990s when it separated it from the Baracaldo municipality to which was attached since the end of 19th century. Alonsotegui is approximately 8 kilometres from the center of Bilbao. The village is situated in the valley of the River Cadagua.  - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.  - M (named \\"em\\" ) is the thirteenth letter of the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet.  - Greater Bilbao (Basque: \\"Bilboaldea\\", Spanish: \\"Gran Bilbao\\") is an administrative division of the province of Biscay, in the Basque Country, Spain.

When we think of a tiger, we think of danger. We think of the big teeth and large feet of it. We also think of beauty. The tiger is a hunter that hunts alone. In fact , tigers are probably better than any other land mammal  at catching large animals without help. Even so, the life of this big-game hunter isn't easy. Finding food can be difficult, especially for a tiger that is old or weak. Most of the animals it tries to attack get away. A tiger sometimes goes weeks without eating. When that happens, it may hunt animals that can be dangerous even for a tiger. When they are in a bad situation, some tigers may even attack humans. But in fact, tigers kill very few people each year. Most tigers run away when they see people. What tigers have done to people can't compare to what people have done to tigers. Over the last 200 years, we have almost killed tigers in the wild . Today, the tiger is one of the most endangered animals on Earth. A tiger may live 20 years or more, if it is not disturbed by humans. Female  tigers usually live longer than male tigers, because the males live more dangerously. It isn't easy for people to tell a male from a female unless the female happens to be with her babies.Only females take care of the young. The big difference between males and females is size. Male tigers are much bigger. Tigers are big eaters. In a single year, one tiger must eat about 70 deer or other large animals. That is one reason why tigers hunt alone. If they lived in big groups, they could never find enough animals to feed them all. Question: According to the passage, why do tigers hunt alone? Yes or no, is the answer \\"They can't find enough animals to share with other tigers.\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer \\"They can't find enough animals to share with other tigers\\" is consistent with the information provided in the passage. As mentioned in the article, tigers are exceptional hunters, adept at catching large animals without assistance. One of the reasons they hunt alone is the significant amount of food required to sustain them. In a single year, a tiger must consume approximately 70 deer or other large animals. If tigers were to live and hunt in large groups, they would struggle to find adequate food sources to support their entire population. Consequently, hunting alone allows them to secure the necessary amount of food to ensure their survival."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

These cups are reusable, and they can stay in place for up to twelve hours.  Menstrual cups are ideal if you are doing endurance training, running a marathon, or hiking. Menstrual cups may move around during yoga, however. Once a menstrual cup is in, you should feel no discomfort, but some people may struggle with placing the cup. If you don’t have a menstrual cup, buy a box of tampons instead.  Tampons are not comfortable for everyone during exercise, however. If you find that you can’t exercise with a tampon in, try another method instead. \\"Sport\\" tampons are designed for workouts. You can try using these if normal tampons are uncomfortable while you exercise. If you have a heavy flow, you may need more protection. Use a pantyliner in addition to a menstrual cup or tampon. Put a new one in your undies just before exercising. Pads may cause uncomfortable chafing as you exercise. They can also scrunch up as you exercise, giving you less protection than you may need. If tampons and menstrual cups don't work for you, however, pads may be your only option. The underwear should be made out of a breathable fabric such as cotton. Underwear with more coverage will be more comfortable and prevent more leaks than a thinner type, such as a thong. You can even invest in a pair of period-proof underwear, such as Thinx. These can be worn in addition to or instead of a tampon or menstrual cup. Pants and shirts that are too tight might cause discomfort, especially if you’re experiencing cramps, constipation, or bloating. Instead, choose looser clothing. Make sure that your pants are dark, just in case there’s a leak!  For example, instead of tight leggings, wear loose sweatpants to the gym. A cotton t-shirt or tank top is perfect, especially if you don’t tolerate heat well on your period. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article highlights the importance of choosing appropriate menstrual products and clothing for exercising during your period. It recommends menstrual cups as the best option for endurance activities due to their long-wearing time and reusability. However, other alternatives, such as sport tampons, can be used, and for those with a heavy flow, pantyliners can provide extra protection. The article also advises against using pads during exercise due to possible discomfort and chafing. Moreover, it suggests wearing breathable and comfortable underwear, with options like period-proof underwear as an additional or alternative choice. Lastly, the article emphasizes the importance of selecting loose, comfortable clothing and dark pants to avoid discomfort and leakage while exercising during your period."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(CNN) -- Horror-meister, Stephen King calls George Pelecanos \\"perhaps the greatest living American crime writer.\\" His stories are set in Pelecanos' hometown of Washington, D.C., but this is not the side of the U.S. capitol that you see portrayed on TV with white marble monuments, lawyers and lobbyists. Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal. Pelecanos knows a thing or two about capturing the authenticity of urban America with an ethnically and socially diverse cast. In addition to his success as a novelist, Pelecanos is a producer and writer for HBO's New Orleans-set, \\"Treme.\\" He was previously a producer and Emmy-nominated writer on the hit series \\"The Wire\\" and the miniseries \\"The Pacific.\\" Read an excerpt from \\"The Cut\\" CNN recently spoke to Pelecanos about his new novel.

Title: The Nightmare Before Christmas Movie plot: Halloween Town is a fantasy world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, zombies, mummies, vampires, werewolves and witches. Jack Skellington, a skeleton with the title of \\"Pumpkin King\\", leads them in organizing the annual Halloween holiday. However, Jack reveals he has grown weary of the same routine year after year, and wants something more. Wandering dejectedly in the woods, he stumbles across seven trees containing doors leading to towns representing various holidays, and accidentally opens a portal to Christmas Town. Impressed by the bright and cheery feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of Christmas, to the Halloween Town residents. However, they fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything to their ideas of Halloween. Jack is dismayed that no one understands the feeling of Christmas, and obsessively studies the holiday but fails to find any further explanation of it. He ultimately decides that it's unfair for Christmas Town alone to enjoy the feeling and announces that he and the citizens of Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year. Jack's obsession with Christmas leads him to usurp the role of \\"Sandy Claus\\". Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a beautiful rag doll woman, falls in love with Jack. However, after a vision of a burning Christmas tree, she alone realizes that his plans to run Christmas will become disastrous, but has no luck convincing him.

Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: A must-read for believers and skeptics alike Review: I started reading DHW only a few months after I had converted from Christianity to agnostic atheism. I'm glad I did, because Carl Sagan gave voice to a lot of the thoughts that had been stewing about in my mind. It also made me understand how even the most intelligent of us can give in to sentimental appeal, and abandon reason.Perhaps the most important thing that this book did, though, was instill a (rational) sense of wonder. Sagan's fascination with the universe comes through in many portions of DHW. And though some people have suggested that Sagan treats science as a religion, I'd disagree; instead, science is simply the best tool for ascertaining the truth, whether or not you believe in god(s). Answer: Answer:","output":"This product review seems to have a predominantly positive tone. The reviewer shares that they had recently converted to agnostic atheism and found the book to resonate with their personal beliefs and thoughts. They appreciate that Carl Sagan gives voice to their inner thoughts, as well as helping them understand how intelligent people can give in to sentimental appeal. The reviewer also highlights that the book instilled a rational sense of wonder in them and emphasizes Sagan's fascination with the universe, which they find compelling. They address criticism by some that Sagan treats science as a religion, but the reviewer disagrees. Instead, they feel that the book portrays science as the best tool for ascertaining the truth, regardless of one's religious beliefs. Overall, the review presents several positive aspects of the book, and the title \\"A must-read for believers and skeptics alike\\" indicates the reviewer's recommendation for a wide range of readers, signaling a positive tone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize: How much of your eating do you do because you are actually hungry?  Often, people eat when they’re bored, stressed, or feel pressured or obligated to do so.  Reducing calorie intake is critical to weight loss, and eating only when your body needs sustenance is a good step in that direction.  Look for other outlets to alleviate your stress or boredom.  When weight loss is your goal, exercise is great option — jogging, for instance, can clear your head and keep you away from the junk food cupboard. When you do eat, focus on your food and eat slowly.  Turn off the TV and eat only at a table, not standing or sitting on the couch.  Think about what you are eating.  Savor each bite.  Stop when you are full. Giving yourself challenges can also make eating more interactive and limit mindless consumption.  For instance, try eating with chopsticks if you aren’t already handy with them. Few people can succeed by going “cold turkey,” switching from an unhealthy to a healthy diet overnight.  For most, an incremental transition is the best means to long-term weight-loss success.  Remember, you need time to re-train your mind, body, habits, and taste buds.  Be patient. Start with small changes.  For instance, start by getting the smaller version of your favorite fast-food meal, and get small soda instead.  Your ultimate goal will be to largely eliminate these items, but incremental reductions in portion size and calorie intake can help you onto that path. Water is good for everyone, but it can be the dieter’s best friend.  It is nourishing, refreshing, and can even be filling, without adding a single calorie to your intake.   Unless you have a specific need for the nutrients in sports drinks (if you are very physically active for a long period of time, for instance), sticking to water is the simplest and lowest calorie (as in zero calorie) way to hydrate effectively.  Always drink a glass of water before you eat something.  Often, when people think they are hungry, they are actually just thirsty.  Water, and perhaps just a small, healthy snack, can be enough to see you through to your next meal.  Water can also limit the amount you actually eat at that meal. Generally speaking, if you’re looking to lose weight before school starts, that means it’s summertime.  Thankfully, summer is the ideal season to seek out fresh fruits and vegetables, which need to be at the heart of your healthy diet.  Don’t think of summer as a time to indulge in junk, but rather as the time to take advantage of nature’s bounty. Depending on your climate, you can go from emphasizing fresh berries and peas, to peaches and tomatoes, to apples and corn, all the while helping your local farmers and the environment (by cutting out long-haul shipping). Whether you can source them locally or not, also add more whole grains, lean proteins (summer is a good time for fishing, for instance), and more fiber-rich foods. With their growing bodies, teens in particular can have the urge to eat almost constantly.  Choosing the right snacks to carry you through to the next meal can make a huge difference in the success of your weight-loss plan.  Make snacks like chips and candy a rare treat.  Focus instead on healthy, easy-to-prepare/carry/eat fruits, vegetables, and foods with whole grains, lean protein, and fiber. For instance, consider pre-packaging any of the following in small sandwich bags: apple slices with peanut butter and raisins; grapes and string cheese; trail mix; edamame; or hummus spread inside a whole-wheat pita.  The options are nearly endless, and by packaging them yourself, you'll reduce your inclination to head for the vending machine or candy drawer when hungry between meals. Diets that feel like punishment are doomed to fail.  The goal is to retrain yourself to see treat foods (double-fudge brownies or double cheeseburgers, for example) as just that — occasional treats and not signs of failure.   Don’t make any of your favorite foods completely “off-limits.”  You’ll only obsess about them more and feel even worse if you do slip up.  Focus on practicing portion and frequency control with unhealthy food options.  When you do choose to indulge, savor every bite of that pecan turtle sundae.  Eat slowly and deliberately, making every bite count.  Make it last so you won’t need to repeat the process again too soon.","output":"To promote healthy weight loss, be mindful of when and why you eat, focusing on eating only when you're actually hungry. Engage in activities like exercise to reduce stress or boredom, and practice mindful eating by eating slowly and savoring each bite. Make incremental changes to your diet, such as reducing portion sizes and choosing healthier alternatives, and drink water to stay hydrated and manage hunger. Take advantage of fresh produce available during summer, and prioritize whole grains, lean proteins, and fiber-rich foods. Choose healthy snacks instead of junk food, and focus on portion control rather than completely eliminating your favorite treats from your diet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: In Europe, people hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right throughout the meal, a system that is generally agreed to be more efficient than the American zigzag method. Americans hold both the fork and the knife in their right hands throughout the meal, so they continually change their forks to the left hand when they have to cut their meat. It seems to be funny for the Europeans to see Americans busy changing their dinner sets, making a lot of noises. A few explanations for this American style are as follows: (1) Americans are practical and efficient. Since most of us are right-handed, it is reasonable to keep our working tools at all times in the right hand that can use them most efficiently. (2) Americans, the master of the New World are rebels .They use the zigzag method to break the rules in the Old World and in this way they are thumbing their nose at Mother England. Americans are a restless kind. They do not like to sit in one spot for very long when dining. (3) Forced to do so, they respond by \\"playing\\" with the silver. Whatever the reason for the practice, it is now certainly as American as apple pie. Europeans recognize this and are quick to attack it as evidence of American innocence of form. Arguments against the zigzag method rest not only on grounds of efficiency but also on those of tradition. In Old World dining, the knife is held in the right hand continually because it can serve as an instant defense against the uninvited intruders .However, such alertness  is out of place in the New World, as every American believes that this is the home of the brave. Americans _ their silverware, perhaps, to show that they are not afraid and that one of them holding a fork is worth any number of them holding blades . Answer:","output":"Question: Which of the following best describes the differences between the European and American dining systems and the possible explanations for the American zigzag method? A. Europeans use the zigzag method while Americans keep the fork and knife in their right hand throughout the meal. Americans are simply trying to be more efficient and practical, are rebelling against Old World traditions, and want to showcase their bravery. B. Europeans hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand throughout the meal, while Americans use the zigzag method, switching the fork between hands when cutting meat. This may be due to Americans' practicality and efficiency, rebellion against Old World traditions, or to demonstrate they are unafraid and confident. C. Both Europeans and Americans use the zigzag method, but Europeans view it as a sign of American innocence. Possible explanations for Americans' dining habits include a desire for orderliness, avoiding confrontation during meals, and mimicking European standards. D. Americans hold the fork in the left hand and the knife in the right hand, while Europeans switch utensils between hands during the meal. Americans maintain their dining style due to the importance of practicality and efficiency, a desire to appear luxurious, and to express their cultural identity. Correct Answer: B.

This may be due to Americans' practicality and efficiency, rebellion against Old World traditions, or to demonstrate they are unafraid and confident."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But something more surprising was, when William was being interviewed by reporters, he answered their questions by speaking rather than singing. And he did it with great manners, and with a clear and pleasant voice. From that day, William gave up singing at all hours. Now he did it only during his stage appearances and world tours. Some people suspected why he had changed, but others continued believing him to be somewhat mad. They wouldn't have thought so if they had seen what William kept in his big suitcase. It was a large stone, with a hand-carved   message on it. The message said: \\"Practice, my boy. Practice every second, for you never know when your chance will come.\\" Little did people realize that he only got the role in the opera because the director had heard William singing while out buying a newspaper. Question: According to the text, William   _  . Options: A: had no idea whether he should continue doing something mad B: was nervous and didn't know how to sing when he was interviewed C: was selling newspapers when the opera director heard him singing D: practiced singing whenever possible before he became famous A:","output":"D: practiced singing whenever possible before he became famous"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(June 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) An unnamed gunslinger referred to as The Lady enters the Old West town of Redemption circa 1881, where she enters a single elimination gunfighting contest held by Redemption's ruthless mayor and former outlaw John Herod. While there she meets Cort, a former Herod henchman turned preacher whom Herod has captured and forced to enter the contest. During her first night in town, The Lady saves Cort's life by shooting the rope Herod's men had hanged Cort from. She also meets \\"The Kid\\", a brash young man who runs the general store and who hopes to impress Herod. The Kid believes Herod is his father and that he can earn his father's respect by entering and winning the contest. In the first round of duels The Kid defeats a Swedish quick-draw champion while Herod kills a braggart named Ace Hanlon, who had taken credit for some of Herod's own accomplishments. The Lady defeats an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Cort, who has renounced violence and doesn't have a weapon, is taken to the general store. Herod buys Cort a gun and decrees that Cort (an exceptionally skilled gunfighter) can only have one bullet at a time so that he doesn't shoot his way out of town. Despite telling everyone he wouldn't fight, Cort winds up drawing his gun and winning his first round fight. During a rainstorm Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill Herod. Before they duel, Herod changes the rules and proclaims that all contests are now to the death. After killing Cantrell, Herod angrily addresses the townspeople and informs them that he will continue to raise his taxes on them until they understand that he is in charge of everything. During a rainstorm that evening The Lady faces off with Eugene Dred after Dred rapes a young girl at the saloon. She defeats him...

Write a title for this article: WASHINGTON -- Congressional Democrats and the Obama White House have plenty to fret about as they eye the 2010 elections: rising deficits, the Afghan war, public fears over expanding government, the fate of the health-care brawl. But one item may prove key: the national unemployment rate, which hit a 26-year high last month at 9.8%. On that front, economists and political pundits say, the majority party looks increasingly wobbly. \\"Unemployment is the leading economic indicator when it comes to politics,\\" said Democratic pollster Peter Hart. \\"Anytime unemployment hits double digits, it's hard to see the party in control having a good election year.\\" Economists generally predict that the number of people out of work will continue to inch up next year, even if the economy begins to rebound. Most see the jobless rate peaking at around 10.5% in the summer. Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said Sunday that his own hunch was that the economy would turn around over coming months, but that unemployment would \\"penetrate the 10% barrier and stay there for a while before we start down.\\" See how the unemployment rate and representation in the House has changed, going back to 1980. Voters generally turn against a newly elected president and his party in the midterm elections. Even with a booming economy, President Bill Clinton and the Democrats lost 52 House seats in 1994. The Republicans under President Ronald Reagan in 1982 are the only party since World War II to have gone into a midterm election with unemployment over 10%. They lost 26 House seats. Republicans are already harnessing voter unease over deficit spending and proposed changes to the health-care system. But they see the economy as the Democrats' main vulnerability. \\"The biggest threat to the president's party is not health care, a climate-change bill, or Afghanistan. It's jobs,\\" said John Feehery, a Republican strategist. Officials at the National Republican Campaign Committee said they planned to use the weak employment numbers to hammer at 54 Democratic House members that Republicans deem the most vulnerable in 2010. Republicans are particularly targeting the 49 House lawmakers in districts carried last November by Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential nominee. People line up outside a job fair in Baltimore in September. \\"We'll continue to remind Democrats of their failed promises that led to what is now, at best, a jobless recovery,\\" said NRCC spokesman Paul Lindsay. Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who heads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said he remained confident that the unemployment picture would improve by next fall. At the same time, he said, \\"the Republicans run a real risk of being seen as the party rooting for economic failure.\\" President Barack Obama and the Democrats are all the more exposed on the jobs front because they touted the 787 billion economic-stimulus bill as a way to curb job losses. The Obama team asserted in January that the recovery plan would keep unemployment below 8% and push it down to nearly 7% by the end of 2010. Obama aides have since said that they didn't grasp how sour the economy was at the time. Economists now generally believe that the stimulus package has cushioned the economic fall. But Republicans argue that it was a waste of money, and it isn't clear whether the Democratic argument -- that things would be worse without the stimulus -- will sway many voters. \\"The challenge for Democrats is it's just not that compelling to say, 'Things would be a lot worse if we didn't do X, Y and Z,' \\" said Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst. Demonstrators in 1982 protest high unemployment. The Obama administration and Democratic lawmakers are now scouring for ways to boost job creation and help the jobless, without proposing a second stimulus bill. One idea is to extend for another year the enhanced unemployment-insurance benefits set to expire in December, a move that could cost another 100 billion, by one estimate. A White House official cautioned, however, that such talk remained preliminary. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Tuesday that Democrats may move ahead on extending some jobless benefits, such as a special subsidy for health insurance, but that any larger stimulus package was off the table for now. Turning the jobless rate around will require a more robust economic expansion than most predict will happen next year. The U.S. has lost 7.2 million jobs since the recession began at the end of 2007. Economists say U.S. output would have to grow by about 4.5% in 2010 to whittle away just 1% from the unemployment rate. That compares with the 3% to 4% growth many economists predict for next year. Yale University economist Ray Fair, who has built a fairly reliable economic model to predict presidential and House election outcomes, said that Democrats could still get lucky. If the economy turns around enough to start driving the jobless rate down by the fall of 2010, he said, \\"then the Democrats won't necessarily do as badly as people think now.\\" Write to Neil King Jr. at neil.king@wsj.com Title:","output":"Facing the Fallout: High Unemployment Threatens Democrats' 2010 Election Prospects Amid Rising Deficits and Public Concerns"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: Cloud argues, \\"the emblematic moment of the period from 1955 through the 1980s in American labor was the tragic PATCO strike in 1981.\\" Most unions were strongly opposed to Reagan in the 1980 presidential election, despite the fact that Reagan remains the only union leader  to become President. On August 3, 1981, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization  union—which had supported Reagan—rejected the government's pay raise offer and sent its 16,000 members out on strike to shut down the nation's commercial airlines. They demanded a reduction in the workweek to 32 from 40 hours, a 10,000 bonus, pay raises up to 40%, and early retirement. Federal law forbade such a strike, and the Transportation department implemented a backup plan  to keep the system running. The strikers were given 48 hours to return to work, else they would be fired and banned from ever again working in a federal capacity. A fourth of the strikers came back to work, but 13,000 did not. The strike collapsed, PATCO vanished, and the union movement as a whole suffered a major reversal, which accelerated the decline of membership across the board in the private sector. Schulman and Zelizer argue that the breaking of PATCO, \\"sent shock waves through the entire U.S. labor relations regime.... strike rates plummeted, and union power sharply declined.\\" Unions suffered a continual decline of power during the Reagan administration, with a concomitant effect on wages. The average first-year raise  fell from 9.8% to 1.2%; in manufacturing, raises fell from 7.2% to negative 1.2%. Salaries of unionized workers also fell relative to non-union workers. Women and blacks suffered more from these trends.

Given the following context:  The Vijayanagara Empire (also called Karnata Empire, and the Kingdom of Bisnegar by the Portuguese) was based in the Deccan Plateau region in South India. It was established in 1336 by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I of Sangama Dynasty. The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers to ward off Islamic invasions by the end of the 13th century. It lasted until 1646, although its power declined after a major military defeat in the Battle of Talikota in 1565 by the combined armies of the Deccan sultanates. The empire is named after its capital city of Vijayanagara, whose ruins surround present day Hampi, now a World Heritage Site in Karnataka, India. The writings of medieval European travelers such as Domingo Paes, Fernão Nunes, and Niccolò Da Conti, and the literature in local languages provide crucial information about its history. Archaeological excavations at Vijayanagara have revealed the empire's power and wealth. The empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at Hampi. Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the Vijayanagara Architecture style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in Hindu temples' construction. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form. The Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in South Indian history that transcended regionalism by promoting Hinduism as a unifying factor.  answer the following question:  What had its power decline after a major military defeat in 1565? Answer:","output":"The power of the Vijayanagara Empire declined after a major military defeat in the Battle of Talikota in 1565, which was fought against the combined armies of the Deccan sultanates. This defeat marked the beginning of the empire's decline, leading to its eventual disintegration in 1646."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article based on this summary: Ministers should be allowed to campaign to leave the EU in the upcoming referendum, Boris Johnson has said.","output":"Title: Boris Johnson Supports Ministers Campaigning for EU Exit Introduction: The ongoing debate surrounding the United Kingdom's involvement in the European Union continues to gain momentum ahead of the upcoming referendum. London's former Mayor, Boris Johnson, has recently expressed his support for Ministers to actively campaign in favor of leaving the EU. This article will explore Johnson's stance on this controversial issue and discuss the possible impact of his endorsement on the Brexit referendum results. Johnson's Argument: Boris Johnson, known for his strong views on Brexit, opines that Ministers should not be barred from campaigning for the UK to leave the EU. According to him, Ministers have the right to express their opinions and represent the voice of those who are unsatisfied with the EU membership. He believes that Ministers should be allowed to advocate for leaving the EU, in order to foster a healthy democratic debate on the future relationship between the UK and Europe. Significance of Johnson's Support: As a prominent figure in UK politics, Boris Johnson's endorsement holds considerable weight and could potentially influence political and public opinion on the Brexit issue. His argument that Ministers should be allowed to campaign for leaving the EU introduces a new dimension to the debate, emphasizing the importance of politicians taking proactive stances to represent their constituents' interests. Critics' Reactions: Johnson's comments have been met with mixed reactions from colleagues and critics alike. Some argue that his support for Ministers campaigning to leave the EU may lead to a divided government and potential conflicts of interest. These critics contend that Ministers should remain neutral in order to effectively serve the people and maintain political stability. On the other hand, there are those that agree with Johnson's view, stating that those in power should be free to express their opinions and participate actively in important political conversations. They argue that political figures advocating for an EU exit demonstrates a vital part of democracy by allowing for diverse perspectives and encouraging constructive discourse. Potentially Influencing the Upcoming Referendum: With the Brexit referendum approaching, Boris Johnson's support for Ministers campaigning to leave the EU could serve to further polarize political opinion. The impact of his statements might help bolster the pro-Brexit campaign, swaying undecided voters and strengthening the determination of those already in favor of leaving the EU. Conclusion: Boris Johnson's assertion that Ministers should be allowed to campaign for the UK's exit from the EU has added fuel to the ongoing Brexit debate. His support for this controversial issue highlights the need for political leaders to engage in constructive discussions surrounding the country's future relationship with Europe. While it remains to be seen how this will ultimately affect the result of the forthcoming referendum, Johnson's endorsement has certainly generated a more nuanced and diverse dialogue on the topic."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Math Problem Solve -148*s - 420 = -399*s + 209*s for s.","output":"To solve the equation -148s - 420 = -399s + 209s for s, we first combine the terms with the variable s on both sides of the equation. Step 1: Combine like terms on the left side and on the right side of the equation. Left side of the equation: -148s (There are no other s terms on the left side, so it remains the same.) Right side of the equation: -399s + 209s Since both terms have the s variable, we add the coefficients: -399 + 209 = -190. So, the right side of the equation becomes -190s. Now, our equation looks like this: -148s - 420 = -190s Step 2: Isolate the variable s by moving all the terms with s to one side of the equation and all the constants to the other side. To do this, we will add 190s to both sides of the equation to cancel out the s terms on the right side. -148s + 190s - 420 = -190s + 190s When we simplify, the equation becomes: 42s - 420 = 0 Now, we will isolate the s term even further by adding 420 to both sides of the equation. 42s - 420 + 420 = 0 + 420 The equation simplifies to: 42s = 420 Step 3: Solve for s Now, we can solve for s by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient 42. 42s / 42 = 420 / 42 s = 10 So, the solution to the equation -148s - 420 = -399s + 209s is s = 10."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Cleveland Browns traveled to Oakland for their first road game of the season to face the Oakland Raiders. Historically, the Browns and the Raiders split their all-time series at 27 games a piece heading into week three's game. The Browns had won six of their last seven meetings with the Raiders, but the team fell short by a final score of 26-24, allowing the Raiders to end their eleven-game losing streak. The Browns' first drive was marred by three penalties and a sack, forcing the team into an almost-impossible 3rd-and-40 situation. The Browns were forced to punt, but held the Raiders to a three-and-out series on their first drive. However, the Browns were forced to punt again on their second drive, and allowed the Raiders to score the first points of the game on a 32-yard Sebastian Janikowski field goal, putting the Raiders up 3-0. The Browns' next drive ended prematurely, as quarterback Derek Anderson was intercepted by Raiders linebacker Thomas Howard, who returned the interception 26&#160;yards. The Raiders' next drive was stalled by the Browns, forcing the team to kick a field goal, this time a 22-yard field goal. The Browns were forced to punt again on their next drive, and the Raiders were able to score on a 41-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Josh McCown to wide receiver Ronald Curry. The score was made possible by a brilliant play-action fake, which caused rookie cornerback Eric Wright to bite on the fake, allowing Curry to run untouched to the endzone. The Browns' next drive was again ended by an interception, as Kirk Morrison picked Anderson off and returned the interception 45&#160;yards before being tackled by Braylon Edwards to save the touchdown. The Raiders were held to a field goal, this time 23&#160;yards, despite their outstanding field position, increasing their lead to 16-0. On the kickoff, however, returner Josh Cribbs managed to break down the Raiders' defense en route to a 99-yard kickoff return touchdown, putting the Browns on the board for the first time in the game. The Raiders then fumbled on their next possession, allowing defensive end Simon Fraser to fall on the loose ball. Anderson then led the Browns down the field to a 23-yard Phil Dawson field goal, bringing the Browns within six points as the first half came to a close. Raiders quarterback McCown was replaced by Daunte Culpepper at the start of the second half due to an ankle injury he sustained on a play in which defensive end Robaire Smith fell on his leg during a tackle. Culpepper's entrance into the game was met with a loud series of cheers from Raiders fans, who have wanted to see Culpepper on the field all year. His first drive leading the Raiders in the second half ended with a punt, but the Raiders held the Browns to a three-and-out, forcing another Browns punt. However, on the Raiders' next drive, a 24-yard pass from Culpepper to wide receiver Mike Williams was fumbled and recovered by cornerback Daven Holly. The Browns capitalized on the momentum from the fumble and scored six quick points on a 21-yard pass from Anderson to Edwards, bringing the Browns to within nine points of the Raiders. However, the Raiders' next drive culminated in a one-yard touchdown run by running back Lamont Jordan, increasing the Raiders' lead to 23-17 while taking more than nine minutes off the game clock. The Browns were forced into a three-and-out on their next possession, and allowed the Raiders to score three more fourth-quarter points on a 48-yard Janikowski field goal, capping the Raiders' scoring for the day at 26, putting them ahead 26-17. The Browns would answer back on their next drive as Anderson scrambled from the pocket and scored on a one-yard touchdown run to bring the Browns within two points of the lead. After a Raider punt, the Browns were forced into their two-minute offense and had to get the ball within field goal range to have a chance of winning the game. The Browns managed to get the ball to the Oakland 22-yard line, and the field goal unit took the field with three seconds left on the clock. Kicker Phil Dawson managed to hit the field goal from 40&#160;yards out; however, Raiders coach Lane Kiffin called a timeout just moments before Dawson kicked the ball, effectively icing his kick. With one more chance, the Browns lined up for the field goal again. This time, however, Dawson's field goal was blocked by Tommy Kelly, ending the Browns' chances for a comeback win. With the win, the Raiders ended their eleven-game losing streak and took the lead in the overall series between the two teams, 28-27. Derek Anderson, despite his somewhat disappointing performance, put up nearly 250&#160;yards passing for the second straight week, though running back Jamal Lewis was held to just 56&#160;yards on 15 carries. With the loss, the Browns have extended their already long streak of games without winning two in a row. That last happened the final game of the 2003 season and the first game of 2004.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a summary based on this article: I've gotten e-mail and Twitter messages begging me to ignore Sarah Palin's return to the national conversation, from her Oprah appearance to her book debut to the icky, Sarah-in-shorts Newsweek cover (I sure am glad Jon Meacham decided to make his mag the classy one, all about ideas!) and everything in between. I can't make Salon a Palin-free zone (nor do I want to). All I can do is promise to ban the term \\"Palinpalooza\\" from the pages of Salon. Done.      Now that her Oprah appearance is over – and boy, did Oprah let the liberals in her audience down; what a waste! – let me confess to my own Palin fatigue. I just can't take seriously the idea that she'll ever be president, even after her moderately successful softball game with Oprah. Palin sealed that fate when she quit being governor (although maybe she can run with Lou Dobbs on the All Quitters ticket in 2012). She'll never obtain the record or the reliability she needs to run credibly for president now that she gave up the modestly challenging job of running Alaska. I don't see her ever having the self-discipline or the humility to admit how very much she'd need to learn to be remotely qualified.      On top of everything else, she seems like a vindictive, spiteful person, judging from her reputation in Alaska politics, her open warfare with the McCain campaign and her juvenile tit-for-tat with her 19-year-old grandbaby-daddy Levi Johnston. If she can't brush off Levi's provocations, how would she handle Ahmadinejad? Or Joe Lieberman? I'll even allow that there's some sexism in the equation: Women suffer more from being perceived as vindictive and spiteful than men do. (It clearly didn't stop George W. Bush or John McCain.) Not fair; still true. But to be completely fair, McCain and even Bush accomplished more than Palin in the same life span, which maybe made their vindictiveness a little bit less defining than hers.      The main reason not to fear a President Palin can be seen in recent polling among independents and moderates. In a the most current ABC News/Washington Post poll, Greg Sargent drilled down to find that: only 37 percent of independents and 30 percent of self-described moderates think she’s qualified for the presidency, and 58 percent of moderates view her unfavorably. Even more intriguing (but not surprising): Palin's approval rating with men is higher than with women, 48 percent to 39 percent, and just a third of women believe she'd be qualified to be our first female president. (So much for Palin's appeal to Hillary Clinton fans!)      So I think the Sarah Palin rehab tour is more about Sarah Palin Inc. than Sarah Palin 2012. She'll rack up the speaking fees, raise some money for red-state, red-meat Republicans, further polarize the party and live the high life she thinks she deserves. Still, even as I dismiss Palin as a serious GOP threat, increasingly I believe that the faux-populism of the right is something to worry about. It may be fun to mock Sarah Palin, but Democrats shouldn't laugh at many of the people who admire her – who see a folksy, new kind of self-made mom trying to fight the bad old Eastern elites.      Two great blog posts last week made me worry: Timothy Egan's \\"The Betrayal,\\" and my friend Digby's \\"What if they don't,\\" about how liberals are too complacent that moderate Republicans and the rest of the country will laugh off the likes of Palin, Dobbs, Tom Tancredo and all the silly nutjobs who listen to them.      Egan intensified my growing fear that Democrats may be unable to ride the rising tide of populist rage, given their ties to Wall Street and K Street. \\"If health care reform gives people a choice, and doesn’t just fatten the rolls of insurance companies, it will be something to run on,\\" Egan wrote. \\"If the recovery helps millions of people who don’t have a well-staffed lobby in Washington, it too will be a plus.\\" But Egan made a good case that the party increasingly identified with Goldman Sachs may well pay at the polls nationwide in 2010, as Jon Corzine did in New Jersey this month.      So while I'm not worried about President Palin, I remain worried about President Obama. I'm particularly concerned that his increasingly triangulating, anti-deficit administration will do the wrong thing, morally and politically, and move to the right, without understanding that some right-wing rage could be rechanneled by acknowledging its roots: That the economic system seems rigged for the have-a-lots v. the have-a-littles, and despite their promises, the Democrats haven't done enough to change that. Palin can't change any of that, but Obama can. There's still time for him to do so, but the clock is ticking. ||||| It's no secret that former GOP vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin and Fox News host Glenn Beck share great respect and admiration — so their fans can be forgiven for wondering: Is a \\"dream ticket\\" of Palin-Beck ticket completely out of the question?      Perhaps not.      Palin initially chuckled when Newsmax broached the idea. But then she had some serious words of praise for the popular Fox personality.      \\"I can envision a couple of different combinations, if ever I were to be in a position to really even seriously consider running for anything in the future, and I'm not there yet,\\" Palin tells Newsmax. \\"But Glenn Beck I have great respect for. He's a hoot. He gets his message across in such a clever way. And he's so bold — I have to respect that.

Answer:","output":"The missing first step is: \\"Inhale air through the mouth or nose.\\" Step-by-step justification: 1. Inhale air through the mouth or nose: This is the starting point of the process, as it helps bring air into the body, which then enables the rest of the steps to take place. 2. Air reaches the lungs: After inhalation, the air flows through the trachea and bronchial tubes, ultimately reaching the lungs. 3. The lungs absorb the oxygen from the air: Within the lungs, millions of alveoli act as sites for gas exchange, where oxygen is absorbed from the air into the bloodstream. 4. The oxygen is transported by hemoglobin: Oxygen binds to hemoglobin molecules found in red blood cells, allowing them to carry oxygen efficiently. 5. Red blood cells are made of hemoglobin: Hemoglobin is the primary component of red blood cells and is responsible for their oxygen-carrying capacity. 6. Blood has a lot of red blood cells: The high concentration of red blood cells in the blood allows for efficient transport of oxygen throughout the body. 7. The heart moves the blood throughout the body: As the central organ in the circulatory system, the heart contracts and pumps blood to various parts of the body. 8. Blood can bring the oxygen to different cells in the body: Blood vessels, such as arteries, arterioles, and capillaries, distribute oxygen-rich blood to cells and tissues, allowing them to utilize the oxygen for cellular respiration and energy production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She suddenly realizes she is late for something and hurries out of the school and drives home. She has no time to talk to her mother as she goes to her room, grabs a dress from her closet, and hops in her truck. Meanwhile, in the country of Denmark we see the young & rebellious Prince Edvard and his servant, Soren, meeting up with a young man for what seems to be a race of some sort. Back in America, Paige is driving to a friend's wedding; she arrives in her father's pick up and nearly runs over half of the wedding party. At the reception, she and a friend discuss the subject of romance and marriage, neither of which Paige has time for because of her focus on her career. The bouquet is tossed, and by some twist of fate, it lands right in Paige's lap. Back in Denmark, the race is about to start; the cars speed down the open road and Edvard wins the race, where he is greeted with a threesome involving two teenage girls. He then realizes that, like Paige, he is also late for something very important. At the castle, 12-year-old Princess Arabella is playing a Gameboy as Edvard's parents, King Haraald and Queen Rosalind, wait anxiously for their eldest child to arrive before they are shown in public. Edvard arrives and is greeted with a hug by Arabella, though his parents don't seem so happy. He takes Arabella's arm and they step out onto the balcony. Later, Edvard and King Haraald are to meet with some members of the board; Haraald warns his son to behave himself, and Edvard glumly agrees.

Iraq took a more mindful approach to land use, they preserved native species, planted trees and didn't overgraze the land.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which country lost fewer bodies of water to desertification?  Hint: Desertification is a type of land degradation in which a relatively dry area of land becomes a desert, typically losing its bodies of water as well as vegetation and wildlife.[2] It is caused by a variety of factors, such as through climate change (particularly the current global warming)[3] and through the overexploitation of soil through human activity.[4] When deserts appear automatically over the natural course of a planet's life cycle, then it can be called a natural phenomenon; however, when deserts emerge due to the rampant and unchecked depletion of nutrients in soil that are essential for it to remain arable, then a virtual \\"soil death\\" can be spoken of,[5] which traces its cause back to human overexploitation. Desertification is a significant global ecological and environmental problem with far reaching consequences on socio-economic and political conditions.[6] A:","output":"Given the information provided in the paragraph above, Iraq has lost fewer bodies of water to desertification compared to Iran. As mentioned, Iran has faced extensive grazing and deforestation, which have led to numerous problems related to desertification. The loss of trees and overgrazing have negative consequences, including the loss of bodies of water, vegetation, and wildlife. This unsustainable exploitation of natural resources has accelerated desertification and the associated environmental problems in Iran. On the other hand, Iraq has taken a more mindful approach to land use. By preserving native species, planting trees, and avoiding overgrazing, the country has been able to prevent or mitigate the effects of desertification and land degradation to some extent. As a result, Iraq has retained more of its bodies of water, due to a reduced impact on the overall desertification process. The rate of desertification is heavily influenced by human activities and the way people manage their land resources. When a country like Iran overexploits its soil and natural resources, this can lead to \\"soil death,\\" which in turn triggers desertification. Conversely, a country like Iraq that adopts more sustainable land use practices can potentially curb desertification and its negative effects on bodies of water, vegetation, and wildlife. In conclusion, given the approaches to land use and management of natural resources mentioned, Iraq has lost fewer bodies of water to desertification when compared to Iran. This highlights the importance of adopting sustainable land use practices in mitigating and preventing desertification at a global level, as significant ecological, environmental, socio-economic, and political consequences depend on the preservation of arable land and natural resources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Like any stone, yellow sapphire occasionally contains inclusions and negative space inside the stone. When a gem-cutter slices into one of these imperfections, a small hole can develop. Most jewelers prefer to keep the hole in the gem rather than cut it away, but untrustworthy jewelers sometimes fill the stone with glass or borax paste to add weight and make the stone appear higher quality. Examine the stone by shining a light on it. Patches of unevenness are usually a good indication of this practice. Foil backing reflects more light, making the color of the yellow sapphire look more vibrant and the luster of the gem look brighter. The backing can be hard to see if the stone is already fitted into a setting, but careful examination of the base of the stone under magnification can often reveal a foil backing. Moreover, this potential falsification is more commonly found in antique jewelry, meaning that you may not need to worry about it quite as much if purchasing a new piece. If you have any doubts about the seller you plan to buy from, consider buying loose stones or stones with settings that give you a look at the bottom of the stone. Claw, tension, and channel settings are good examples. On the other hand, closed settings, like the bezel mounting, are often used by scammers to hide flaws and evidence of fraudulence. True yellow sapphire is a pure yellow, but similar, less precious imitations often have slightly different hues. Citrine has a slight green tint, golden topaz has strong traces of orange, and yellow tourmaline has a brighter, lemon-like hue. While a certificate does not give you the same assurance that physically checking the stone might, it does provide you with the satisfaction of knowing that the stone was checked and approved by an official, trusted organization.  Look for certificates from national gem societies like the Gemological Institute of America or the American Gem Society.

Glass has the ability to refract, reflect, and transmit light following geometrical optics, without scattering it. It is used in the manufacture of lenses and windows. Common glass has a refraction index around 1.5. This may be modified by adding low-density materials such as boron, which lowers the index of refraction (see crown glass), or increased (to as much as 1.8) with high-density materials such as (classically) lead oxide (see flint glass and lead glass), or in modern uses, less toxic oxides of zirconium, titanium, or barium. These high-index glasses (inaccurately known as \\"crystal\\" when used in glass vessels) cause more chromatic dispersion of light, and are prized for their diamond-like optical properties. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What can be used to make glass less refractive?","output":"To make glass less refractive, we can add special materials like boron. Adding boron to glass makes it have a lower index of refraction, which means light doesn't bend as much when it goes through the glass. This kind of glass is called crown glass."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Ben visited two states. Washington state, which had many wildfires year-round, and Oregon, state which had almost no wildfires. Ben enjoyed the visit and planned to return.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which state had more people inhaling carbon dioxide from the wildfire smoke?  Hint: Wildfire smoke contains particulate matter that may have adverse effects upon the human respiratory system. Evidence of the health effects of wildfire smoke should be relayed to the public so that exposure may be limited. Evidence of health effects can also be used to influence policy to promote positive health outcomes.Inhalation of smoke from a wildfire can be a health hazard. Wildfire smoke is composed of combustion products i.e. carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water vapor, particulate matter, organic chemicals, nitrogen oxides and other compounds. The principal health concern is the inhalation of particulate matter and carbon monoxide.Particulate matter (PM) is a type of air pollution made up of particles of dust and liquid droplets. They are characterized into three categories based on the diameter of the particle: coarse PM, fine PM, and ultrafine PM. Coarse particles are between 2.5 micrometers and 10 micrometers, fine particles measure 0.1 to 2.5 micrometers, and ultrafine particle are less than 0.1 micrometer.  Each size can enter the body through inhalation, but the PM impact on the body varies by size. Coarse particles are filtered by the upper airways and these particles can accumulate and cause pulmonary inflammation. This can result in eye and sinus irritation as well as sore throat and coughing. Coarse PM is often composed of materials that are heavier and more toxic that lead to short-term effects with stronger impact.Smaller particulate moves further into the respiratory system creating issues deep into the lungs and the bloodstream. In asthma patients, PM2.5 causes inflammation but also increases oxidative stress in the epithelial cells. These particulates also cause apoptosis and autophagy in lung epithelial cells. Both processes cause the cells to be damaged and impacts the cell function. This damage impacts those with respiratory conditions such as asthma where the lung tissues and function are already compromised. The third PM type is ultra-fine PM (UFP). UFP can enter the bloodstream... Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Washington state had more people inhaling carbon dioxide from the wildfire smoke. This is because Washington state experienced many wildfires year-round, whereas Oregon had almost no wildfires. Wildfire smoke, containing particulate matter and carbon monoxide, can have adverse effects on the human respiratory system. As a result, individuals in Washington state would be more exposed to these harmful elements due to the higher frequency of wildfires compared to Oregon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of The Football Association (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen Street, London. The only school to be represented on this occasion was Charterhouse. The Freemason's Tavern was the setting for five more meetings between October and December, which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules. At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the representative from Blackheath, withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting: the first allowed for running with the ball in hand; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA and instead in 1871 formed the Rugby Football Union. The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of Ebenezer Cobb Morley, went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game. These rules included handling of the ball by \\"marks\\" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to Victorian rules football being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.

Premise: a skinny woman spikes a volleyball over the net. Hypothesis: The woman scores the winning point in the game. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the given premise of a skinny woman spiking a volleyball over the net, we cannot definitively conclude the hypothesis that the woman scores the winning point in the game. The premise only provides information about one specific moment during the game: a skinny woman successfully spikes the volleyball over the net. From this, we can reasonably infer that she executed a successful move in order to direct the ball towards her opponent's side of the court. While this action contributes positively to her team's performance, it is important to note that it does not inherently imply any information about the overall progression or final outcome of the game. In order to conclude that the woman scores the winning point in the game, we would require additional information beyond the premise provided. This could include information on the following aspects: 1. Game score: Knowing the current score of the game could help establish whether the spike by the skinny woman created a decisive point or otherwise impacted the final outcome. It is essential to have details about the game's context, such as the points required to win, the current set, and if there are any match-point opportunities.  2. Opponent's response: We would need to consider the opponent's reaction to the spike. For instance, were they able to return the ball, or did they fail to counter the woman's move, leading to a point for her team? This information would directly ascertain the contribution of the woman's spike to her team's score and its significance within the greater context of the game. 3. Rules and regulations: A comprehensive understanding of the specific rules followed within the volleyball match can also greatly influence any conclusions. Different leagues or tournaments have varying rulesets that can impact, among other factors, the points required to win a game or unique stipulations that regulate how points are scored. In conclusion, the given premise that a skinny woman spikes a volleyball over the net does not offer enough information to definitively conclude the hypothesis that the woman scores the winning point in the game. To make such a conclusion, we would need more context and data about the game, its rules, and the overall progression to appropriately evaluate the impact of this particular spike in relation to the game's final outcome."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

And the answer is...","output":"Alright, little buddy, first, let's simplify the problem with the numbers we have.  If we look at the problem, there is a -438 over there on the right side. Let's move it over to the left side with the numbers 860 and 1291. But, remember the rule? When it moves over, it switches from being negative(-438) to positive(+438).  So, when we add 1291 and 438, we get 1729. And what we are left with now on that side is the number 9 because the -438 walked away to the other side! So, now the problem is 860 * s + 1729 = 9. Next, we need to get 's' all by itself on one side of the equal sign to find out what it equals. We can do that by moving the 1729 from the left side over to the right side with the number 9. But, remember the rule? When it moves over, it switches from being positive(1729) to negative(-1729). So, when we subtract 1729 from 9, we get -1720. Now, our problem looks like this: 860 * s = -1720. To solve for 's', we need to divide both sides of the problem by 860. This will isolate 's' all by itself.  -1720 divided by 860 equals -2.

Juicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect.

A photo-op to celebrate a 1.2-million lottery win in Nova Scotia turned sour Thursday when two family members feuded over the win.      Barbara Reddick of Guysborough, N.S., and her nephew, Tyrone MacInnis, posed for the cameras with a giant cheque in Margaree Forks, N.S., after winning the Chase the Ace fundraiser benefitting two local fire departments.      Reddick then pointed at MacInnis and said: \\"See you in court.\\"      \\"It was my ticket,\\" she told a group of people gathered for the ceremony. \\"I bought the ticket and now he's trying to lie and say I said split. I said split with the 50/50, not with no Chase the Ace.\\"      \\"I'm taking him to court. I'm getting a lawyer tomorrow. Now you can print that.\\"      Barb Reddick says she put her nephew's name on the winning ticket for good luck, but is now threatening to take him to court. 1:21      In order to play, people bought tickets as they would in a 50-50 draw. If their ticket was drawn, they got a percentage of the sales. If they drew the lucky ace of spades, they would win the jackpot.      By Wednesday night's draw, only two cards were left.      Although both names were on the winning ticket, Reddick denied that the two had an agreement.      Her nephew replied: \\"Yes, we did.\\"      \\"He's lying,\\" Reddick said.      \\"I put his name on the ticket for good luck because he's like a son to me — he was,\\" she said. \\"He was lucky, but not for half a million dollars.\\"      The contact number on the ticket was for MacInnis, who lives in Glace Bay, N.S.      Reddick said she had no intention of splitting the winnings with her nephew.      Bernice Curley, chair of the fundraiser, says she is disappointed at how the cheque presentation turned out. (Gary Mansfield/CBC)      Bernice Curley, chair of the Margaree Forks Chase the Ace committee, said she was floored.      She said because there were two names on the winning ticket, she wrote a cheque for half of the winnings to each person, after checking with province's alcohol and gaming division \\"to make sure I was allowed to do that. They were perfectly fine with that, that it would make it easier for everyone involved. So I split the cheque evenly.\\"      \\"I can't really explain it. I didn't expect anything like that to happen,\\" she said. \\"I just came to deliver the cheques and present them to the winners.      \\"I'm a little bit disappointed that happened at the end.\\"      Earlier Thursday morning, Curley told CBC's Information Morning Cape Breton that there was a good crowd on hand for the big win.      \\"The buzz was quite high,\\" she said.      \\"Everyone was pretty excited to see what was going to happen. Since the jackpot got higher, every week the crowd got bigger.\\"      \\"I think people in the area got a little frustrated. They're not used to having traffic gridlocked in Margaree Forks, but it was short-lived and it was great to see so many people come to the area.\\"      The proceeds are being shared by the Margaree Volunteer Fire Department and North East Margaree Volunteer Fire Department, which are getting new fire trucks and possibly emergency response vehicles.

She said she's been asked if she feels guilty about the money people are spending on tickets.      \\"I'm not sure. I'm really not sure where that money comes from,\\" Curley said.      \\"I'm more of a believer that if you weren't giving it to us, you'd be giving it to some other gambling idea.\\"      Rob Currie, who teaches at the Schulich School of Law at Dalhousie University, told CBC's Mainstreet the first thing that needs to be done is find out what rules and regulations are in place for this type of situation.      This would require looking at the rules from the Alcohol, Gaming, Fuel and Tobacco Division of Service Nova Scotia, which handle games of chance such as Chase the Ace.      He said there would also have to be evidence about what the terms of the agreement were; noting that an oral contract is \\"much dicier\\" than a written one.      He added that, because this dispute is about more than 25,000, it is too large to be brought to small claims court and it could only be brought to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.      \\"It could cost tens of thousands of dollars to both sides and it could drag on for years,\\" said Currie.      He said there are many disputes known to Canadian law about lottery tickets, and his impression is that none of them end very well.

Her nephew, Tyrone MacInnis, went there too, expecting the same. In the parking lot, she says, she asked the 19-year-old to sit in her car with her. She wanted him to look her in the eye and tell the truth, or what she believes to be the truth, that she never promised to split her winnings with him.      But MacInnis, and his parents, insisted he was entitled to half, Reddick says. So on Thursday, after posing for photos with the big cheque, the feud between an aunt and her nephew erupted in a painfully public way, with Reddick vowing to sue the teenager in front of a pack of news cameras.      “I’m taking him to court. It was my ticket,” she shouted. “Now he’s trying to lie and say I said split.”      People go crazy when it comes to money      According to Reddick, she sent MacInnis 100 via email transfer to buy her tickets for the Chase the Ace draw, a fundraiser for two volunteer fire departments in Margaree. She said she told him to put his name on the ticket, beside hers, only for luck, not because they planned on splitting any winnings. They’d been through this routine before with a weekly 50/50 draw in Glace Bay, and, Reddick says, there seemed to be some magic in Tyrone’s name.      “He’s always lucky with his draws, right?” said Reddick, a 57-year-old retired military supply tech. “I said ‘Well, put your name on the ticket and you’ll be my good luck charm.’”      “I didn’t say split. I never mentioned money at all.”      On Wednesday night, their ticket won the draw. In chase the ace — a growing phenomenon in the Maritimes — the winning ticket holder gets a cut of the nights’ tickets sales, but more importantly they get a chance at the jackpot. All they have to do is pull the ace of spades from a deck. If they don’t, the deck gets smaller, the jackpot gets bigger and the draw continues for another week. On Wednesday — after 50 weeks of no one pulling the ace — there were two cards left with a jackpot of 1.2 million. Since neither Barb nor Tyrone was at the firehall in Magaree Forks, a volunteer pulled their card for them. It was the ace.      Barb got a call at home in Guysborough with news that she and Tyrone had won.      “I said, ‘No I won! It was my ticket.’ ”      On Thursday, Barb said she asked Tyrone how much money he was expecting from the jackpot. Tyrone, she said, expected to split the pot. His parents got involved, saying Tyrone’s name was on the ticket and he was entitled to half, according to Reddick.      “I would have given him 150,000,” she said. “Listen, Tyrone was the son that I never had. Me and Tyrone — ask anybody — we’re very very close.”      “Tyrone is getting nothing from me,” she said. “It’s just for the principle. We were so close. He broke my heart. He broke it. … People go crazy when it comes to money.”      It wasn't pretty      Reddick went into the hall and stood beside her nephew, holding the novelty cheque for the assembled news cameras. Bernice Curley, the organizer, handed each a cheque for 611,319.      “It wasn’t pretty,” Curley said after.      The cheque for only half caught Reddick off guard. Then, she said, the reporters started asking questions. “Buddy said, ‘how do you feel?’ ” And Reddick started ranting about getting a lawyer and taking the young man to court. She looked at her brother — MacInnis’ father — and accused him of just wanting a new truck out of the whole thing. The father was escorted out of the hall, shouting to the reporters, asking them to keep his young son’s name out of the news. He declined to comment to the National Post afterward. “Respect my privacy please,” he said. His son, MacInnis, did not respond to messages and calls.      With their silence, it’s tough to tell what exactly happened between the aunt and the nephew she claimed to be more like a son. What is clear, from video of the cheque ceremony posted by both CBC and CTV, is that a relationship was broken by the hazards of the jackpot, not in a slow, fraying way, but instantly, and on television.      “I’ll never speak to him,” Reddick said, “in this lifetime or the next.”      • Email: jedmiston@postmedia.com | Twitter: jakeedmiston ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"A photo-op celebrating a 1.2 million lottery win in Nova Scotia turned into a family feud when Barbara Reddick and her nephew, Tyrone MacInnis, argued over the winnings.

Translate \\"Wireless Internet is available throughout the property.\\" to Spanish.","output":"El acceso a Internet inalámbrico está disponible en toda la propiedad. Explanation: In this translation, we have kept the meaning and context of the original English sentence intact while adapting it to Spanish grammar and conventions. Here is a breakdown of the translation: - \\"Wireless Internet\\" is translated as \\"Internet inalámbrico.\\" The term \\"inalámbrico\\" signifies the absence of wires or cords, which correctly conveys the idea of a wireless connection.    - \\"is available\\" is translated as \\"está disponible.\\" The verb \\"estar\\" (to be) is used in this context to express the availability of something in Spanish. The verb \\"estar\\" has been conjugated to agree with the third person singular form, \\"está,\\" in the present tense. The adjective \\"disponible\\" signifies that something is available or accessible, and agrees in gender and number with the noun it refers to, in this case, \\"Internet.\\" - \\"throughout\\" is translated as \\"en toda.\\" This prepositional phrase communicates the idea that the availability of wireless Internet is not limited to specific areas but rather extends across the entirety of the property. - \\"the property\\" is translated as \\"la propiedad.\\" This term accurately refers to an area or space owned or managed by someone, which is often used in descriptions of accommodation services or other establishments. Combining all these elements, we arrive at the translation \\"El acceso a Internet inalámbrico está disponible en toda la propiedad.\\" This sentence accurately and effectively communicates the original message in the target language, Spanish."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is on the east rim of the Pine Creek Gorge, also known as the Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania, which is 800 feet (240 m) deep and nearly 4,000 feet (1,200 m) across here. It also serves as headquarters for the adjoining Colton Point State Park, its sister park on the west rim of the gorge. Leonard Harrison State Park is known for its views of the Pine Creek Gorge, and offers hiking, fishing and hunting, whitewater boating, and camping. The park is in Shippen and Delmar Townships, 10 miles (16 km) west of Wellsboro at the western terminus of Pennsylvania Route 660. Pine Creek flows through the park and has carved the gorge through five major rock formations from the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. Native Americans once used the Pine Creek Path along the creek. The path was later used by lumbermen, and then became the course of a railroad from 1883 to 1988. Since 1996, the 63.4-mile (102.0 km) Pine Creek Rail Trail has followed the creek through the park. The Pine Creek Gorge was named a National Natural Landmark in 1968 and is also protected as a Pennsylvania State Natural Area and Important Bird Area, while Pine Creek is a Pennsylvania Scenic and Wild River. The gorge is home to many species of plants and animals, some of which have been reintroduced to the area. Although the Pine Creek Gorge was clearcut in the 19th and early 20th centuries, it is now covered by second growth forest, thanks in part to the conservation efforts of the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in the 1930s. The park is named for Leonard Harrison, a Wellsboro lumberman who cut the timber there, then established the park, which he donated to the state in 1922. The CCC improved the park and built many of its original facilities. Since a successful publicity campaign in 1936, the park has been a popular tourist destination and attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.

Question: I have been the brunt of cruelty from a doctor a number of times but I will relate one that has always stayed with me since I was a child. I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again.

A handsome but riotously cluttered melodrama with maybe 145 subplots. 6. It's McConaughey's commanding performance (or the way scenes between him and the equally camera-friendly Bullock practically eat through the screen) that will make this movie one for the history books. 7.

You can store the boxes on shelves or tables, but they’re also portable, which makes them ideal for taking LEGOs on the go.  A tool, tackle, or craft box works best for a small collection. If you have many pieces to hold, you may need multiple boxes. Avoid boxes with removable dividers because they are usually flimsy, and your LEGOs may end getting mixed together when you move the box around.

US is deeply concerned by reports that separatists are denying access.\\" Bociurkiw said the investigation will be difficult because the plane crashed in a difficult-to-access area in the countryside with no electricity. Many of the victims were on vacation. \\"I don't think too much of the crime scene has been compromised already,\\" Bociurkiw said. \\"The bodies are still there. They have not been tampered with. We actually spoke to some civilian emergency workers. They said their job was just to mark where the bodies are.\\" The FBI is sending two investigators to work on the case, a U.S. law enforcement official said, but the Ukraine government will be in charge of the investigation. Obama puts focus on Russia. The location of the flight recorder has not been determined. Ukrainian Economy and Trade Minister Pavlo Sheremeta told CNN's Richard Quest that MH17's black boxes are in Ukraine.  Sheremeta would not say, though, whether the government has them. \\"They are on Ukrainian territory. I don't know whether we have it or the international team has it,\\" he said. Earlier Friday, the adviser to the exiled governor of Dontesk told CNN's Victoria Butenko that the black boxes had been retrieved and were in rebel hands, though the location was not clear. Russia likely bears some of the responsibility for the apparent downing of Flight 17, President Barack Obama said. In the administration's strongest words yet on the downing of the jet, Obama said rebel fighters couldn't have operated the surface-to-air missile believed responsible for the shootdown \\"without sophisticated equipment and sophisticated training, and that is coming from Russia.\\" In his remarks to reporters, Obama said that he did not want to get ahead of the facts of who may have been directly involved in the airliner's destruction. But he said the United States would work hard to hold accountable those responsible for it. He and other U.S. officials stopped short of publicly placing the responsibility on Russia, which has denied involvement in the destruction of the jetliner. But a senior defense official told CNN that the \\"working theory\\" among U.S. intelligence analysts is that the Russian military supplied the Buk missile system to rebel fighters inside Ukraine. The United States believes the missile system was transferred into eastern Ukraine from Russia \\"in recent days or weeks,\\" a senior administration official told CNN, and that the system was operational at the time. The United States believes pro-Russian separatists could not have operated it without Russian training, the official said, noting that it's unknown whether Russian personnel were on scene when the plane was shot down. U.S. officials believe the plane was \\"likely downed by a surface-to-air missile ... operated from a separatist-held location in eastern Ukraine,\\" the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, told an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council.  If pro-Russian separatists are responsible for shooting down the plane with a missile, investigators can't rule out the possibility that Russia offered help to operate the system, she said. Power also said Russia should take steps to cool tensions in Ukraine. \\"Russia can end this war,\\" she said. \\"Russia must end this war. At least one American on board. Obama confirmed that at least one U.S. citizen was aboard the plane; Quinn Lucas Schansman was a student at International Business School Hogeschool van Amsterdam, according to his Facebook page. A majority of the passengers (at least 173) were Dutch. \\"No one can deny the truth that is revealed in the awful images that we all have seen, and the eyes of the world are on eastern Ukraine, and we are going to make sure that the truth is out,\\" Obama said. He called for an immediate cease-fire in the region and for a \\"credible international investigation\\" into what happened. MAPS: What route did the flight take? Among the evidence cited by U.S. officials and others for their conclusions was an audio recording released by Ukrainian intelligence officials which purportedly feature pro-Russian rebels and Russian military officers discussing a surface-to-air strike and the crash of a civilian jetliner. \\"How are things going there,\\" a man identified as a Russian intelligence agent asks. \\"Well, we are 100% sure that it was a civilian plane,\\" a man identified as a pro-Russian fighter responds. \\"Are there a lot of people?\\" the Russian officer asks. The rebel fighter then utters an obscenity and says, \\"The debris was falling straight into the yards.\\" CNN cannot confirm the authenticity of this audio, or other similar recordings. Also, in a news conference Friday, the chief of Ukraine's security service, Valentyn Nalyvaichenko, said the Buk missile system that shot down the airliner crossed the border from Russia only \\"right before\\" the attack. He didn't say how investigators know that, however. Ukraine's Interfax news agency reported claims by an adviser to Ukrainian Minister of Internal Affairs Anton Geraschenko that the launcher, as well as the flight data recorders from MH17, were handed over to Russian agents across the border at a checkpoint in the Luhansk area overnight. A senior Ukrainian official who spoke to CNN also accused Russia of carrying out a cover-up of its role in the shoot-down. He cited video showing a Buk launcher being moved toward Russia overnight. CNN could not independently confirm the claims. Should downed Malaysian jet have flown over Ukraine? Russia-Ukraine dispute. Tensions have been high between Ukraine and Russia since street protests forced former pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych from power in February. Russia subsequently annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region, and a pro-Russian separatist rebellion has been raging in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Ukraine's government has accused Russia of allowing weapons and military equipment, including tanks, to cross the border illegally into the hands of pro-Russian rebels. While Ukrainian officials implicated pro-Russian fighters and their Russian backers for the jetliner's downing, Moscow argued Ukraine was to blame. \\"With regard to the claims raised by Kiev, that it was almost us who did it: In fact I haven't heard any truthful statements from Kiev over the past few months,\\" Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an exclusive interview with the state-run Russia 24 TV channel. European Union leaders agreed this week to expand sanctions against individuals and entities in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine, with details to be decided by the end of the month. Expanded U.S. sanctions were also announced in Washington. Airspace closed. The Ukrainian Ministry of Infrastructure announced Friday that the airspace over Donetsk, Luhansk and part of Kharkiv where rebels are operating had been closed indefinitely. Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai defended the routing of the Malaysia Airlines plane over the region, saying other carriers were sending their aircraft through the same airspace. Three months ago, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration prohibited U.S. airlines from flying in areas some way south of where Flight 17 crashed Thursday. Thursday night, the FAA expanded the flight restrictions to all of eastern Ukraine. Airline's troubles. Thursday's crash marks the second time this year that Malaysia Airlines has faced an incident involving a downed plane. In March, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 people on board. Searchers have found no trace of the Boeing 777 or its passengers despite extensive search efforts. Flight 370 probably flew into the southern Indian Ocean on autopilot with an unresponsive crew, Australian authorities said last month. A new underwater search is expected to begin in August.

In Scotland, while a similar Gothic style to that used further south in England was adopted by figures including Frederick Thomas Pilkington (1832-98) in secular architecture it was marked by the re-adoption of the Scots baronial style. Important for the adoption of the style in the early 19th century was Abbotsford House, the residence of the novelist and poet Sir Walter Scott. Re-built for him from 1816, it became a model for the modern revival of the baronial style. Common features borrowed from 16th- and 17th-century houses included battlements gateways, crow-stepped gables, pointed turrets and machicolations. The style was popular across Scotland and was applied to many relatively modest dwellings by architects such as William Burn (1789-1870), David Bryce (1803-76), Edward Blore (1787-1879), Edward Calvert (architect) (c. 1847-1914) and Robert Stodart Lorimer (1864-1929) and in urban contexts, including the building of Cockburn Street, Edinburgh in Edinburgh (from the 1850s) as well as the National Wallace Monument at Stirling (1859-69).

As well as games, it also produced a large number of educational titles, extra computer languages and business and utility packages  these included word processor \\"VIEW\\" and the spreadsheet \\"ViewSheet\\" supplied on ROM and cartridge for the BBC Micro/Acorn Electron and included as standard in the BBC Master and Acorn Business Computer.  - Professor Peter D. Killworth (27 March 1946  28 January 2008) was an English scientist known for both his work on oceanography and the study of social networks. A prolific writer, he published more than 160 scientific papers over the course of his career. He was also known for his work as a pioneering author of text interactive fiction games during the early 1980s.  - BBC BASIC is a programming language, developed in 1981 as a native programming language for the MOS Technology 6502 based Acorn BBC Micro home/personal computer, mainly by Sophie Wilson. It is a version of the BASIC programming language adapted for a UK computer literacy project of the BBC.  - The Acorn Electron is a budget version of the BBC Micro educational/home computer made by Acorn Computers Ltd. It has 32 kilobytes of RAM, and its ROM includes BBC BASIC v2 along with its operating system.  - Interactive fiction, often abbreviated IF, is software simulating environments in which players use text commands to control characters and influence the environment. Works in this form can be understood as literary narratives, either in the form of Interactive narratives or Interactive narrations. These works can also be understood as a form of video game, either in the form of an adventure game or role-playing game. In common usage, the term refers to text adventures, a type of adventure game where the entire interface can be \\"text-only\\", however, Graphical text adventure games, where the text is accompanied by graphics (still images, animations or video) still fall under the text adventure category if the main way to interact with the game is by typing text. Some users of the term distinguish between interactive fiction, known as \\"Puzzle-free\\", that focuses on narrative, and \\"text adventures\\" that focus on puzzles.  - Countdown to Doom is a text adventure computer game, more recently termed interactive fiction, written in 1982 by Peter Killworth. Its setting is the planet Doomawangara, which is coyly said to be shortened to \\"Doom\\". There are two sequels, \\"Return to Doom\\" and \\"Last Days of Doom\\".  - Acorn Computers Ltd. was a British computer company established in Cambridge, England, in 1978. The company produced a number of computers which were especially popular in the UK, including the Acorn Electron and the Acorn Archimedes. Acorn's BBC Micro computer dominated the UK educational computer market during the 1980s. It is more known for its computer than for its other products.  - The Acorn Archimedes is a family of personal computers designed by Acorn Computers Ltd in Cambridge, England and sold in the late-1980s to mid-1990s, their first general purpose home computer based on their own ARM architecture (then the CPU and architecture was known as Acorn RISC Machine, or ARM, that later became one of the most widely used CPU architectures in the world, e.g. used in most smartphones). The first Archimedes was launched in 1987.  - The kilobyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. The International System of Units (SI) defines the prefix \\"kilo\\" as 1000 (10); therefore one kilobyte is 1000 bytes. The unit symbol for the kilobyte is kB. In information technology, particularly in reference to main memory capacity, \\"kilobyte\\" is traditionally used to denote 1024 (2) bytes. This arises from the powers-of-two sizing common to such memory in digital circuitry. In this context, the symbols K and KB are often used when 1024 bytes is meant.   - Oceanography (compound of the Greek words  meaning \\"ocean\\" and  meaning \\"write\\"), also known as oceanology, is the study of the physical and the biological aspects of the ocean. It is an Earth science covering a wide range of topics, including ecosystem dynamics; ocean currents, waves, and geophysical fluid dynamics; plate tectonics and the geology of the sea floor; and fluxes of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries. These diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the world ocean and understanding of processes within: astronomy, biology, chemistry, climatology, geography, geology, hydrology, meteorology and physics. Paleoceanography studies the history of the oceans in the geologic past.  - Castle of Riddles is a text adventure released by Acornsoft for the BBC Micro ( in 1982 ) and Acorn Electron ( 1984 ) home computers . The game was written by Peter Killworth and was one of a series of text adventures written for , or ported to the BBC Micro by the same author ( others including Countdown to Doom and Philosopher 's Quest ) . As with all such games , only text is used . The player must use a simple ' verb - noun ' format ( e.g. ' Go North ' , ' Get lamp ' ) to control the game . Unlike Killworth 's other Acornsoft adventures , Castle of Riddles was not updated and reissued by Topologika so became unavailable after 1985 when Acorn Computers ( parent company of Acornsoft ) pulled out of the games publishing market . Some of the puzzles however were included in the Topologika version of Philosopher 's Quest .  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - Topologika Software Ltd was an independent British publisher of educational software. Established in Stilton, Cambridgeshire in 1983, the company spent most of its life in Penryn, Cornwall before moving to Brighton, Sussex. The company was dissolved at the end of June 2013. Its educational software continues to be sold by distributors REM via , and is still supported by Topologika's founder Brian Kerslake.  - The BBC Microcomputer System, or BBC Micro, is a series of microcomputers and associated peripherals designed and built by the Acorn Computer company for the \\"BBC Computer Literacy Project\\", operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Designed with an emphasis on education, it was notable for its ruggedness, expandability, and the quality of its operating system. An accompanying 1982 television series \\"\\"The Computer Programme\\"\\" featuring Chris Serle learning to use the machine was also broadcast on BBC 2.  - The Acorn Business Computer (ABC) was a series of microcomputers announced at the end of 1983 by the British company Acorn Computers. The series of eight computers was aimed at the business, research and further education markets. However, the ABC range was cancelled before any of the models were shipped to customers.

In football, he was recruited by Alabama, Georgia, and Oklahoma, all of whom were willing to break the color barrier just for Jackson (Oklahoma had black football players before 1964- including Prentice Gautt, a star running back recruited in 1957, who played in the NFL with the St. Louis Cardinals). Jackson declined Alabama and Georgia because he was fearful of the South at the time, and declined Oklahoma because they told him to stop dating white girls. For baseball, Jackson was scouted by Hans Lobert of the San Francisco Giants who was desperate to sign him. The Los Angeles Dodgers and Minnesota Twins also made offers, and the hometown Philadelphia Phillies gave him a tryout but declined because of his \\"hitting skills\\".  His father wanted his son to go to college, where Jackson wanted to play both football and baseball. He accepted a football scholarship from Arizona State University in Tempe; his high school football coach knew ASU's head football coach Frank Kush, and they discussed the possibility of his playing both sports. After a recruiting trip, Kush decided that Jackson had the ability and willingness to work to join the squad.  One day after football practice, he approached ASU baseball coach Bobby Winkles and asked if he could join the team. Winkles said he would give Jackson a look, and the next day while still in his football gear, he hit a home run on the second pitch he saw; in five at bats he hit three home runs. He was allowed to practice with the team, but could not join the squad because the NCAA had a rule forbidding the use of freshman players. Jackson switched permanently to baseball following his freshman year, as he did not want to become a defensive back. To hone his skills, Winkles assigned him to a Baltimore Orioles-affiliated amateur team. He broke numerous team records for the squad, and the Orioles offered him a 50,000 signing bonus if he joined the team. Jackson declined the offer stating that he did not want to forfeit his college scholarship.  In the beginning of his sophomore year in 1966, Jackson replaced Rick Monday (the first player ever selected in the Major League Baseball draft and a future teammate with the A's) at center field. He broke the team record for most home runs in a single season, led the team in numerous other categories and was first team All-American. Many scouts were looking at him play, including Tom Greenwade of the New York Yankees (who discovered Mickey Mantle), and Danny Murtaugh of the Pittsburgh Pirates. In his final game at Arizona State, he showed his potential by being only a triple away from hitting for the cycle, making a sliding catch, and having an assist at home plate. Jackson was the first college player to hit a home run out of Phoenix Municipal Stadium.

Attending a public school for the first time, Cady meets new classmates Janis (Lizzy Caplan) and Damian (Daniel Franzese). The two warn Cady to avoid the school's most popular clique, the \\"Plastics\\", who are led by queen bee Regina George (Rachel McAdams) and include rich but insecure Gretchen Wieners (Lacey Chabert) and sweet airhead Karen Smith (Amanda Seyfried). The Plastics take an interest in Cady, and invite her to sit with them at lunch. Seeing that Cady is getting along with the Plastics, Janis hatches a plan of revenge against Regina for some past slight, using Cady as the infiltrator. Cady soon learns about Regina's \\"Burn Book\\", a journal filled with rumors, secrets, and gossip about the other girls and some teachers at school. Despite this discovery, Cady decides to forgo Janis's scheme for ethical reasons.

Only protein supplements so they can eat whatever they want; [2]. not enough information; [3]. More foods that are higher in protein; [4]. They'll consume less protein and more carbs for energy; Q: Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule.

Title: Fahrenheit 9/11 Movie plot: The movie begins by suggesting that friends and political allies of George W. Bush at Fox News Channel tilted the election of 2000 by prematurely declaring Bush the winner. It then suggests the handling of the voting controversy in Florida constituted election fraud. The film then segues into the September 11 attacks. Moore says Bush was informed of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center on his way to an elementary school. Bush is then shown sitting in a Florida classroom with children. When told that a second plane has hit the World Trade Center and that the nation is \\"under attack\\", Bush allows the students to finish their book reading, and Moore notes that he continued reading for nearly seven minutes. Moore then discusses the complex relationships between the U.S. government and the Bush family; and between the bin Laden family, the Saudi Arabian government, and the Taliban, which span over three decades. Moore alleges that the United States government evacuated 24 members of the bin Laden family on a secret flight shortly after the attacks, without subjecting them to any form of interrogation. Moore moves on to examine George W. Bush's Air National Guard service record. Moore contends that Bush's dry-hole oil well attempts were partially funded by the Saudis and by the bin Laden family through the intermediary of James R. Bath. Moore alleges that these conflicts of interest suggest that the Bush administration does not serve the interests of Americans. The movie continues by suggesting ulterior motives for the War in Afghanistan, including a natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan to the Indian Ocean. Moore alleges that the Bush administration induced a climate of fear among the American population through the mass media.

Now for the first time Payne wrote to a magazine from the prison about what happened on the night of 13 October 1999. I had to stay late at the hospital that night to do an operation. I finally left at about 11p.m.. I drove home slowly because the wind was blowing and it was raining heavily. I was running into our road when a man suddenly ran in front of my car. I almost hit him but I stopped just in time. I was scared and the man looked scared, too. I got out of the car but he ran away before I could ask if he was all right. It was very strange. When I got home, the lights were on but it was very quiet. I called to my wife but there was no answer. Then I remembered that she was out at a concert. I was still very unhappy about what happened on the road, so I made myself a drink. Then I went upstairs to have a bath. I saw that the window in the bedroom was open. This was strange because my wife always locked the doors and windows before she went out. She was afraid of burglars. When I went to close it, I found Ellen. She was lying on the floor. There was blood everywhere. I rushed over for her pulse but she was dead. I was so scared. I sat on the floor beside her body without knowing what to do. The next thing I knew was that the sky was getting light. I can't remember a thing about that night. In the morning I phoned the police. They arrived half an hour after I phoned them. But it seemed like hours. During that time I tried hard to remember anything I could about the night before. I couldn't stop thinking about the man in the road. What was he doing at that time of night in our quiet neighborhood? Question: In this passage Payne tried to  _  .

Senators, Flames struggling for consistency Two teams seeking salvation face off Wednesday when the Calgary Flames visit Canada's capital to take on the Ottawa Senators (7:30 p.m. ET). Calgary has dropped six of seven, while Ottawa is winless in four after a good start to the season. The Flames are wrapping up a three-game road trip that began with losses to the New York Islanders and Rangers.They totaled one goal in those setbacks. Offence has been hard to find for the Flames with super sophomore Johnny Gaudreau playing more of a setup role with nine assists among his team-leading 10 points. Three players — Jiri Hudler, David Jones and captain Mark Giordano — are tied for the team lead in goals with three as the Flames have only 16 goals in their first nine games. Calgary (2-7-0) has struggled at both ends of the ice in the early going. It has scored fewer goals (16) than all but three other teams entering Tuesday and only Columbus (40) has surrendered more goals than the Flames (35). Jonas Hiller has both of the Flames' wins in goal, coming in 3-2 overtime victories (over the Canucks and Red Wings). Ottawa looks to halt a four-game slide (0-2-2) that includes the first three contests of its four-game homestand. The Senators have scored a total of eight goals during their skid after tallying seven times in a victory at Columbus on Oct. 14. After opening the season with three victories in four games, the Senators have also seen a down-turn in their offence, as they were shut out by the Penguins, then lost a pair of shootouts to the Predators and Devils, before falling at home Saturday to the Coyotes, 4-1. Craig Anderson has six starts in goal for the Senators and all three of their wins thus far. His goals against average is 2.61. Ottawa (3-3-2) could be without Curtis Lazar, who did not participate in Tuesday's practice after suffering an upper-body injury in a loss to Arizona three days earlier. Max McCormick made his NHL debut against the Coyotes after being recalled from Binghamton of the American Hockey League on Friday. The 23-year-old right wing saw 13:32 of ice time on 16 shifts and recorded one shot on goal. Calgary and Ottawa split their two-game series last season, with each club winning at home — and the Senators doing so in a shootout. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1.

A:","output":"Kai is an individual who appears to experience heightened feelings of fear and anxiety, particularly when she finds herself in vulnerable situations, such as being home alone. This reaction suggests her emotional responses to potential threats or uncertainties can be intense, leading to a sense of unease and discomfort. Various factors may contribute to Kai's state of mind, such as her environment, upbringing, or personal experiences. It is important to delve deeper into these aspects to better understand her emotional landscape. From an environmental standpoint, Kai's fear when home alone might be influenced by the neighborhood she resides in or the size and layout of her house. For instance, if she lives in an area with a high crime rate or has experienced a break-in in the past, her anxiety may be well-founded. Alternatively, staying in a large or poorly lit house might exacerbate her fear, due to the perception of increased vulnerability in such a setting. Moreover, her upbringing and family dynamics can play a role in shaping the way Kai experiences anxiety when alone. If she has been continually exposed to overprotective parenting or has a history of trauma, her sense of security might be compromised, leading to heightened fear. Similarly, witnessing family members, particularly caregivers, exhibiting nervousness or apprehension about being home alone can condition her to mirror these behaviors. Additionally, aspects of Kai's personality may contribute to her fear. For example, if she has a naturally anxious temperament or suffers from an anxiety disorder, these factors can amplify her reaction to being home alone. In some cases, her fear might also be fueled by an overactive imagination, where she conjures up vivid and frightening scenarios that increase her sense of vulnerability. Furthermore, social and cultural influences can shape Kai's fear. Media and entertainment often feature stories that dramatize the potential dangers one can encounter when home alone, which can impact her perception of safety. Moreover, social conformity might compel her to adopt similar fears expressed by peers or popular culture, which she believes to be common or expected. In summary, Kai can be described as a person who experiences elevated fear and anxiety, particularly when home alone. Various factors contribute to these feelings, including her environment, upbringing, personal experiences, personality traits, and the influence of media and cultural norms. These factors can intertwine and intersect in complex ways, creating a unique emotional tapestry that defines Kai's reactions to potentially threatening or uncertain situations. In order to alleviate her fear and provide her with a greater sense of security, it is essential to understand and address these underlying factors through support, empathy, and appropriate interventions."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer.

The Bennets' residence is Longbourn House, a modest but comfortable country estate in this rural setting. Meryton serves as an important setting and social hub in the novel as it is the local village where most of the characters mingle and interact. The town is situated near other prominent locations in the story, such as Netherfield Park, the grand estate rented by Mr. Charles Bingley, one of the wealthy eligible bachelors in the story, and Rosings Park, the home of the imposing Lady Catherine de Bourgh. The social scene in Meryton revolves around assemblies, gatherings, and visits to one another’s homes. This allows the characters, including the five Bennet sisters, to engage in social activities, develop romantic interests, and pursue potential suitors, which is a fundamental aspect of the novel. The rural environment of Meryton and its surrounding estates is a crucial part of the story as it highlights the societal expectations and norms of early 19th-century England. Particularly, the novel showcases the concerns of families with daughters to secure advantageous marriages to ensure financial stability and social standing for themselves and their children. In summary, the Bennet family's hometown of Meryton plays an integral role in \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" providing an idyllic backdrop for the social interactions, romantic entanglements, and the exploration of societal norms that the novel aims to depict. The nuanced and complex relationships that develop within and around Meryton reveal the characters' true intentions, reflections on social class, and the pursuit of happiness and love in the context of early 19th-century England."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Justifying the steps: To further alleviate pain and discomfort from hammertoe, non-medical treatments are recommended before any surgical intervention. Hammertoe condition is often associated with pressure and stress on the toe. Although wearing proper shoes can reduce discomfort, using additional supportive devices can provide extra relief.

A podiatrist or similar medical professional will be able to provide the most accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment steps for an individual. It is crucial to remember that self-diagnosis or self-treatment may not always be sufficient, and professional medical advice should be sought for any lasting or severe health issues.  So, the most natural sequence after \\"Wearing ill-fitting shoes can prolong the issue and possibly make your hammertoe worse\\" would be: \\"Consider using over-the-counter pads, cushions, or straps to decrease stress on the toe, which can help minimize pain and discomfort. If non-surgical treatments are not relieving your pain or if your hammertoe becomes more severe, consider seeing a foot specialist, such as a podiatrist.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By July 16 it had burned more than 156469 acre . Alaska was experiencing an unusually hot and dry start to the summer season, which in turn led to a very active wildfire season. By the time the Minto Flats fire had become the largest fire in Alaska, over seventy other blazes were active throughout the state, stretching resources to their limits. The main body of the fire was deemed too large to actually try to extinguish, and firefighting efforts were focused from the beginning on protecting lives and property. In mid July it had grown to over 20000 acres , and was rapidly expanding along its souther edge; smokejumpers were deployed to protect cabins along the Teklanika River near Nenana. There is also an oil drilling rig in this area, and firefighters cleared the area surrounding it of fuel and instructed the drilling crew on the use of firefighting equipment. By the end of July, over 350 persons were involved in the firefighting effort, and continued hot, dry weather had helped the fire grow to over 300000 acres .

In which century plant species in northeast Michigan  were in less stress, sixteenth century or twentieth century?  In the sixteenth century the State of Michigan had forests all over. But that has long been gone.  Especially, in the state's northeast part the vegetation has been cleared in the twentieth century.  Wooded areas were replaced by farm lands. All these farmlands were under heavy Irrigation. At one time, in the sixteenth century, plant species like elm and oak used to be plentiful. We still had some elms and oaks in the twentieth century, but they were not great many in number.  Hint: Groundwater salinization compromises buffering properties. Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts.

With the addition of Stirratt, Coomer, and Johnston just prior to the recording of Anodyne, Farrar and Tweedy's relationship became more tumultuous, leading to verbal altercations after concerts. In one account, Tweedy recalled: Around this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, \\"Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.\\" He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore. Tweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore.

When dad arrived, he went as usual straight to watch the flowers. Seeing his flowers lying on the ground like dead animals, he was shocked at first. He looked towards the street to see if it was any of the neighbors' children who could have done it. Then he looked at mom in silence. Finally mom, who always taught us to tell the truth no matter what, said, \\"No bad neighbors did this great job, only your lovely daughter Clemence.\\" Dad's face changed into a smile and then he said, \\"Do I have better flower than my lovely daughter?\\" My younger sister smiled and hugged   dad strongly. ,.

Context: In 1981, when I was nine years old, my father took me to see Raiders of the Lost Ark. Although I had to squint my eyes during some of the scary scenes, I loved it – in particular because I was fairly sure that Harrison Ford’s character was based on my dad. My father was a palaeontologist at the University of Chicago, and I’d gone on several field trips with him to the Rocky Mountains, where he seemed to transform into a rock-hammer-wielding superhero. That illusion was shattered some years later when I figured out what he actually did: far from spending his time climbing dangerous cliffs and digging up dinosaurs, Jack Sepkoski spent most of his career in front of a computer, building what would become the first comprehensive database on the fossil record of life. The analysis that he and his colleagues performed revealed new understandings of phenomena such as diversification and extinction, and changed the way that palaeontologists work. But he was about as different from Indiana Jones as you can get. The intertwining tales of my father and his discipline contain lessons for the current era of algorithmic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI), and points to the value-laden way in which we “see” data. My dad was part of a group of innovators in palaeontology who identified as “palaeobiologists” – meaning that they approached their science not as a branch of geology, but rather as the study of the biology and evolution of past life. Since Charles Darwin’s time, palaeontology – especially the study of the marine invertebrates that make up most of the record – involved descriptive tasks such as classifying or correlating fossils with layers of the Earth (known as stratigraphy). Some invertebrate palaeontologists studied evolution, too, but often these studies were regarded by evolutionary biologists and geneticists as little more than “stamp collecting”.

Steven Gerrard, the integral component of Liverpool's midfield and key playmaker, stole the limelight for his goal during the match. Deployed in a position behind the striker Rickie Lambert, Gerrard handled the responsibility with aplomb, ensuring that the team advanced persistently. Last season, Gerrard was utilized in a deeper role, taking charge in front of the back four, and served as the anchor protecting the defense. This significantly enriched the transmission of the ball from defense to attack, allowing him to marshal the field with tactical and strategic brilliance. The change in Gerrard's role midway through the previous season had been a pivotal reason behind Liverpool's resurgence and their consequent second-place finish in the Premier League. It not only rejuvenated Gerrard's career but also showcased his versatility in adapting to different positions to benefit the team. In Tuesday's match against Leicester, Gerrard's new position allowed him to maintain a rhythm and balance, impacting the game from higher up the field. The shift in position enabled him to partner with Rickie Lambert in the final third and paved the way for his goal that significantly boosted Liverpool's morale. Despite slight reservations over his age and stamina, Steven Gerrard has proven time and again that his experience and skills outweigh his age. His adaptability to various positions on the field is a testament to his commitment and passion for the sport and his club. The victory against Leicester City marks the continuation of Liverpool's progression this season, as they now stand eighth in the Premier League table. Gerrard's goal, in particular, seems to have reinforced the team's spirit, instilling them with optimism and confidence to face upcoming challenges.

As the organist, keyboardist and saxophonist for Canadian-American rock group the Band, he was a principal architect of the group's unique sound. Hudson has been called \\"the most brilliant organist in the rock world\\" by Keyboard magazine. As of 2018, Hudson and fellow musician Robbie Robertson are the last original members of The Band who are still alive. Hudson was born in Windsor, Ontario, Canada. His parents, Fred James Hudson and Olive Louella Pentland, were musicians. His mother played piano and accordion and sang. His father, a farm inspector who had fought as a fighter pilot in World War I, played drums, C melody saxophone, clarinet, flute and piano. Hudson moved with his family to London, Ontario, around 1940. Classically trained in piano, music theory, harmony and counterpoint, Hudson wrote his first song at the age of eleven and first played professionally with dance bands in 1949 at the age of twelve. He attended Broughdale Public School and Medway High School before studying music (primarily Bach's chorales and The Well-Tempered Clavier) at the University of Western Ontario for one year; nevertheless, he grew increasingly frustrated with the rigidity of the classical repertoire.  In 1958, he joined a rock and roll band called \\"the Capers\\". He was reported to have said that he also gained some performance experience from playing at his uncle's funeral parlor. In December 1961, the 24-year-old Hudson joined the Hawks, the backing band for Ronnie Hawkins, which already consisted of 21-year-old Levon Helm on drums, 18-year-old Robbie Robertson on guitar, 18-year-old Rick Danko on bass and 18-year-old Richard Manuel on piano.  Fearing that his parents would think he was squandering his years of music education by playing in a rock and roll band, Hudson joined the band on the condition he be given the title \\"music consultant\\" and that his bandmates each pay him 10 a week for music lessons. Revealing a bit of the thinking behind his early fears, in The Last Waltz Hudson told interviewer-director Martin Scorsese: \\"There is a view that jazz is 'evil' because it comes from evil people, but actually the greatest priests on 52nd Street and on the streets of New York City were the musicians. They were doing the greatest healing work. They knew how to punch through music that would cure and make people feel good.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: who were his parents","output":"Eric Garth Hudson's parents were Fred James Hudson and Olive Louella Pentland. Like I said, his mommy played piano and accordion, and she also liked to sing. His daddy played drums, saxophone, clarinet, flute, and piano."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

But Ellen really became famous in 2001.Aged only 24,she was one of only two women who entered the Vendee Globe round the world solo race,which lasted 100 days.Despite many problems,she came second in the race out of 24 competitors and she was given a very warm welcome when she returned.    Ambition and determination have always been a big part of Ellen's personality.When she was younger,she lived in a kind of hut   for three years while she was trying to get sponsorship to compete in a transatlantic race.Then she took a one-way ticket to France,bought a tiny seven-meter Class Mini yacht,slept under it while she was repairing it,and then she raced it 4,000 kilometers across the Atlantic in 1997,alone for 33 days.    Ellen has had to learn many things,because sailing single-handed means that she has to be her own captain,electrician,sail maker,engineer,doctor,journalist,cameraman and cook.She also has to be very fit,and because of the dangers of sleeping for long periods of time when she's in the middle of the ocean, she has trained herself to sleep for about 20 minutes at a time.

The answer is:","output":"This review depicts the product in both a flattering and unflattering light. There are aspects of the review that praise the product, while other parts point out areas of disappointment.  On the one hand, the reviewer expresses disappointment about the absence of the top mounting piece, which suggests an unflattering aspect of the product. This missing piece might be a crucial component for some users, and its absence may lead potential buyers to think that the product is incomplete or not worth purchasing.  However, in the context of the entire review, this criticism is balanced by several positive comments about the product. The reviewer describes the product as a great buy, sturdy, and well made, which indicates that they see value in their purchase despite the missing component. They also mention how they are able to use the product effectively for stargazing with a pair of binoculars, further emphasizing that the product serves its purpose well and providing a more flattering portrayal. Moreover, the reviewer states that they are \\"completely satisfied\\" with the product, which reinforces the positive aspects of the review. This overall satisfaction might encourage potential buyers to consider purchasing the product despite the missing top mounting piece, as the other qualities of the product seem to outweigh this negative aspect.

While the missing top mounting piece is a point of disappointment, the reviewer's satisfaction with the product's quality, sturdiness, and functionality indicates that the product is still considered a valuable and worthwhile purchase.

These are our parameters to work with. k is the starting element, i determines the interval between elements, and A is the list from which we need to extract values. Part #2: Start with the kth element. Usage: Since k=3, we start with the 3rd element in list A which is '9687'. Part #3: Find every ith element. Usage: We need to find every 4th element (i=4) from the starting element. Here that means we'll take elements at positions 3, 7, and 11. This gives us the elements '9687', '709', and 't'. Part #4: Stop when the position of the next ith element exceeds the length of the list. Usage: The next 4th element would be at position 15. The length of list A is 21 elements. Since position 15 is within the length of the list, we don't have to stop yet. However, if we move another 4 elements, that would lead us to position 19. The length of list A is 21, so the next ith element (in this case, position 23) would exceed the length of the list. Thus, we stop at position 15.

They might view this advice as beneficial, and Taylor as helpful and insightful. Others might feel that Taylor's decision was cruel or invasive, as the decision to adopt or have a biological child is deeply personal and a significant choice made by the potential parents themselves. These individuals might think that it was inappropriate for Taylor to intervene in this way. In summary, people's feelings about Taylor's actions would likely vary based on their own beliefs, values, and perspectives. It's essential to consider multiple viewpoints and be understanding of the complexity of the emotional responses in this situation."},{"instruction":"Question: Information:  - Mateo \`\` Matty '' Rojas Alou ( December 22 , 1938 -- November 3 , 2011 ) was a Dominican outfielder who spent fifteen seasons in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) with the San Francisco Giants ( 1960 -- 1965 ) , Pittsburgh Pirates ( 1966 -- 1970 ) , St. Louis Cardinals ( 1971 -- 1972 , 1973 ) , Oakland Athletics ( 1972 ) , New York Yankees ( 1973 ) and San Diego Padres ( 1974 ) .

Avoid creating questions that (i) can't be answered correctly without actually understanding the passage and (ii) uses the same words or phrases given in the passage. Q: Context: To measure the serum highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and adiponectin levels, assess insulin sensitivity index (SI) and acute insulin response (AIR) in normal control (NC) subjects, patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), and further explore the possible correlation between hs-CRP and SI, AIR and adiponectin in IGT and newly diagnosed type 2 DM groups.', \\"Age and sex matched 28 normal subjects, 31 patients with IGT, and 31 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 DM were included in the study. SI and AIR were assessed by the reduced sample number of Bergman's minimal model method with intravenous glucose tolerance test in subjects of each group.\\", 'Compared with NC group, serum hs-CRP was significantly increased in IGT and type 2 DM groups (p < 0.001), although there was no significant difference between the latter groups. Hs-CRP was negatively correlated with high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), SI and adiponectin levels (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001), and positively correlated with systolic blood pressure (SBP), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), postprandial 2h plasma glucose (2hPG), fasting serum insulin (FINS) and postprandial serum insulin (PSI) in IGT and newly diagnosed type 2 DM groups (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). In general multivariate regression, only adiponectin was the significantly independent determinant for serum hs-CRP (regression coefficient -1.380; 95% CI -2.062 to 0.698, p < 0.001); meanwhile, TG, SI, hs-CRP, FINS, 2hPG and WHR were significantly independent determinants for serum adiponectin concentration (p < 0.05 to p < 0.001).

Context: If you turned on the TV towards the end of 2002 you could have been forgiven for thinking that Britain had gone absolutely horseshit mental. Every week, it seemed, another pretty young girl from a nice family, who was happy and popular and always did well at school, was being kidnapped or murdered by what the Sun newspaper cheerfully termed 'evil paedo scum'. Naming and shaming was as popular a feature in the Murdoch press as Page Three girls and discounted holidays to Butlin's. Of course you can't blame parents for wanting to keep their children safe; that's pretty much the job description of a parent. And, on the face of it, the tabloids were doing a public service in warning us about the paedophile menace lurking in our midst. The problem came when it turned out that a huge number of these concerned tabloid-reading parents were also absolute fucking morons. For every story of an actual sex offender being driven from their house by a baying mob there was one like that of Dr Yvette Cloete, a doctor at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, South Wales, who returned home from work to find that a group of 'concerned parents' had daubed the word 'paedo' on her front door in bright red paint. Dr Cloete was a consultant paediatrician. Easy mistake. If you're an absolute fucking moron. And so it was that one hung-over morning, after reading yet another story about vigilantes who had threatened to stone Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham killer Ian Huntley, to death during her high-profile trial for perverting the course of justice, I decided to set up a website parodying this collective national madness. The result of two or three hours of hung-over labour was thinkofthechildren.co.uk, a spoof campaign site which claimed to offer a handy online guide for crazy vigilantes of all stripes to co-ordinate their crazy vigilante efforts. Although there are a few parts of the site I'm still a bit proud of, the majority of it was, I freely admit, satire of the lowest order.

Answer a question about this article: In the U.S., a push for revisions of the FD&C Act emerged from Congressional hearings led by Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee in 1959. The hearings covered a wide range of policy issues, including advertising abuses, questionable efficacy of drugs, and the need for greater regulation of the industry. While momentum for new legislation temporarily flagged under extended debate, a new tragedy emerged that underscored the need for more comprehensive regulation and provided the driving force for the passage of new laws. What were the major issues that needed to be addressed?","output":"In this article, they talk about some big problems that needed to be fixed in the U.S. back in 1959. The major issues were: 1. Advertising abuses: This means that some people were not being honest when they talked about what their medicine could do. They might have said it could help with more things than it really could. 2. Questionable efficacy of drugs: Efficacy means how well something works. In this case, there were concerns that some medicines might not be working as well as they should or people just didn't know if they would work at all. 3. Need for greater regulation of the industry: Regulation means making rules to help control how things are done. The article says there was a need for more rules to make sure the people who make and sell medicine are doing it properly and safely. So, the major issues were that they needed to fix the way medicines were advertised, check if the medicines work well, and make more rules for the people who work with medicines to follow. This made sure that the medicines were safe and helpful for everyone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Options: - gain - supplies - helpful - help people - add to The answer to this question is:","output":"Being someone's taxi for the day while they run errands can be good for the world in a variety of ways. It not only exemplifies the essence of helpfulness, but it also has the potential to positively impact both the individual and the environment. The primary reasons why this action can be beneficial for the world include: 1. Promoting a sense of community and cooperation: When people help each other out with their daily tasks and errands, it fosters a culture of collaboration and mutual support. This increases social interaction and can contribute to a stronger society overall, where people are more friendly and willing to assist one another, thus creating a more enjoyable and harmonious atmosphere. 2. Reducing carbon emissions: Considering the increasing concerns about climate change and environmental degradation, taking on the role of being someone's taxi for the day can help reduce the number of individual car trips that take place. This, in turn, can lessen greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, and traffic congestion - all of which contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable environment. 3. Saving resources: By acting as a taxi for someone else, you effectively combine the errands of two or more people into a single trip. This can result in more efficient use of gasoline or electricity (if you are driving an electric car), thereby conserving resources and reducing the overall energy consumption. 4. Encouraging carpooling: When you provide a taxi service for others, you set an example for carpooling and inspire other people to do the same. This can lead to a more widespread adoption of carpooling as a regular practice, which can help in reducing the total number of vehicles on the road and thus decrease the negative environmental impacts of transportation. 5. Reducing stress and promoting mental well-being: Running errands can be a stressful endeavor, especially when dealing with transportation issues or time constraints. By helping someone with their errands, you can potentially reduce their stress levels and provide an opportunity for them to focus on other important aspects of their life. Additionally, the act of being helpful and assisting others can lead to increased happiness and a sense of accomplishment for the person providing the taxi service. 6. Strengthening relationships: Helping someone with their errands can lead to improved interpersonal relationships, as it allows for bonding experiences and shared moments of gratitude. This might eventually result in a stronger sense of connection between the individuals involved, further reinforcing the feeling of community and support. To sum up, being someone's taxi for the day while they run errands can be an immensely helpful and environmentally-conscious act. It promotes a sense of community, encourages sustainable practices, reduces stress, strengthens relationships, and conserves resources, all of which combine to make the world a better place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the first sentence – \\"Block an attack\\" – the word \\"block\\" is used as a verb meaning to prevent or defend against something. In this context, \\"block\\" refers to the action of stopping or hindering the attack from causing harm or achieving its intended purpose.

Yusuf Islam (born Steven Demetre Georgiou; 21 July 1948), commonly known by his former stage name Cat Stevens, is a British singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. His 1967 debut album reached the top 10 in the UK, and the album's title song \\"Matthew and Son\\" charted at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart. Stevens' albums Tea for the Tillerman (1970) and Teaser and the Firecat (1971) were both certified triple platinum in the US by the RIAA. His musical style consists of folk, pop, rock, and Islamic music. Immediately following the September 11 attacks on the United States, he said:  I wish to express my heartfelt horror at the indiscriminate terrorist attacks committed against innocent people of the United States yesterday. While it is still not clear who carried out the attack, it must be stated that no right-thinking follower of Islam could possibly condone such an action.

Question: suppose the nasal passages are clear happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen being brought to the body.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"Since the question is asking about the effect of clear nasal passages on bringing more oxygen to the body and the influence of this on the second effect mentioned, let's analyze the steps accordingly. Step 1: If the nasal passages are clear, air intake through the nose will be more efficient, leading to more oxygen being inhaled. Step 2: The air travels into the windpipe, which is not directly affected by the nasal passages being clear. So, there is no direct effect on this step. Step 3: The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes. Since more oxygen is being inhaled due to clear nasal passages, this step would result in a greater amount of oxygen being distributed to the lungs. Step 4: The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body. With more oxygen being supplied to the lungs, the blood can become more oxygenated, which implies that more oxygen will be available for transport to the body's cells. Step 5: Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body. This step is not directly influenced by clear nasal passages or more oxygen being inhaled, so the effect can be considered neutral. Step 6: The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream. This step is also not directly influenced by clear nasal passages or more oxygen being inhaled, so the effect is neutral. Step 7: The carbon dioxide is exhaled. This step is not directly influenced by clear nasal passages or more oxygen being inhaled, so the effect is neutral. From the analysis, a clear nasal passage leads to MORE oxygen being brought into the body. In the process, there is no direct influence on the second effect mentioned, which is the air traveling through the windpipe.

Movie title: Even the Rain Context: Sebastian (Gael Garcia Bernal) and Costa (Luis Tosar), both in their mid thirties, are life long friends only in the way a warring couple might be. Sebastian is an obsessive idealist who has sworn to his inner self that he will direct a film about one of the worlds most iconic figures, Christopher Columbus (Karra Elejalde). Not for him the hypocritical lies of a genius sailor on a divine mission to win souls for Christ. He is determined to upturn the entire conservative myth of Western Civilization's arrival in the Americas as a force for good. Rather, his story is about what Columbus set in motion; the obsession with gold, the hunt for slaves by Spanish mastiffs, and punitive violence to those Indians who fought back. His story is counterbalanced by the radical priests Bartolome de las Casas (Raul Arevalo) and Antonio Montestinos (Carlos Santos) who were the first to raise their voice in defence of the Indians, and ask the question, Are these men? Sebastian is also obsessed by the first Indian leader to resist - Hatuey (Carlos Aduviri), who was nailed to a cross and crucified as example to those who oppose the Christians. The talented and brilliant actor playing Columbus constantly challenges Sebastian and accuses him of agit prop and cheap manipulation. Costa doesn't give a shit. He cares little about what happened yesterday, never mind 500 years ago. The only thing that matters to him is his professional pride as a producer - that the film is made on time and within budget.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The first Indian leader to resist, as mentioned in the movie \\"Even the Rain,\\" was Hatuey (played by Carlos Aduviri). Hatuey was a Taino cacique (chief) from the island of Hispaniola (present-day Haiti and the Dominican Republic) who led a resistance against the Spanish conquistadors in the early 16th century. As Columbus and his crew arrived in the Americas, the indigenous peoples faced exploitation, violence, and forced conversion to Christianity. Hatuey relocated his people to the island of Cuba in an attempt to escape the Spanish invaders. However, Columbus's forces pursued and continued their oppressive actions on the new island. Hatuey led a resistance against the Spanish forces, uniting various indigenous communities in the battle against the foreigners. Despite his efforts, Hatuey was eventually captured, and as an example to those who dared to oppose the Christians, he was nailed to a cross and crucified. In the movie \\"Even the Rain,\\" Sebastian (Gael Garcia Bernal) is a director making a film about Christopher Columbus, aiming to expose the true nature of his expeditions and the detrimental effects they had on the indigenous population. The story of Hatuey plays a significant role in the narrative, as the character serves as a symbol of the resistance against the brutal colonization of the Americas. Sebastian's project also highlights the role of radical priests like Bartolome de las Casas (Raul Arevalo) and Antonio Montestinos (Carlos Santos), who were among the first to take a stand for the rights and dignity of the indigenous peoples oppressed by the colonial powers. The film-within-a-film unfolds amidst the socio-political backdrop of contemporary Bolivia, where the privatization of the water supply mirrors the conflicts of the past."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

In addition, the jury was not charged in the   Holding statements: (A) holding that under the former rules congress envisioned two separate petitions filed to review two separate final orders (B) holding that the evidence supported two separate convictions and punishments for two attempted robberies of two different victims who suffered separate and distinct harms (C) holding unanimity requirement not violated when charge stated two separate counts with two separate and distinct offenses in each case (D) holding that two distinct acts of assault with a deadly weapon taking place within a fifteen minute period were a part of the same incident and they could not reasonably be held to constitute two separate offenses each complete in itself and each of which would require a separate charge (E) holding that congress envisioned two separate petitions filed to review two separate final orders A:","output":"In this task, you are given a prompt from a judicial decision and multiple holding statements that are derived from citations in the legal decision.

Sincerity is a personal and subjective quality that is not always clearly apparent in written or spoken communication. Evaluating the sincerity of an apology can depend on various factors, such as the language used, the speaker's tone and body language, and the speaker's past behavior or actions. In this case, we simply lack enough data to reasonably evaluate the sincerity of Mark Halperin's apology.

The Red Cross exists in almost every country around the world. The world Red Cross organizations are sometimes called the Red Crescent, the Red Mogen Daid, the Sun, and the Red Lion.

In 1859, he observed how people were suffering on a battlefield in Italy. He wanted to help all the wounded people regardless of which side they were fighting for. The most important result of his work was an international treaty called the Geneva Convention . It protects prisoners of war, the sick and wounded, and other citizens during a war. The American Red Cross was set up by Clara Barton in 1881. Today the Red Cross in the United States provides a number of services for the public, such as helping people in need, teaching first aid and providing blood.

After 10 minutes of nothing but porn we turned it off and I have returned the movie to Amazon. Nowhere in the write ups did it mention this is a soft porn movie. It doesn't even have a rating, but it should be rated X. We're not prudes in any sense of the word, but this went way beyond mildly amuzing sexual scenes. Amazon had reccomended this after we had purchased a few other zombie movies. What's wrong with you Amazon? Do you even know what you are selling? I also found the portrayal of the one Native American as a drinking, vomitting idiot offensive. Definitely not a family or date movie. I could go on for a long time describing how awful this movie is, but I think you get te point by now. It shouldn't even be sold on Amazon - an adult bookstore maybe.

Given the idyllic image of the Dominican Republic as a paradise for vacationers, it can be shocking for some to learn that migrants from this country are putting their lives at risk in order to leave their homeland. The text suggests that the plights of these migrants reveal an uglier side to the nation that is often not seen or widely acknowledged by tourists and outsiders who frequent its beaches and resorts.

Judith at the Banquet of Holofernes - the lady in the picture had. previously been thought to have been Artemisia, Queen of Pergamon, about. to drink the ashes of her dead husband. The app ‘Second Canvas Museo del Prado’ brings together ancient paintings with modern technology to explore 14 of the famous gallery’s most celebrated masterpieces. It aims to do away with the velvet rope holding people back in galleries allowing anyone peer into the depths of a canvas and see details that would otherwise go unnoticed. An X-ray function reveals the layers of paint and the construction of the canvases, while infrared vision exposes the artists’ sketches beneath, which can often be drastically different to the final painting. An infrared view shows there was originally another figure in Judith at the Banquet of Holofernes waiting to with a sack to put the enemy general's head into. The X-ray vision function reveals Velázquez originally painted María Agustina de Sarmiento, handmaiden of the Infanta Margarita in Las Meninas with a much larger nose.

For instance, zooming into the face of Saint John the Evangelist from Rogier van der Weyden’s 'Descent from the Cross' reveals tears rolling down his cheeks. Looking at the painting through the infrared function shows a splash of blood across his throat that van der Weyden later removed. The X-ray vision function also reveals Velázquez originally painted María Agustina de Sarmiento, handmaiden of the Infanta Margarita in Las Meninas, had a much larger nose. In 'Descent from the Cross', painted for the chapel of the crossbowmen’s guild in Leuven, Belgium, zooming in to the highest level reveals tiny crossbows in the very top left and right corners. People have often thought that the shape of Christ’s body in the painting is positioned like a crossbow too, revealing intriguing hidden symbolism. The incredible skill of this painting is also evident when you zoom in, the tears on the Virgin Mary’s face look like water on the canvas. Meanwhile, 'Judith at the Banquet of Holofernes' had at one time been thought to picture Artemisia, Queen of Pergamon, about to drink the ashes of her dead husband. However, the infrared view reveals that there was originally another figure in the painting, waiting with a sack to for the enemy general’s head, identifying the main figure as Judith. The museum created giga-pixel images of the paintings five years ago including the Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch and Self-Portrait by Dürer. To do this they combined thousands of high-resolution images to create one giant image of 1,000,000,000 or more pixels. This means the user can see the image in unprecedented detail. The app lets users zoom in and out to read the explanations of the key symbolic details of each painting. As well as exploring the works of art, users can interact with them, choosing their favourite detail to share with friends online. Gabriele Finaldi, deputy director of the museum, believes it provides a new level of understanding of the artwork, but that the app is not intended to replace looking at the original. ‘What we're presenting with this app is the opportunity to get right up close, taking you by the hand to show you details you might never notice,’ he said. ‘Visitors in the gallery can spend a minute, even just half a minute, looking at a picture. With the app you can explore every centimetre of the work of art in your own time on your iPad, leading to a deeper understanding of how it was created and every detail the artist included.’ Madpixel, the developers behind the app, hope to work with further galleries and museums to roll the technology out globally.

Plot title: The Croods Movie plot: Eep (Emma Stone) is a girl in a family of cavemen living and hunting in pre-historic times. Her family is one of the few to survive, mainly due to the strict rules of her overprotective father, Grug (Nicolas Cage). In their cave home, Grug tells a story to the family, which includes his wife Ugga (Catherine Keener), his daughter Sandy, his son Thunk (Clark Duke), and his mother-in-law Gran (Cloris Leachman). He uses the story of a character who mirrors Eep's curious nature to warn the family that exploration and 'new things' pose a threat to their survival, and says to never not be afraid. This irritates the bored and adventurous Eep, and after the family falls asleep, she leaves the cave, against her father's advice, when she sees a light moving outside.Seeking the light's source, she meets Guy (Ryan Reynolds), a clever and inventive caveboy. She at first attacks him but then becomes fascinated with the fire he creates and is eager to learn more. He tells her about his theory that the world is reaching its 'end' and asks her to join him. She refuses and Guy leaves, but not before giving her a noise-making shell to call him if she needs help. Eep is then caught by Grug (who had been searching for her), and is later grounded for what she had done. Grug brings Eep home and is joined by the rest of the family. Eep tells them about Guy and shows them the shell given to her, only for them to destroy it in fear of 'new things'. An earthquake then occurs, sending everyone running for the cave, only to be stopped by Grug moments before the cave is destroyed by falling rocks. They climb over the wreckage to discover a land with lush vegetation, much different from their usual surroundings of rocky terrain. Grug takes his family into the forest to find a new cave.The family is chased by a \\"Macawnivore\\" (a large, macaw-colored machairodont later called \\"Chunky\\") and attacked by a swarm of \\"Piranhakeets\\" (deadly red-feathered, piranha-like birds).

Though prehistoric remains from the Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Ages have been unearthed in the Manzanares Valley, prior to Madrid's sudden elevation to capital city in 1561 its history was rather undistinguished. Over a period of many centuries crucial in Spanish history, Madrid's significance was negligible. The Romans built their most advanced outpost on the Iberian peninsula, but left nothing of consequence in Madrid. Armies of North African nomads, intent on disseminating Islam, invaded the peninsula in a.d. Within 10 years, they had overrun most of Spain. If Madrid played any role in these pivotal events, no record of it remains. The first solid references to this obscure settlement on the Castilian plateau, guarded by the looming Guadarrama mountain range, appear in the 9th century. The Arabic name for \\"place of many springs,\\" variously recorded as Magerit, Mayrit or Magrit, eventually evolved into Madrid. The hamlet entered historical chronicles for its military significance; it was located near the main line of resistance to the Christian reconquest. Over centuries of struggle, the defending Moorish army built a full-scale fort, or Alcázar, on the heights of Madrid commanding the Manzanares valley. After several unsuccessful skirmishes, the Christian forces of Alfonso VI captured Madrid in 1083. The Alcázar became a fort of the crown of Castile. During a counter-offensive in 1109, the town was overrun by the Moors, but the Christianized fortress held. The Moors were expelled from the town, but they remained in control of southern Spain for almost four centuries. Meanwhile, Madrid enjoyed brief prominence in 1308 when king Ferdinand IV and his Cortes, an early version of parliament, held a formal meeting in the fledgling town. From then on, the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid, where the air was invigorating and the hunting excellent. Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic monarchs that united all the provinces of Spain, first visited Madrid in 1477.

To learn more about the science behind skin colors he categorized the skin colors into two broad groups, case D and case L. Case D is represented by darker skin and case L is represented by lighter skin.  In which case melanocytes would produce less melanin, case D or case L?  Hint: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. The answer to this question is:","output":"Case L.  Let's delve into the specifics to understand this more clearly. Melanocytes are the cells found in the basal layer of the epidermis, the outermost layer of our skin. They are responsible for the production of melanin, a pigment that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color.  Now, fundamentally, every human, regardless of their skin color, possesses approximately the same number of melanocytes. The variance in skin color that we see globally is not due to the number of melanocytes present in the skin but depends on the amount and type of melanin these melanocytes produce and disperse to the surrounding skin cells called keratinocytes.  In case D, which represents darker skin, melanocytes tend to produce more melanin. This results in a darker skin complexion, which essentially acts as a natural, in-built sunscreen. This increased melanin production serves as a protective mechanism against the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun, by absorbing and scattering the UV rays, thereby reducing their penetration into the skin and the potential damage to the vulnerable skin cells. In contrast, in case L, representing lighter skin, melanocytes produce less melanin. Hence, the skin appears lighter or fairer. The lighter skin color in this group allows for more efficient production of Vitamin D in response to sunlight exposure because less melanin is present to block the UV radiation. However, people in this category are more prone to skin damage from excessive UV radiation exposure due to the lower concentration of melanin, which is why they are also at a higher risk for skin cancers. To wrap up, the melanocytes in individuals represented by case L, meaning those with lighter skin, would produce less melanin compared to those represented by case D, or those with darker skin."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Agent Stahl twists the story to make it seem like Gemma is responsible for both crimes. The situation is further complicated because Gemma is also wanted for questioning regarding the kidnapping of her grandson, Abel, by the Irish True IRA. Throughout Season 3, Gemma faces various challenges while in jail, including trying to maintain her hard exterior and strength. She also contends with her deteriorating relationship with Clay and the tense situation involving the club, who were battling external threats and internal strife. As Gemma deals with these matters, she becomes even more concerned about the fate of her son, Jax, who ends up being targeted by Agent Stahl in a scheme aimed at making Jax look like a rat to the other members of the motorcycle club, SAMCRO. Gemma learns about Stahl's plan and faces intense emotional turmoil as she watches Stahl set Jax up to be killed by his own club members. However, unbeknownst to Gemma and Stahl, Jax had already informed the club members about the scheme, and as a result, they were all in on the plan. The tension reaches a boiling point when Jax sends a letter to Gemma that reveals the true nature of the secret deal, assuring her that he was never a rat and that the club members were fully aware of the plan.

The man tried to store the statue inside the home but the","output":"The man tried to store the statue inside the home but the home was too small, making it impossible for him to accommodate the statue without causing significant disruptions to his living space and potentially damaging both the statue and the surrounding household items. As the man had put a lot of effort and money into purchasing the statue, he was understandably dismayed upon realizing that it would not fit in his desired location within his abode. The statue, which was a grand representation of his favorite historical figure, had been acquired during his travels, and he saw it as the perfect addition to elevate the aesthetics of his residence. The disproportionate size of the statue relative to the man's home meant a series of issues arose when attempting to maneuver it into place. First, navigating the statue through the doors and entryways proved to be a challenging and delicate operation, with careful consideration needed to avoid scrapes or damages. The man had underestimated the towering height and considerable weight of the statue, and so the endeavor was made even more arduous. Additionally, the man encountered difficulty in finding a suitable spot to place the statue that wouldn't obstruct essential pathways or lead to overcrowded conditions in the living spaces. As he went from room to room, assessing available areas, his disappointment mounted; the reality of the situation became increasingly clearer. While the man was, by all means, a resourceful individual, he quickly realized that fitting the colossal statue into his modest home would require more than just ingenuity. It would call for significant rearrangements of existing furniture, if not the removal of entire pieces altogether. In some instances, even structural adjustments to the property came into question, as the sheer presence of the statue could impact the building's integrity. The scenario forced the man to explore alternative solutions to his predicament. He began to consider placing the statue outdoors, where its imposing form could be better appreciated and without causing potential damage to his belongings. This, however, would necessitate the purchase of protective materials and coatings to safeguard the statue against the elements, which added an additional layer of concern for its preservation. In another scenario, the man contemplated if renting or purchasing a larger property would be a viable route to take, but this quickly became dismissed as an impractical and financially unfeasible option. He was left with the difficult decision of potentially parting ways with the beloved statue altogether or finding a way to integrate it into his home somehow, despite the limited space he had at his disposal. Ultimately, this scenario aptly illustrates the importance of planning and foresight when acquiring large, decorative items such as statues. A thorough understanding of the dimensions and restrictions of one's living environment, alongside a proper evaluation of weight, size, and material requirements, are all essential factors to navigate in order to prevent similar challenges from arising in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Hoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the Packers, the Vikings' Week 11 opponent was the Oakland Raiders, who had former Vikings quarterback Daunte Culpepper under center. After a 79-yard pass from wide receiver Sidney Rice to Visanthe Shiancoe on the first play from scrimmage, the Vikings scored on the very next play on a 10-yard run from Chester Taylor. This was followed by a safety when Culpepper was penalized for intentional grounding in his own endzone. Two plays after the ensuing free kick, the Vikings fumbled the ball just inside Oakland territory, allowing the Raiders to set up a 42-yard field goal for Sebastian Janikowski. On the next drive, the Vikings restored their nine-point lead as kicker Ryan Longwell hit a 30-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter. A short Oakland drive culminating in 10-yard touchdown pass from Culpepper to tight end John Madsen, followed by another Janikowski field goal, saw the Raiders take the lead for the first time. Four plays later, Minnesota regained a six-point lead on a 38-yard touchdown run from Taylor, but field goals of 42 and 49 yards from Janikowski meant the first half ended with the scores level at 19-19. The Vikings recorded the only score of the third quarter on a 38-yard field goal from Longwell, though they did finish the period on the Raiders' 6-yard line, allowing Taylor to run in his third touchdown on the opening play of the fourth quarter, the first time in his career that he scored three touchdowns in one game. A 52-yard field goal from Janikowski narrowed the margin to 7 points with less than three-and-a-half minutes to play, and after forcing the Vikings to punt just inside the two-minute warning, they had one last chance to level the scores. On the first play of the drive, Culpepper threw the ball in the direction of Justin Fargas, who tipped it up, allowing Chad Greenway to come up with an interception; he went to ground with the ball, but inexplicably got up and attempted to advance it, which allowed left tackle Barry Sims to force a fumble, recovered by right guard Paul McQuistan. That enabled the Raiders to extend their drive, but although they managed to get into Vikings territory, a false start penalty meant Culpepper had to attempt a Hail Mary pass on the final play, but it came up short, giving the Vikings a 29-22 win.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The human body has hundreds of muscles. The three types are skeletal  muscles, smooth muscles and cardiac, or heart muscles. Each kind of muscle has a special job to do. The skeletal muscles are attached to the bones; they actually hold the skeleton together. Strong cords, called tendons , help connect these muscles to the bones. Skeletal muscles give us strength and allow us to move in many ways. If you look at skeletal muscles through a microscope, you will see that it has bands of fibers that look like stripes . These stripes are called striations. Skeletal muscles usually move because the brain has sent a conscious message to them telling them what to do. This is called voluntary movement. Another type of muscle is smooth muscle. Unlike skeletal muscle, smooth muscle does not have striations. This is found in organs such as the stomach, the bladder , the lungs and the eyes. Smooth muscles are smaller than the skeletal muscles and they move involuntarily. The brain tells these muscles what to do, but we aren't even aware of it. For example, we don't have to think about breathing or digesting food. The smooth muscles just do their jobs automatically. For this reason smooth muscles are sometimes called involuntary muscles. Like smooth muscle, cardiac muscle also works involuntarily. It is a very thick muscle that is found only in the walls of the heart. Its job is to pump blood out of the heart and into blood vessels called arteries . The arteries help carry the blood to all parts of the body. When the cardiac muscles relax, they let blood back into the heart. Cardiac muscles have striations, just like skeletal muscles do. Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? Answer: Pick from: [I] Heart muscles are very important because they give us strength and allow us to move. [II] The heart of human beings completely consists of heart muscle.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Lissitzky was born on November 23, 1890 in Pochinok, a small Jewish community 50 kilometres (31 mi) southeast of Smolensk, former Russian Empire. During his childhood, he lived and studied in the city of Vitebsk, now part of Belarus, and later spent 10 years in Smolensk living with his grandparents and attending the Smolensk Grammar School, spending summer vacations in Vitebsk. Always expressing an interest and talent in drawing, he started to receive instruction at 13 from Yehuda Pen, a local Jewish artist, and by the time he was 15 was teaching students himself. In 1909, he applied to an art academy in Saint Petersburg, but was rejected. While he passed the entrance exam and was qualified, the law under the Tsarist regime only allowed a limited number of Jewish students to attend Russian schools and universities. Like many other Jews then living in the Russian Empire, Lissitzky went to study in Germany. He left in 1909 to study architectural engineering at a Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany. During the summer of 1912, Lissitzky, in his own words, \\"wandered through Europe\\", spending time in Paris and covering 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) on foot in Italy, teaching himself about fine art and sketching architecture and landscapes that interested him. His interest in ancient Jewish culture had originated during the contacts with a Paris-based group of Russian Jews led by sculptor Ossip Zadkine, a lifetime friend of Lissitzky since early childhood, who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora. Also in 1912 some of his pieces were included for the first time in an exhibit by the St. Petersburg Artists Union; a notable first step. He remained in Germany until the outbreak of World War I, when he was forced to return home through Switzerland and the Balkans, along with many of his countrymen, including other expatriate artists born in the former Russian Empire, such as Wassily Kandinsky and Marc Chagall.Upon his return to Moscow, Lissitzky attended the Polytechnic...

You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer.

Write the answer: \\"The saying \\"\\"Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful\\"\\" is commonly attributed to whom?\\"","output":"The saying \\"Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful\\" is commonly attributed to a prominent historical figure named Lucius Annaeus Seneca, also known as Seneca the Younger, who was a Roman philosopher, statesman, and playwright. However, despite this attribution, there is ongoing debate among scholars regarding the true origins and authorship of this statement. Seneca the Younger was born in 4 BCE in Corduba, Spain, and lived until 65 CE, making him a contemporary of Jesus Christ and the early Christian Church. Throughout his life, he held various posts in Roman politics and was a well-established and influential figure within the Roman Empire. Seneca was a prolific author of works including moral epistles, essays, and tragedies, and he was also one of the leading practitioners of the Stoic school of philosophy. Given Seneca's prominence in the philosophical and political spheres, it is not surprising that such an insightful and thought-provoking quote about religion would be attributed to him; however, the authenticity of this attribution is frequently debated. The statement does not appear in any of Seneca's surviving works, and the argument for the attribution primarily seems to be based on the idea that it is consistent with his philosophical views on religion. Some scholars also suggest that another possible source of the quote is Edward Gibbon, an 18th-century historian who is best known for his six-volume work, \\"The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.\\" Gibbon was a rationalist and had strong doubts about the claims of supernatural intervention in human affairs. Although more often attributed to Seneca, the statement could be derived from Gibbon's work, as he was well-versed in Roman history and philosophy. Another theory is that the quote might have been derived from Niccolò Machiavelli, the 16th-century political philosopher who famously analyzed the uses and misuses of power in his work \\"The Prince.\\" Machiavelli, renowned for his somewhat cynical and unsentimental view of human behavior, could have made such an observation about religion being useful for rulers in maintaining control and order. However, like Seneca, this statement does not appear in Machiavelli’s surviving works, making the attribution uncertain. As it stands, there is no definitive proof as to the origins of the saying and the identity of its author. It is important to recognize that the quest for the authorship of this statement helps us examine the cultural and political significance of religion throughout history. Furthermore, the saying encourages an ongoing conversation about the nature of religious beliefs and the motivations of individuals in their attitudes towards such beliefs. While commonly attributed to Seneca, the true author may remain unknown, and, as such, the quote should be analyzed and considered with the understanding that its origins and authorship are uncertain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Step 1: Analyze the similarity between the two questions. Both questions are focused on increasing visibility on Quora, but the first question specifically asks about increasing visibility for comments, while the second question is about overall visibility on the platform. Step 2: Evaluate if the answers to the questions could be similar or different. Given that both questions deal with visibility on Quora, it is possible that some strategies may overlap, such as providing valuable content, being active, and interacting with other users. However, there are probably more specific strategies for each question, such as following posts and being active in comments for Question 1, and creating high-quality answers, optimizing your profile, and engaging with followers for Question 2. Step 3: Determine the answer to the OPT options. Given the evaluation in Step 2, it can be deduced that the answer to these two questions might not be exactly the same, although there may be some overlapping strategies. OPT: 1). no. 2). yes. Answer: Option 1 (no)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Context: Protocadherin-15 (PCDH15) is one of the five genes currently identified as being mutated in Usher 1 syndrome and defines Usher syndrome type 1F (USH1F). When PCDH15 was systematically analyzed for mutations in a cohort of USH1 patients, a number of deletions were found. Here we characterize these deletions as to extent, position, and breakpoints.', 'Microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses, used in a preliminary survey of an Usher cohort of 31 patients, revealed large deletions in three patients. These deletions were further characterized by semiquantitative PCR assays to narrow down the breakpoints.', 'The analysis of the three large deletions revealed that all six breakpoints are different. The breakpoint junction was identified in one patient and the four other breakpoints were mapped to 4 kb. There were no specific distinguishing features of the isolated breakpoints. Answer: A complete screen of PCDH15 should include a search for large deletions. Failure to screen for gross genomic rearrangements is likely to significantly lower the mutation detection rate. A likely explanation for the high rate of such deletions is the unusual gene structure. PCDH15 gene spans nearly 1 Mb for a corresponding open reading frame (ORF) of 7,021 bp. The intron sizes of PCDH15 are up to 150 kb, and the first three exons of the gene cover 0.42 Mb. The genomic structure of any gene should be taken into consideration when designing a mutation screening strategy.","output":"Question: What should a complete screen of PCDH15 include in order to avoid significantly lowering the mutation detection rate, and what is a likely explanation for the high rate of large deletions in this gene?"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. We got the spinach dip, it was gross and thick, too much cream cheese I think. The pizza was really good! I was disappointed there was no kids menu, seeing as it's called sugar factory.... We had to pay extra for the two kids to split the pizza as well. There were flies flying around inside!!! And the windows and balconies were not open!!! I thought this would be a nicer place, but really wasn't, especially for the prices you pay. And the tables are tiny!...our food barely fit in the table. Won't go again! They're cocktails did look amazing though! Did not try one. Is this review positive or negative?
