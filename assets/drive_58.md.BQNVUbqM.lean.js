The visit is still fresh in my mind. Let me share the things which I feel a person will only believe when they visit Mumbai . Safe for women. We were roaming in Marine Drive at around 2 at night and there were many girls/women walking in groups of two or three or even alone wearing short clothes and everyone were minding their own business (not judging here, but describing so that one gets the idea of how free and relatively safer women are here). I cannot imagine the same thing here in Delhi !Girls have freedom to wear and do what they like without being judged and ogled upon. Hats off to people of Mumbai (Mumbaikars ?) for providing this kind of environment ! People here follow queue almost everywhere. It was a shocker for me and my family coming from Delhi to Bombay for the first time. At Bus stops, ticket counters, and people were even standing in queue for taking shared auto, it was such a delight for us.We must have taken around 12–15 auto rides in our short journey of 5 days and all the auto drivers took us by meter, here in Delhi it is difficult to find autos that charge you according to meters. Mostly they will say a fixed amount(which is always higher than meter price) and it is upon the person to bargain and negotiate to bring the cost down. The people of Mumbai are more open/ matured and generally mind their own business. My sister lives there and told us that she was much more comfortable staying and working in Mumbai than Delhi.The architectural structures of Mumbai are exceedingly great. Just awesome- The traffic jams are very very bad, but we did not felt it much as we live in south Delhi where traffic is always bad to extremely bad on any given day. For the people who are visiting Mumbai from a place where there is less/no traffic jams, they will be in for a surprise.Crowd crowd everywhere. The city of Mumbai is crowded like hell and this goes without saying as it is the most populous city in the country with one of the highest population density in the world. Finally the city never seems to sleep and everyone is busy all the time. It was a great experience all in all. I would really wish to visit Mumbai once again If I get a chance for sure. The city leaves it’s magic onto you !

Khariboli was spoken far earlier in the Delhi area, the original Hindi. Why people probably assume Urdu is original is because most Indians and other South Asians today do not speak shubh Hindi or pure Hindi in day to day life. Colloquial Hindi uses about 30% Urdu, but it is still not “pure Urdu” either. But we do not need to get into pointless competitions of which language is older/more original/more prestigious.

It is designed to provide excellent support to the back and spine, which can help reduce the risk of developing back pain or other musculoskeletal disorders caused by sitting for prolonged periods. While the Aeron chair is quite expensive, it may be worth the investment if you spend a significant amount of time sitting in your home office and prioritize your long-term health and comfort. Additionally, Herman Miller is known for its high-quality materials and construction, which means that the Aeron chair should last for many years with proper care. That being said, there are also other ergonomic chairs available that may be more affordable than the Aeron chair while still providing excellent support and comfort. Some popular options include the Steelcase Leap, the Haworth Zody, and the Humanscale Freedom. These chairs offer similar features and benefits to the Aeron chair, but they may be available at a lower price point. Ultimately, the best chair for your home office will depend on your specific needs and preferences, as well as your budget. It may be worth researching and trying out different chairs before making a decision to ensure that you find one that is comfortable and supportive for your body.More information:[LINKED_TEXT: https:/sites.google.com/view/sunny-nail-fishkill/] [URL: https://sites.google.com/view/sunny-nail-fishkill/]"},{"instruction":"What are some tips for writing your PhD thesis?","output":"Writing a PhD thesis is a significant undertaking that can be both challenging and rewarding.

But do the bottles hold the same amount of wine?","output":"Yes. Wine (and spirits for that matter) are highly regulated and only vary from the typical (750ml, 1L, 1.5L) volumes by micro milliliters thanks to computer automated filling machines. If you look at a bottle with punt and without you’ll notice very small differences in size of the bottle, fill line, thickness of the glass, etc; this is to offset the slight interior volume differences that a punt might create. “Historically, punts were a function of wine bottles being made by glassblowers. The seam was pushed up to make sure the bottle could stand upright and there wasn't a sharp point of glass on the bottom. It's also thought that the punt added to the bottle's structural integrity.” -Dr. Vinny, Wine Spectator Historically as well when glass was blown instead of pressed into a machine the punt allowed the wine maker to actually create a more consistent interior volume as they could push the punt further into or less far into the depths of the bottle while keeping a consistent exterior look and shape to the bottles. So with today much more automated glass making process a punt is more decorative than necessary."},{"instruction":"Why did Melinda Gates say choosing to divorce Bill was her 'lowest moment?","output":"Perhaps because she never in her wildest dreams imagined that her husband might be problematic in the way(s) that he was?

It may sound simple, but it's a powerful reminder to be kind, empathetic, and respectful toward others. I once came across a story of a young boy who had trouble making friends at school. His grandmother told him to try treating his classmates the way he would want to be treated. He took her advice and started complimenting his classmates, sharing his snacks, and helping them with their homework. Soon, he made many friends and became known as one of the most generous and friendly students in the school. This advice can apply to all aspects of life, not just making friends. It can help you build better relationships, avoid conflicts, and create a more positive environment around you. It's a timeless piece of advice that has been passed down through generations and has remained relevant today. Another piece of advice that I find interesting is to \\"embrace failure.\\" It's easy to fear failure and to avoid taking risks because we don't want to fail. However, failure is a natural part of life, and it's often the stepping stone to success. If you never fail, it means you're not pushing yourself out of your comfort zone, and you're not learning anything new. I once read about a successful entrepreneur who failed in several businesses before he finally hit it big. He said that each failure taught him valuable lessons that he used to improve his next venture. He embraced failure as a natural part of the journey to success, and it paid off. In conclusion, there's no shortage of great advice out there, but the best advice is the one that resonates with you personally. It's the one that inspires you to be a better person, to take risks, and to keep pushing yourself toward your goals. So keep searching, keep learning, and keep growing. Who knows, maybe one day someone will ask you for your best advice!"},{"instruction":"f you could go back and change one event in history, what would it be?","output":"There’s only one of two points I would go back to. The first one is when I first learned about Bitcoin when I was finishing college. At the time not too many people knew about it, the concept of a cryptocurrency wasn’t even fully flushed out yet. This the same time when I first began to take interest in stocks, bonds and simply investing overall. I had around 1,000 that I wanted to invest into something and I was seriously considering putting that money into Bitcoin. The next day, which was about a month or so before graduation some of my friends on campus were having a pick up game of basketball and invited me. Instead, I went to a lecture being held on campus about Bitcoin, the lecturer was talking pretty much about how risky of an investment it was and how the majority of purchases were on the dark web for illegal goods and services. This turned me off of Bitcoin because the lecturer, a technology lawyer believed that the feds would eventually crack down on this and abolish Bitcoin. This all happened about when a single Bitcoin was fluctuating around 80 ¢. That 1,000 back then, would’ve amounted to 81 million today. Knowing what I know now, if I could go back in time, I would’ve never gone to that lecture, pulled the trigger on Bitcoin, and played hoops with my friends. The second point that I would’ve liked to have changed is extremely similar. About a year later after graduating college I began law school. During that year off in between college and law school studied for the LSAT, fortunately got a scholarship, and I made a bit of money working a few minimum wage jobs. I had about 5 thousand dollars set aside that I wanted to invest it in something. This time I was thinking about Tesla, it had IPO’d about a few months earlier and was trading around 20 per share, well before the stock had even split. The girl I was seeing at the time convinced me instead to “invest” that money upgrading my wardrobe instead, according to her all I had were old “grandpa suits.” She was also going to law school with me and said I need to wear more “upper class” or “preppy” looking outfits as I’d probably be going to a lot of fancy dinners, country club events, and the like. I ended up spending 4k on suits, none of which fit by the time I graduated, and I spent another 1,000 on designer polos and khakis. I eventually did invest in Tesla much later, but had I invested that money back then, I’d have close to about 1 million dollars today in Tesla stocks. This isn’t nearly as bad of a miss as my Bitcoin debacle, but it’s still a big miss. If I could go back, I 100% would."},{"instruction":"w is a BSc in geology from AMU?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: https://www.amu.ac.in/departmentpage.jsp?did=4] [URL: https://www.amu.ac.in/departmentpage.jsp?did=4] You will get excellent placement in the field of geology ast it has tremendous scope.

One would not advertise industrial cherry pitting machines on broadcast television, but a trade show or trade magazine would be a very effective way of reaching a receptive audience. Media relations has two main objectives. Building relationships (with the media), raising awareness about the product or service (this creating sales opportunities). Elon Musk accomplishes these objectives almost by himself, so there seems little reason to have a large staff who would almost certainly be less effective. Frankly, Tesla’s most effective marketing is implicit in the product design (also a marketing function…) and owner delight with their experience. I want one because my wife and I drove a friends X model (amazing…). I had a similar experience with the Apple watch, which frankly, I didn’t get when it was first released and neither, apparently, did many other people as sales proved disappointing. Yet my wife and I both agree that the watch has become our primary technological interface with our phones acting more like a docking station. Our conversion was once again, the direct result of another user’s delight with the product. For any product or service, it’s a sign of incompetence when a company throws the marketing tools kitchen sink at a product to try to sell it."},{"instruction":"Atheists, take a look around.

Switching or upgrading your networking career to an ethical hacking domain is a great decision. Ethical hacking is the best-suited domain related to networking. From my prior experience, I can suggest you take Intellipaat’s Ethical Hacking Course. You can find the Ethical hacking and Cyber Security bundle course, which will help you get a job in top MNCs.

If you absolutely must send your kids to a boarding school, be sure that you have a good relationship with them and that they are free to communicate openly with you. They may be afraid to tell you what is happening because they might face retaliation if other students or school personnel found out that they told.

Don’t make things more complicated by trying to arrange the perfect romantic dinner, or planning a whole day out. Instead, keep things short and simple. A cup of coffee in a central location will make it clear fast if your date is someone you would like to spend more time with. And if things go well, the coffee could turn into a lunch or dinner, adding some spontaneity into the mix. Don’t stress unnecessarily A bit of anxiety is natural on a first date it’s half the fun. But you’ll want to eliminate the kind of stress that will make you flustered and your date uncomfortable. Remember, the more relaxed you feel, the more comfortable your date will be around you. One simple trick is to sit at a right angle to your date rather than face them directly. This takes the pressure off trying to fill every pause in the conversation, and you can both do a bit of people-watching instead. Cut down the texting, and meet in person The conversation might have started on an app or a website, but it shouldn’t stay there for too long. Texting can certainly give you a sense of another person, but to get to know each other, you need more than messages on a screen: facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice are just as important. So don’t waste time on a virtual relationship – go out there and meet the real person behind the words. Be true to yourself Dating in the 21st century can feel like a competition, and perhaps it has always been that way. But too often we measure our worth against those we perceive to be ‘winning’, with the result that we try to imitate and improve on what others are doing instead of finding our way. But dating shouldn’t be about winners and losers. It’s about finding someone you connect with and care about; someone who makes you happy and who you can make happy in return. This is only possible when you stay true to yourself and let your authenticity shine through. Complete your successful first date with the right follow-up What to do after the first date? So you felt a connection, the conversation flowed and you had lots of things in common. Terrific. Now what? A successful first date is only as good as the follow-up, and this means arranging another meeting. You could do this right away, but it’s probably better not to put someone on the spot."},{"instruction":"w do you know that you have found a true friend?","output":"In most cases it takes time. You need shared experiences to form a bond and build the unshakable trust that makes the very best friendships last. There’s nobody in my inner circle that I haven’t known for at least ten years. One, my Aunt Jane, I’ve known for my entire life. Another is a girl I met in Kindergarten. We grew up together and never lost touch, even after life pulled us in different directions. True friends expect nothing and give everything. They love you just as you are. As I’ve heard it said: Good friends help you bury the body, great friends bring the shovel, and best friends don’t even ask why there’s a body to bury. If you’re the least bit concerned that your friend would blow your cover, then he or she doesn’t quite qualify as a “true” friend, I’d say. The person may be someone you enjoy spending time with, maybe even a casual friend, but probably not part of your most trusted inner circle. There’s a reason you have to take care not to admit people to the inner circle too soon. I did that recently. It was someone I had romantic feelings for, and in hindsight that clouded my judgment. I overlooked too many warning signs, and things fell apart once I realized there was a trust and truthfulness issue that I thought we’d worked past. We’re still friends, but for my part I’m much more guarded now in that particular relationship than I was. With a true-blue friend, there never would have been any issues to wonder about or work through."},{"instruction":"What do you think of PyTorch compared to TensorFlow?","output":"I think that 2 or 3 months ago, both libraries were more or less equivalent in terms of power. But in the last times Tensorflow has received so many improvements and pull requests, even there were new frameworks created around it, that I’m not sure anymore they are now equivalent. I think that there should be a common language to express models and networks architectures, because there are many duplicated efforts just to implement the same network. When a paper appears, you begin to see the implementation indifferent frameworks, all wanting to express the same type of neural network architectures. This should change in the future IMO, maybe building language wrappers, or a complete new definition language."},{"instruction":"What mobile app development companies are based in Chicago?","output":"Generally, Customers can expert Best services on Design & Development in Mobile Solutions.

Forty years passed, compilers improved a lot, but myth persists.

To start of with, the first thing the officer in charge should be concerned with during a protracted firefight is logistics. They should not run out of ammo, they should not even run low on ammo. There should be some system set up for either resupply or an escape route. If they have neither, the officer in charge has failed to do their job. If an individual soldier ends up black on ammo (completely out,) their squadmates should share ammo with them. There are reasons both the M4/M16 and the M249 SAW both fire 5.56x45mm ammunition. Ammo sharing is one of them. If the entire squad runs out of ammo with an incompetent officer in charge, they can try to resort to picking up enemy weapons. The first problem this is the location of the enemy’s weapons. Most firefights take place at range; its not like COD where you are shooting people ten feet in front of you. There may be dozens to hundreds of yards of open field between you and the nearest enemy weapon. You would have to cross that distance while being shot at before running all the way back to your squad. If one runs dry during close quarter’s battle, they would be better off switching to their pistol (if they have one,) or backing out of the room. If this happens, it is the result of poor planning; they should have asked for ammo BEFORE kicking in the door. The next problem is questionable maintenance. The gun an enemy died holding could be so worn as to be one round away from blowing up in your face. Alternatively, and less dramatically, it could simply malfunction; jamming up when you need it most. Then there is the issue of fratricide (“friendly” fire.) The human eye tends to zero in on precise threats. If you perceive a spider as a threat, your eyes will focus in on the fangs (actually the pedipalps, the mouth like protrusions a spider’s fangs are located on, but I digress.) Likewise, if you perceive an armed enemy as a threat, and you should, you will focus on his/her weapon. If you are a U.S soldier and you see someone carrying an AK-74, its easy to react (read: shoot) as if s/he were an enemy. But, in this scenario, it turns out you just shot a U.S. Marine armed with a commandeered AK-74. Even the sound of the weapon can contribute to fratricide. Most soldiers never see their enemy; they shoot at the location from which the fire, or sound of gunfire, is coming from. If you are sporting an AK-74, you may very well find yourself being suppressed and/or shot by a friendly soldier carrying an M249 SAW. Finally, there is the danger of booby traps. If the enemy has had time, they can attach a tripwire to a weapon. When you pick up the weapon, you inadvertently set off an IED, potentially killing you in the process (or worse, maiming you, thereby making your squadmates leave cover to save your, now permanently disabled, life and equipment) all while being shot at. This has been done before, wounding an enemy so as to draw his squadmates out of cover to render aid. In my opinion, it is an absolutely despicable tactic (as you can argue the unwounded squadmates are acting as medics and the injuries inflicted will hamper the soldier longer after the war has ended,) but such is the nature of war. Oh, and the enemy’s weapons are likely lower quality than your own. They likely sourced their firearms off the black market, where they sat in dirty, moist warehouses, rusting away for decades before being pressed into service. They are frequently cheaper, less reliable, less accurate, and heavier than what a soldier from a first world country would be carrying."},{"instruction":"ve you left California and if so, why?","output":"Yes, I left not only California, but US altogether.

Which wasn't true at all. Not even close. The people who told me didn't have a clue as to who their ancestors really were. The way I've since put it together, from the vantage point of having a membership in [LINKED_TEXT: Genealogy, Family Trees & Family History Records] [URL: http://ancestry.com/] (and that is how Quora treats the link to Ancestry), is that over the years and the generations the name “Allen” came to be associated with Ethan Allen. It wasn't. The name, “Allen” belonged to one Lewis Allen, a close compatriot of Daniel Boone. There are 3 surnames that are closely intertwined; Allen, Boone and Morgan. So close were these families that the children of one family were routinely given middle names of one or the other of the families. So Lewis “B.” Allen was actually Lewis Boone Allen. And Daniel “M.” Boone was Daniel Morgan Boone. The same with Sarah B. Allen, whose full name was (drum roll please, because this is where the confusion began): Sarah “Boone” Allen. Who married my 3X great grand pappy. Early in the 19th century Ethan Allen was revered as a real “American Patriot.” A guy who'd organized “The Green Mountain Boys” and fought the British. Someone you actually might wish to be related to. Daniel Boone had earned quite a name for himself by the time he died in 1835, an American folk hero, but Colonel Ethan Allen was already renowned for his Revolutionary War exploits. He even made his own furniture (Sorry. You had to have seen that coming). If they'd actually kept only adequate records they would have been fascinated to know that Ethan Allen pales in comparison to some of their other true ancestors. For instance, Revolutionary War buffs will instantly recognize the name “Brigadier General Daniel Morgan.” He was as much an outdoorsman as Daniel Boone. Like Boone, he'd fought the Indians, studied their war tactics and effectively used this new mode of fighting brilliantly against the British, who thought it all very ungentlemanly. He came to Washington's attention because he was winning and General Washington badly needed a winner. For those who don't recognize the Revolutionary War general think, “The Patriot” movie. Yep. Same guy. Mel Gibson's character was based on Brigadier General Daniel Morgan, who accepted British General Cornwallis’ surrender. And if you follow the Morgan line back a bit further, to Wales in fact, you'll find a very interesting character. Sir Henry Morgan. Wait! You can't be serious? Not that “Sir Henry Morgan,” of all people? Oh, but I am. And now, if you're thinking, “Blackbeard, the Pirate” you're right. And if you're not, then think Johhny Depp, who built his character around the very same British privateer (with a dash of Kieth Richards) who both confounded and terrorized the Spanish Main, ultimately becoming a wealthy landowner and Governor of Jamaica. There you have The Big Lie, as solemnly passed on to me, of which several generations my family spoke reverently of and took as The Gospel Truth. But required only months to unwind and get right. “You're a REAL American, boy!” my Uncle Jack would say. It took awhile for the boy to grow into a man and dispel that one. “We're all real Americans, Uncle Jack. Each one of us. If knowing it somehow made me a better “American” that would be great. But it doesn't. To me it's just an interesting sidebar to my own life. Nothing more.” But if they could have only known the real lineage maybe they would have been even happier about the whole thing.

Not every Australian or New Zealander would dislike something about another & then assume that ALL from that country are similar. Having said that I had wondered how often an Australian comedian had been right when he told Zealanders in the audience that he hoped they really enjoyed the upcoming Christmas in Australia & added… ‘Hurry, hurry, hurry! Only ten shopliftinh days left until Christmas’. Judging by how hilarious most of the audience found the comment to be, it looked surprisingly on target. I had also had two unrelated & brief NZ acquaintences - one of whom exchanged her old shoes for new ones on a shelf & walked out the shop calmly, me after her insisting she return & pay. She stared at me blankly, hailed a taxi & took off alone. The other bragged to me that he had cheated a car & van salesperson out of both & had no intention of paying. Horrific behaviour in the distant past - I assumed that a high percentage of arrivals then were Nz’s runaways - & I can’t say I liked that one bit. These days people can’t be so anonymous, so I doubt if it’s the same now. However I did hear a NZ person say not so long ago that I need not tell a person buying an old car of mine about a hidden motor issue. This person was surprised why I would be open about it, since I would get less for the car. They were stunned when I said I do my best to treat others as fairly as I want to be treated. So, I’m guessing that some ethical standards might be a bit different to Aussies & it’s a good idea to be aware of that potential… but it’s unnecessarily generalising to assume that this issue is true of all people from NZ ."},{"instruction":"Mathematicians, how did you become so exceptionally great at maths?

Firstly, unlike many think, abusive relationships are rarely like this, with happiness continuously and rapidly falling flat out over time. They are rather like this Abusive relationships are not abusive every single day. They have their highs and amazing moments occasionally, which you are often blanketed by. Because of this, you don't see the toxicity building up in the relationship. Every time a ‘enough is enough’ point comes, it often is followed by a ‘this is good’ point which gives hope to the person that it is worth giving a shot. Secondly, the sunk cost fallacy in toxic relationships. As I have explained in the other answer, you tend to continue in the relationship because you have already invested a lot of time and energy in it. It happens when you are so attached to the emotions that you forget to think logically, and you are so caught up in the past that you forget to think about the future. Thirdly, toxic optimism. Hope and positivity are not always good. It can cut two ways. Sometimes, you will get what you have wanted and feel like ‘It’s worth the wait.’ Sometimes, you will lose your time and energy in this process and feel like ‘I shouldn’t have done this.’ You continue to be in a toxic relationship because somewhere you have a hope that your partner might change someday, realise your value, respect your feelings and mend their behaviour. But, it might happen or might not happen. Fourthly, fear and low self-esteem. From what I have noticed, after a point of time, people who are victims in a toxic relationship start doubting themselves. They think, ‘Maybe this is how it is everywhere?’ ‘Maybe I am expecting too much.’ ‘Maybe there is a mistake on my side.’ So because of this self-doubt, people develop fear as well that their next relationship might also go through the same way. ‘What if the next partner is worse than this?’ sends shivers down their spines and put them back in the same relationship. Fifthly, society. It is not just about random women in kitty parties or colleagues in offices sharing gossip about divorces. Among peers and friends in college also this is quite common. ‘Oh look at her, she changed her boyfriend again.’ ‘He got a new girlfriend, maybe he cheated on his Ex’ There are people who want to live silently without falling into anyone’s gossip group meetings. They suffer silently and smile outside, solely just to maintain their image of ‘One life. One lover. Jai Shree Ram.’"},{"instruction":"f you had one wish from a genie in a bottle, what would it be?","output":"I would wish for a cup of tea. The story of Genie and the Millionaire Once upon a time, a millionaire was driving to work in his fancy car. All of a sudden, an old rusty car hits his car hard from the back. Surprized and angry, the millionaire pulls over and gets out to confront the driver. An old white-bearded man appears out of the car and takes the resposibility for the damage: “My bad, son. Couldn’t stop the car in time. You see it got really old; I probably should buy a new car. Anyway, let’s sit and talk. How much do you want for the compensation?” The millionaire looks for a moment at the old man who is wearing torn old clothes, and says: “No, that is okay. I don’t need your money. Just be careful next time”. To which the old man replies: “Who do you think I am?! Some poor old man? Let me show you something” And opens the back of his car; takes out a strange ceramic bottle and starts rubbing it. Moments later, a genie swirls out of the bottle and starts speaking with a loud voice: “I AM THE GENIE AND TELL ME WHAT YOU WISH” The old man proudly looks at the millionaire who is now shaking with fear, and says to the genie: “Make us some tea while we talk about the cost of the damage” Now the millionaire with his business mindset sees the opportunity and offers the old man to buy the genie. After long negotiations, the old man finally agrees to sell the genie for a crazy amount of money. The millionaire goes home and brags to his wife: “I bought a genie and he will make us the richest people in the world” And orders the genie to make their house full of gold, to which the genie says: “I am sorry. But, I can only make tea” P.s. It is a popular story in my country.

C++ is by far the most popular language of choice for competitive programmers due to its speed, and most resources/solutions but many people start with Python or Java too. I would strongly recommend that you first get basics of C, learn the concepts of libraries, flow of control and functions and then switch to C++ and get started with competitive programming. A good first step would be to tackle the [LINKED_TEXT: USACO Training Pages] [URL: https://train.usaco.org/usacogate]. The first few sections cover some basic but very important algorithms such as Greedy, DFS/BFS, binary search, dynamic programming, and more. The training pages have tutorials that you can read on these topics, plus a host of practice problems to hone your skills. This provides you with a structured and organized way of learning the basic algorithms you need in competitive programming. However, one shortcoming of the USACO training pages is that to progress to the next section, you must first successfully solve all problems in the previous section. Sometimes, this can lead to frustration if one difficult problem is blocking your progress, since it does not allow you to view the solutions to a problem until you solve it. Read about algorithms: Besides the USACO training pages, there’s a lot of other material out there that can be useful for learning algorithms.If you like going through textbooks, the [LINKED_TEXT: CLRS Introduction to Algorithms] [URL: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https%3A%2F%2Fedutechlearners.com%2Fdownload%2FIntroduction_to_algorithms-3rd%2520Edition.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiYyoLkrNjyAhUZrpUCHRHFDOAQFnoECF8QAQ&sqi=2&usg=AOvVaw1MTgMaJy6tIydXbqrtS9j1] textbook is a good choice. There’s probably a lot of details in this textbook that might not necessarily be useful for competitive programming, however, it has a depth knowledge, requires maths knowledge and quite not suitable for beginners.For others, who think textbooks are too dry and/or long, you can buy an online course for learning algorithms which encloses all your needs, have good curriculum, in-depth concepts explained, good mentorship with doubt-solving facility, etc. Now, I would like to mention one such course that contains all what you need to get started with Competitive Programming.

It's the most important part in learning Competitive Programming.Topcoder, HackerRank, and CodeChef all have periodic online contests as well. 4. Have Fun: At last, the most important thing. Programming competitions are meant to be fun. If you’re not having fun, take a break and try coming back after sometime away from your computer. It’s hard to improve on something if you’re not enjoying it. Competitive Programming is just like a daily exercise for our brain that everyone should try.

I was wondering why I got asked, but skimming the other answers I can see this never actually got a useful response originally. There are two parts to this. The first is that the building’s structural system was really high-tech at the time, and involved using every floor of the structure to support every other floor. There was a lot of extra load capacity, but very little redundancy, and the major structure that kept the buildings from blowing over in the wind was on the very top floors: What this means is there wasn’t really a “safe” amount of the upper floors that could collapse - any amount of structure lost off the top would critically compromise the entire building. This is very different from how things had been designed previously, and in the wake of both this collapse and the Oklahoma City bombings we learned it was a pretty bad idea. Most buildings don’t catastrophically collapse when they fail, which is a much better design goal. Here’s an example of the Windsor tower in Madrid, which caught on fire and only partially collapsed: The second part to this is that the WTC towers had a very unusual and extreme structural failure. What happened was that the outer columns lost their “lateral” support, which allowed them to buckle like a long, thin ruler (or the sides of a tin can): Here’s what that looked like in action: Buckling is what’s known as a “geometric instability” - it’s a critical load value where the columns start deflecting to the side, and once it starts the deflection is instantaneous and infinite. When the columns lost their lateral support, that critical value decreased by ~90%. In practice the failure is not actually instantaneous or infinite, but it does happen very quickly and without warning, and tends to be a complete failure because as the column gets less straight it loses even more strength. Just think about how quickly an aluminum can crumples if you try to stand on it. Engineers avoid this sort of failure mode like the plague, specifically because it leads to collapses like this, that are so rapid and energetic that they happen unexpectedly and cause total loss of the structure. We strongly prefer for buildings to give some sort of warning before they start to fail, so that they can be evacuated as much as possible. Most 9/11 truther arguments are built on incredulity that this collapse doesn’t seem like how buildings fail “normally.” What they don’t realize is that’s an intentional design goal, and this case was a really bad mistake. In fact, a lot of the 9/11 truther community is built on being openly hostile to experts in the field, because most of the perceived inconsistencies can be explained pretty trivially as design mistakes."},{"instruction":"Why is SRK the biggest superstar in India?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Success By 'Secret Superstar' Could Give Aamir Khan The Title Of The World's Biggest Movie Star] [URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/robcain/2017/10/03/if-secret-superstar-hits-big-aamir-khan-will-own-the-title-worlds-biggest-movie-star/#3e4df1aa8d3a]"},{"instruction":"What kind of facilities or amenities can you expect in a threestar hotel?","output":"The main difference between amenities and facilities is that the amenities refer to things that are designed to provide comfort and enjoyment to the guests while facilities basically refer to places or even equipment built to facilitate guests in their specific needs.

The rational mindset that almost all methods are allowed in order to gain a better trade position as long as the cost of doing so ends up on the plus side of the equation. The biggest example of this being that the Netherlands was one of the last countries that officially made slavery illegal (as it was so good for business and the wealth of our nation). And until today no official apologies have been made to the the people who got ripped away from their lands to labor in horrible conditions for no personal gain whatsoever. Ethics in business seem so often secondary. If it wasn't for more dominant powers in the global trade game right now, we would consider and act upon doing trade (export mostly these days) to ANY country in the world regardless of its situation. We would rationalize it with we do good for them as we help the people of, e.g. North-Korea to have more food and better agricultural methods (two things the Dutch excel in globally). We would build dams and create islands wreaking havoc to the livelihood of the locals due to changing fishing or flooding conditions, because we gain of it and the idea was not ours, we only execute it. These ideas of participating in trade or economic adventures for self gain are embedded very deeply in our culture, so deeply that most Dutch with all their directness and self esteem won't even be able to tell that they approach things so rational and pragmatic that moral and ethical embarrassment is often a second away (especially in hindsight)."},{"instruction":"Can you use a mouse with a smart TV?","output":"Unless you have a very long USB extension cable or a wireless mouse, this would seem a bit inconvenient as you would have to be really close to the set to use a conventional mouse.

Today both have middle classes of about the same size--but in addition India has a billion starving peasants. That's one helluva difference. What we should be doing, each in our own nations, is to look around the world, treating every other nation as an experiment in governance, and see who's doing particular things our country might benefit from adopting. For example, I'd love for America to adopt India's universal biometric database project. It would be very good for us. India has a vastly higher level of corruption than all the \\"first world\\" nations--not just America. The Indian people obviously want less corruption (except for the ones profiting from it).

I hauled ass past him, saw his lights come on, and said, “Crap.” As soon as I got to a shoulder, (at the first intersection) I pulled over, got my license, my insurance card, and was sitting on the trunk of my car when he pulled up, grinning and waving at him. He sat in his car laughing for five minutes. He couldn’t believe I’d stopped for him, had gotten out, was waiting for him and was so cheerful about it. He lectured me for about ten minutes on everything about speeding, getting out of the car on the shoulder, to my license plate frame…(it was a chasing lights one, and whether or not they were legal was debatable)…. And gave me the ticket. It SHOULD have been 110 in a 35. It was for 45 in a 35. Never ever underestimate being honest, friendly, prepared and funny… not to mention knowing and owning your idiotic behavior. Cops are people too."},{"instruction":"What skills will help anyone make a significantly higher salary as an employee?","output":"In my opinion, there are several skills that come handy in acquiring a significantly higher salary but here are the 3 that I think are the most importants: 1. be an expert in a field that is preferably in high-demand and increase your value for the enterprise. Document facts that demonstrate it and remember that management understand money when it is time to discuss with them. 2. be good at marketing your achievements. If noone knows that you are great, not much will happen. This will also make your services in demand which will push higher the salary that companies are will to pay to get you. It is always a good idea to always have several options in case negotiation fails. 3. Be good at negotiations Understand the following. You and the management have different goals in mind that are in direct opposition from each other. You want to get the best possible work conditions and the manager has the responsability to maximize profits for the shareholders by minimizing the expenses. A good manager will make sure that his staff is happy and that good employees remain in his staff for as long as possible but he will do so by paying as little as possible. You can bet your ass that he will pay salary that are just enough to keep people in his staff and not a single penny more than what is needed. His own remuneration depends on how good he is on that. If you want a better salary, you will at least need to ask for it but much more can be done during negotiation to get the best out of it as an employee. I'm currently writing that will have the title: 6 Elements for a successful salary raise negotiation"},{"instruction":"Where does Grand Admiral Thrawn rank among nonforce sensitive Star Wars villains?","output":"In terms of military prowess, and in being a commander that you would actually WANT to serve under, regardless of the characters subjective “good” or “bad” guy status, Thrawn is one of if not the best leaders in Star Wars. He’s a tactical and strategic genius (and in the Legends series also demonstrates an otherwise-unprecedented-in-Star-Wars grasp of logistics.) That’s true, and he’s pretty much better than the other Imperials, who operate on blunt force and unlimited resources, and he’s better than the Rebels, whose major engagement victories come entirely from sheer stupid luck (and in Rebels, near-literal deus ex machinas.) But besides that, unlike pretty much all the other Imperials including those who aren’t cackling evil space wizards, he’s the only one who prioritizes mission over self-aggrandizement and who includes in his objectives not just winning, but making sure he does it at as little a cost as possible, particularly to his own resources. Someone like Tarkin will kill off thousands of Imperial personnel to settle a petty organizational dispute, never mind blowing up whole planets as object lessons he doesn’t have to make. Even among the good guys, they won’t necessarily enjoy sending you on suicide missions if you join the Rebellion, but they’ll do it because when you’re a guerrilla insurgency, you sometimes don’t have a choice about how you do things. Basically Thrawn was created and mostly written by someone who does well with military SF, and who created a character who operates like someone working with a realistic military with not-unlimited resources that values keeping casualties low."},{"instruction":"When will USA and its European allies realize Putin isn’t bluffing when he says we are getting closer to nuclear war?","output":"If the alternative is a world under the sway of the whims of a mad dictator does it matter?

Where exactly is this controversy. Why did I have to search the title to even know it was a book? I don’t have cable and so don’t watch cable news, but I do view YouTube videos and I noticed in the last week or so a flurry of videos, usually by Fox News personalities, commenting on Chris Cuomo’s suspension for CNN. I found this remarkably incestuous and the implications disturbing. Apparently, cable news is like a small town where everyone knows everyone else’s business and everyone is talking about the kerfuffle between the Browns and the Kavanaughs. It is all emblematic of the term provincial, a label applied to unsophisticated folk who imbue meaningless issues with great emotion. The book fits right in, except that the small town folk whose lives revolve around the media soap opera aren’t particularly literary folks. Nevertheless, I realized that I had already seen an excerpt of the book that discussed the disappointment of CIA officers that Trump didn’t pay more attention to their highly detailed expositions of covert operations. When I put it together, I finally understood. This is a book for morons. Anyone who has ever done a successful executive presentation knows that you keep it brief, hit the major themes and allow the principle(s) to ask questions that probe the details for which one is hopefully well prepared to answer, very much like presenting a case to the Supreme Court. An executive, if they are any good at all, leaves the details to others and focuses on managing priorities and resources. Do you really think Tim Cook is going to sit through a forty slide PowerPoint to hear how you solved the race condition problem? The authors are journalists, whose work product can be charitably be called ideas. The problem is that all the really good ideas come from experience actually accomplishing concrete things. which of course no journalist has, or ever will have. So here is the problem most of the country understands or feels in their gut. If Trump is such a moron, how could he possibly have been as effective as he was? If Joe Biden is such a genius, and has the fawning coverage of a partisan media, why is the administration so incompetent? Most people in the country don’t care about the Brown’s and the Kavanaugh’s fight over the height of the hedge between their properties. They care that the country is on the right track, that we are making progress, that our freedoms are being protected by men and women of good will. Absolutely no one except the small town media folk care about what to partisan journalist have to say about Trump’s final year in office."},{"instruction":"forgot my Apple ID password how can I reset it?","output":"I forgot my Apple ID to activate my iPhone; this is one of the most common problems with iOS users.

If you’ve worked long enough in mental health, and at all aware of your surroundings, meaning the people you work with, it’s not hard to see the paradox that there are sometimes more disturbed “helpers and healers” than many of the patients, who can be threatening and scary, but my point is there are people working with disturbed people who sometimes do the work to distance themselves from their own irrationality and deep problems, because they have ready made containers for their projections, the “sick” patients. There are those who are wounded healers, and they work from within the client’s subjective reality, and don’t run from it, because they understand from their own inescapable suffering, just being bozos on the bus with everyone else, with a smattering of special sauce which might distinguish them from the patients, but their always willing to share…. their sauce.

This blobfish looks like a blob only on the surface because it’s depressurized. In its natural habitat, it looks nothing like this at all. There are many species that will not thrive in captivity. Some animals, like many species of whales or giant squids, are enormous and on top of that they are aquatic and we are not. We would need to provide them with a marine habitat multiple times their size that would require megastructure scale construction and maintenance. Because of that, there are still many unknowns about the behaviour and biology of such huge animals.There is a huge diversity of life in deep oceans that is adapted to very high pressures. Recreating this sort of habitat for them is an enormous challenge.All aspects of the physiology and behaviour of some flying animals, like swallows, are so streamlined for flying that they would never thrive in captivity.Many animals have some very specific and unusual requirements that are very difficult or challenging to recreate. It could be a diet or something very quirky.There aren’t that many extremophile animals, like some that live in hydrothermal vents but there are many extremophile microorganisms that scientists would like to research in the lab. They cannot do it, however, because it’s too difficult to recreate their habitat that might be unlike anything that we are used to. It can be high PH, temperature, pressure, salinity and others. Often many of these all at once.What is thrive? There are many animals that humans keep in captivity and provide them with a habitat similar to what they are used to in nature but it doesn’t mean that they thrive. Famously, it’s often celebrated, when babies of many captive animals are born. Even the ones that seemingly cope with captivity might have their lifespan reduced. Although, there are also some examples of animals that live longer in zoos than in nature, where they can succumb early in life to predators. Many animals in captivity exhibit abnormal behaviours like repeating some ticks, they can self-harm, self-bite, hair or feather pluck, excessively self-groom. Some primates can even poke their eyes out with their own fists. All of this means that animals that thrive in captivity are actually rather rare in comparison to animals that don’t, at least in some aspects. Sometimes it would aid conservation efforts if some endangered species were easier to keep in zoos. The question was: Does any species exist which can’t thrive in captivity?"},{"instruction":"What industries need lead generation and marketing?","output":"Lead generation and marketing are crucial for a wide range of industries.

Sorry, I know that\`s the most obnoxious, cynical millenial thing to say but it\`s true in this case. When a band forms, they have a vision, or at least a set sound that they\`re going for. Of course they want to become famous, because who wouldn\`t want to make obscene amounts of money playing in a band? The thing that they don\`t realize or that they think won\`t happen to them for some reason is once you do become famous and successful, commercial pressure turns you and your music into something you never wanted. This happened to basically every kind of rock music, but with punk it was worse because it originated as a rebuke of that very thing. Punk was never supposed to become mainstream, yet once it did, it became altered, commercialized, and watered down until it was nothing more than radio-friendly power pop. You just can\`t sell strip-down, 2-minute fast songs for very long, fans will get bored, which is why punk never should have been anything more than a place for underground venting sessions for jaded youths. Once your punk band becomes famous, they inevitably become something true punk fans hate, and unless they can evolve into something different but still catchy (e.g New Wave), they\`ll eventually fade into irrelevance. Another reason is the western world is, by and large, doing pretty well right now. LGBTQ people are more accepted than perhaps ever, race relations are better, economic circumstances are still tenuous, maybe, but not enough to make people start a whole musical movement over it. That\`s the unfortunate downside to winning cultural battles: once you win, you start to wonder what your purpose is.

Poor me, I am still nursing a neck pain from too much of trying to crane my neck to look upwards towards the terraces.Refer: [LINKED_TEXT: Earthquake zones of India] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_zones_of_India].The Weather: It’s humid. Here in Mumbai, even an otherwise moderate 30 degree celsius does not spell respite. The 93% relative humidity in the air takes care of that; it is enough to make the day hot and stuffy.The Traffic: The duration and extent of the traffic jams in Mumbai made the jams I had previously seen in any other place of India seem like cruel jokes.The Prices: A single fist-sized vada pav at Juhu Beach costing INR 30 feels like an exorbitant meal, especially if you are used to a full plate of steaming hot chicken momos for the same price elsewhere (Guwahati, to be precise).The Roads: They are so wide that in Powai, in front of the IITB campus, crossing one felt like I was crossing the entire width of a football field (an exaggeration, of course, because I don’t have the experience of crossing one).

I would come into work an hour earlier than my shift, chow down and surf the net. A recently hired coworker didn't like that. He was on day shift. I didn't waste all of my time.

My boss, 11 years older than me, once saw me scooting across the lab, running three machines at once. He said he'd never seen anything like that. I laughed. I was also teaching myself more Unix.

We were a start up. My labor was most of it for my influence. I found out later that the guy was bad mouthing me as if he would have gotten my job. The issue was that he never applied for it, I did.

They know that, if they are all still in the race for Super Tuesday, the moderate vote will be split between them, meaning the nomination will most likely end up going to Bernie Sanders, even though, collectively, the moderates may have received more votes. By dropping out, they are trying to make Joe Biden the only moderate candidate in the race. That way, all the moderate voters will coalesce around him. It’s fairly clear that this is what they are doing from the fact that all the most prominent moderates who were in the race—Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, and Beto O’Rourke—have now endorsed Joe Biden. At this point, the race looks like it is really going to be between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. More moderate Democratic voters will vote for Biden and more progressive Democratic voters will vote for Sanders. Elizabeth Warren and Michael Bloomberg are still technically in the race, but they probably won’t be for much longer, since Bloomberg is widely detested among Democrats and Warren is ideologically very close to Sanders, who currently has more supporters. I expect that Bloomberg will probably utterly bomb on Super Tuesday and drop out in disgrace; whereas Warren will probably drop out and endorse Sanders. That’s what I’m expecting right now.

March 14: Left Tennessee. Had breakfast with [LINKED_TEXT: Ben Waggoner] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Ben-Waggoner-1] in Conway, AR. Restaurants were still open. People didn’t seem particularly concerned with maintaining their distance from others. Drove to Oklahoma City. There, too, there seemed little worry about avoiding strangers, both at the hotel and the restaurant. Incidentally, it wasn’t my favorite city in the universe. It was fine enough as cities go, but I couldn’t imagine ever wanting to live there. Anyway, the most notable thing about this night is that I realized that, try as I might, it was going to be impossible to stay away from people if I ate at a restaurant. SAD!Ides of March: Drove to Albuquerque. It was my second time there. People didn’t seem to be concerned about the virus. The only difference it made in my trip was that, unlike the normal breakfast buffet at Hyatt, what was available was breakfast sandwiches to go. This was the case for the remainder of my trip. I’m not in love with Albuquerque either. There is the occasional oasis here and there, but overall, the desert is very depressing to me.March 16. Left Albuquerque and decided to head to Salt Lake City. It was going to take me 9 hours. After about 6 hours, I was in Moab. There, to my surprise, I discovered that there was a Hyatt hotel! I decided to stay put. Unfortunately, the local parks were mostly closed due COVID-19. So, I didn’t get to see the main sights. Still, I was able to see some beautiful rock formations. I liked Moab enough that I might come back someday.March 17. I drove to Salt Lake City, met up with [LINKED_TEXT: Kosta] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Kosta-63]. He is such a white guy! You know what I mean? Probably not. Like, if there was a how to be a white dude competition, he would probably win, and effortlessly. Does that clarify things? Probably not. Oh well, you’ll just have to take my word for it. Super white dude. And handsome. And smart. That’s why he gets all the women. But, seriously, super white. Anyway, we mostly succeeded in staying 6 ft apart. Other people weren’t nearly as concerned, it seemed. After that, I met with Melissa, a friend from my nursing school days. She was very short when we were in nursing school. 12 years later? Still short. Some people just never grow up, you know? Anyway, Salt Lake City is one of my all time favorite places on the planet. It’s so effortlessly gorgeous. It’s like living in a postcard. Stunning mountains. Vividly blue skies. I can totally see why the Mormons stopped there. I slept in Farmington, one of its northern suburbs, choosing yet another Hyatt hotel.March 18. An hour after I woke up, there was an earthquake that made me realize that I should have turned left in Albuquerque. I decided that it was time to get the hell out of there, and I did so in short order. I went to Boise, ID. What a cute little town! I could totally live there! Just Wow! If Utah made me realize that I liked mountains so much that they could be an adequate substitute for woods. Idaho made me realize that I didn’t have to choose; I could have them both. Anyway, the most noticeable thing from a COVID-19 standpoint was that it looked like a swarm of locusts had descended on their Trader Joe’s! Dear Fornicating Horus, guys! This is not the apocalypse. We’re not actually out of food. March 19. Drove to Eugene. I passed through Bend, but I was much too exhausted to stop. Maybe next time. Got the keys to my apartment. Learned that the pool, sauna, and hot tub were closed, due to the coronapocalypse. Fortunately, most of what I had pre-ordered, including my couch, bed, and mattress, was already in my apartment, courtesy of the apartment complex. I had to drive to Costco anyway to get some household stuff and food and whatnot. Since then, I’ve mostly kept to myself. I can’t go on dates, because corona. I can’t make social visits because corona. It’s hard to avoid people when I go to the park, so I don’t go as much as I might want to. Most people are not nearly as religious as I am at keeping a wide distance between themselves and other people. I go to the grocery store or pharmacy when I need something, but I try to minimize that, because corona. Yesterday, I thought I might be sick. It made me realize just how vulnerable I was, alone in a state without an emergency contact nearby. I was having some cold sweats and intermittent albeit very mild cough. On top of the sneezing, low back pain, and what felt like shortness of breath with mild exertion, I thought it might be the beginning of an upper respiratory tract viral illness. But all these symptoms could be explained by other more common things. Maybe I was sweating because my hoodie was too heavy. Maybe I had back pain because I had lifted boxes. Maybe I was short of breath because I was deconditioned. Maybe I was sneezing because of allergies or because of some benign common virus. Maybe I was coughing because I had aspirated on my pistachios. Maybe I was fatigued because I had just spent 6 days on the road and I had been chronically sleep deprived before then. I decided to go get a thermometer. I walked to 3 different pharmacies: there was no thermometer to be found, and all the acetaminophen was also gone. I sighed and went home. Thankfully, I woke up feeling better today. Mostly, I’m doing okay. My problems are all first world problems. I have enough food to last me a while. I even have enough toilet paper, since I had the presence of mind to bring some from Tennessee. But I’ve been sleeping a lot.

Rule 3.01 that prohibited soiling a baseball came on the books in 1908. in the late 19-teens owners were unhappy that too many balls were being dismissed from play, according to The Sporting News. (If you read anywhere that only one ball was used in a game 100 years ago, that simply is not true for the major leagues.) So why are balls removed from play so often today? Scuffed balls can be made to move by talented pitchers. And 50 years ago, pitchers wanted to throw those baseballs. Today, they don’t. One MLB umpire, who began his career in 1984, has stated that today’s baseballs scuff more easily. And umpires make the decision to remove those from play. Recently retired MLB pitcher Glen Perkins in this story, states why he didn’t like to throw a scuffed ball, and would even reject a ball put in play. [LINKED_TEXT: Major league baseballs have a short shelf-life] [URL: https://www.foxsports.com/other/story/major-league-baseballs-have-a-short-shelf-life-062912] Like Perkins, and unlike many pitchers just a couple decades earlier, there are a lot of pitchers throwing 90 mph or better. Pitchers want control over what they can do at that speed. Any player can request the umpire examine a ball. This was also true when Babe Ruth played. In the major leagues, umpires don’t question a pitcher or catcher. Hitters, if they suspect a ball is moving oddly, will also ask an umpire to examine it. These days, the umpire in the majors is going to toss that ball. Certainly, this has been an evolution. The original question is: Why do pitchers get new balls when the balls hit the ground, but when a ball is hit, it is thrown back to the pitcher and put back in play? Balls in play are also often tossed. People don’t seem to notice. Regardless of when, balls are tossed much more often now than was the case in say, the 1960s. The proof? You can watch videos of World Series games from the ‘60s and ’70s, and probably even more recently, and see that balls are kept in play far longer than today. And this is World Series play. If the balls in a World Series game aren’t exchanged at today’s rate, certainly they were not exchanged as much during the season. It’s clear: The rate of dismissing baseballs from play at the current rate has been evolutionary. Pitchers seem to have changed their attitude toward nicked baseballs It used to be the hitters who wanted a ball examined, not the pitchers. That often happened years ago when someone like Houston’s Mike Scott pitched.

Those stories include New York Hall of Famer Whitey Ford. Then, many pitchers favored nicked baseballs, or doctored baseballs. Unlike today, pitchers of that era did not ask for those balls to be removed from play. Gaylord Perry was long suspected of doctoring the baseball. In 1982, he was suspended for it. He certainly was not asking for new baseballs all the time. [LINKED_TEXT: 30th anniversary: Gaylord Perry finally busted] [URL: https://www.fangraphs.com/tht/tht-live/30th-anniversary-gaylord-perry-finally-busted] Disproving the Chapman connection On Quora, you can find a couple answers to this question that use the death of Cleveland shortstop Ray Chapman as the reason balls are tossed so often today. Chapman was struck in the head by a pitched ball in 1920. But the only man to die in a MLB game from being hit by a pitch never had anything to do with the rate baseballs are thrown from play. It’s a mistaken notion that originated from one poorly researched source online and taken by some as fact. The genesis for that appears to be here, and unfortunately some responses contain all but plagiarized versions that clearly used this as a source: [LINKED_TEXT: This is how a fatal pitch changed how long Major League baseballs are in play] [URL: https://www.bnd.com/living/liv-columns-blogs/answer-man/article203279514.html] This “answer man” didn’t research his answer very well. One of the rules he cites was instituted when Chapman, who died at age 29, was 17. That article, in part, states: “Today, baseball historians say the tragedy was a major impetus for what today is rule 3.01, which states, “No player shall intentionally discolor or damage the ball by rubbing it with soil, rosin, paraffin, licorice, sand-paper, emerypaper or other foreign substance. “ Rule 3.01 that prohibited soiling a baseball came on the books in 1908. More than a decade before Chapman died. There might be one rule that emerged from Chapman’s beaning. I can’t find the year it was enacted. It reads the umpire must: (e) Have in his possession at least two alternate balls and shall require replenishment of such supply of alternate balls as needed throughout the game. Such alternate balls shall be put in play when: (1) A ball has been batted out of the playing field or into the spectator area; (2) A ball has become discolored or unfit for further use; (3) The pitcher requests such alternate ball. That rule is very broad. A ball “unfit for further use” in 1960 doesn’t have the same definition as today. Umpires were’t tossing a ball with a little dirt on it during the 1960s. So it’s easy to believe that definition of “unfit for use” was even more exclusive in the 1920s. Copies of The Sporting News from after Chapman’s beaning in 1920 state the MLB owners emphasized umpires that they remove baseballs that were “not white” from play. There is no discussion of an update of the rule made in 1908. I found evidence new balls were put in play more frequently before the season in which Chapman was struck. Based on the link below: “Balls were exchanged much more frequently starting in 1920, and that benefited the hitters.” [LINKED_TEXT: The Evolution of the Baseball From the Dead-Ball Era Through Today] [URL: https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1676509-the-evolution-of-the-baseball-from-the-dead-ball-era-through-today] Not unique Chapman was not unique in being hit in the head in that era, he was the one who died. It’s ironic. In 1920, other rule changes were starting to favor hitters and provide them with a better opportunity to produce more offense for fans. Yet that’s the season a man died. Spitball Some people believe that Chapman was hit with a spitball, and this is why the spitball was outlawed. But MLB owners enacted a rule before the 1920 season to make the spitball illegal. It was a pitch that was grandfathered out, so the spitball was still legal for the 1920 season. The rule change was introduced 9 months before Chapman was hit. Carl Mays said the pitch he threw that killed was not a spitball. Many players at the game affirmed this in The Sporting News stories. Chapman’s widow, by the way, was said to have never again attended a baseball game. Lucky you: You can buy these baseballs If you are concerned that tossed balls end up in a landfill, don’t underestimate pro sports as a business. Major League Baseball has an auctions web site at which it sells “game-used” baseballs. (And infield dirt.) [LINKED_TEXT: MLB Auction] [URL: https://auctions.mlb.com/] Most balls will end up in a bin for batting practice. The minor leagues Oddly, until 2019, no level of minor leagues used the same baseball as the major leagues. That season, AAA ball began to use the same ball as the AL and NL. Some pitchers promoted to the major leagues have complained because the balls used in the minor leagues are not the same as ones used in the major leagues. Minnesota Twins’ pitcher Jose Berrios talked about that here. [LINKED_TEXT: Secret to sudden success for Twins’ Jose Berrios: It’s the ball, stupid] [URL: https://www.twincities.com/2017/05/15/new-twins-policy-helping-jose-berrios-adjust-to-different-seams-of-big-league-ball/] Considering how many balls are tossed from play each major league game, why the majority of these are not in good enough shape to be shipped to the minors seems to be a good question.

It’s not often that I get to blow someones mind, but this might : ) Okay, anyone remember that old movie ‘forbidden planet’ from 1956? This is what they thought the spaceships would look like because flying saucers why not. Annnyway, they told a good story by extrapolating from what they had to work with in 1956, and most of it wasn’t too bad for its day except for one big blind spot: So, ignore the costumes and the robot; look at the big Plexiglas ball. That’s the starship’s navigation chart table. Think about that for a moment. The world had just finished WWII and ships used flat charts to navigate, therefore, in the far future they would navigate by really good 3D see through plastic charts. It just made sense. To us living in 2019 their mistake is obvious - sure they have switches nobs and electronics, but where are their computers? Even years later, sci-fi was still struggling to imagine what a computer could do as the original star trek showed: A fixed display with fixed functionality and fixed lights/buttons. This isn’t an issue of computers getting smaller, its sci-fi visionaries struggling to imagine a truly versatile machine that can do everything computers do today instead of just being a bigger better single purpose machine. (How many fixed buttons do you see?) Yes, modern machines still have the occasional hard button, but they’re fundamentally software driven, changing their function moment by moment as you change programs, apps and context. Okay, but this is all obvious right? So what, what constraint is preventing us from becoming a sci-fi civilization? What does all nearly all the sci-fi out there get wrong even today? This. This is what’s not coming with us to our sci-fi world of tomorrow: There is a famous saying that earth is the cradle of humanity, but one does not live in the cradle forever. Its a good point, but lets follow it to its natural conclusion. People do leave the cradle, but the world isn’t run by babies: (Though some of our leaders make us wonder from time to time : / ) We leave the cradle and we change, developing control of our biology, dropping the need to haul a toilet around strapped to us. We change ourselves to better fit the environment we find ourselves in, and if that environment is to be space then hauling biological bodies around is only slightly dumber than this: Computers are still getting better at an accelerating pace, and it’s only getting faster: Or put another way: So sure, we may be stuck in meat bodies for the time being, but that’s not going to last anymore than paper maps. ‘We’ want to explore the stars, but why in the world do we have to haul an active biosphere with us? Here is the same concept with a different species: Ridiculous right? But this is basically what we do today. We have single instance minds that can’t be copied or backed up running on hardware that inevitably fails over time. We can’t pause for ten years to fly to a planet, and we can’t stop breathing air and eating food/water, so we have to haul it all along with us just like the fish. So how is this going to go? When spaceships start leaving for very distant planets and eventually stars they’ll be carrying people, but just people, no biology. A ship to a distant star might have a crew of several hundred in a probe the size of minivan, all of who start to wake up when the craft gets close enough to warm up and power up in the light of a new star several hundred years from now. They’d be copies of the best people in their fields, the originals having stayed behind in our solar system, and from their perspective they’ed still be living breathing humans controlling their craft from inside a digital simulation. Heck, some of the old fans might actually use a mockup of the Enterprise as their interface of choice to conduct day to day business. It’s all just software running on the probe. The first steps on this path are taking place today for all to see: (Yes it’s over an hour long. Unless you’re a nuroscientist this is new info you don’t know about yet and it’s going to shape your future.

No one knows the details of how this will all play out, just as no one in 1956 could have predicted smartphones, but it’s going to happen, and its going to take a lot less than 63 years this time.

Yes, the top funds keep changing and if this is the only parameter you follow while taking an investment decision, you can go wrong. Plus, even if your investment horizon is 15 years, it makes sense to review your portfolio quarterly and rebalance, if required annually until and unless you are following a passive investment strategy by investing in index funds which is again not the right strategy when the horizon is as longish as 15 years. So, when you are selecting a fund for a longer time period, following parameters shall help you make the right decision. Fund type/ theme- Which type of fund are you looking to invest in. Ideally, when the investment horizon is as long as 15 years, one can invest in mid and small caps, Value funds, thematic funds as well take sectoral calls too based on advice from experienced advisor. Fund House - Investing in an established fund house is recommended. Fund Consistency - It is not about the fund’s recent performance but its returns and ranking over years since its inception that should be considered while taking investment decision. Fund AUM - While not the leading criterion, the fund size or AUM is another factor that can be considered. This doesn’t go to say that a fund with higher AUM is expected to perform but yes, fund with higher AUM is a safer proposition to invest in.

I.e. Before humans there wasn’t species burning fossil fuels. I’ll extract the lesson there, do we need to consider more renewable resources to future-proof the planet? Absolutely! However, is there a climate crisis? Are we all doomed and destined for failure by 2030, or 2050? I don’t believe so. I believe the climate activists all exaggerate the consequences. I also believe it is virtually impossible to measure data on our planet’s performance. We hardly understand how the Earth was formed, let alone measure what ALL of the factors are that might lead to our temperature rising. Are humans a factor? Yes. However how to we explain ice ages? These were drastic changes in the Earth’s temperature and humans weren’t around. We have been through I believe 5 cycles of ice ages (glacial and interglacial). How can these be explained if they were occurring well before humans touched fossil fuels? What I'm trying to say, those who remain confused, if the Earth can go through ice ages by itself, who says we are the MAJOR cause of the climate changing? Could it just be the Earth going through it’s cycle again?

The problem with spacecraft needing people is that they need a life support system as well. A source of air, a cargo haul of food supply, somewhere to eat, poop and sleep. All of this costs massive amounts of extra money, adds weight, requires fuel. The ISS has these amneties and look how huge it is. It had to be launched into space in small pieces and assembled like lego. Imagine how much more expensive it would be to send a manned probe to pluto if it had to be that big The further you travel out into space, the more these extra costs stack up and so does the danger to anyone on board Instead it’s far, far cheaper and more efficient to just send a robot into space if you want to explore anything further than Mars. Robots don’t need air, or food. They can recharge off the sun or from a reactor. They can be tiny and light-wheight so they don’t need much to launch. They don’t require a salary and technology is at a point where computer AI is really good at driving things. Most importantly, they can operate all the same scientific instruments and radio their findings back to earth with the exact same level of competency and at the speed of a microprocessor, so what benefit is there in exploring space with manned spacecraft when robots do the same job cheaper, better and safer? The reason the ISS has people on it, is because the ISS is a laboratory that performs a wide variety of complex micro-gravity experiments. For that you need manpower. But most probes only need to do one thing, so you can just program a computer to do that one thing for a fraction of the cost There’s really only one reason to use manned spacecraft. Two in the 1950’s: The first reason was that computer guidance and processing power wasn’t as good as a USAF pilot back during the 60’s and 70’s and that’s not even an issue anymore The second reason is when human beings need transportation somewhere, whether that’s to a spacestation, or on the surface of the Moon or Mars for a colony/expedition.

The human brain makes up an estimated 2% of all the cells in the body and uses about 20% of our energy while we sleep. So if we were able to use 100% of it, it would be a giant evolutionary leap. If we did figure out how to tap into that potential, there's no telling what we could do with ourselves and our world - but at this point, nobody knows. Knowing how much energy is consumed by the brain and extrapolating the maximal cognitive function calculation from studies done on animal studies its hard to say what would happen if humans were able to use 100% of their brains, but given that animal's studies used 10 times more brainpower than what we do it is possible that humans could achieve 10 times more than what animals can using their brains. Conversely, if the brain does use 20% of our energy, then I believe that humans would only be able to use 5% or less of their brains which is tiny compared to all the potential uses of 100%. Experiments where neuroscientists stimulated rat neurons showed results suggesting that cells in some brain areas communicate via electric impulses across gaps called synapses. If every neuron were firing at once (like they were in some experiments), it would fry us like an egg on a sidewalk. The likelihood of this happening decreases as you go deeper into different brain parts because nerve fibres connect both spheres called the corpus callosum. If we could use 100% of our brain, then there would be many problems running around all at once, and it wouldn't do us any good. Also, I don't know how much memory or thought processes take up, but it's clear that if we could use 100% of it, we'd be using a whole bunch more energy than we are now. This question will remain unanswered until someone can figure out how to unlock the hidden potential within the human brain, which could take a long time. Having the ability to use 100% of our brain would be beneficial in some ways because all of us would have exceptional problem-solving skills, high intelligence, and a great deal of memory. This is not realistic, though, because there's no way for us to use 100% of ours brains without becoming fried like an egg on a sidewalk. Everybody has different opinions about what they think we can achieve if we could unlock the hidden potential within our brains that only 2-3% can use. There is no definite answer, but it's fun thinking about all the possibilities this could bring. For instance, one person says we will become telepathic and communicate through thought alone, whereas another believes we'll gain more knowledge and become even more intelligent than we already are. I think it's unlikely that our brains would be able to handle the stress of having every neuron firing at once, so there is no way for 100% of our brain potential ever to be achieved. I think this question needs more research because nobody knows what would happen if we could use 100% of our brains right now. Many experiments have been done on animals, suggesting that high amounts of mental power can damage some parts of the brain doing excessive calculations or thoughts, but this has never been thoroughly tested in humans yet. However, one experiment showed that stimulating rat neurons caused some cells to fire at once and fry like an egg on a sidewalk, so it's clear that using too much energy will cause damage."},{"instruction":"Are the Sami genetically closer to Europeans or East Asians?","output":"After the Neolithic started, the Saami & other Uralic people interbred with the general European population.

While I had visited Darjeeling many times previously, this time, we made an unplanned halt at Ghoom railway station, the highest railway station in India and the second highest railway station in the world. Situated at an altitude of 7,500 feet above sea level, Ghoom railway station is a beautiful tourist destination in itself. But what caught my attention were the boards on display inside and outside the station. Currently, only the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway operates at the station. Opened in 1881, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway and Ghum railway station has been given the status of World Heritage Site by UNESCO — the only one of the four railway stations in India to attain this achievement. In the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, it used to take 5–6 days to travel on this train from Kolkata to reach Darjeeling. Today, the train operates as a toy train from the nearby town of Siliguri to Ghoom. The distance of 60 kilometres, which is usually covered in 2.5 hours on road takes 7 hours by toy train. In spite of the slow speed, the toy train gets fully booked every day as tourists do not miss a chance to experience this heritage. The interior of the train carriages is said to be very beautiful. It still runs on a steam engine and on your way to Darjeeling from Siliguri, you will often encounter the toy train.

What is a Proxy Server? Simply put, a proxy is a computer (Computer B) that acts on behalf of another computer (Computer A) when sending and receiving requests from yet another computer (Computer C). Instead of Computer A sending its request for a file or web page directly to Computer C, it routes the request through Computer B, which is the proxy. When Computer C responds with the requested file or web page, it will send the response to Computer B, who then forwards the files to the original requestor, Computer A. If all these sounds confusing, take a look at this tweeted picture to better understand what a proxy is. In effect, the proxy acts as a go-between or an intermediary between two different computers, enabling them to communicate effectively with each other. How Do Proxies Work? [LINKED_TEXT: Proxy servers] [URL: https://limeproxies.com/] act as intermediaries between an end-user (an individual or a company’s network of computers) and external web servers. Being a “middleman,” the proxy server receives the request for files and web pages from the end-user and forwards it to the destination web server. The responses of the destination web server also go through the proxy who then forwards them to the end-user. This is generally how a proxy works, although the intricate details depend on the type of proxy being used.

(But it depends) Let me explain at a high level without getting into too much technical jargon. Happy to write a post about this in more detail if people like the content. Overview In general, the main ways to prevent or reduce the frequency/intensity of lower back pain are: strength exercises, stretching, functional exercises, and warming-up before activity. There is also merit to the concept of ‘breaking the pain cycle’, which I’ll explain later in the article. Since the causes of lower back pain are varied, there are also treatments targeted to specific causes (e.g., muscle pain vs nerve pain). Because the discussion of the different causes and the related treatments is beyond the scope of this article, I will focus on general mitigation tactics that can benefit anyone with back pain. Strength Exercises 🏋️‍♀️ A large proportion of back pain is a consequence of weak muscles. Most large movements originate from the body center and require stabilization of chest, back, torse, and/or legs. Since all of this requires muscle, strength exercises are important for preventing back pain. This is easily understood with the following thought exercise: Look at your arm and think about what is providing the rigid structure that keeps your arm from flopping around like a big noodle. Spoiler alert: It’s the bones in your arm that provide a stable structure that allows your arm to function properly. Now think about your back…..your spine……is it a solid piece of bone like the one in your arm? No. The spine has evolved for mobility, not stability. The structures that keep your body and spine stabilized are the muscles around your torse, also called abdominal musculature or CORE muscles. When these muscles are strong and toned, they support your body and movements. However, if these muscles are underdeveloped, the weakness results in instability of the spine and all the problems that go with it. Bulging discs, pinched nerves, and muscle spasms are just a few of the unpleasant consequences of having weak core musculature. Stretching 🧘‍♂️ As can happen in the rest of the body, the back muscles can get tired, stiff, and tight. Any amount of physical pain or emotional stress can also cause stiffening of the torso, and back pain is a vicious cycle in which the pain causes muscle spasms, which creates more pain. Stretching reduces pain by reducing tension in the muscles around the spine, and by improving range of motion (ROM) and overall mobility. While stretching is a great preventative measure, gentle stretching may also relieve back pain in some cases that originate from muscles or pinched nerves. Functional Training 🎯 As the name suggests, functional strength training improves your ability to perform everyday functions, from carrying grocery bags into your kitchen to walking up and down the stairs. While strength training can make muscles stronger in one motion (e.g., lifting a weight), functional training uses light weights - or body weight - to help your muscles work together to keep your joints moving properly and keeping you safe from injury. Warming Up ❤️‍🔥 Last but definitely not least is warming up. Been hearing about it since high-school. Never thought much of it….until I turned 30-ish. Then I realized that my muscles can’t go from 0–60 in 5 seconds. Warming-up increases blood flow, which brings oxygen and nutrients to the parts of your body that are about to see some action. Warming-up can also combine elements of stretching and functional training to achieve an efficient and effective pre-workout routine. Breaking the Pain Cycle As mentioned above, back pain can become a vicious cycle: Pain ➡️ Reduced Activity & Flexibility ➡️ Sensitization ➡️ More Pain The best way to break the cycle is with regular daily movement & activity - just 20–30 minutes a day can do the trick. In addition to movement, we can break the pain cycle with: ❄️ Temperature - ice packs, hot shower, etc. 🕺🏽 Stretching / Massage / Physical Therapy - as we’ve already discussed, movement and activity are the best medicine for pain. Involving a professional trained in injury and pain relief is also a great way to interrupt a pain cycle and possibly even prevent the next one 🪷 Topical Pain Relievers - many options in the market 💊 Oral Pain Relievers - these should be a last resort as many of them have adverse side effects and/or serious addiction potential. Unethical actions by pharmaceutical companies selling drugs in this category caused the opioid epidemic Conclusion This has been a high-level discussion of some general principles in managing back pain.

According to Buddhism, all Gods are also within the rebirth cycle and they are bound to karma too. Gods can't pray to us for anything as much as we can't pray to them for nothing. All these prayers and superstitious beliefs are out of ignorance and according to Buddhism, ignorance is the root cause of all sufferings, I can't agree more. Due to people's ignorance and greed, some people created religion with claim of an all mighty God and it becomes big business. Here are some 5 good irrefutable evidence that proved the all mighty God is fake: 1) A creator god claimed to be all mighty should be the oldest and only religion but all the pagans, Greek, Chinese, Hinduism religions existed earlier. This proved their Creator claim fake. 2) Jesus similarities with Buddha. Maya to Mary, miracle pregnancy to virgin pregnancy, birth during a journey home to from home, prophesied soon after birth, both had a disciple who betrayed them, walked on water, Gautama left the palace at age 29 and Jesus appeared at 29, Gautama became Buddha at 35 and Jesus died and resurrected at around 35 too, Buddha had a big meal while Jesus had a last supper before they died, after they passed away, 500 arahants witnessed compilation of Buddha's teachings and over 500 witnesses to Jesus's resurrection etc. All coincidental ? Beside Buddha, Jesus was also found to be copied from other figures. Surely they can't be ALL coincidental. 3) Many of the Bible's mythologies was copied from older pagans, Greek, Egyptian or Hinduism religions(note the names too) E.g. Adam & Eve from Atman and Jiva, in Hinduism, big flood and survivor Noah/3 sons same as Manu/3 sons although cause of flood is different, Moses similar stories with Krishnu. Even the names of Abraham and wife/sister Sarah close to Brahma and Saraswathi beside having quite similar story. Regardless of which religion copied which, it proved this god is NOT the only true god or all mighty as it doesn't makes sense for an ALMIGHTY GOD to create or allow more copies or religions. 4) Why should a true all mighty and all knowing God allowed their people to branch off and kill their parent religion Judaism or Zoroatruism ? \\"Free will\\" as an excuse is not acceptable as earlier they claimed their God killed all people with a big flood(without freewill) because they sinned. 5) The way they collect tithings during Sunday mass is so tricky. They know people will be shy not to pay or tend to pay more when others could be watching. This is why they don't just use a stationed money box like Buddhism, Hinduism or Chinese temples where people can donate anytime. Catholics and Islam made it even bigger by suggesting donation of a certain percentage of their income."},{"instruction":"w do I create a customized WordPress website?","output":"Hey there!

It is the only way to make sure."},{"instruction":"Why does the recording in GarageBand sound so bad?","output":"If you are not happy with the sound of your recordings, the software you are using (Known as a Digital Audio Workstation or DAW) is the least likely culprit. Garageband is capable of recording at the same bit rates, sample rates, and in the same file formats as professional DAWs. There are a few other places that you should look at first. Generally the signal path for sound going into a computer is microphone/intrument→ preamp→Analog to Digital Converter. Problems at any of those steps can significantly reduce the quality of a recording. Obviously the quality of your microphone is very important. It is impossible to get a good sounding recording with a bad microphone. Unlike other parts of your signal path that can introduce colors to your sound, your microphone creates the sound. If you didn’t capture it at the moment, it is never coming back, so if your microphone has a narrow bandwidth, or does not capture the full range of frequencies, there is nothing to be done later to get that information back. Investing in a decent microphone is a must. The next step is the step most often overlooked, microphone preampfification. The most basic kind of microphone is called a dynamic microphone, this includes most every microphone seen outside recording studios and even some very popular professional microphones like the SM57. When a dynamic mic creates the electrical signal that travels down the microphone cable, it is powered only by the energy that exists in the vibrations of the air hitting the microphone. in other words, it is a very weak signal. In order to be usable in any kind of electronics, that signal has to be amplified or made louder. That stage of amplification is “preampfification” not because it happens before amplification, but because before the signal can be useful it has to be “pre-amplified”. Your microphone preamp takes a tiny little sound and makes it a big one. If you have ever blown up a tiny picture into a big one, you know that you not only lose resolution, but you can also see all of the dust and dirt on the original picture. The bigger you make it, the worse it gets. If the mic pre isn't good, it can do the same thing to your sound. It can cause the loss of resolution and the addition of lots of noise. Having a good external mic-pre can make a huge difference, however most people have an audio interface with built in microphone preamps. The audio interface is the box that plugs into your computer on one side and the audio signal on the other and it does the last step, A to D conversion. Getting an audio interface with decent mic-pres can kill two birds with one stone. Once your signal is at a level that it can be processed, it it turned from analog electrical signals into digital computer data. Good converters are super important, but this is the least likely culprit. Any digital audio interfaces with good mic-pres will generally have pretty decent conversion. That being said, you should make sure that GarageBand is set to convert to a high quality file format. There are two measures of the quality of the format, but rate and sample rate. How high you can go with either is a function of the D to A converters. Make sure you are working at a minimum of 44.1 sample rate and 24bit and make sure you are using a non-compressed file format like WAV or AIFF. Good luck with your music. Hope that helps."},{"instruction":"w much will liposuction cost in India?","output":"Liposuction is a surgical procedure that removes excess fat from specific areas of the body.

That’s the good option for the Spartans here. Only one or two Spartan commanders — Brasidas, maybe Gylippus — would be smart enough to figure it out before things got embarrassing. There are two dimensions to the problem. The first one is the longbows. Spartans would have a bad first encounter here, because they’d come to the field with some degree of confidence in their ability to shrug off archery. The big hoplon shield and a bronze cuirass offered a lot of protection against the kind of archers they were used to facing. At least in our sources, it seems like Persian archers could not really hope to penetrate Greek armor at 100 yards — this meant that in battles like Marathon, Thermopylae and Cunaxa a Greek phalanx only had to shrug off a couple of volleys before they charged into the ranks of lightly-armed archers. Arrows were a threat to exposed arms and legs — or eyes — but a well managed formation could and usually did weather them effectively. English longbows, however, were significantly more powerful than Persian bows — the Persian bow draw weights were usually around 80 lbs, while the English bows drew twice that. Persian arrows were reeds tipped with bronze, English shafts were hardwood tipped by steel arrowheads that had a millennium and a half of metallurgical advances built in. There’s a lot of controversy about the ability of a longbowman to penetrate medieval European steel armor at range — optimists think that iron might be penetrable at 200 yards and steel around 75; pessimists might drop those by half or more. Bronze will perform a bit better than iron, but Greek armor will be thinner than its medieval counterparts. The upshot is that at best the Spartans will suffer a lot more than they expect. At worst it could be a disaster if the Spartans are overconfident. Still, archers don’t usually win battles on their own against men at arms — the famous longbow battles were all won with the support of knights and footmen. However the question specifies a castle. Not only does that mean there won’t be any fearsome hoplite charge through the arrows and into the plucky English — it means the Spartans should probably just give up. Despite their warlike reputation, the Spartans were mediocre military engineers. Spartans were warrior-aristocrats who looked down on the grubby business of engineering: only the push of pikes on the battlefield was ‘real’ war. It took an entire generation of warfare to force them to apply the same determination to engineering (and naval warfare) that they showed on land. It might not be surprising that the Spartans never tried to breach the walls of Athens despite a thirty years of war — but were also stymied by the tiny town of Plataea, where a mere 500 defenders held them off for two years. Even then almost half of the defenders broke out and escaped before they town finally fell. The Spartans did take a handful of places by storm, but their most reliable tactic was starvation. So, if you can afford to build a wall around the castle to keep those English Johnnies locked in and keep supplies of food out, you’ll have them eventually … though unlike a hoplite, that helot toting stones make siege wall is not wearing armor so your wall is going to have to be at least 300 yards from the castle! Lacking artillery, mining expertise, and sophisticated siege weapons it’s highly unlikely that Spartans could take a well-built medieval castle. A 14th century castle from the age of Agincourt and Crecy was significantly more sophisticated than anything the Spartans had ever faced, with layer defenses and well-planned fields of fire. The walls of Athens, which the Spartans never breached, were only about 30 feet high — not only were there plenty of taller walls among English castles, their tallest towers might reach 80 feet or more. Depending on where you got you longbowmen, they may even have had to withstand gunpowder sieges : the longbow fought along side cannon as early as Crecy, in 1346 and the first wall breached by a cannon was in 1376, a generation before Agincourt. Suffice to say, a 14th or 15th century castle manned by veterans of Crecy, Poitiers or Agincourt was a tougher nut than any a Spartan army ever cracked. Now, go away you silly Spartan Lakedaimonioi, or I shall taunt you a second time! —-* Spartans were notorious for finding convenient religious reasons not to do things they didn’t want to do — like showing up for the battle of Marathon, for example."},{"instruction":"Which pitcher had the most effective fastball in MLB history?","output":"effective? ryan duren. he would warm up, then sail one into the backstop, hitters were usually hesitant to dig in, same with nolan ryan, fear of the express"},{"instruction":"f evolution were true (it clearly is not), what would observable evidence look like?","output":"In one place finches had ‘evolved’ beaks for local purpose.

And now the long answer: One of the (many) cool things about Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is that the film contrasts Kirk’s ability to cheat death with Spock’s ability to self-sacrifice. Even in the Star Trek reboot Spock talks about the test being designed to have people face their fears. If it’s a test, then Data with his trillions of calculations per second, should be able to outsmart the test and figure out how to save everyone in record time, right? Well, let’s keep in mind a few things. Here’s the big one: Data is not infallible. In the episode “Peak Performance” Data goes up against a Zakdorn named Sirna Kolrami and loses at a game called Strategema. Everyone is shocked, including Data, who removes himself from active duty because he thinks there’s something wrong with him. Data cleverly decides in his rematch to not play to win, but to stalemate his opponent. Kolrami quits out of frustration, and Data gets points for attacking Kolrami where he’s most vulnerable: his ego. He still could have lost, but instead of thinking like a computer trying to outthink his opponent, he used his wits. Let’s also remember another thing: Data values relationships. In the seventh season episode “Gambit” Data takes command of the Enterprise and appoints Worf his First Officer. Data doesn’t like how Worf is performing and although the most efficient action would be just to get rid of him, he explains using examples why Worf’s performance is sub-par and offers him another chance to do better. On top of that, Data expresses regret that his actions, although necessary, may have permanently damaged their friendship. His actions don’t show the side of a cold, calculating machine, but someone who cares about Worf’s growth, he wants Worf to learn and recover from a mistake, and most of all, he still wants to be able to know at the end of the day that he can call him friend. He handles the situation in a very empathic way. So, if Data were to do the Kobayashi Maru, he would have wanted to experience the inevitable outcome (failure), because would want to undergo a very human experience: face fears, contemplate loss, and grapple with the crippling notion of futility."},{"instruction":"What mobile app development companies are based in Chicago?","output":"Chicago is a developed city in the world.

Statistically, it is very uncommon to find an individual that is profitable over the long haul on sports betting. Unfortunately, luck and basic sports knowledge will only get you so far. These successful bettors tend to possess some common traits that aid them in being better at sports betting than the rest of the pack. Below, we’ll go into detail on some of the common traits of successful sports bettors. After reviewing this list, you might decide to work on some of these areas in an attempt to be more like them. By fine-tuning some of these skills yourself, you might be able to become a more successful sports bettor. Common Traits of Successful Sports Bettors We’ve compiled a list of some of the most common traits of successful sports bettors. While not a complete list by any means, this list encompasses the vast majority of important traits held by these bettors. It’s important to note that a successful bettor doesn’t necessarily need to have all of these traits, but they will possess most of them. With that said, let’s get into it! Knowledge of Sports This common trait of sports bettors should be pretty obvious, but we wanted to make sure that we stated it regardless. In order to be successful, sports bettors need to have a solid knowledge of sports. Without this trait, it is honestly near impossible to become good at sports betting. Having a good knowledge of sports allows successful sports bettors to understand better things that might impact their wagers. Using their knowledge of sports, these successful bettors have a good understanding of the many different things that can impact the outcome of sporting events. This allows them the chance to make better-educated wagers than someone that is not as knowledgeable about sports. Strong Math Skills Betting on sports involves a ton of numbers. From historical performance data to bookmaker odds, there are lots of numbers to look at and analyze. If you’re not good at math, it can be tough to understand what all of these numbers mean to you and your sports betting wagers. Successful sports bettors tend to have very strong math skills. Using this skill set, they are able to quickly understand what the data they have access to means. Often, these types of bettors will then crunch some serious numbers to help them determine what wagers they want to place. At the end of the day, these bettors use their strong math skills to quickly analyze and interpret data for the sake of making quick and educated betting decisions. Excellent Money Management Something else that successful sports bettors do well is managed their money. Without excellent money management skills, it’s hard to make a long and successful run in sports betting. If you end up betting too much of your bankroll on single games, it could be detrimental to your bankroll balance. This is a common mistake that recreational bettors make. Successful sports bettors will have established strict money management guidelines for themselves, and they will stick to these no matter what. These money management lines will determine how much of their total bankroll will be placed on each wager. Instead of swinging for the fence on each bet, the goal of a successful sports bettor will be to make money over the long haul. Evaluation of All Game Factors A recreational sports bettor will often just look at a handful of factors, such as which team is favored, when making their betting decision. Even though there is much more information that could be evaluated, your average sports bettor tends to stop right there. However, successful sports bettors make an evaluation of all game factors, not just the basics. When it comes to successful sports bettors, they are peeling back as many layers of the onion as possible. While basic stats are great, these bettors go much deeper in an attempt to evaluate all game factors. Example Successful bettors will consider the health of all players, not just the quarterback and wide receivers. As well, they’ll often consider things such as team grudges and teams coming off of big losses and how that might impact the game. For you to be more of a successful sports bettor, you’ll want to do your best to evaluate everything you possibly can. It can take a bit to train yourself to think outside of the box, but this is how you can work to get a leg up like the professionals do. By thinking differently and looking at all aspects of the game, you’re more likely to catch something that many others will miss. Emotional Control One of the biggest things that separates professional gamblers from recreational gamblers is that professionals can control their emotions. Unfortunately, this is not something that too many recreational bettors understand. Like some other things on our traits of successful sports bettors, emotional control is something that is easier said than done. Often, recreational sports bettors let their emotions get the best of them. If a recreational sports bettor grew up in a diehard Green Bay Packers family, he’d probably have a hard time not betting on the Packers, regardless of what the odds or data say. However, a successful sports bettor that also grew up in a diehard Green Bay Packers family will know when to toss his love for the Packers aside to make a smart betting decision. Emotional control is a tough habit to master. However, it will be impossible to become a successful sports bettor if you can’t set your emotions aside. Emotions all too often get in the way of making sound betting decisions based solely on data. If you’d like to become more of a successful bettor, you’ll have to learn emotional control so that you begin to make decisions based on data as opposed to your emotions. Line Shopping Another common trait of successful sports bettors is that they shop their lines. Unlike recreational sports bettors that typically rely on just one sportsbook, these bettors will usually shop their lines across multiple sportsbooks. By shopping around, successful bettors can make sure that they are getting the best bang for their buck. In many cases, lines tend to be pretty close from one sportsbook to the next. However, this is not always the case. If a successful sports bettor is able to find a sportsbook offering a wager at 0.5 points better than the market average, they’ll be coming out ahead if they win the bet. What’s nice about line shopping is that it allows you to get the maximum value from your winning wager. If you’re not currently line shopping, you should definitely consider it. At a minimum, we’d suggest that you sign up with at least two different sportsbooks. When you’re ready to make a wager, be sure to shop the lines between the two sportsbooks. Your goal should be to find the one offering you the best pricing. While it might not seem like much on an individual bet basis, line shopping can add some serious growth to your bottom line as you become better at sports betting. By not line shopping, you’ll end up leaving money on the table, and that’s no fun! Strong Discipline When it comes to successful sports bettors, another common trait that they have is a strong discipline. Using this strong discipline, these bettors are able to stick to a plan and remain focused on the overall long-term goal. Unfortunately, this is not a trait that the majority of recreational bettors have. Strong discipline is key in the grand scheme of things if you want to become successful at sports betting. Successful sports bettors will utilize strong discipline in areas such as staking plans, bankroll management, and the overall wager plan of attack. Emotions can play into making poor discipline decisions, which is why these bettors tend to have emotional control and a strong discipline. Without them, it’s too easy to get off track. Ability to Understand Value A successful sports bettor will have a good ability to understand value. When it comes to recreational bettors, they don’t usually analyze the value of a bet. For them, they’ll just pick a winner and call it a day. Successful bettors, however, will look at a bet’s overall value to determine if it is worth the risk. What successful sports bettors look for are wagers that have a high value. An ideal wager will have a big potential payout with a relatively small risk. The goal of these bettors is to not risk a huge amount of cash for a relatively small overall return. By understanding value, successful sports bettors work to get more bang for their buck. Unlike recreational bettors that don’t look for value, successful bettors will come out ahead in the long run by searching for this extra value. If you’d like to learn more about value, check out our article about probabilities and value. Strong Analytical Capabilities Something else that successful sports bettors typically possess is strong analytical capabilities. When it comes to sports betting, there is a ton of data that needs to be analyzed. To be successful, you need to be able to review and interpret historical data, bookmaker odds, and much more. Without these skills, it is tough to become successful over the long haul. Often, successful sports bettors will have created their own systems to help them analyze all of the data that is important to them. In some cases, they use programs like Microsoft Excel or other proprietary software that they have created. The goal of these bettors is to review and analyze as much data as possible to make the best informed decision they can. Unfortunately, analyzing data is not something that comes naturally to many people. Unless you’re a financial analyst or banker, then the odds are that you’ve not had any formal training in data analysis. What’s nice is that you can learn to be better at data analysis if you’re willing to take the time to study. If data analysis is not currently a strong suit, you can find lots of good tips and research on the internet to help you begin to sharpen your analytical capabilities. Ability to Take a Long-Term View Patience is a key trait of successful sports bettors. Many sports bettors quickly become unmotivated after having a few bad losses in a row. What differentiates successful bettors is that they are able to step back and take a long-term view. Successful sports bettors know that they won’t win every bet. However, sports bettors set a goal for themselves that they want to win more often than not. Even in runs of losses, successful bettors understand that there are highs and lows in what they do. Overall, a successful sports bettor on average will win somewhere between 50% and 60% of their wagers. It’s important to note that this means that they are still losing plenty. To keep their head in the game, these bettors will learn from losses and realize that losing sometimes is still part of the process. It is important for you to be able to take a long-term view if you’d like to become a better sports bettor. Along the way, there will be setbacks. However, you need to not get discouraged by these setbacks, and continue to hone your skills. If you give up too quickly and easily, you might be missing out on something much larger. The sooner that you can train yourself to take a long-term view when it comes to sports betting, the sooner you’ll be more in line with successful sports bettors. Strong Organizational Skills Another key trait of successful sports bettors tends to be strong organizational skills. As we’ve discussed previously, there is a ton of data when it comes to sports betting. These bettors will be able to properly organize and sort this information so that they can make sense of it. It doesn’t matter how much data you have access to if you’re not able to sort it and make educated guesses about it. Strong organizational skills also come in handy with tracking the bets that you have placed. Tracking your bets is an important part of bankroll management. If you’re not able to keep this organized, you might quickly find your bankroll in trouble. A successful bettor will keep meticulous records of bets placed, along with tracking any associated wins and losses. If organizational skills are not a strong suit of yours, you can definitely work to improve them. We’d suggest that you start by tracking your bets. You can use something as easy as pen and paper, but we’d recommend using something computer-based, such as Microsoft Excel. Your ultimate goal should be to record a history of your sports betting wagers. Using this organized data, you can then refer to it to review your historical trends to see what worked for you and what didn’t. As an added bonus, you’ll have a better view of the health of your sports betting bankroll. Flexible, Adaptable, Resilient To be successful, sports bettors need to be flexible, adaptable, and resilient. A successful sports bettor will know that things change over time and that in turn means that their plans and strategies must also change. Being flexible and adaptable is key. Those unwilling to change their ways are less likely to be successful over time. Resilience is another key trait of successful sports bettors. Sometimes you’ll feel like the king of the world, and other times you’ll feel like an elephant has just trampled you. A successful bettor will remain resilient even in the down times, knowing that you have to take the good with the bad. If your goal is to become a more successful sports bettor, you should work to be all three of these things. It’s much easier said than done, but you should work to become more flexible, adaptable, and resilient over time. By adopting these qualities, you’ll better align yourself with some of the traits of successful sports bettors."},{"instruction":"What happens if a person who orders pizza takes the pizza and refuses to pay?","output":"This does place the owner of the pizza shop in a sticky situation. Some may call the police on anyone who walks away without paying. I don’t blame the pizza owner for doing this because the owner of the business most frequently works hard for his/her money and theft should not be tolerated. It is a different situation however when the person comes in hungry and asks for food, gets the pizza and then walks away. In such a situation, the owner will not accept monies for the exchange. It will be done as a write off. We had a bizarre situation happen once when someone bought a 200 plus raccoon statue from us. We had inspected and then shipped the statue to the customer. It was a sturdy sculpture - not easily breakable through shipping and the statue was well packed. When the customer got the statue, he emailed us a picture claiming it broke. We took a look at the statue and realized something fishy had just happened. On appearance, there seemed nothing wrong with the statue but beneath the tail of the raccoon statue, we saw a big round hole which seemed to have been caused by a drill bit. The hole seemed too round and too clean to suggest it occurred because of breakage. Right away, we knew the customer had used a drill to make a hole and cry “foul”. It was also interesting to note that the whole sculpture looked good except when you look at the bottom of the tail and notice this little hole that was made. Situations of this order do occur and business owners sometimes suffer immensely because of such customers. Then again, we have seen customers who have been so exceptionally nice in explaining and trying to get a second statue after breaking the first one, that we have extended further by rewarding them either a discount or sent them a nice token to let them know how much we appreciate them being true."},{"instruction":"Which Bollywood actresses have viraled their MMS?","output":"Top 5 actresses have viraled MMS scandals in Bollywood Kareena Kapoor and Shahid Kapoor Kareena Kapoor and Shahid Kapoor reportedly caught headlines with their leaked MMS.

I am blessed and humbled to have Telugu as my Mother Tongue.. 1) The first and Foremost Thing I like about Telugu is that , we call Kids ether in adorable manner or in respectful manner as “Amma/Nanna” (Mother /Father).. Like “ Ituchudandi naanna, itu vinale amma, adi kaadu nanna/naayana, etc” ..Even many teachers address students as “Arthamayinda Amma, Arthamayinda nanna”.. That is the beauty of telugus.. we see our elders in children !! This is in addition to “kanna, buji, bidda, etc” (the adorable addresses specific to children).. Perhaps it is more to do with culture than language, as it is primary way of addressing children, I put it as part of language.. 2) Another Beautiful aspect of Telugu is Having Dvyarthi and Trayarthi kavyas (Double and triple Entendres[LINKED_TEXT: ] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_entendre]) .. Very few languages have that like Sanskrit or Kannada /Tamizh have such extremely tough poetic works.. Take the examples of Raghava Pandaveeyam, Raghva Yadava Pandavaeeyam, etc It is said that Vemulawada Bhimakavifirst written “Raghava Pandaveeyam”, a work which was lost in course of time.. But During Golden Age of telugu Literature in Viajayanagara SriKrishna Devaraya Time, one of his court poets (Ashta Diaggajas)- Pingali Surana has written Raghava Pandaveeyam and is said to have mentioned earlier work of Bhima kavi.. In Raghava Pandaveeyam , Surana had written in such a way that if we read the kavyam/poetic book from first to last with one meaning , we get the story of Ramayana . If read the same book from first to last by considering the other meaning of words , we get the story of Mahabharata.. Two epics !! Raghava Yadava Pandaveeyam tells the story of Rama, Krishna and mahabharatha by considering three different meanings of the words.. Think the beauty of creativity in that.. And just assume how tough and hard problem is it,.. People from Mathematics and Computer Science domains can easily analyze the complexity of this problem— “The poet has to chose the words that will have different meanings, which should satisfy the grammatical set up, also the words which will help the flow of the story , the character names in completely two different and long stories, and most importantly making it interesting to readers !!” I think it is definitely NP-Hard problem.. Perhaps it will be a great insight into algorithmic and NLP research if we try to decode the algorithm employed by these poets to scale double entendres to such a long epic !! Even Shakespeare is said to have written double entendres of not more than one paragraph due to the complexity of the problem!! Just great , no words !! 3) What I like about telugu is that it is highly classical , beautiful and musical both with and without vowel ending.. Many feel that telugu is beautiful just because of vowel Ending.. No it is also beautiful even with consonant ending !! Observe the following images of Anjaneya Dandakam—It is musical and beautiful even with consonant endings..!! Beautiful mixture of Telugu and Sanskrit without any abrupt break.. Personally, I feel that Telugus should have popularized Anjaneya Dandakam across india, just like that of Hanuman chalisa of Braj bhasha..Both are equally divine and spiritual.. 4) I can also say about great Mathematical and poetic arts of Chandasu , Avadhanam (which is present only in Telugu after Sankritam, and Kannada also adopted it later)..or Musical or Literary beauty of telugu.. But what makes telugu unique is that its ease to mix with other languages..Not only telugu enables great compatibility with these non-native languages, but also enriched the language with vocabulary and increased its idioms strength. (My answer is definitely going to hurt the feelings of Pure Telugu enthusiasts (which even includes me).. But I am here to show the beauty of my language , not confirming that pure telugu is impossible task..) You may question, does having loan words is quite common in all languages.. Off late Englsih is loaned in all languages, what is so special about telugu than?? You can’t easily differentiate loan words from Telugu as telugu has a trait of great rapport and intermingling with the languages that it loans the words from.. We all know the major languages that Influenced telugu- “Sanskrit, Prakrit, Persian/urdu and English”, right..? The amalgamation with these languages in some literary works is so high that even after absence of almost all telugu vocabulary (except few connecting prepositions), the whole work is passable as telugu .. Even in the above Anjaneya Dandakam, the bold lyrics are initially completely in Sanskrit and suddenly it turns into Telugu (but even the telugu part in this dandakam has many Sanskrit loan words).. On a side note, It would be beautiful, if we coin pure Telugu words for the Telugu section of Anjaneya Dankdakam, keeping the Sanskrit Section as it is.. It would be another beautiful gem of Telugu !! And Sanskrit /Samskrutam is definitely.. See the following Sankeertana of Naada Brahma Tyagaraja swami varu (a great Saint -Composer of Carnatic Music). Ragam : Atana (29th melakartha janyam) Talam : Adi See the following link for meaning and lyrics in Englsih transliteration [LINKED_TEXT: http://www.shivkumar.org/music/elaneedayaradu.htm] [URL: http://www.shivkumar.org/music/elaneedayaradu.htm] In the above lyric, the ones which are in bold are actually “Telugu” (even in that Samayam , daya Sanskrit loans, hence italicized them)..And the remaining are all Sanskrit with strict Sanskrit pronunciation itself..Even If you see the flow either during singing or during reading, you don’t see any break and it continues as a single language.. that is the beauty of telugu.. Not even Indo-Aryan languages can amalgamate and gel with Sanksrit so well as Telugu !! Or see the following composition from Annamacharya (hailed as Andhra Pada Kavitaa Pitamaha).. In fact I like the style of Annamayya , he composed Keertanas in pure Sanskrit, pure telugu and in varying degree of Sanskrit -Telugu mix !! Ragam: Bowli (15th Melakartha (Mayamalavagowla) Janyam) , Talam:Adi The only bold ones are actually Telugu , remaining whole Keertana is in Sanskrit, but you will never feel that it is Sanksrit Song.. The telugu is used only for pronouns and conjunction !! You know telugu even gels well with English, and perhaps my large-hearted Telugu scholars have written and composed a classical “Jhavali” for Bharatanatyam in “Karaharapriya” raagam with lyrics as a mixture of Telugu_English way back in early 1800s . See one charanam of the javali of “Oh my lovely lalana” composed by Karur Sivaramayya garu O my lovely LalanaElane PommantiItuvanti Step, is it fit to take?Sit a while hereLet me convince you. In the above only the bold words are telugu, remaining is English..Perhaps it is a first of its kind of Literary Fusion with English in classical arts of India !! Karur Sivaramayya garu is known to have written many such javalais mixing Kannada, Tamizh , English and Telugu languages.

As my friend Thilak has said, there are many old Telugu songs like “Joruga husharu ga shikarukeldama”.. (except preposition and last verb , everything is Urdu !!).. It is said that Yayati Charitram of Telaganna also has Persian loans (this work of yayati charitra is often cited as pure Telugu work) Will add more later.. :) Sorry for hurting pure Telugu notion..

Because of its anti-inflammatory and moisturising qualities, it is a well-liked component in many skincare products. Aloe vera gel can be applied on the face overnight with no risk. I myself leave aloevera gel overnight on my skin. Aloe vera gel is non-toxic and likely to result in allergic reactions or skin rashes. When using aloe vera gel for the first time, you should perform a patch test, especially if you have sensitive skin. Applying aloe vera gel to your face overnight will help to lessen irritation and redness if you have oily or acne-prone skin.

It may work by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing glucose production in the liver.Gymnema (Gymnema sylvestre): This herb has been shown to help lower blood sugar levels by blocking the absorption of sugar in the intestines and improving insulin secretion from the pancreas.Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum): Fenugreek seeds have been shown to help lower blood sugar levels by improving insulin sensitivity and reducing glucose absorption in the intestines.Cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum): Cinnamon has been shown to help improve insulin sensitivity and reduce blood sugar levels in people with diabetes.

The better analogy is clearly between Ukraine and Israel. Both Ukrainians and Israeli have lost the sovereignty for many centuries - they were citizens in countries ruled by other nations (the Russian Empire; the Arab civilization or the Roman and British Empire) and they simply didn’t have any territory of their own. So recently, in 1948 in the case of Israel, 1991 in the case of Ukraine, they finally declared independence and sovereignty over some territory that used to belong to their ancestors a millennium or two or three ago (Judea from the Bible etc. and Kievan Rus), and they are still being terrorized and their very right to have a country (or to exist and stay alive?) is being challenged by the large sea-like nation that surrounds them - which is Arabs or Muslims (including the Iranians!) in the Israeli case, and Russians in the Ukrainians’ case. Palestinians as a separate nation are really a deception. They are just Arabs who want to take some territory (which has belonged to the Jews since 1948) even though Arabs already (and still) have a huge territory around, including gigatons of fossil fuels (sorry but the land that is controlled by Arabs is a vastly greater percentage of the landmass than the percentage of Arab contributions to mankind). The word for Palestine has been around for over 2,000 years (Palashtu, Pilistu)… but only much more recently, it became a territory with an Arab quasi-majority. Those 2,000 years ago, the dominant inhabitants had a very different ethnic origin. Jews were moving there before Israel was established and soon afterwards, they became a majority in Israel (and even extended Israel) instead. But the non-Jewish people who compete with Jews are not really members of some very old nation that has an equally characteristic tie with the territory. They are simply a subset of Arabs whose ancestors came there much more recently, but they finally lost this small piece of the Arab land around 1948. The claims that the Arabs have the right to control the territory of Israel are pretty much the same fascist demagogy as the Russians’ claimed right to own Ukraine."},{"instruction":"it possible to use an extensive vocabulary without being a jerk?","output":"Some words just \\"fit\\" better than others in certain circumstances, and I'm sure you've been in a situation where you consciously chose the \\"big\\" word because you found it more appropriate for the situation than the alternative, otherwise you wouldn't be asking this question. Of course it's possible to flex your vocabulary muscles, because \\"being a jerk\\" is entirely the other person's opinion. You can use small or big words, and it's still possible that you'll be found to be a jerk because the gist of what you're saying is still the same. But of course if we're talking about an entirely neutral situation, i.e. normal everyday discussion, then it's really down to a matter of practicality and, as everyone else here has already said, reading your audience. I say practicality because it really depends on if you want to spend time digressing from the conversation at hand to explain the big word you just used, and if the audience is okay with that. You'll be able to pick up cues from people on whether they want to hear fancy words by listening to them speak. If they're fine with shooting a few big ones off, then they should be fine hearing a few too.

In a 2009 interview with GQ magazine, Fox said she has a \\"weird\\" genetic mutation that makes her \\"really good\\" at certain things. He did not elaborate on what these things are, but said that she is \\"really good at learning languages\\" and has \\"really good spatial awareness\\".

You call the doctor to make an appointment. You talk to a receptionist who asks you questions about your reason for needing an appointment. You don't have to answer these but they help the Receptionist work out how serious your problem is and give you an appointment based on that. If its judged important (you have what sounds like a serious infection, for example that might get worse if not treated) then you get an emergency appointment, usually same day. If less serious it might be scheduled later, maybe a few days or weeks. If they think its critical, you might even get them calling an ambulance to take you straight to hospital (as happened to me once). The NHS 111 and NHS direct service also do this function. You call 111 and talk to a qualified nurse who decides the best course of action. This might include giving you advice (take some painkillers, bed rest and contact again if not better in a couple of days) or them contacting your doctor for you and making the appointment or even calling the aforementioned ambulance. Generally, however, no matter how serious your problem is you will get seen and given advice.

At most casinos, drinks are free, as long as you are gambling. So, the trick here is to save your drinking for your gambling time, and to play slowly. A convenient venue for this approach might be the video poker machines at the bar in one of the lounges. Here, there is no human dealer, so there is no one to push you. The odds won’t be as good as table Blackjack, but they may be good enough for the math wiz to calculate the cost of play in terms of how many drinks it represents. In this scenario, imagine that drinks cost 5 each if paid directly. If the minimum to play the poker machine is 20, then that’s 4 drinks. As long as you aren’t scarfing down 150 proof rum, you could possibly stretch your time on the machine to as long as 30 to 45 minutes, because you WILL WIN now and then, and those winnings are added to what remains of your initial deposit. Thus you should order “sissy” drinks like a whiskey sour, grasshopper, seven and seven, bloody Mary, screwdriver, or some similar abomination. The desired outcome is that the cost of play is the same as the cost of the drinks, give or take. AND THERE IS ALWAYS THE CHANCE that you will win BIG; a straight flush, full house, 4 of a kind, etc. Because each deal assumes a full deck, the math brains can calculate (or just lookup) the chances of any big winning hand. And many video poker machines tell you the house edge. Thus our band of merry mathematicians works out a plan: The 20 of them agree to spread out over 4 or 5 lounges, (perhaps even at different casinos) and seat themselves before the poker machines at the bar, appearing to be strangers to one another. They will play for one hour, then compare notes. But play is not random; the math wizards already know the proper strategy, because they have consulted this web site: [LINKED_TEXT: Video Poker Lessons] [URL: https://vegasclick.com/games/videopoker] and pre-selected the best machines. If someone hits it big, a text message is sent to all the others: “STOP.” At that point, everyone cashes out. This might not bring down the casino, but at the very least you’ll have a happy troupe of wasted mathematicians. Hope that helps."},{"instruction":"What are some home cleaning tips for men?","output":"During my first semester of college, I roomed with my good friend from high school in a dorm at the University of Oklahoma. We were pretty much like The Odd Couple, with me playing the part of the slobby Oscar Madison and my friend taking on the role of neat freak Felix Ungar, minus the annoying neuroticism. You could walk into our dorm room and instantly tell whose side was whose. My roommate’s side always looked presentable and clean: bed made, desk neat, clothes put away. My side looked like a disaster area: blankets and sheets askew, books and newspapers covering my bed, and laundry only half put away. The mess on my little twin bed sometimes got so big and unmanageable that I’d just sleep on top of all my crap, like you see those crazy people do on Hoarders. Thankfully, my roommate was quite patient with me and kindly nudged me to start routines that would keep our place looking spic and span. I soon discovered that keeping things clean didn’t take all that much time or effort. In less than 30 minutes a day, we created a haven of order and tidiness that would make Mr. Clean and my mom nod with approval. And my turning over a new leaf couldn’t have come at a better time, as I started dating Kate soon after. It was nice being able to invite her over to our place without having to worry she’d be frightened to use a bathroom that looked like a giant petri dish of mold, bacteria, and other gunk. For many young men heading out on their own for the first time, maintaining a cleaning routine on their own wasn’t something they had to do at home. Sure, they might have helped with chores when asked, but they probably had their mom or dad telling them what to clean and when. But keeping your dwelling space in [LINKED_TEXT: home products] [URL: https://lovedfortress.shop/] clean and tidy is important for a variety of reasons, it’s hygienic, allows you to feel comfortable having people over and inviting in surprise guests, gives you peace of mind, and even helps conserve your supply of willpower."},{"instruction":"Are there any Enterprise Cloud sharing solutions like DropBox but that suit a larger user base.

For example, The 2nd chord in the Key of C is the chord Dm. Note that there’s no number in the chord name. It’s the 2nd chord in the key, but its quality is minor. The quality ‘9th’ implies that you have a dominant 7 chord (for argument’s sake an E7 chord), and it has an additional note above the 7th degree of the scale. The notes of E9 would be: E (root note), G# (third), B (Fifth), D (flat 7), and F# (the 9th) You’re right in thinking that the 9th note of the scale is the same as the 2nd note in the scale, but technically the 9th is higher than the octave of the first note of the scale.

Jobs recognized that Apple needed a cash infusion to stay afloat, and he also knew that having Microsoft as an ally would be incredibly valuable. Jobs used his excellent negotiation skills to persuade Gates to invest in Apple, and as part of the deal, Microsoft agreed to continue developing Microsoft Office for the Mac and to support the Mac platform with other software. This move was incredibly shrewd because it gave Apple the financial resources it needed to turn its fortunes around, and it also gave Apple a powerful ally in Microsoft. The investment also helped to repair the relationship between the two companies, which had been strained for years.

To get to that, you have to read the whole chapter, and to know a little about the circumstances of the time. Christianity grew up in Judea; all the first Christians were Jews, and were, therefore, circumcised. (Circumcision is the physical mark of being a Jew, commanded to Abraham in Genesis and made law for all Jews by Moses.) When the Gospel began to spread among non-Jews, the question arose - should these people be circumcised? By becoming Christians, are they becoming Jews? Are they inheriting all the Law as well as the history of the Jewish faith that led to the coming of Christ? A number of crises and disagreements in the early church revolved around this question. A gathering of church leaders in Jerusalem debated this question quite early on; it’s described in Acts 15. They decided that the answer was no; non-Jewish believers did not have to become practising adherents to the Jewish religion. They made this decision because Peter, Paul, and Barnabas told about how the Holy Spirit had fallen on non-Jews just as it had on them, and that if God accepted them by grace, it was obvious that He was accepting them all (including the Jews) by faith, not by the works that marked the Jewish law. The only rules they felt had to be imposed on the new believers were to refrain from being involved in idol worship by eating the meat offered to idols, to refrain from sexual immorality (without specifications), and to refrain from eating meat from strangled animals or from eating or drinking blood. These rules were not needed to bring salvation to the non-Jewish believers, but to keep them from offending the Jewish believers so much it caused division between them. However, at a later date, some of the leaders from Jerusalem went to the churches in Galatia, arguing that all these non-Jewish believers had to become circumcised, i.e., to adopt the Jewish Law, in order to be Christians and be saved. In Galatians, Paul is opposing this teaching. He is basing his position on that taken by the Jerusalem Council in Acts - the non-Jews did not have to obey the Jewish Law, because they were saved by the grace of God in Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection, and they didn’t need anything else. In this specific verse, he is arguing that to take his opponents’ position would be to oppose God, to set aside God’s grace as if it were not enough, and to imply that Jesus’ death was essentially futile, because people still need the Law besides. When people use this verse today, it is generally to point out that salvation for a Christian is by faith and not by works, that believing in the sacrificial death of Christ on our behalf is all we need, and we need nothing further. This sometimes needs to be said, because there are people who think of Christianity as a system of morality, which is very far from the truth, although morality is believed to be an outgrowth of salvation. There are now even whole denominations claiming that Christians need to keep the whole Law of Moses, in direct opposition to Paul’s statement in this verse. For the individual Christian, the verse tells us that we do not need to depend on anything we ourselves do, but can depend wholly on Christ for salvation and new life."},{"instruction":"w do homosexuals decide who is the alpha; coin toss?","output":"Every relationship has its ups and downs.

Keep in mind that this was well before smartphones, or laptops. A good HP21 calculator was still top of the line. A number of my classes had final exams that were open book, open notes, whatever. Anything short of a live expert to ask questions of. The professors wanted you to be able to solve the problem and to be able to use the resources you would normally have (other than a live mentor that is). Since these exams are timed, you really had to know the material in the first place to do well. If you had to spend time digging into the textbook for a lot of help, there was not going to be much time, but this did avoid having to spend pointless hours memorizing equations and formulas. The feeling was in industry or later work, you would confirm that you were using the right stuff before moving on and not just trust your memory. As mentioned many times, collaboration on assignments was actively encouraged. The point was to learn the material. Problem sets (homework) usually only counted for a small portion of the final grade, and if you just copied stuff from other folks and did not learn it, then the exams and quizzes could be brutal. Most of the time the questions on each year's exam were new or tweaked in special ways from previous ones. One exam I took in a thermo course was especially brutal. We all left the exam and no one had been able to solve that problem (one of 5) on the 90-minute exam. Next lecture the professor apologized and said he goofed. He had changed some critical parameters which meant that the question he had asked took him and his TA’s well over an hour to solve. He had not checked into what the changes he had made meant to the complexity of the problem. So the exam was rescaled to the other 4 questions and any credit you got on that question was a bonus."},{"instruction":"w can we use chat GPT in the best possible way?","output":"Here are some tips for using Chat GPT wisely: Be specific: Provide as much context and detail as possible when asking a question or making a request.

I’m going to assume you’re sharpening by hand if you are asking this question, and not using a sharpening system like a Tormek or WorkSharp which will give you a great edge easily. To sharpen a chisel (assuming you mean a bench chisel, not a woodturning chisel with a curved edge), the first thing you need to do is to get the back completely flat. This is something that most factory sharpened tools are lacking. You can do this by attaching a piece of relatively coarse sandpaper to a known flat surface such as a piece of glass, a chunk of stone countertop material, or the top of your tablesaw or jointer. Lap the back of the chisel quickly, and you’ll see that there are likely spots that haven’t been scratched, showing you where it isn’t flat. The goal is to continue lapping it on the sandpaper until those spots go away, and you are getting an even scratch pattern across the metal. If your chisel is really off, you need to get it flat at the back of the cutting edge at least. Going way above that doesn’t matter. Once you’ve gotten it flat, work up through the grits (you can get automotive wet/dry paper in very high grits that will put a mirror polish on metal tools) until you have a high polish on it. You can also do this on a diamond stone, but not everyone has one of those. It’s harder to do on an oil/water stone, as that surface can wear over time and may not be flat. Then you need to sharpen the bevel. Unless you are really experienced, using a honing guide like the Veritas Honing Guide, shown below, will help you to keep the tool steady as you sharpen. Again, work through the grits until you have a fine polish on the primary bevel. For a normal bench chisel, a 25 degree angle is common. To help you keep the tool sharp, you then might want to put a secondary bevel on the front edge. This involves raising the angle by a few degrees and sharpening until a small section - maybe 1/16″ is beveled at that angle. This makes it easier to keep the tool sharp by only having to hone that small section each time. The sandpaper sharpening method I described above is often called ‘scary sharp’. You’ll find lots of resources on the web about it - both articles and videos. I found this simple text-based guide which I think describes it pretty well….

Let’s start building the function. Since [math]f(f(1)) = 3[/math], and [math]f[/math] is increasing, the only option is [math]f(1) = 2[/math], and we have [math]f(1) = 2[/math] [math]f(2) = 3[/math] [math]f(3) = 5[/math] [math]f(5) = 7[/math] which forces [math]f(4) = 6[/math] Then we can go ahead and get [math]f(6) = 9[/math] [math]f(7) = 11[/math] [math]f(9) = 13[/math] And we got “lucky” again because there’s only one possible value for the next gap [math]f(8) = 12[/math] But I claim that was no luck. The gap between [math]f(7)[/math] and [math]f(9)[/math] was exactly [math]2[/math] because [math]7[/math] and [math]9[/math] were the images of two consecutive numbers (namely [math]5[/math] and [math]6[/math]) So, if we can prove that the gap between two consecutive images is always [math]1[/math] or [math]2[/math], we’re done. Why? If a number [math]n[/math] has already appeared in the second column, i.e. if it is [math]f(k)[/math] for some [math]k[/math], then we know that [math]f(n)[/math] will be [math]2k+1[/math]. Otherwise, we’ll have to have a [math]k[/math] such that [math]f(k) = n-1[/math] and [math]f(k+1) = n+1[/math], which means that [math]f(n-1) = 2k+1[/math], [math]f(n+1) = 2k+3[/math], and [math]f(n)[/math] is forced to be [math]2k+2[/math]. So let’s prove that Claim: For every [math]k in N[/math], [math]f(k+1) - f(k) in {1,2}[/math] Proof: We’ve already proved this for [math]k leq 9[/math]. Now assume this is true for all [math]k < m > 7[/math]. We want to prove that [math]f(m) - f(m-1) = 1[/math] or [math]2[/math]. Since [math]f(m-1) > m+1[/math] (given that [math]f(7) = 11 > 7+1[/math] and that [math]f[/math] is strictly increasing, which means that [math]f(n) - n[/math] is non-decreasing), and, by hypothesis, there is no gap bigger than 2 in the consecutive values of the function up to this point, that means that ther exists a [math]k < m[/math] such that either [math]f(k) = m[/math] or [math]f(k) = m-1[/math]. Suppose that both [math]m[/math] and [math]m-1[/math] are in the image of [math]f[/math]. Then necessarily (by monotonicity), we need to have [math]f(k) = m-1[/math], [math]f(k+1) = m[/math] for some [math]k[/math], which means that [math]f(m) - f(m-1) = 2k + 3 - (2k + 1) = 2[/math], and we’re done. If [math]m[/math] isn’t on the image, by the induction hypothesis, we’ll have a [math]k<m[/math] such that [math]f(k) = m-1[/math] and [math]f(k+1) = m+1[/math], which means that [math]f(m-1) = 2k+1[/math], [math]f(m+1) = 2k+3[/math], hence [math]f(m) = 2k+2[/math] and [math]f(m) - f(m-1) = 1[/math], done. The only case left is that [math]m[/math] is on the image of [math]f[/math], but [math]m-1[/math] is not. Then we have [math]f(k) = m-2[/math], [math]f(k+1) = m[/math], [math]f(m-2) = 2k+1[/math], [math]f(m) = 2k+3[/math], [math]f(m-1) = 2k+2[/math], and [math]f(m) - f(m-1) = 1[/math], Q.E.D. PS: naively, one would expect [math]f(n)/n[/math] to converge to [math]sqrt{2}[/math], but it doesn’t seem to be true. Actually, [math]f(n)/n[/math] oscillates between 4/3 and 3/2. Here’s the plot of [math]f(n)/n[/math] for [math]n<10^7[/math] The distance between consecutive crests (or valleys) grows exponentially, with a factor of 2, since [math]f(n) = 3/2 ; n Rightarrow f(3/2 ; n) = 2n + 1 = 4/3 ; (3/2 ; n) + 1Rightarrow f(2n+1) = 3n + 1 = 3/2 ; (2n + 1) - 1/2[/math] PPS: The simple pyhton script I used to calculate [math]f[/math] up to [math]10^7[/math]: f = {1:2} k=1 for i in range(2,10000000): while f[k] < i: k = k+1 if f[k] == i: f[i] = 2*k+1 if f[k] == i+1: f[i] = 2*k"},{"instruction":"What would you do if one of your bridesmaids didn't like the dress you have chosen for her?","output":"Bring the bridesmaid out for shopping… or change the bridesmaid"},{"instruction":"f there are big cats, why are there no big dogs?","output":"Big cats mostly hunt alone and rely on a short burst of speed to catch their prey, and swipes from their claws to bring it down.

We colloquially group cats and dogs together because we keep domestic versions of both of them as pets, but they are different animals that have evolved to fit different niches. Cats and dogs are both in the Carnivora order, but their last common ancestor lived about 42 million years ago.

A great commander like Hannibal would take the city if he had seen any realistic chance and end the war. Some historians suggest that he did not take Rome after the battle of Cannae because he did not want to look like a barbarian etc. It does not make sense at all. A classical reason I see frequently in historical sources does not make any sense for me: ‘’ Hannibal believed his battlefield victories would force Rome to the negotiating table. This Hellenistic approach restrained Hannibal from attacking Rome itself when presented two opportunities—first after his 217 BC victory at Lake Trasimene and again after Cannae just over a year later.

( Hannibal lost almost half of his army and most elephants on the Alps) Like Bruce Lee saying boards or rocks do not hit back. Hannibal did not have any siege engines strong enough to take Rome. Furthermore, his army did not have the luxury to stay static. It means that if Hannibal had encamped in front of Rome too long, he and his army would be sitting ducks. In a way, Hannibal would repeat the Turkish mistake of 1683 in front of Vienna. Rome had great reserves and manpower potential to raise army after army. Hannibal only had a single chance, Romans had many… War of attrition would work against Hannibal. A realistic approach: ‘’ His strategic aim was not the destruction of Rome itself, but the break-up of the confederation it had established throughout Italy by conquest.

Once he asked for additional troops, it was obvious the plan was not working anymore and the cost of war would be much higher than expected. In today’s terms, he was exceeding the budget and risking an economical crisis back at home which would shorten the war because of economic reasons from the Senate’s point of view. It was not about ‘’jealousy’’ or ‘’the luxury spending’’ of the Carthage Senate. Once they ship fresh soldiers they would risk the security of Spain and Carthage at the same time. Eventually, at Zama, the war was taken to Carthage itself. Senate of Carthage had valid reasons not to send additional armies to Hannibal.

Most importantly, despite his historical predispositions, and his name, the Molecule Man is not a matter-manipulator, he is a reality-manipulator. Let’s redefine the parameters of your question. Matter manipulation and reality manipulation are two entirely different things. A matter manipulator in the Marvel Universe has the ability to alter the physical nature of the universe such that they can change aspects of matter through force of will, using psychic or magical manipulation, or in some more advanced cases, through the manipulation of undisclosed electromagnetic fields using unknown or primal energies.Altering matter at the molecular level is a formidable ability and the Marvel Universe has plenty of them. However, most superheroes and supervillains are only working at the most fundamental level of this ability.Beings such as Iceman and Magneto are matter and energy manipulators, respectively. However, they are still limited by their ability to understand how their power interacts with matter.A true reality-manipulator has no such limitations. They are not bound by an aspect like fire or heat or molecules or magnetism. A true reality manipulator can “turn sunshine into puppies” and back again. They are changing the very nature of reality making it whatever they want reality to be.As a result, the Molecule Man is a reality manipulator, who is an order of magnitude more power than most matter manipulators and capable of competing against even some of the most powerful energy manipulators in the Marvel Universe. Why does the Molecule Man appear so much more powerful than most reality-manipulators? Because this is comics and the character has an incredibly long history, it is possible for his powers to fluctuate wildly and as such he has an uneven power rating defeating some godlike beings (the Beyonder) and yet unable to defeat very mortal ones (The Sentry).Because he was designed to be a weapon, a weapon capable of destroying/deconstructing a Universe; he was created by a species of beings whose ability to alter reality was at the highest order of capacity. Called the Beyonders, their capacity for reality manipulation is met only by Marvel’s One-Above-All, its supreme being as far as we have been led to believe.The Molecule Man is not a person. He is an embodied force created by beings whose objective was to destroy the Omniverse, a living sentient bomb planted across the totality of the Multiverse.For him to destroy all of reality as we understand it, he had to be able to affect the fundamental aspects of the superstructure of reality. He is a repository of power, not necessarily the best shaper of reality, but certainly the most powerful. He is a brute force shaper of reality. There are better ones, more elegant ones, more masterful ones but no one is more powerful than he is; he was designed that way. The Molecule Man is, when he is completely sane, and even when he is not, capable of restructuring anything he can conceive of because to him, nothing is more real than anything else. This is an intuitive ability limited only by his personal viewpoint of himself and the Universe at large.While he is no longer a weapon poised to destroy the Marvel Universe, he is still a threat to anyone whose capacities are less than his own.His abilities exceed even beings who have learned to manipulate reality including those who use:super-advanced scientific technological capacity (the Celestials);by their innate being manipulating the Power Cosmic or other such primal energy sources (Galactus, The Phoenix, other abstract beings);through the dint of their experience via magic, technology or psychic abilities: the Elders of the Universe and their manipulation of their Primal Powers;those who acquire their powers by proxy such as the Power-Cosmically enhanced Silver Surfer, Sky-Fathers and Mothers of planetary pantheons who can channel the energies of their relationship with planetary biospheres to alter reality, and reality altering species such as the Cosmic Cubes;and he may only be equaled by objects such as the Infinity Gauntlet or the Heart of the Universe. The Molecule Man is a unique being. He was a sentient weapon created by beings who were just shy of being supreme beings themselves. His powers at their peak channeled energies from other realities making his powers simply greater than anything that could be imagined by most beings in the mainstream Marvel Universe.In his amplified state, he was almost completely insane and unstable and only when his energies were returned to their native universes did he become more stable. (Secret Wars #9, 2016) A Final Note: The Molecule Man’s ability to alter reality exceeds almost anything known by our Universe today with the rare exception of entities such as the Living Tribunal, the Dreaming Celestial or the One-Above-All, who possess a fundamental mastery of the fabric of this Universe since it is an aspect of this primal being’s existence. When Adam Warlock accidentally erased the Universe, Thanos was forced to dare to risk the ire of the One-Above-All to bring back the Marvel Universe on a gamble we amused the One-Above-All enough for it to return the erased Universe this one time… Despite the One-Above-All’s apparent disinterest, it has the capacity to do or undo all of the events performed by the Molecule Man, the Beyonders or any other such force. It simply does not often choose to. Perhaps it likes the variety such interactions bring to an omniverse always in need of change.

The saying that the customer is always right applies. When a customer has a complaint, do your best to resolve the issue or at least compromise. Create a funnel so that you can collect the needed information about your customer on their first visit. The most basic information you will get from their first order is their email address, home address, and phone number, and birth date which are all great ways to get in touch with your customers to offer them coupons and special offers. Loyalty programs are a must because a 5-percent increase in customer loyalty can result in more than a 25-percent increase in revenue. That’s a big jump! When you create a loyalty program, strategize so that the rewards are relevant and exciting for customers. The loyalty program also needs to be easy to understand and easy to sign up. Pitch it to your customers clearly with to-the-point copy or video. Make it easy for them to say yes! Ask your most loyal customers personally to refer your jewelry business to their friends. Ask them to share on social media or to forward your email to their friends.

William will almost certainly one day become King, and his wife Kate Middleton, the Queen consort. There is nobody called Kate Middleton who will ever become Queen Consort. Do you honestly believe that we are going to have King William and Queen Kate Middleton? Go and give your head a wobble. We will have a King William and Queen Catherine, because they are second in line for the throne, as the law stands right now, no need to “eliminate” anyone, neither. Despite him being handed the keys to the monarchy, Charles' upbringing is said to have been less than favourable to his later development. Oh right, “handed the keys to the monarchy”, what effing keys would those be, then? I wasn’t even aware that the monarchy needed keys to get it started in the mornings. And besides, isn’t Charles supposed to eliminate somebody before getting these mystery “keys”? Now let’s have a swipe at the Queen, and chuck in a picture of Ghislane Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein for good measure - It said: \\"Charles was never really close to his parents while growing up,\\" going on to say that it wasn't until after the Queen had given birth to Andrew and Edward that she \\"dedicated more time to caring for her family\\". WTAF is this actually supposed to be? What is the point of this “article”? Was the hack blind drunk when he spewed out this risible nonsense? It really does look as though they have had to find something to fill up a space, or maybe the just let the work experience schoolkid have a go. In fact if some of my work experience kids turned in an abortion like that as an assessment task I would have failed it on the spot. I can’t believe that a grown adult actually came up with this and that other supposedly grown adults are actually swallowing it."},{"instruction":"w often do popular Quora users go anonymous?","output":"I do not know if I am popular or not but I have never been anonymous because I simply do not feel the need to be. It is not about the greed for upvotes or even attention. I think many unpopular opinions, answers, questions, comments and personal happenings are expressed on Quora anonymously to not get backlash or face resistance. The popular opinions anyway will get upvotes and appreciated by all. For me it is about saying it clearly that this is what I feel as an individual. You can see my face and read my name. I think it is cowardly to hide behind anonymity and then express yourself or your opinion. I wonder if behind a keyboard someone shivers to type something with his or her name then just imagine how spineless will she or he be when it comes to do something strong in real life. By the way I am not really very likeable here on Quora because of the opinions that I express but I have never gone anonymous on anything."},{"instruction":"What did you think of Donald Trump before he became President?","output":"Trump had the job of President but in my opinion I don’t think he ever actually became President.

The universe is estimated to be around 13.8 billion years old, and it is constantly expanding. 2. The human brain is the most energy-consuming organ in the body, using about 20% of the body's total energy. 3. The Great Wall of China, stretching over 13,000 miles, is one of the few man-made structures visible from space. 4. Dolphins are incredibly intelligent creatures and have been known to display self-awareness, use tools, and even call each other by specific names. 5. Time passes more slowly in strong gravitational fields. For example, astronauts who spend time in space age slightly slower than people on Earth. 6. The world's oceans contain more undiscovered species than those that have been identified. It's estimated that over 80% of our ocean remains unexplored. 7. The Statue of Liberty in New York was a gift from France and was designed by Gustave Eiffel, who also designed the Eiffel Tower in Paris. 8. The tallest mountain in the world, Mount Everest, continues to grow at a rate of approximately 0.16 inches (4 millimeters) per year due to geological forces. 9. Honey never spoils. It can remain edible for thousands of years due to its low water content and acidic pH. 10. The Japanese island of Okunoshima is often referred to as \\"Rabbit Island\\" because it is inhabited by hundreds of friendly, wild rabbits."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between SSC MTS and SSC CHSL?","output":"SSC CHSL stands for Combined Higher Secondary Level Exam which is conducted by the SSC for 12th Pass students.

Her Kylie Cosmetics company is valued at 900 million according to Forbes and she owns 100% of the company. It’s hard to value this company. On the one hand, it did make a net profit and she has reaped much of her current liquid assets in dividends from the company. On the other hand, without Jenner as the face of the company, like for instance if she sold all interests in it or she passed away, the value might well be 0. Forbes does a good job writing about finances but they are still a news organization looking for clicks and sales. Remember a little company called Theranos and their estimate of its value and that CEO? Yep. The best way for Jenner to soon see that 900m and to get a proper value of the business, would be to declare an IPO where she is still the brand and face of the business. And I just don’t know what wall street’s value might be on a “shopify” business even if it has reportedly made hundreds of millions in profit. It could very well go gangbusters on the hype more than the business nature, like a Tesla company. But as her purchasing market isn’t really sthe investor crowd, I imagine the value will settle lower. In any regards, she’s done very well and should be proud whether she embraces the 1B moniker or not. *Update* November 18, 2019- With an actual cash purchase of her company, I would now put her safely at a billionare. She sold 51% of her company for 600,000,000 to Coty Inc, a cosmetics conglomerate. So her company has increased in it’s value from 900M to just under 1.2B. Because she gave up controlling interest, she was able to get a premium for the 51% of the company. A very smart and appropriate move. With that cash sale, she will now have to pay 1/3 of that in taxes. 20% U.S. Federal Tax and 13.3% California state tax. Her 600M cash from the sale will become 400M after April 2020. Combine that with her previous 100M in cash, property and other personal assets and you’d come out with half a billion dollars. Net worth sites like Forbes will then include her 49% as another 600M value and list her net worth at 1.1B. Actually, many sites will probably list her net worth at 1.2B or 1.3B not taking into account the severe hit that taxes will play. There is nothing wrong with giving her a 1.1B net worth. If she were to sell the remaining 49% now minority holding in her company, I personally don’t think it’d be another 600M if Coty or anyone else were paying that. Even if she did, and it came out as another cash payment, she’d pay the same taxes and end up just shy of 1B. For her, I think, this was a very smart sale right now to lower her risk in one business, get a premium price for her shares, and possibly see Coty Inc’s supervision guide her 49% company interest even higher in the upcoming years. TLDR- with a solid sale of 51% of Kylie Cosmetics and therefore meaningful company valuation, I’d conclude it is appropriate to call her a Billionare now. Maybe off 100m either way but that isn’t a major concern."},{"instruction":"w do I get someone's name by their mobile number?","output":"If the Republican Party, based on what it currently is like, continually controlled Congress, the White House and the Supreme Court for 20 years, assuming they continue on the same path they are on where they continually double-down, let me tell you the story of 2039… The US is a pariah nation, broke, in debt, thuggish and armed with nukes. It looks like a dictatorship in all but name, with President-for-Life Trump having died a few years back in 2034 and handing the reins over to his daughter Ivanka in his will. She was sworn in and held a special gala at the Met right after. The couture was stunning, and I will admit she is still very physically attractive. They starved the State Department of funds and sent off most diplomats into retirement. Foggy Bottom has been waiting for years to see when the Trumps will finally lock the doors. My cousin the diplomat has managed to hang on, but partly that’s because he’s off in India and the Trumps forgot he was there. Social Security was turned into an enormous fund to prop up the stock market in mid-2024, not coincidentally propping up management portfolios for well-connected Republican hedge-fund owners. When I last spoke with my late mother’s portfolio manager, he was yet again telling me how he was only a few million away from the cutoff when they started the shift. Now he can’t keep up. The DJIA is up above 62,000 and humming, despite some other difficult economic factors. Seniors saw their Social Security checks drop by at least a third, but for the leadership it’s OK since some billionaires are getting richer. Medicare was turned into block grants for the states starting in 2022, with Republican states somehow getting more money per person than Democratic states. Obamacare, aka the Affordable Care Act, was repealed that year. Healthcare is now around 25% of our nation’s GDP but we are back down to about 80% of people covered effectively because Medicaid was gutted too. Closing government-funded USDA inspections has probably contributed, as has our vaccination rate having gone down to 88%. And then there’s energy. Between the increase in high-carbon fuel use like coal and oil, and Trump moving to actively block wind and solar power despite them costing about 3 cents less per kilowatt hour, we have lots more asthma and other diseases. This helps fuel our out-of-control healthcare costs. The temperatures have gone up about 3ºF over the past 20 years, or about 1.5ºC. Last year, about 3% of California was blanketed by fire in May through July. Pity about Napa Valley. They’re hoping to rebuild getting good vines from Sweden—France has been heating up too much for its older vintages to stay there. The floodwall that Trump promised Miami was only half-built and somewhere around three times over budget before they stopped, and much of the city I knew from visiting my grandmother during the 1970s through the 1990s is now a few inches underwater, including the entrance to her condo building. Disney World is humming, though—they have new underwater exhibits where you really walk under the sea. Oh, for-profit prisons have been making major bank. They’ve managed to get over 5% of the population behind bars and in camps, where they’ve been stuck doing slave labor due to the 13th Amendment loophole. CCA got the federal contract in 2027 and pushed for federal enforcement of marijuana laws that had been on the books only technically at that point. They scaled back on food, medicine and shelter for prisoners, and after you leave you now have to pay the company for your mostly-nonexistent food, medicine and shelter despite them getting money from the government for your care. I swear they’re charging more than the rent on a two bedroom New York City apartment, per person. We lost our tourists. Oh, we still get some, but mostly foreign right-wingers who want to be able to open-carry a gun for a week before going home and showing the pictures to their friends. Most of them never want to overstay their visas. The ones that do are either very well-connected or get shot and killed for breaking the now-violent-felony law of being illegal. Unless they make it to prison, that is. Our public schools are paying teachers slightly better, but the science classes are showing episodes of The Flintstones—as documentaries. Facts are whatever you can argue and shout in far too many school districts. Many businesses make money depending on how good their patronage is with government. Dedicated public servants still exist, of course, but they’re much harder to find in real life than they are on-screen. My niece has an excellent project in the works at Disney about an intrepid social worker helping some adorable orphans who were adopted from outside the country, who risk deportation because their parents were killed in a freak tornado while visiting the last remaining Florida Key. You should go support her Kickstarter. We no longer have the global reserve currency since Trump trashed the Bretton Woods agreement. Now it’s a battle between the dragon and the phoenix, China and Japan. Our currency is really weak and interest rates are closer to 1979 levels than 2019 levels. I’d love to tell you about this year’s anime, but President Ivanka Trump barred it a few months ago. I hope the trade talks finish quickly. At least with a weak dollar we can export all we want. Only, since we’ve scaled back so much on science and facts and such, our US made goods have gotten shoddier. MADE IN THE USA has become a joke for most goods, with some exceptions for products from the West Coast and the Northeast. Some Republican states have openly talked about putting a The Purge scenario in place, but so far Washington hasn’t allowed it. Support for it seems to be growing in Congress, though. I’ve been writing to my senior senator, Ayanna Pressley, trying to get a firm commitment against. So far I haven’t gotten anything more than form letters from her office, though she is on record as being opposed. Excuse me, but there’s a knock at the door. It’s two MAGA officers and a MAGA doctor. I should try to run, but my arthritis makes it too difficult. Hopefully I can finish with them in a few moments. I’ll just post this here in the meantime and edit it later."},{"instruction":"What are some facts that sound like 'BS', but are actually true?","output":"Here are some mind-blowing facts that may sound unreal but are actually true: There are more possible iterations of a game of chess than there are atoms in the observable universe.A teaspoonful of a neutron star would weigh about 6 billion tons.The longest word in the English language has 189,819 letters and takes more than 3.5 hours to pronounce.A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus.The world's largest living organism is a fungus in Oregon that covers over 2,200 acres.A group of flamingos is called a flamboyance.The oldest living creature on Earth is a species of tortoise named Jonathan, who is over 190 years old.Humans share 50% of their DNA with bananas.The shortest war in history was between Britain and Zanzibar in 1896 and lasted only 38 minutes.The Great Wall of China is not visible from space without aid, contrary to popular belief.

The ‘rare’ isotope He-3 doesn’t become superfluid until it is a thousand times colder, a few milli-kelvin. Superfluids do flow with zero viscosity through extremely fine, packed powders, but NOT through glass containers. It ‘escapes’ the glass (as you note) by ‘climbing’ the sides and syphoning down the outer surface. The inner surface becomes wetted by the van Der Waals forces between the liquid and the glass. ‘Every’ liquid can wet the inner surface of a gas container - but only a superfluid can flow without viscosity in this film and syphon itself out of the container. Kitchen Experiment - Fill a glass with water and drape a cotton cloth from inside the glass down into the sink. With enough time the glass will become empty. Set the glass on the edge of the sink and you can watch the water drip from the cloth. Water is using ‘capillary attraction’ to wet the cloth and form the syphon.

I was very disappointed and feel sad to see her failure in flim industry. Her fan will still argue about her good acting. That's expected. Only her PR team keeps are floating in bollywood. There was a lot negative news are published. Like her physical relationship with Subhas Gai etc. I always wonder, why our successful models endup in another career like film industry, where their talents has no values. All our 1990s and early 2000s successful models like Aishwarya Rai, Susmita Sen, Lara Dutta etc could lead to a new super model industry. Where they can create a new market and dominate. But they choose another career where they are being dominated by others. None of them pursued any career in international market. I feel those our successful models had greater opportunities to gain fame in international markets. But lost their fame in another industry. Only their PR trying to project them as successful.

He knows this would not turn out well for Russia in general or him in particular. Rather, this thought and threat is encouraged by the one party who would benefit immensely if Russia lobbed a nuke: China. In this scenario, if Vlad were to order a single “tactical” nuclear weapon, the response would be devastating. To Russia. Every one of their subs and combatant surface ships would be sunk, within minutes to hours. All Russian Command and Control assets would be obliterated. All potential locations of Russian nuclear weapons would be destroyed almost instantly. Then would come the ground troops of NATO, who would render Moscow into a blot. During all of this, China would be the most vocal advocate of all these actions, while participating in none of them. They will be quite content to allow the West to rid the world of everything Russia might have which could threaten China. Then, when the dust settles, it will be China who will advance and absorb Siberia. Moscow (what is left of it) will become the latter-day Berlin, split down the middle. Poland would claim St Petersburg, Ukraine would absorb one oblast east and north of the 2014 borders. China is encouraging this. They are engineering the West to do the heavy lifting for them."},{"instruction":"the US, is it better to send your kid to a public or private school? Are private schools better than public schools?","output":"[Original question: Are private schools really that much better than public schools?] Personally, I actually think private schools are worse. But I advise you to double check the schools in your area to see if that's true for you as well. I live in western Michigan. I know certain friends and relatives of mine that went to the local Christian schools, which are the more popular private schools in the area. I keep seeing posts on social media from them spreading certain political lies that have no basis in fact. I'm not saying the statements can't come from public school graduates (they certainly can), but the percentage of lies I see overwhelmingly comes from the Christian school graduates. It doesn't help that the Secretary of Education for four years was someone less qualified than either of my parents, only one of whom has a college degree. Even some Republicans admitted Betsy DeVos had no business being in that position and voted against her confirmation. Her high school education? The same Christian school some of my coworkers went to. I will admit, I graduated from a good public school, and there are some that are not decent at all. But if I had kids, I would rather they learned to trust facts and experience over religion and traditions. Unfortunately, my local Christian schools appear to fail here. Again, this is from my observations in western Michigan. Your results may be different, and I even hope that public and private schools are equally great somewhere. But I have no faith in the private schools near me. If I have kids some day, they will almost certainly go to a public school."},{"instruction":"meone ever thought about creating a cyber security company that brings security tools for free (just like the opposite thing of Metasploit)?","output":"There are many excellent security tools that are available for free, and even more that are expensive, but free for non-commercial use.

So, if you are stuck to decide from where to get started with CP, here I’ll be suggesting the best resource available. First, let's see what you need to know before starting CP. It is a very vast field and you would need to give a huge amount of time and practice a lot to become good at CP. Following are the steps you must follow to get started with it: Learn a programming language: First of all, learn the basics of any one programming language like C++, Java, Python, if you have not yet. You can learn any language of your choice and interest in which you want to code. Though the most popular language for CP is C++, you can choose anyone you want. Learn the basic syntax and libraries of the language and start practicing very basic programs in the language.Study Data Structures and Algorithms: Data structures and algorithms are one of the most important subjects for one who is interested in computer science. You need to have a good knowledge of DSA to excel in CP or even in coding interviews. So first start with basic data structures like arrays, strings, stacks, queues, etc. Practice a good amount of problems on these until you find yourself to be comfortable with them. Then move towards more advanced data structures like graphs, trees, tries, segment trees, and algorithms like shortest path in graphs and string algorithms.Practice, and just Practice: Being good in CP, is not a result of 2–3 months. It takes a lot of time and patience to become good at solving coding questions. For this, you need to practice a lot of coding questions from platforms like CodeForces, Codechef, GeeksforGeeks, etc. Give regular contests on these platforms, as they give you a chance to track your progress. If you want to be really good at CP, and learn in an efficient way, check out this [LINKED_TEXT: Competitive Programming course] [URL: https://www.codingninjas.com/courses/online-competitive-programming-course] by [LINKED_TEXT: Coding Ninjas] [URL: https://www.codingninjas.com/].

The third eyelid helps protect the eye from dust and other particles while they are eating or grooming. If your chinchilla's eye turns white briefly and then returns to its normal color, it's likely due to the third eyelid functioning as it should. However, if you notice any persistent changes, discharge, or a loss of vision, it's best to consult a veterinarian to rule out any underlying health issues."},{"instruction":"My blood pressure was 138/83 and my pulse was 52.

In general, a blood pressure reading of 138/83 mm Hg is considered to be in the \\"normal\\" range, but it is on the high end of normal. A pulse rate of 52 is considered to be within a healthy range.

Only a few days old, Charlie the baby hippo was orphaned after his mother could no longer feed him. Luckily for Charlie, rescuers found him and took him to an animal orphanage in Africa, where they nursed him back to health. About a week later Makhosi the Rhino was brought to the orphanage after its mother was killed by poachers. She was very traumatised and wouldn’t settle, so they decided to put her in the pen with Charlie the Hippo. Hippo’s and Rhino’s are usually territorial and don’t normally get along. It didn’t take long for Makhosi to settle once she was in the pen with Charlie. For the first time since she arrived Makhosi was able to sleep. The Hippo and the Rhino became attached to each other which was strange because in the wild they would hate each other. Charlie followed Makhosi everywhere and even started to act like the Rhino. They did everything together, bath, eat, sleep and eventually with a Rhino for a best friend Charlie the Hippo began to believe he was a Rhino. Charlie began to hate going near the water because Makhosi would never follow him in. He would only eat when the other Rhinos ate and this was a problem, because if Charlie could never learn to be a Hippo he could never be released back into the wild. Luckily for Charlie the orphanage brought in another orphaned Hippo, a female called Moomin. It didn’t take long for Moomin to fall head over heels for Charlie and would even get upset if she saw him getting attention from some one else. The more the two Hippo’s spent together the more Charlie began acting like a Hippo. He started going back in the water and even started to eat with Moomin. Even though Charlie was a Hippo again, he didn’t forget about his friend Makhosi. They would still hang out and they still took naps under the tree together. In early 2021, Makhosi was transferred to a game reserve with another Rhino that she got close to, where they started their transition back into the wild. Charlie and Moomin where released back into the wild in February of this year, they had spent 6 years together at the orphanage."},{"instruction":"Why do Glocks and HiPoints look like they are rudimentary, and made for people who just want to say they own a gun?","output":"Rudimentary means that anyone could operate them.

Nevertheless, when I go to a casino, I play craps. There are many. many kinds of bets you can make at a craps table, but only one rather simple betting system gives you the best odds of winning. Using this system, you have about a 49.5% chance of winning. Essentially, this means you can almost break even. If you start with about 1000 in chips, you could get free drinks or meal vouchers. This actually puts you ahead of the casinos. (You’ll actually only bet 20 to 30 each round). Compare this to going out to dinner and a movie, and you’ll come out ahead. I’m not going to give my system here because 1) you have to be very disciplined to use it and 2) I don’t want to encourage anyone to gamble. EDIT: There are groups that have ‘beaten Vegas’. But they have done this, for example, by finding a roulette table that is not exactly balanced.

He began to tailgate a black Ford F250 with black truck bed cap & tinted windows, in the left/passing lane. Suddenly, the black truck’s existing tail lights, white backup lights, along with a bunch of red & blue LED lights, behind the rear tinted window, LIT UP & FLASHED for about 5 seconds. The Saab driver, braked very hard, & moved over to the right lane & slowed to BELOW the speed limit. The black truck just continued down the highway & must’ve been a State Police truck. I have seen them before at crime scenes… water rescue dive scenes, etc. The brief light show was the cops way of telling the Saab driver to “slow down & stop tailgating!” It was rather funny, as when we passed the Saab, the driver definitely fit the profile of a “long haired, hippy-type, pot smoking Dead Head”… complete with long hair, an earring or two & an array of “groovy” things hanging from his rear view mirror.

From this, I deduce that INTJs are best represented by their dominant-tertiary system, Ni-Fi, and ENTJs by theirs: Te-Se. Introverted intuition is about a subjective interpretation of the future, i.e. what WILL happen, as opposed to Ne being about what COULD happen. Introverted feeling is about a subjective, personalized code of standards, i.e. what the self classifies as good or bad. Combine Ni and Fi, and one gets an evaluation of the future tense: “this will be good/bad”, “I want this or that”. Thus the INTJ is about deep ambitions, dreams, goals, etc. ENTJs are slightly different. Extraverted thinking is about usefulness, relevance of information, practical uses of things. Extraverted sensation is about the real world, exactly as it is. Nothing more, nothing less. Thus the ENTJ is about power, money, status, fame, anything immediately useful to them."},{"instruction":"know most IDF soldiers are good, and harming anyone is against the IDF code of ethics, but why are they many videos of (bad apples) IDF soldiers who harm Palestinians and what is being done to stop them?","output":"It’s called “Pallywood”.

Secondly in that time the Persian were the civilized people compared to all their rivals. Many of the benefits we see in modern Scandinavian societies, were already implemented in Persia under Cyrus The great and his successors. According to the Greeks everyone were barbarian, of course with the exception of the Greek :) However if we look at history Rome and Greece truly behaved barbaric, slavery was common, the Romans had the gladiators. If compare to modern society, the Persian were the only ones 2500 years ago who actually behaved Civilized and the Greek who have written the history on the Persians and are the source for the movie 300 were the Barbarians :) That being said don’t misunderstand me, I love Greece, one of my best friends is Greek and we “fight” and laugh about this all the time :) And yes those three empires you mentioned were Persian and some the greatest empires the world has seen, with many achievements and contributions to the world. An example is the introduction of human rights by Cyrus the great.

They may choose to be silent bristlers, rather than mount a protest. The more important and highly paid they are, the more likely they are to do this. The longer they have been in their jobs, the more likely they are to decide not to rock the boat, even though they are disgusted with a company’s or organization’s values. The closer they are to retirement, the more likely they are to adopt an MOA of silent bristling, sometimes combined with some ineffective but psychologically therapeutic subversiveness. It is often too much effort to invest time and energy to start over at a new job in a new company, and to lose out on the comfort of doing a job you are used to and can do with ease. Also, to lose out on benefits like extended vacation, vesting, and other such benefits that accrue to employees with longer tenure. This is why they grin and bear it. During the pandemic, many employees might have secretly bristled about the shutdowns and mandatory vaccinations and masks that were imposed on them by their companies or organizations. But for the reasons stated above, they chose to go along with it. In the same way, many employees may not like, or agree with, the “woke” policies of their company. But they have decided to stay silent and keep working their jobs. Some have resorted to quiet quitting as a way to deal with the conflict… Note: employees of not just companies, but academia, churches, and more will be conflicted about working for who they work for, for this or that reason, at different stages of their life.

As a rule, any mention of religion on an online forum degenerates into a religious argument. Why? Why does this happen with religion and not with Javascript or baking or other topics people talk about on forums? What's different about religion is that people don't feel they need to have any particular expertise to have opinions about it. All they need is strongly held beliefs, and anyone can have those. No thread about Javascript will grow as fast as one about religion, because people feel they have to be over some threshold of expertise to post comments about that. But on religion everyone's an expert. Then it struck me: this is the problem with politics too. Politics, like religion, is a topic where there's no threshold of expertise for expressing an opinion. All you need is strong convictions. Do religion and politics have something in common that explains this similarity? One possible explanation is that they deal with questions that have no definite answers, so there's no back pressure on people's opinions. Since no one can be proven wrong, every opinion is equally valid, and sensing this, everyone lets fly with theirs. But this isn't true. There are certainly some political questions that have definite answers, like how much a new government policy will cost. But the more precise political questions suffer the same fate as the vaguer ones. I think what religion and politics have in common is that they become part of people's identity, and people can never have a fruitful argument about something that's part of their identity. By definition they're partisan. Which topics engage people's identity depends on the people, not the topic. For example, a discussion about a battle that included citizens of one or more of the countries involved would probably degenerate into a political argument. But a discussion today about a battle that took place in the Bronze Age probably wouldn't. No one would know what side to be on. So it's not politics that's the source of the trouble, but identity. When people say a discussion has degenerated into a religious war, what they really mean is that it has started to be driven mostly by people's identities. [ 1 ] Because the point at which this happens depends on the people rather than the topic, it's a mistake to conclude that because a question tends to provoke religious wars, it must have no answer. For example, the question of the relative merits of programming languages often degenerates into a religious war, because so many programmers identify as X programmers or Y programmers. This sometimes leads people to conclude the question must be unanswerable—that all languages are equally good. Obviously that's false: anything else people make can be well or badly designed; why should this be uniquely impossible for programming languages?

If so, what did you do and did you stay in the child’s life?","output":"Your story is confusing. First you say that you received joint custody of your daughter, and then you say that paternity was challenged and the police came with a court order to take your daughter away. Had you actually submitted to a paternity test at the time? You later state that the paternity test showed that you are the biological father, so you must have taken a test. If so, why was this child taken from you in the first place, and why do you think you have no right to inquire about her? If you are the biological father, you definitely do have rights unless the mother goes to court and proves that you are unfit as a father, but it doesn't sound like that happened. It does sound like she, perhaps, is an unfit mother, based on how you say she treated the child. However, I question why you have made no attempt to contact this child or have any interaction with her for 3 years. You say you will never stop hurting; if that is true, then do something about it. If she didn't go to court to have you declared unfit, there is nothing your ex-wife can do to prevent you from seeing your daughter and being a part of her life.

In the 23 years since its rebrand, England's top division has delivered more storylines than EastEnders. Many of them have been inspiring. Others have been downright disgraceful. Here, we count down the most shocking moments. In brief, these are the times that have made you stand up and ask: 'Did that really just happen?' Our only other criteria was that they must have taken place INSIDE a stadium. After that, it's down to our opinion. We want to hear yours, too. Get involved by using our comments section below. 1. Rooney swears into the front room of fans worldwide:- April 2, 2011 Never one to dodge controversy, Wayne Rooney drew widespread condemnation when he swore straight into the lens of a camera at Upton Park after scoring against West Ham. Having led United from 2-0 down to 2-2 with a brace, Rooney tucked away a penalty to give his side the lead before running to the Sky cameras and shouting: 'f***ing what? What?' No player had been banned in English football for foul language before but that didn't stop the FA throwing the book at the future England captain, banning him for two games. Unfortunately for Rooney, that included an FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City. He missed the game, United lost and the famous old trophy remains the only one to evade Rooney in his trophy-laden Old Trafford career. Wayne Rooney celebrates scoring against West Ham and shouts down the camera in April 2011 The United and England striker ran to the Sky cameras and swore into the front room of fans worldwide Rooney pictured swearing down the camera after scoring for United as they took the lead against West Ham 2. Cisse and Evans get caught up in spitting row:- March 4, 2015 Fresh in the memory this one, Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse get themselves caught up in what many professionals regard as the 'worst thing that can happen to you on a football pitch', although reading through this list of shocking incidents certainly has its moments where you would rather have been spat at. Having been brought down in a challenge by Evans, Cisse looked to have carelessly swung a boot in the direction of the Manchester United centre back while grounded on his back. Evans turned, looked down at the Newcastle striker and appeared to launch spit at him. Obviously infuriated, Cisse leapt to his feet and performed the same cowardly act from point-blank range into Evans' neck. Two wrongs don't make a right, unsurprisingly and both were hit with big bans: Evans for six games and Cisse for seven after a previous red card offence that season. To make the situation even more ridiculous Evans outright denied that he had spat, while Cisse admitted his offence but said it was in retaliation. Jonny Evans and Papiss Cisse did what many professionals describe as the 'worst thing to do on a pitch' The Newcastle and United players were judged to have spat at each other during their Premier League match 3. Ketsbaia kicks off after 90th-minute winner:- January 17, 1998 Scoring a 90th-minute winner tends to be a cause for celebration – but it didn't look like it for Temuri Ketsbaia when he decided Newcastle United's Premier League clash with Bolton Wanderers in 1998. The Georgian midfielder tore his shirt off, threw it to the ground and starting kicking the advertising hoardings at St James' Park until calmed down by team-mates in an utterly bizarre incident surrounded by scenes of jubilation. Ketsbaia later explained that the anger he let out was down to being left out of the starting line-up by then-manager Kenny Dalglish. 'I scored a goal, I was happy to score a goal but I was not happy to not be playing and I was frustrated,' Ketsbaia said. 'It's not a normal celebration, but I play with passion and all I wanted to do was play. It was not malicious.' Newcastle's Temuri Ketsbaia celebrated scoring a 90th minute winner by kicking the advertising hoardings Alan Shearer retrieves Ketsbaia's shirt after he tore it off and threw it to the ground in a bizarre celebration 4. Gomis collapses:- March 4, 2015 Given Fabrice Muamba's near-fatal cardiac arrest in March 2012 in almost the same spot, Bafetimbi Gomis' collapse had fans fearful of a casualty on the field during a Premier League game. The powerful French striker fell to the floor just six minutes into Swansea's 3-2 defeat by Tottenham and had to be treated for more than five minutes before leaving on the field wearing an oxygen mask on a stretcher. Other players and fans around the silent ground covered their faces, unable to watch as Gomis lay motionless on the turf. Fortunately, the forward who suffers from vasovagal — a medical condition that can lead to fainting — was alright and even gained consciousness as he left the field. His request to play on was understandably rejected but he was back in action the following week against Liverpool. The Premier League breathed a collective sigh of relief that things were not more serious. Bafetimbi Gomis is put on a stretcher after collapsing during Tottenham Hotspur's Premier League match Tottenham and Swansea players and fans around a silent White Hart Lane covered their faces in shock 5. Bloodied Rio hit by coin at The Etihad:- December 9, 2012 A 90th-minute winner in a local derby, against the team that robbed you of the Premier League title just over six months earlier, how could you not celebrate wildly? As Robin van Persie's free-kick found the bottom left-hand corner of Joe Hart's net to make it 3-2 to the away side, the Manchester United players ran straight to their travelling support at the Etihad Stadium to revel in the moment. It was a turning point in United's pursuit of Manchester City's title, and an iconic one at that with every outfield player in red engulfed in the blue fumes of a smoke bomb thrown from the home end – but that was the less concerning of the two missiles that found their target from the stands. Rio Ferdinand, the epitome of everything that United represented in Ferguson's later years, screamed into the stands filled with passion as he grabbed at his shirt. Suddenly though, blood was streaming from his head. What looked on live television like Ferdinand hitting himself in the eye was in fact a two-pence coin that came close to blinding the United defender, cutting him on the brow. At least Ferdinand saw the funny side of things, tweeting after: 'Whoever threw that coin, what a shot! Can't believe it was a copper 2p... could have at least been a £1 coin!' Rio Ferdinand was struck by a coin at the Etihad after Manchester United score the winning goal late on United defender Ferdinand holds his head after being struck by a two-pence coin in December 2012 Blood is visible on Ferdinand's brow after being struck by the coin as United beat Manchester City 3-2 5. Eboue cries on the pitch:- December 6, 2008 No footballer ever wants to be the 'substitute that gets substituted', but in Emmanuel Eboue's case for Arsenal in 2008, it was probably a move that Arsene Wenger made for the player's own good. Brought on after 32 minutes for Samir Nasri, Eboue – already seen as a bit of a joke figure among supporters – put in one of the worst performances the Premier League has ever seen. After misplacing simple passes and repeatedly failing to control the ball, the Ivorian capped a terrible showing by tackling his own team-mate Kolo Toure. Arsenal supporters had expected their team to waltz to a simple victory after Emmanuel Adebayor's early goal and Eboue's ineptitude brought boos from the crowd every time he made a mistake, doing nothing for his confidence. With the Gunners clinging on to a narrow lead, the fourth official's board went up to show Eboue being replaced by Mikael Silvestre to huge ironic cheers followed by loud booing from the home support. Eboue made his way to the bench in floods of tears, being consoled by Adebayor. It was a surprise to some that he had the mental strength to carry on in north London after this episode.

Pardew and Pellegrini exchange pleasantries:- January 12, 2014 Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini might not seem hugely exciting for many spectators, but he was certainly able to get Newcastle boss Alan Pardew feeling passionate on the touchline during the Chilean's first season in charge. City moved top of the Premier League with a 2-0 win at St James' Park but there was controversy with Cheikh Tiote having a goal ruled out for offside after Yoan Gouffran was deemed to have interfered with play. Understandably, Pardew took exception to the decision. Confronting the City boss on the touchline, Pardew ended an angry exchange by shouting: 'Shut your noise! F***ing old c***' which could be clearly lip-read on the television coverage. Within minutes the clip was going viral across the internet and many laughing while others worried about children reading the manager's lips. Pardew was horrified to see his words caught on camera and apologised to Pellegrini privately and publicly to fans watching on TV. He escaped FA censure but was told to improve his touchline behaviour in future. Then-Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew (left) and Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini (right) argue Pardew and Pellegrini clashed a St James' Park during City's 2-0 win over Newcastle in the Premier League Pardew mouthed: 'Shut your noise! F***ing old c***' which could be clearly lip-read on the television coverage 8. Anelka shames football with the 'quenelle':- December 28, 2013 At the time and to the untrained eye, Nicholas Anelka was simply celebrating two goals for West Bromwich Albion with one arm outstretched and with his other hand held just above his elbow. News quickly filtered through that this wasn't so innocent though, and instead Anelka was showing off the 'quenelle', devised by French comedian Dieudonne M'bala M'bala which has been viewed as anti-Semitic, inverted Nazi salute. It is therefore considered a racially aggravated gesture, and carries a minimum five-match ban. The French forward maintained that he had done nothing wrong but the FA disagreed, banning him for five games and fining him £80,000. The fall-out didn't stop there though, with West Brom sponsors Zoopla - a company with a Jewish owner – opting against renewing their sponsorship agreement before the club sacked Anelka for gross misconduct after he posted that he would be quitting the club on Twitter. West Brom striker Nicholas Anelka celebrates scoring against West Ham with the 'quenelle' gesture The 'quenelle' was devised by Dieudonne M'bala M'bala and viewed as an anti-semitic, inverted Nazi salute 9. QPR players try to fight their own fans:- January 10, 2015 Sure, 10 away defeats on the bounce isn't something anyone wants to see but it doesn't give players and fans the right to start kicking off with each other to the extent that it did with Queens Park Rangers' travelling mob earlier this season. Richard Dunne was believed to have clashed with a supporter as he walked off at the end of a 2-1 defeat at Burnley and had to be led away by goalkeeper coach Kevin Hitchcock. Coach Glenn Hoddle and Joey Barton then had to step in as Clint Hill also became involved in a heated exchange with a group of about a dozen fans which continued as the defender headed down the tunnel. Maybe it was a positive thing though, two away games later Rangers finally got an away win. Or maybe not, given that they lost a further two after contributing to a dismal overall away record of three points from a possible 42. QPR captain Joey Barton restrains Clint Hill at full-time who was remonstrating with disgruntled away fans 10. Campbell quits at half-time:- February 1, 2006 Few could forget Sol Campbell's arrival at Arsenal as a Tottenham Hotspur captain and academy product, and there won't be too many Arsenal fans who will forget the moment Campbell quit Highbury in 2006, either. Arsenal were 2-1 down to West Ham with Campbell at fault for both goals. The big centre back was substituted at half-time but it wasn't until later that it was discovered he had left the ground there and then under a cloud of mystery. The real reason for Campbell's quick exit only emerged years later in extracts from the former England defender's biography. 'As Campbell walked off the pitch he heard someone shout abuse and make the gesture of a hand fashioned into the shape of a gun,' it read. 'It was pointed in his direction. As the index finger pulled the trigger, the fan's lips made a little explosion and the mouth stretched itself into a bayonet smile. The fan did not flinch. He continued to stare. And to sneer. 'At half-time Campbell was not his usual self in the Arsenal dressing room. \\"I can't go on\\", Campbell said gently.' Arsenal defender Sol Campbell (right) was substituted at half-time against West Ham on February 1, 2006"},{"instruction":"What do you think of the 3/21/22 CBC report that the NDP has agreed to keep Trudeau's Liberal Party in power until 2025?","output":"That’s fine with me.

Ambedkar hate Hinduism?","output":"Several millions of Hindus worship Buddha and consider him as an avatar of Indian Hindu Sikh Jain Buddhist protector god Vishnu. Ambedkar by making some of his Indian Hindu Kshatriya Mahars convert to buddhism, has divided his own people into Hindu Mahars and Buddhist Mahars. Then, others have become Sikh Mahars, Muslim Mahars, and Christian Mahars. Ambedkar should have seen to it that his Indian Hindu Mahar Kshatriyas stay united and not get split up into Hindu Mahars, Buddhist Mahars, Sikh Mahars, Muslim Mahars, and Christian Mahars. We know that when Hindus were converted into Muslims, the Muslims broke away from their fellow Hindus and became enemies of their own fellow Hindus, and even divided India into Muslim Pakistan, Muslim Bangladesh, Muslim Pak-Bangla-India and have lost fellow feeling with their Hindu religion, and fellow Hindus. Now, after several centuries, Hindu Mahars, Buddhist Mahars, Sikh Mahars, Muslim Mahars, and Christian Mahars will move in different directions, will not marry each other, will hate each other, and will harm, trouble, torment, and torture their fellow Mahars. Instead of one huge, powerful, united, strong, self confident, and mutually uplifting, mutuaaly cooperating, mutually assisting, and playing a major role in the politics, administration, and prosperity of India, the Indian Hindu Kshatriya Mahars will become weak, enfeebled, directionless, unrelated to, and worse enemies of other Mahars and over a period of time, many of them will no longer have their Mahar identity just as Indian Hindus who were converted into Muslims lost their Indian Hindu identity for ever and won;t even know, recognize, or bother about their ancestral Hindu religion. Ambedkar has done greatest disservice to Buddhism and Gautama Buddha by making Buddha different from Vishnu and making it difficult, uncomfortable, and irritating to worship Buddha for severa million Hindus of India. Ambedkar by making just a few lakh Mahars convert to Buddhism has made several hundred millions of Hindus find it difficult, embarassing, and uncomfortable to continue to worship Gautama Buddha and this way, Ambedkar has irresponsibly, unnecessarily, and inhumanly reduced the number of devotees of Gautama Buddha among several millions of Hindus by making it necessary for his Mahar Buddhsts to disown, disrespect, and hate Indian Hindu gods Rama, Krishna, Vishnu, Brahma, and Shiva and unnecessarily, needlessly, and inhumanly reduce the number of Hindu devotees of Gautama Buddha and also create a divide between Hinduism and Buddhist just as Mohammad Ali Jinnah created a divide between Hinduism and Muslim Islam and make the Hindus get divided into two mutually hating Indian Hindus and Indian Muslims who were converts to Muslim Islam from Hinduism. Ambedkar has unnecessarily, cruelly, and inhumanly created divide, suspision, and mutual dislike between Hindus and Buddhist and Hinduism and Buddhism when both were once and the same and belonged to Indian Hindu Sikh Jain Buddhist Hinduism with all respecting, worshipping, and adoring Gautam Buddha Dev, Vishnu Gautama Buddha Dev, Vishnu Dev, Vishnu Ram Dev, Vishnu Hanuman Dev, Vishnu Krishna Dev, Brahma Dev, and Shiva Dev. Now, Ambedkar has created a disunity, friction, and artificial divide among the followers of Indian Hindu Sikh Jain Buddhist Hinduism by making Mahar Buddhists to denounce, criticise, disrespect, hate, and disown Ram, Krishna, Vishnu, Brahma, and Shiva. In the process, Ambedkar has weakened all Indian Hindu Sikh Jain Buddhist Hinduism following men, women, and children and ironically, his own Indian Hindu Kshatriya Mahar people as well. Very unfortunate! Highly irresponsible! Truly Cruel! Very Inhuman too!"},{"instruction":"After the defeat at the Battle of Midway, why didn't the IJN remove Nagumo from command?","output":"Anyone examining Nagumo’s performance at Midway would find very little to fault based on his reactions to intelligence as it came in. The kinds of decisions he was making during the battle were of the perfectly normal sort that pretty much anyone in his position would make. The correct choice is only obvious in hindsight. In truth, he was supposed to take out the Island defenses in one bomber strike, which was an impossible task. Yamamoto should have assigned at least a battleship and a couple of cruisers to assist. It should not have been done strictly from the air. This in turn, forced Nagumo to order a second strike. Up to this point, every attempt to attack his ships had failed miserably. He had no reason to worry. It’s this pivotal moment where everything came apart. His one mistake was not foreseeing that his forces were about to be walloped by experienced pilots flying much better planes. Much of his defeat can be traced to bad luck. His zeroes were chasing down the last of a doomed American squadron and completely out of position when the main attack came. In the span of a few minutes, three aircraft carriers were lost. This was partly because they were in the middle of switching up who was going to fly and had hose, bombs and fuel exposed, but Japanese carriers had bad fire control and it while it made things worse, those ships couldn’t take that kind of damage and survive. Nagumo didn’t decide not to include battleships, nor did he decide how to build the carriers. He was not indecisive either, he just made the wrong decision."},{"instruction":"What mobile app development companies are based in Chicago?","output":"A Mobile Application platform supports mobile application development using various tools for different programming languages and provides an application programming interface to allow interactivity between software packages.

What do you think about this?","output":"Going by track record, that’s certainly true. I don’t know what the stats are on sexual assault or sexual harassment committed by trans women, but I do know that trans people (of both genders) are far more likely to be the victims of assault than perpetrators. And powerful men have a pretty poor track record when it comes to sexual abuse and exploitation. Now, that comparison is not particularly relevant, as few people are proposing allowing powerful male executives into women’s restrooms, while trans women in women’s rooms have, somewhat bizarrely, become a political hot button issue of late. The bigger question I have is this: when have we ever had bathrooms with guards to check birth certificates (or genitalia?) before allowing people in? That’s literally never been a thing. Was there some silent epidemic of assault by trans woman in restrooms happening until these bathroom bills started being proposed? I mean, that seems like the kind of thing that we would have heard about, right? AOC’s point, as I take it, is that the fear of harassment or assault, which is the histrionics that usually accompany this very silly issue, appears to be an entirely hypothetical problem. The real issue is that small-government Republicans really want the federal government in the business of officially declaring that transsexuals aren’t actually the gender they identify as. And since gender has less and less of an official standing, they’re left trying to stake out a claim in the few places that are regulated by gender, and bathrooms are the most visceral among them. The point is, a reasonable policy would be that people who were harassing others, or behaving in a threatening way can be removed from a restroom, it doesn’t matter if it’s a trans woman, a cisgender lesbian, or a heterosexual woman who’s just being aggressive. The idea that such a policy can or should be determined by someone’s chromosomes doesn’t make that much sense: assault can come from anywhere, and is unacceptable in any form."},{"instruction":"Stay (Stray Kids fandom) a toxic fandom?","output":"No They’re respectful, nice, kind and funny… …and clowns 🤡"},{"instruction":"What is the most advanced invention in the world?","output":"It's difficult to determine the most advanced technology that man has ever invented, as it can be subjective and dependent on various factors such as the field it was developed in, its practical applications, and its impact on society.

Once you’ve built a great personal brand and got your skillset down. Choose a side hustle or freelance job that will help you build a solid skillset along with a promising income. I’ve written a comprehensive list of [LINKED_TEXT: side jobs here] [URL: https://looka.com/blog/side-jobs-2020/], but I’ve summarized some of them below for you: Here's some examples: 1. Teach a new skill Are your friends always raving about your incredible skills as a cook, calligrapher, piano player, or [insert your special skill here]? Take your passion to new heights by sharing your knowledge with others. Some examples of skills people want to learn are: Culinary arts (baking, cooking nutritious meals, making cultural cuisine, cake decorating, and mixology)Music (guitar, piano, and singing)Arts and crafts (pottery, painting, and sewing)Wellness (essential oils workshop, guided meditation, and DIY natural beauty) Average rate: 20 – 300 per person. The rate ranges depending on skill type, factoring in possible overhead costs, such as food ingredients or craft materials. For example, a cocktail-making class for a group might be 75 per person, while teaching piano can start at 40 for a 1-hour lesson. Primary skills required: Your expertise in a specific skill area, good communication, comfort working with new people, event planning and basic marketing to gather interest. 2. Photography Visual media is needed for all types of businesses and for various purposes—from company websites to social media. You don’t have to be an expert to start a side hustle as an amateur photographer. So long as you know how to work a DSLR camera, and understand lighting and composition, you could step into a lucrative niche. Some specialties include: WeddingFoodFashionPortrait Average rate: Generally starting at 200 for a 1-hour photo shoot and into the thousands per day. If you’re offering stock-photo options, the rate per photo may start from 10 per pic. Primary skills required: Comfort working with a DSLR camera, practiced understanding of lighting, composition, and basic photo editing skills are fundamental in photography. It’s also essential to consider the type of photography, which may involve other factors. For example, a wedding photographer would need to be skilled at taking photos under varying weather conditions, such as on an overcast day, and working with movement and people. On the other hand, a food photographer would have the know-how to work in indoor lighting, and a basic understanding of props and food composition. 3.

That’s a business opportunity if we’ve ever heard of one. If you’re a Virgo, or enjoy a home that’s spick-and-span, you might find a side-job as a cleaner your newfound calling. Be prepared to do it all, including: Washing and putting away dishesLaundryTaking out the garbageWashing floors Average rate: 25 – 90 per hour.

Remote work has been a growing trend in recent years – it’s projected that remote work will rival fixed office locations by 2025. One of the fastest-growing side jobs is the virtual assistant.

Many adorn their homes with a copy of that painting. Because it’s a beautiful painting. And it portrays what many would consider ‘’the ideal woman’’. Yes, she is Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, sex, beauty, fertility, and prostitution. In the Roman mythology she is known as Venus. But here is the dark side of her legend, and the painting: Cronus, an all destructive and violent god of time, was the leader of his brothers to fight and overthrow his father, Uranus, the god of the cosmos (universe). Cronus envied and hated his father for his power. His mother, Gaia, who also hated her husband, Uranus, crafted a sickle, and told Cronus to castrate Uranus with it. Cronus followed his mother’s vile plan, and after mutilating his father, he threw his father’s genitals into the sea. As the genitals were sinking, a foam arose from the water, and from that foam Aphrodite (Venus) was born, emerging from the depths on a shell. And this painting depicts that moment, it is called “The birth of Venus’’."},{"instruction":"Why do people vape?","output":"I was once in school and I tried it.

Don’t know where that came from. Gun laws? No reason for anyone to have a gun unless for sporting or farming use. Obviously measure in place to ensure proper storage etc. Abortion? Nothing for the state to legislate about, personal health is your own concern and responsibility, but it’s government/NHS responsibility to ensure health services appropriate to need are available. We have a national health service so no differences between nations. Gay marriage? Knock yourselves out. Restoring the death penalty? Causes me to pause. “Better a guilty man go free than an innocent man is killed”. Our judicial system is imperfect, it relies on people who have social bias and personal opinion already inbuilt, to make decisions on other people. Asking for those inbuilt natural processes to be set aside is difficult if not impossible. If a guilty man (he/she/prefer not to say) goes free there is opportunity to offend again. We know this, it happens, we know it happens. If that guilty man gets off with murder, his next victim will certainly seal his fate, but he’s already killed twice. If the innocent man is convicted, the state kills an innocent man leaving the guilty man to continue killing. Do we concern ourselves with the final death count or does killing the innocent man cause a much stronger warning to the murderer/rapist etc. Its a dilemna but I think on balance we have it right in UK."},{"instruction":"English is an almost grammarless language. — Richard Grant White.

Then you will understand his point.Richard Grant White was a controversialist. He regularly challenged the norms of language.His point is that English does not have the same formality of grammar that a language like Latin ( and those languages that are derived from it- the Romance languages ) does.If you match things like correspondences between verb cases, genders, possessives, pronouns; it uses different rules to Romance languages; and some English grammatical constructions seen nonsensical of you measure them against Latin.His point, proposed in Chapter 9 and developed in chapter 10, is intended to criticise those who try to force the English language into the structure of a Latin language, and criticised the forced alignment of English with latin. He was also someone who believed that language should evolve, and not be firced to be fixedHe used this phrase to spark that debate. He actually did believe in Grammar; he was a noted scholar of Shakespeare; and he wrote in exquisite English grammar himself."},{"instruction":"Lisa from Blackpink similar to Thai people in general?","output":"I only know two Thai who kinda look similar to Lisa blackpink.

The first was a girl being wheeled off, all bloody after she had cut her veins with a blade that a different girl had snuck in and gave to her. When she got bac just a few hours later, covered in stitches, she looked so miserable that it was heartbreaking (she was 3 years older than me, 16). The other one was one of my good friends and roommates trying to hang himself on the bed railing with a ripped bedsheet ‘as a joke’, while me and our other three roommates watched. He was taken by the nurses as he flung around and screamed. He was tied to a bed, alone in a room for 48 hours, and we could hear his screams around the whole ward. It was terrible."},{"instruction":"What percentage of commercial airline pilots could have had the same successful landing as the crew of the Boeing 777 United Airlines flight 328?","output":"Any western Airline under ICAO, FAA, EASA …virtually a100%….there is always a possibility of a hiccup. All in the Training. Those are the best trained airline pilots in the world. There are others of course and provided their training matches those organisations mentioned then they too would would also have been successful. This could easily have turned into something very different if the disintegration had a punctured the fuel tanks, hydraulic lines, impacted flight controls, punctured the pressure hull. Now you really are talking professional crews having to ‘Think’…… For example the United 232 DC10 crash with Capt. Al Haynes and his 2 other excellent flight deck pilots. Also a disintegrating engine. Anyhow apparently a good job by the crew. Amazing engine footage."},{"instruction":"Should Christians stop giving their money to Televangelists'?","output":"Yes I think they should.

If you are working off a list you can try 3–5 touches and if you get no response then I would assume the lead is dead. If your company has a marketing automation system(e.g. marketo) you can try moving that lead back into a nurture program and see if you can get the lead to respond to some kind of other outreach. You have to be careful with the “not-now” perspective. It that lead has no intention of buying from you now or in the future then, any follow up activity is going to be a waste of your selling time that could and should spent on more viable leads. Some of the best sales guys I’ve worked with are the best because they knew when to take the hard decision to qualify a lead/opportunity out as well as qualify it in"},{"instruction":"Do autopilot systems in some way diminish the natural skills and reflexes of pilots?","output":"If you don’t use it, you lose it, applies to all aspects of life."},{"instruction":"Was there ever programming being done in machine code?","output":"Yes, in Japan we still using Z80 on calculators to practice assembler language. 😁 Everyone may still remember the C9 instruction that represents return on assembler Z80.

Do you remember what it was like to be 30? To be able to do anything? To know you had “time” to make your dreams come true? To still have a family? To still be capable of feeling wonder instead of cynicism? To be vital? To be able to cum multiple times a day? To dress up to go to a club at 10PM instead of pulling down the blankets at 8 so you can go to bed at 9? To be able to run, to lift, to bend. to do ANYTHING you demanded of your body without feeling like shit the next day? To be attractive again? To have hair again? To be a triathlete again? Who WOULDN’T want that? Now, if you were 30 again, as for all people who are 30, you have to be an INCREDIBLE optimist because when you’re 30, you have 50 more years or so to watch the Republicans destroy the US, plunge it into civil war and authoritarianism, to watch them destroy the environment, to drill in the Grand Canyon, the cut down the last Redwoods, to strip mine coal and pour slag in the lakes and rivers, to dump everything in the ocean. You have to live through accelerating extinction and climate change and climate change denial and Republican idiots who won’t take vaccines spreading disease all over the country and shrugging their shoulders as they die. It will be hard to do, especially in a world of 15 or 18 billion people, more than half of whom are dying of hunger or thirst. The group Spandau Ballet channeled Shakespeare when they said, “These are my salad days”. Those of us who are old are praying the salad doesn’t wilt over the next 20 years; that there are still services and people who will care for us in our rapidly approaching dotage. It’s still a good bet that we will have the last big bite of the over-ripe apple as it begins to get rotten. But if you are 30 today, there’s much less chance that you will be able to live in the house with a white picket fence and a green lawn and get your groceries delivered from Peapod while your kid plays soccer at the park down the street, and as you get older there is an increasingly dwindling chance that you will be able to be cared for in a dignified and loving way where you don’t starve to death in a dim room in your own feces after being molested and robbed by some unde-reducated moron who is supposed to take care of you, or you will die in the cardboard box that is your home under the crumbling freeway overpass while toxic waste falls from the sky with every rainfall and the temperatures are perpetually 100 degrees or more. Because that’s what today’s 30 year olds may face, and it certainly is what their children will face."},{"instruction":"Which countries were Portuguese colonies?","output":"Portugal had quite an impressive colonial empire back in the day, spanning across different continents. They were one of the pioneering European powers when it came to overseas exploration and colonization. One of the most prominent areas colonized by Portugal was South America. They established colonies in Brazil, which eventually became their largest and most prosperous colony. It's worth mentioning that Brazil is the only country in South America that was colonized by the Portuguese. The Portuguese influence can still be seen today in the language, culture, and even in the architectural wonders like the historic center of Salvador de Bahia. Moving on, Portugal also set its sights on Africa. They had a significant presence in countries like Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and São Tomé and Príncipe. These colonies played a crucial role in Portugal's trade network, especially in terms of natural resources such as diamonds, gold, and ivory. Although these countries have gained their independence, you can still see remnants of Portuguese influence in their language, cuisine, and cultural traditions. Overall, Portugal's colonial legacy is quite extensive, with their influence spanning across multiple continents."},{"instruction":"Who usually holds the rights to old classical instrumental composition Beethoven, Mozart, etc.?","output":"They are all in the public domain.

However, there are some key differences between the two materials. Composition: Granite is an igneous rock made up mostly of quartz, feldspar, and mica. Marble is a metamorphic rock that is primarily composed of calcium carbonate.Hardness: Granite is a harder and more durable stone than marble. It is resistant to scratches, heat, and stains, making it a practical and long-lasting option for countertops and flooring. Marble, on the other hand, is softer and more prone to scratches and stains.Color and pattern: Granite comes in a wide range of colors and patterns, including solid colors, veins, speckles, and swirls. Marble, on the other hand, typically has a more consistent color and pattern, with unique veining patterns.Porosity: Granite is a less porous stone than marble, meaning it is less likely to absorb liquids and stains. Marble, on the other hand, is more porous and requires more maintenance to keep it looking its best.Price: Granite is typically more affordable than marble, but it depends on the specific type and quality of the stone.Applications: Both granite and marble are used in a wide range of applications including countertops, flooring, wall cladding, monuments and sculptures, etc. But granite is more popular for outdoor applications due to its durability and resistance to weathering, whereas marble is more suitable for indoor applications due to its elegant look and softness. In conclusion, while both [LINKED_TEXT: granite] [URL: https://indiangranitestone.quora.com/] and marble are beautiful natural stones, they have different properties and are suitable for different types of applications. The choice between the two will depend on your personal preferences, budget and the use of the stone."},{"instruction":"Which Bollywood movie has a very effective, well crafted, and brilliant climax scene?","output":"Sadma (1983) has one of the best acted and emotional climax scene in Indian Cinema. Although bombed at the box office during release, the film achieved cult-status. It is considered among-st the best performances for both the lead pairs, Sridevi and Kamal Hassan, which is a big complement as both of them had very illustrious careers. Spoilers Ahead Brief Background: Reshmi (Sridevi) is a young woman who has regressed to childhood due to a car crash and somehow end up in brothel. Somu(Kamal Hassan), a lonely school teacher, rescues Reshmi (Sridevi) from a brothel and takes her to his home in Ooty. Reshmi reciprocates Somu's care as they spend several months sharing an innocent and amazing relationship which treads the line between love and affection. The relationships is free of any worldly carnal desires. So, Somu and Reshmi enjoy this very tender moment in which Somu acts a monkey and Reshmi as a Madari/Street Performer (Remember Reshmi's mental age is around 7). While watching this relationship unfold, you are going to always get an uneasy feeling of approaching doom. But even all this can't prepare you for the end. This moment is used again a couple of times by Somu to conciliate Reshmi. At the end, Somu takes Reshmi to a local medical practitioner who bring her back to sanity but now she is unable to identify Somu. The climax scene consists of Reshmi leaving for her home while Somu desperately trying to make her remember the last few months and the precious moments they shared together. Despite greats efforts from Somu to trigger the memory of the above mentioned event, Reshmi remains indifferent to him and instead taking him for some mad hungry beggar throws a food packet for him. The final scene is truly memorable for Kamal Hassan's performance and the agony and despair he brings through his expressions. It will definitely leave you teary-eyed."},{"instruction":"What are the best decisions ever made by Apple?","output":"Having a brand logo with a bitten Apple."},{"instruction":"w do I recover Samsung Notes on a Samsung Galaxy?","output":"It seems the best solution is to apply for a Android data recovery tool if you haven't backed your Samsung Galaxy S6/S5/S4/Note before.

It was Cannae. Hannibal had not enough war machines to lay siege to Rome, he needed a larger army in any case, as he had no more than 20,000, of which half were mercs. He went basically unheeded in the request of alliances, just Capua and a few more chose to ally with him.

He is the student of parushuram. He got a boon almost close to chiranjeevi. Yet he behaved down to earth most of the time. He made even krishna to break his vow. What else the proof we need. He defeated parushuram in all kinds of fights. Bheesma is the overall greatest warrior in mahabharatha because he decides when he want to die and when his enemy want to die. There is another person who got the ultimate power for one day, even krishna and pandavas ran away from him. Ashwathama got a boon from Shiva so that he will be unstoppable.

Gef, ‘the talking mongoose’, was supposed to be a ghost that haunted a farm called Doarlish Cashen, in the Isle of Man, in the 1930s. In 1931, a schoolgirl called Voirrey Irving claimed she regularly received visits from a little furry animal that looked like a weasel and caused knocking sounds to emanate from behind the walls. The family called this creature Gef, and, after a few months, it allegedly started to talk and sing songs in several languages, including Manx. According to Voirrey, Gef had told her he was a mongoose, originally from Delhi and in his seventies. It was not until a local woman from Peel contacted the famous ghost hunter, Harry Price, that this ‘thing’ gained wider notoriety. The Daily Mail newspaper loved the story and the ‘talking mongoose of the Isle of Man’ turned into a fad. Harry Price, by all accounts, took it seriously and travelled to the Isle of Man to interrogate Voirrey Irivin, but he did not see the animal for himself. He gave the family a camera with which to take any pictures of Gef, should he choose to show himself. In the event, the image they managed to capture could just as well have been a rag. (Image: The Spooky Isles) Harry Price then went on to write a book on this phenomenon, The Haunting of Cashen’s Gap, along with Richard Lambert who worked for the BBC and was subsequently fired by them. He was awarded indemnities in a Court of Law in 1936. In 1935, Reginald Pocock of the Natural History Museum examined some paw prints in Vaseline, said to have come from Gef, and asserted that they had probably not been made by an animal. A bit of hair, also allegedly from the mongoose, turned out to be actually from the Irving family’s collie. Then came the Second World War, people had other things to worry about, and Gef slowly disappeared from collective memory. The Irving farmhouse has long since vanished. It must be noted that, in the Isle of Man, mongooses did occur in the wild for some years, after a local farmer had released a few in 1912. It is therefore quite possible there were still some Manx mongooses around in 1931. For a fuller account of events, see Jenny Randles (2003), Supernatural Isle of Man.

With the rise of \\"fake news\\" and partisan political rhetoric, it can be tough to know who or what to trust. You might be wondering, What are the most empirically neutral, objective, nonpartisan and unbiased news sources in the US? Don't worry, we're here to help. Below, we've compiled a list of some of the most reliable and trustworthy news sources in the country. Whether you're looking for a source that's politically neutral or one that just presents the facts, you'll find what you're looking for on this list. Overview of Objective News Sources There are a number of objective news sources in the United States. As defined by the Pew Research Center, these are news sources that \\"attempt to provide factual information with minimal bias.\\" Typically, these sources fall into one of two categories: mainstream media or fact-checking organizations. Mainstream media outlets like The New York Times and CNN are often criticized for their liberal bias, while fact-checking organizations like PolitiFact and Snopes are often criticized for their conservative bias. However, there are a few objective news sources that manage to maintain a nonpartisan stance. These include NPR, The Associated Press, and Reuters. What Makes a News Source Reliable? Journalists have a responsibility to their audience to be accurate and unbiased in their reporting. This means that they must seek to give a fair and accurate representation of the events they are reporting on, without any personal bias or political agenda. So how can you tell if a news source is reliable? There are a few key things to look for: First, look for news sources that are empirically neutral, objective and nonpartisan. This means that they report on events without any personal bias or political agenda. Second, make sure that the news source you're relying on is reputable and has a history of accurate reporting. Third, read the article carefully and check for signs of bias. biased language, sources or framing of the story can all be clues that the news source is not reliable. Criteria for Evaluating News Sources When looking for a news source, it's important to first understand the different criteria that can be used to evaluate them. These factors can include: the source's political bias, its objectivity, its level of transparency, and whether it's a nonpartisan or unbiased news outlet. By understanding these things, you can make a more informed decision about which source is best for you. Top Impartial US-based News Sources When searching for impartial news sources, you should look for those that are carefully scrutinized by independent organizations and adhere to non-partisan platforms that promote balanced coverage. The following are some of the most sought-after news sources that provide a balanced perspective and comprehensive coverage regarding US policy: The Wall Street Journal, The Associated Press, Reuters, The New York Times, CNN and Politico. In addition, many radio stations like NPR provide objective and unbiased reporting. Beyond these traditional options, there are a number of online sources that specialize in providing trustworthy information about current events such as ProPublica and [LINKED_TEXT: FactCheck.org] [URL: http://factcheck.org/]. As with any news source, it's always important to consider the credibility of the source before relying on any information they provide. Where to Find Unbiased International News If you’re looking for international news, you can find plenty of sources which strive for neutrality and objectivity. From newspapers like the Financial Times and The Hindu to broadcast channels like BBC, Al Jazeera and DW, unbiased international news coverage is abundant. The unbiased coverage from international news sources can provide valuable perspectives on world events. You can look to these international sources to broaden your global awareness or if you’re looking for a different perspective on issues in your own country. Another great ressource is the Pew Research Center - a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issue, attitudes and trends shaping our world. With US-based reporters providing in-depth analysis of global issues and datasets of public opinion polls from around the world, Pew Research Center is an invaluable resource for readers interested in finding trusted objective news. Strategies for Avoiding Biased Media Coverage When you’re looking for news, you can take some simple steps to find content that is more likely to be empirically neutral, objective and nonpartisan. First, always be aware of the different political leanings of any news source you are reading. Then, if you plan on using a website as your source, check to see if it is reputable by double-checking with fact-checking websites such as Snopes or PolitiFact. These sources will help verify the accuracy of different claims that news outlets make. You can also choose outlets that are non-profit or non-partisan, and have a reputation for being unbiased and balanced in their coverage. Examples include PBS News Hour, NPR and BBC News. And finally, it’s worth double checking the authors of the piece – do they have any political affiliations or ties? If so, it can help inform the content in their work and make it harder to trust their insights as being neutral. By doing research on bias before consuming news media and taking steps to find content from unbiased sources, you are much more likely to encounter truly impartial media coverage - now and in the future!…………..

Not so easy to bring out pleasurable sounds. Once the pianist gets the knack of holding this key up to the very instant the next key plays, then holding it up to the very instant the next key plays, and so forth, without any sort of gap whatsoever, the organ begins to sound like music. Some dirty fingering has to be resorted to, and hitting with one finger, changing to another without releasing, and so forth is commonplace, as is playing with the tip of one finger and playing the next note with the knuckle of the same finger, then sliding it to hold the key with the tip, perhaps sliding it to the next key…..sometimes a finger can play strings of five or six notes in succession, without gaps, by sliding and knuckling. This is doable because an organ key is only to be depressed in order to speak, whereas the piano key has to be struck forcibly. Going back to the piano, is another ordeal…….. But it is fun all the way. Not to mention the playing of some key with the nose. It is done, and plenty, to help fatten chords……."},{"instruction":"it hypocritical for libertarians to be prolife?","output":"Why"},{"instruction":"Are openworld video games getting too big for their own good?","output":"No. If a map feels too big, too overwhelming, that's because of bad game design, not because of the size of the map. It's like saying “is this piece of fabric too big to make clothing?” I don't know, what are you making? for how many people? what's the size of each person you’re making clothing for? It's nonsensical to just say “Oh but it's too big!” You see this a lot with designer-wanna-be gamers. Oh but the big map just doesn't work (because I played this one game and the big map doesn't work for me); microtransaction is just evil (because I don't want the temptation of vanity items); Battle Royale (or <insert popular game mode here>) is just a fad (because I'm not interested in this particular “fad\\"). Nope. game design doesn't work like that. When people say “oh the map is too big\\" it's never about the actual size of the map. NEVER. You aren't physically walking in the game world. The actual size (as in square feet) of the map is irrelevant. When people complain about “big maps\\", what they're actually saying is much more nuanced. “The map is too big and there isn't a lot to do on it\\" or “the map is too big and there's too much stuff I need to do and it's overwhelming\\" or “the map is too big and I spend too much time traveling from point A to point B.\\" or “the map is too big for me to effectively explore and I love to clear the map”… The complaint never just stop at “the map is too big\\", it's always “the map is too big for the gamers to … ”. So the solution for these complains isn't about the size of the map. It's about the design. It's about what kind of experience designers want gamers to experience. Every game design feature, may it be the size of the map, the complicity of the skill tree (or what kind of skill tree, or if there is a skill tree), does it encourage co-op, if the game allows vertical traverse, all those choices are tools designer use to create coherent enjoyable experiences so that a majority of players would enjoy this game, the majority of the time. The goal is that experience, everything else is just means to an end. So back to your question, Are open world game getting too big? I don't know. Which game, what's the experience the designer is trying to make? Does exploration enhance that experience? How is exploration handled in relation to the size of the map? How is exploration fit into the overall game design? Now, allow me to turn this into a lesson: So you want to be a game designer? Start looking at the game as a designer instead of a gamer. When you felt something unpleasant, like “map is too big\\" or “crafting is too complicated\\", take a step forward and ask yourself “map is too big for what?” or “crafting is too complicated for you to effectively do… what?” Think about what designers want to create for the gamers, and think about how you didn't feel it, and think about where exactly it went wrong? And also, think about if your bad experience is mostly because of your personal preference, or a legitimate bad design of the game. Think about the possibilities that other gamers might actually like this feature because they're looking for a different experience in games. Think about all that, and stop asking “is the map too big\\"? No. The map isn't too big. If it felt too big, something went wrong with your design."},{"instruction":"lost my email password.

Images may be full-body or close-up, candid or staged. In both cases, the subject's face and eyes are usually sharp. Tone and emotion can be conveyed with lighting and a backdrop. Photojournalism:Through the use of pictures, photojournalism tells the tale of a noteworthy (perhaps even historic) event or setting. It's crucial to be as neutral and truthful as you can when shooting photojournalism, and candid moments should be captured rather than ideal photographs. Photographic editorials:Editorial photography is done for a magazine or newspaper, generally to illustrate a narrative or article. Editorial photography's subject matter is totally based on the theme of the text it is meant to accompany. In general, you should aim to capture images for editorial photography that can be used in both horizontal and vertical compositions. Wedding photography: It's a tremendous duty to capture the biggest day of a couple's life. However, you can take excellent wedding images if you have the necessary tools, practise, and planning.

Here are some reasons why: 1. Increased [LINKED_TEXT: Brand ] [URL: https://webfrogo.com/]Awareness: Social media is one of the most cost-efficient digital marketing methods used to syndicate content and increase your business's visibility. Implementing a social media strategy will greatly increase your brand recognition since you will be engaging with a broad audience of consumers. 2. More Inbound Traffic: Without marketing your business on social media, your inbound traffic is limited to your usual customers. The people familiar with your brand are likely searching for the same keywords you already rank for. Without utilizing social media as part of your marketing strategy, you'll have much more difficulty reaching anyone outside of your loyal customer circle. 3. [LINKED_TEXT: Improved Search Engine Rankings] [URL: https://webfrogo.com/]: SEO is very important for achieving higher page rankings and obtaining traffic to your business website. While social media doesn't directly increase search engine rankings, businesses that share their content on social media are sending out a brand signal to search engines that speaks to your brand validity, integrity, and constancy. 4. Higher Conversion Rates: With increased visibility, your business gains more opportunities for conversion. Every blog post, image, video, or comment may lead viewers to your company's website and increase traffic. Social media marketing allows your business to give a positive impression through a humanization factor. 5. Better Customer Satisfaction: Social media is a networking and communication platform. Creating a voice for your company through these platforms is important in humanizing your company. Customers appreciate knowing that when they post comments on your pages, they will receive a personalized response rather than an automated message. 6. Improved Brand Loyalty: One of the main goals of almost all businesses is developing a loyal customer base. Considering that customer satisfaction and brand loyalty typically go hand in hand, it is important to regularly engage with consumers and begin developing a bond with them. 7. Cost-Effective: For an advertising strategy, social media marketing is possibly the most cost-effective way. Creating an account and signing up is free for almost all social networking platforms. But if you decide to use paid advertising on social media, always start small to see what you should expect. 8. Gain Marketplace Insights: One of the most valuable advantages of social media is marketplace insight. You can monitor the activity on your profile to see customer’ interests and opinions that you might not know otherwise if you didn’t have a social media presence. 9. Thought Leadership: Posting insightful and well-written content on your social media is a great way to become an expert and leader in your field. 10. [LINKED_TEXT: Increased Brand Authority] [URL: https://webfrogo.com/]: For making your business more powerful, brand loyalty and customer satisfaction both play a major role, but it all comes down to communication. When customers see your company posting on social media, especially replying to their queries and posting original content, it helps them build a positive image in their minds. In conclusion, not only does social media marketing help you direct people to your website, but the more social media shares you receive, the higher your search ranking will be."},{"instruction":"ving at 62, I have no pension.

EVERY buffet near me (American, Seafood, and several Chinese places) ALL charge when you walk in the door…so, as long as you get up to the register before lunch is over, you obviously get charged for the lunch buffet. We time it with ours. The switch is at 4:30…we often get in around 4:15…and obviously stay longer than 15 minutes so we do get to have lunch “and” dinner. Though at my local buffets, the food is the same, it’s ONLY the price that changes for some reason. Breakfasts are MUCH cheaper than even the lunch, and many more options are available between the two, so it’s really only worth it to go for breakfast and stay for the lunch items. Breakfasts are just that: pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage, several types of cereal and milk, and they’ll even make you a custom omelette (you pick your ingredients, they make it)…then lunch has “everything” (except the breakfast stuff) like baked potatoes, baked sweet potatoes, 5–7 different types of meats, all sorts of sides (like green beans, mashed potatoes), pot roast, pizza…..and a ton other other things. Note that where I am, breakfast is typically 9 per person, while lunch is 15-17 and dinner is 17-19. Drinks are never included, but other than water, it’s a flat rate of 3.50 - no matter what; coffee, tea, milk, or pop…which are all “free refills”. Anyway, if the place lets you eat before you pay, they’ll charge based on what time it is when you LEAVE…simply because there is no way to PROVE you walked in during lunch. Or rather, there is no way to prove what time you walked in *without* a manager looking through the day’s CCTV footage…and for the price you pay at most buffets, it’s really, REALLY, not worth it - for them OR you - to do that.

A photograph that was taken when the subject was unaware that they were being shot is called a candid photo. The subject, or individuals, were unaware that they were being photographed. In my opinion, a candid shot is one in which the subject is unaware that you are taking it or you have not specifically sought for their consent to do so. I sincerely hope I was of service to you.

Conservative leader Erin O'Toole also spoke out against the violence, condemning the actions of pro-Trump protesters as an assault on democracy. \\"The storming of the Capitol Building is an astonishing assault on freedom and democracy. I am deeply saddened to see chaos grip our greatest ally today,\\" he said in a social media post. [. . .] B.C. NDP MP Alistair MacGregor even took to Twitter to urge U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence to use the 25th amendment to remove Trump from power. [. . .] Tweeting in French, Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-François Blanchet said the situation was provoked by Trump's actions and those who follow him. Green Party Leader Annamie Paul issued a statement saying the events in D.C. \\"underscore the importance of respect for the rule of law and the peaceful transfer of power — principles upon which any healthy democracy depends.\\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford issuing a statement calling the situation in Washington \\"absolutely disgraceful.\\" \\"The peaceful transfer of power is crucial to any democracy and I'm incredibly disappointed with what we are witnessing in the United States today,\\" Ford said. Quebec Premier François Legault tweeted in English that while he was watching the events in D.C. closely, he believes that the U.S. is a \\"great country\\" that \\"will rebound as it has always done in its history.\\" Polling in October, meanwhile, confirms that this unanimously hostile reaction of political parties reflects a deep antipathy among the population at large.

A lot\\")] [URL: https://www.macleans.ca/politics/how-much-do-canadians-dislike-donald-trump-a-lot/] shows that Biden was uniformly supported over Trump, with Trump being least unpopular in the province of Alberta and among supporters of the Conservative Party. Even in that province and among that political party, more people preferred Biden than Trump. A separate Ipsos poll ([LINKED_TEXT: Seven in Ten (69%) Canadians Agree that Biden in White House Will Be Good for Canada] [URL: https://www.ipsos.com/en-ca/news-polls/canadians-agree-biden-in-white-house-will-be-good-for-canada]) confirmed this polling, also noting that 60% of these polled feared the possibility of political violence. I would be exceptionally surprised if the events of the past few months have somehow made Trump more palatable to Canadians. “What do you think of the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemning the U.S. Capitol riot \\"incited\\" by Trump?” Frankly, I think that it was inevitable. The overwhelming majority of Canadians, irregardless of province or political party, were already deeply hostile towards and skeptical of Donald Trump. That the outgoing American presidency went on to try to trigger a coup is justifiable cause for horror among Canadians.

What if, God help us, Trump had actually pulled this off? A too-early condemnation of the coup could have led to disaster. Let us not forget that Trump is a man who started a diplomatic incident over the disinterest of Greenlanders in having their homeland sold to the US; Canada is much closer to the US than Greenland, and much less defensible.

But in this broader category, you can add different methods according to your child psychology."},{"instruction":"Do you believe in karma? Why or why not?","output":"No, I dont believe in karma and how it is defined by people. I believe in the below statement 1 and statement 2 is partially true. somewhat Statement 1 Nature believes in balance. Statement 2 (The notion of karmic definition by people) whatever we do, we will receive its consequence in the same manner as things will get balanced by nature. Both the statement looks almost similar if you read the definition but once we start looking at the equation of karma in detail it might start making sense both statements are different and miles apart. Statement 2 puts human/creature as the center of the subject. Cases will be launched through the eye of the subject. Judgment should be passed concerning the subject's action. Here we are talking about justice around each species under the sun and recording of there karma and learning about the story from their point of view. Consideration should be made not just by action we should respect intention too. It is almost certain one might take the wrong action though having the right intention(we don't have access to the future). To make things simpler if we remove intention from the equation and the external environment which affects action it is still challenging to define the judgment. Defining right and wrong itself is a super hard problem. It varies from culture to culture. It is not a function of evolution also. Current wrong actions might be a possible implication of old actions or influenced by the current environment or worse by our culture change. It might be also possible our silly genes and gray matter couldn't keep up with the pace of right and wrong ever changing defination and do things through the impulse that is flowing to us for the last 5000 years through evolution. The second statement doesn't give importance to anything it just runs based on balance. Nature need to eliminate 5000 people .It will simply kill 5000 people whoever they are criminal or saint. Example of statement 2 Consider the case there might be termites or ants in our kitchen will we kill them selectively? cause some insect stole my pastries of 500 rs and others stole cheap sugar. We will not do that way. It doesn't matter they are not important. Consider the case of rabbits increasing in Australia we kill rabbits to control their population without the action they invade our agriculture land. we kill them and shoot at sight. It might be possible rabbits not coming to agricultural land will be killed less as we dont see that sample sets often. But they(rabbits) can argue themselves they are not killed because of their good karma not destroying human crops. Humans are on the same scale as rabbits if we start discarding our self-importance. I firmly believe the truth lies in middle. Nature hardly discriminates whether you are a murderer or a saint when it comes to balancing things both of their act is so negligible against the problem it is trying to solve. It will randomly take action that helps to achieve her goal. Karma/Justice notion came because of culture. Humans have already hacked the mutation by introducing the culture. Culture is evolving super fast(only in 500 years I am sitting peacefully typing on a computer in an AC room rather than waging war in the field).500 years is a blink if we run the timeline for evolution. So justice(what is defined) by culture is more available to us. If we are still thinking I have seen people struggle because of bad karma remember this statement In an infinite set of events, there will always remain a pattern that makes you believe this is the law. We see things that we want to see in this infinite event #peace"},{"instruction":"What do gun fanatics have to say about the fact that there are over 130 studies proving that gun control works?

When I lived in a village in the Nottinghamshire countryside, about 25 to 30 years ago now, I did not have a pet of my own, but I used to feed the cats who lived on the farm on the opposite side the street. In a way I came to regard these cats as my own pets. The only photograph I have of these cats is of the one pictured below, who was the final cat who visited my house. He stayed with me for some time after all of the other cats from the farm, who eventually either died or were run over by speeding motorists in the street outside my house. As you can see from the picture of him above (taken in my house) he was grey in colour, with white patches, so I just called him “Grey”, which is not a very original name for a cat of his colour, is it ? As time passed he did not seem to be spending so much time with me, so I wondered what he was getting up to now. I found out the reason for this when one day one of my neighbours called on me and was very surprised to see Grey sleeping on a chair in the house. This was because this neighbour had also come to regard Grey as his cat, and had fed him and took him into his home. However this neighbour had already given him a better name than the one I had given him, even though it also began with “G”. The name given to this cat by my neighbour was George, which is a much better name than Grey, don’t you think ? This neighbour also told me that he had even taken the cat to a vet to have him neutered. Now living in suburban Nottingham bUt not having a pet of my own I subscribe to a local on line neighbourhood messaging service in which people can contact their neighbours about any issue they choose. Most of the messages are from people asking their neighbours to recommend good reliable tradespeople for jobs they want doing, and most of the other messages not on this subject are about cats. Before we had this messaging service people who had lost their cat would put up notices in lamp posts appealing for people to look for the cat, but now they post a message on the messaging service instead. Although most of the messages are about lost cats, there are almost as many messages about “found” cats, i.e. cats trying to make their homes somewhere else or hanging around another house and eating the food put out for other cats there. Obviously people who do not want to take the cat in post these messages in an attempt to trace the owner, but I am sure that there are also some other people who would befriend these wandering cats and try to make them their own pets. Often when I have read the messages about lost cats and seen how distraught the owners of lost cats are, my own experience with cats makes me feel like sending them a reply even though I have no idea as to where their cat is. I just want to tell them that they should not worry about their lost cat, because he is probably now comfortably ensconced in his new home and living the “life of Riley” there, enjoying food that is much more to his liking than what he was fed at his old home and also sleeping on the beds in the house when he was not allowed to do that in his old home. But of course I have refrained from doing that because I would only be a Job’s comforter if I did."},{"instruction":"Can I prepare for NID in 45 months?

But today we have much more accurate dating of the volcanic event making it clear that climate change and the volcanic event caused the extinction and was rapidly followed by the meteor. No dinosaur fossils are found within 40,000 years of te meteor impact, indicating they were gone by then. The ony places where fossils exist in the metoer layer is where the layer had been mixed with older layers due to the effects of the impact event. If the initial argument were to happen today the better dating would have had the meteor event be dismissed. But things are always more complicated than having just one thing being the cause. the dinosaurs had been gradually going extinct (or evolving into something different) for 10 million years before either event happened.

His physique was comparable to Dave Bautista’s but he had more tats and was probably a couple inches taller. He made it through almost the entire the course but on the day before the last day, stepped in a hole and rolled his ankle badly. He could barely walk but knew all he had to do was push through the pain and await the results. He decided to ask the Sergeant supervising selection if he thought that the injury would affect his chances of getting selected. The Sergeant matter-of-factly told him, “Son, you never had a chance”. My buddy thought he was joking and asked what he meant, and the Sergeant said, “When somebody built like you walks into a room, everybody looks at you. What we need are people that blend in everywhere and that’s not you.” My friend was dumbfounded, and asked, “Why didn’t anyone say something when I first got here?” The Sergeant said, “Well, we didn’t want to hurt your feelings”. A second friend was a former SEAL. He had a good physique, but nothing that stood out. Once, he wanted to buy a new motorcycle but didn’t want to use his savings for the purchase. Lucky for him, an announcement was made that there would be a “King of the Ring” boxing contest that anyone could enter. He didn’t have any experience, so for the three weeks leading up to the contest, he trained at a local boxing gym. He was probably a middleweight, but the contest was only divided into two categories—up to 205 and over 205. He was probably around 180 lbs. He won his division handily after fighting about 8 guys over 2 days, and got a ten-thousand dollar check to buy his bike. Another friend was a TL for Delta and served with them for over 10 years. He was truly huge, but somehow didn’t “look” huge. He got out after Somalia in ’93 which is when I met him, and until I was at his place doing some training a few years later, I never really noticed how powerfully built he was.

Matches typically start in the late afternoon or early evening so that at least some of games can be played at night under floodlights for international television broadcasts. Before to the anticipated expansion to 10 clubs in 2011, league games were initially played on a home-and-away basis between all teams. However, this structure was amended so that some teams' matches would only be played once. Three play-off matches between the top four teams are played, with one losing team receiving a second chance to advance to the championship. We hope the knowledge is both interesting and beneficial.

Exports in May fell 7.5% yoy to USD 283.5 billion or well below the consensus forecast fall for May of 0.4% yoy. The fall sharply reversed the rises seen in the first 4 months of 2023 - as can be seen in the chart below. However, the news is even worse if you look below the surface numbers. China exports to the US fell 18.2% yoy and to the EU by 26.6%. The overall numbers were saved by exports to Russia which surged by 114% and to Southeast Asia. The main reasons for the May reversal appear to be: Slower economic growth in the USA as a response to domestic monetary tightening and other local reasons. For instance, rises in interest rates and bank failures in the US resulted in very sharp declines in March, April and May deposits. Deposits fell by more than US700 bn since end Feb. US GDP for 2023 is now expected to be under 1%. If this proves correct, then US GDP will contract in Q3 and/or Q4 2023. Slower EU demand due to the Ukrainian war, credit tightening and other reasons. However, unlike a lowering of the GDP forecast in the US, the forecast for EU GDP have been revised upwards, EU growth in 2023 has been revised from around 0.8% to 1%.Automation and rising cost of logistics. The sharp fall in local manufacturing arising from these trends, plus fears of vulnerable long supply chains, have accelerated the re-emergence of manufacturing in industrialized countries. This is putting pressure on all global merchandise exports including China’s.The high base that Chinese exports are coming from. As can be seen in the first of the two charts, May 2022 was the highest month for exports for the whole of 2022. As can be seen in the second of the two charts, it can be seen that China’s exports surged after the COVID lockdown. Part of the reason was catchup of delayed shipments and pent up demand. Both created a high base on which the May 2023 yoy fall is computed. While I, like many other forecasters, believe that China exports will slow, it is not as bad as some of the more superficial commentators suggest. The reason is three-fold. The nature of China’s exports are changing. China no longer exports cheap goods but more value add goods such as machinery, electronics, intermediary goods etc. However, many of these goods are less suitable for advanced markets such as the EU and USA and more suitable for developing countries. This is evidenced by continued strong exports to Korea (4th largest export market), Vietnam (5th), India (6th) Malaysia (9th), Thailand (14th) and Mexico (15th). … exports to S Korea … exports to Vietnam … exports to India … exports to Malaysia … exports to Thailand … exports to Mexico While China’s export of services is still small compared to its merchandise exports, it is rising rapidly. In 2022 it rose by more than 20% compared to merchandise growth of 8.5% over the same period.While China’s exports is around 20% of GDP, China’s imports is around 14–15% of GDP. Thus the net impact is around 5–6%. This impact on GDP is very modest relative to domestic and government consumption."},{"instruction":"Who are some of the big hearted citizens of India?","output":"Ameritus Ratan Tata Tata Group’s chairman Ameritus Ratan Tata has always used over most of the wealth created by the (group) firms for charitable purposes.Be it education, medical or causes related to rural development, Tata is involved in most welfare activities.

One way to try and trace a name through a mobile number is by doing a reverse phone lookup. This is where you take a phone number and search for information about the owner of that number. Some websites provide this service for free, while others may charge a fee. However, the information provided by these services may be limited, and it's not guaranteed that you'll be able to find the name of the person you're looking for. Another way to try and trace a name through a mobile number is by contacting the phone carrier and asking them to verify the name associated with the number. However, phone carriers typically only provide this information to law enforcement agencies or other authorized parties with legal authorization. It's important to keep in mind that, if the number is not publicly listed, it may not be possible to trace the name through a mobile number without a legal authorization or the owner's consent.

Actually, this position of refusing to recognize Japan’s attempt to re-annex Ryukyu and even displaying sympathy for Ryukyuan independence has been a long-held one by the government of the Republic of China (ROC), sometimes conveniently referred to as Taiwan, where I am from. It is a position grounded in international law, and fully in keeping with the principles of moral justice, human right and national self-determination. It is shameful that the world community, especially the West, has intentionally turned a blind eye to this gross transgression of international law, justice, and human right for so long. Few cases are better than Ryukyu to expose the West’s hypocrisy and double standard*. - Ryukyu is an independent nation of its own race, ethnicity, language, history, custom, religion, and culture, all distinct from those of Japan. - Japan brutally annexed the independent kingdom of Ryukyu in 1879, murdering its people, obliterating its history, culture and language and renamed it Okinawa. - Japan used Ryukyuans massively as human shields against Allied invasion in WWII (see the HBO series The Pacific, produced by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks), resulting in decimation of its civilian population. Japan also used this opportunity to murder Ryukyuans of uncounted number, many of which by forced suicide. Over 300,000 Ryukyu civilians perished due to Japanese war atrocity**. - Japan renounced all its claims to Ryukyu/Okinawa and other territories in no uncertain terms when it unconditionally surrendered in 1945, per terms stipulated in the Potsdam Proclamation signed by ROC, the US and the UK. - Japan re-annexed Ryukyu under tacit agreement by the US, who unilaterally transferred to it “administrative rights” of Ryukyu in the 1970, disregarding vehement objection from the ROC, one of the signatory nations of the Potsdam Proclamation whose opinion by definition was required in such decisions. - Japan has not treated the Ryukyuans nicely. They have been second class citizens ever since the beginning, and always got the short end of the stick. For more detail, see the links included below. Japan has dumped 74.4% of its share of the US military bases on Ryukyu, which accounts for less than 1% of the Japanese land area. The attendant lion’s share of intrusion, noise, accidents, pollution, rape, crime etc. are born by Ryukyuans alone.Japanese officials can often be caught making racially derogatory remarks about Ryukyuans with impunity, let alone discriminatory and abusive practices committed daily against Ryukyuans in the society accepted as the norm.Native grown voices and movements for greater Ryukyuan autonomy have been relentlessly suppressed by the Japanese government, counter to the liberal façade it presents to the outside world. Without this heavy-handed, anti-democratic oppression by the Japanese government, we would be hearing 100 times more outcries from native Ryukyuans accusing their Japanese colonizers of their crimes, and demanding more autonomy, if not independence. I grew up in ROC/Taiwan. For a long time, the ROC government vocally expressed its refusal to recognize Japan’s claim to Ryukyu, although it was too weak and too beholden to the US to assert or enforce what was right in this issue. The ROC government has nonetheless insisted on sending ambassadorial level diplomats to the capital of Ryukyu as a protest, and used the name Ryukyu, not Okinawa, in all official proceedings. Such practice has persisted well into the 21st Century, until the DPP regime, backed by major financial donors and supporting US lobbyists with shady Japanese links, came to power. Today on Taiwanese streets one stills finds the name Ryukyu used much more often than Okinawa. Recently when the Governor of Ryukyu, Denny Tamaki, visited Taiwan, he was greeted by the sign “Welcome Governor of Ryukyu”, for which he expressed great appreciation. The well-respected Taiwanese political journal 遠望雜誌 has made it its mission to advocate Ryukyu independence. It is only the most legally and morally defensible position to take. I should relate a story shared by a friend who lives in the US. Once he and his wife stepped into a sushi restaurant. They sat down, started talking to the sushi chef, and learned that the chef was a Ryukyuan. The next thing he heard was deep resentment, even hatred, toward the Japanese by the chef, who stated that he shared nothing in common with the Japanese, and wished his nation could become free from its oppressors one day. My friend was deeply impressed by the passion displayed by this Ryukyuan chef. No need for the Ryukyuans to despair. I remember once, in the 1980s, seeing a small group holding a banner of “Independent Lithuania” in the Chicago July 4th parade. Everyone laughed his head off when he saw this procession pass by. But lo and behold, 10 years later, Independent Lithuania was a reality. By international law, Ryukyu has at least as much right to be independent. We shall see. * As you may know, whenever I see a brainwashed question about Xinjiang or Tibet, I ask the questioner to ask the same question about Ryukyu first before anyone should bother to answer. As a tiny island nation, Ryukyu coexisted with a gigantic China next door peacefully for hundreds of years. Whereas, as soon as Japan had the means, it brutally annexed Ryukyu in no time. That should tell you something. ** By an estimate of the US Army after WWII, 270 thousand Ryukyuans were slaughtered by the Japanese, and another 90 thousand were killed in the war, when the total population was less than half a million. This was even worse than Taiwan, where the Japanese slaughtered 600 thousand people when the population was only about 6.5 million.

It is an honest summary of the background and current state of the Ryukyu problem. A cautionary note: If you can, watch it ASAP. The channel host is under threat of cancellation by YouTube with zero explanation given by the latter, as it appears that there is no legit reason for cancelling his channel. In the beginning, you would see a footage of Japanese policemen yelling racially derogatory epithets at Ryukyuans. A pretty repugnant face! This clip mentioned many facts I discussed above, including the absolutely illegitimate claim Japan has on Ryukyu. It also talked about other facts that I didn’t know before. Japan annexed Ryukyu in 1879 by kidnapping its King and his relatives, among other atrocities committed against its people as I described.The former Japanese emperor Akihito has survived two assassination attempts by Ryukyuans, showing the ongoing, untamable resentment by the Ryukyuans toward their colonialists, a sharp contradiction to the ostensible uneventfulness reported on Western media.Despite being a tiny island nation next to the giant of China, it has peacefully coexisted with China for over 500 years until its brutal annexation by Japan. Even the name Ryukyu was coined almost a millennium ago by a Chinese official, and then by the Ming Emperor. At the end, you would see another footage of the Ryukyuan ceremony commemorating the ancient annual ritual of receiving envoys from China, which has been going on for the past 5–600 years. You also see the Ryukyuans performing a carnival style dance in this ceremony called “Welcome the Tang (Chinese) boats”. The host noted that, over the 150 years of Japan’s illegal annexation of Ryukyu, the Ryukyuan never developed a similar welcoming dance for the Japanese boats. Note Added 07/06/2023 The video below mentioned many facts already cited above. What’s new and remarkable from it was the account that Japan has monopolized many of the tourism business privileges in Ryukyu, earmarking them for big Japanese businesses and depriving the Ryukyuans the rights to earn a living off their own land. It has taken over the beach resort and cruise liner management rights out of the hands of the Ryukyuans. I remembered another account by a Taiwanese pundit on YouTube, who said from his personal observation that Ryukyuans, the economically underprivileged ethnic second class, are mostly clustered in the ghetto areas in large Japanese cities. This video also reported on the mass protests by the Ryukyuans, numbering up to 150 thousand in some cases. Of course you will never see this in Western media."},{"instruction":"What is the formula for sport betting?","output":"The key to successful sports betting is discipline, research, and money management.

Cryptocurrency has been a hot topic in recent years. It's a digital asset that's designed to work as a medium of exchange, using cryptography to secure transactions and to control the creation of new units. Cryptocurrency is decentralized, meaning that it's not controlled by any central authority, and it's usually based on blockchain technology. As with any new technology, people have been questioning the safety and security of cryptocurrency. In this article, we'll explore some of the risks associated with cryptocurrency and discuss ways to keep your investments safe. Volatility One of the biggest risks associated with [LINKED_TEXT: cryptocurrency] [URL: https://polygoncrypto.blogspot.com/2023/04/blog-post_07.html] is its volatility. The value of cryptocurrency can fluctuate rapidly, and there's no guarantee that it will maintain its value over time. This means that if you invest in cryptocurrency, you could potentially lose a significant amount of money if the value of the currency drops suddenly. However, it's worth noting that volatility can work both ways. If you're willing to take on the risk, you could potentially make a significant profit if the value of the currency increases rapidly. Hacking Another risk associated with cryptocurrency is the possibility of hacking. Cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets can be vulnerable to hacking, which could result in the loss of your funds. To reduce the risk of hacking, it's important to use reputable exchanges and wallets. Look for platforms that have a strong security track record and use two-factor authentication to protect your account. It's also important to keep your private keys secure. Your private keys are essentially the passwords that allow you to access your cryptocurrency. If someone gains access to your private keys, they can steal your funds. Keep your private keys in a secure location, such as a hardware wallet, and never share them with anyone. Regulation Cryptocurrency is a relatively new technology, and as such, it's not yet fully regulated in many parts of the world. This lack of regulation can create uncertainty and make it difficult to know whether your investments are safe. To reduce the risk associated with regulation, it's important to stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the cryptocurrency world. Keep an eye on regulatory bodies such as the SEC and stay informed about any changes to regulations that may affect your investments. Scams Finally, there are a number of scams associated with cryptocurrency. These can include fraudulent ICOs, Ponzi schemes, and phishing scams. To avoid falling victim to a cryptocurrency scam, it's important to do your research before investing. Look for projects that have a strong track record and a solid team behind them. Avoid projects that promise unrealistic returns or that seem too good to be true. In Conclusion Cryptocurrency is a new and exciting technology, but it's important to be aware of the risks associated with investing in it. By staying informed and taking steps to protect your investments, you can reduce the risk and potentially profit from this emerging asset class. Remember to always use reputable exchanges and wallets, keep your private keys secure, stay informed about regulatory developments, and do your research before investing in any cryptocurrency project."},{"instruction":"Should we be disrespectful to former presidents if we disagree with them politically?

I was really serious about it when I was 19 (I’m 25 now) and it was going okay…Not great even though I was killing myself by exercising, every day, in the California heat for approximately 2 hours. I wasn’t losing as much weight as I thought I should have but I did lose a good chunk (I don’t remember exactly how much). Sadly, I have suffered from depression since I was 11 so during one of my bouts, I gained it all back. I was put on Belviq and the side-effects were so undesirable that I got serious again on my own. Lost something like 50 lbs (or thereabouts). Then I moved in with my in-laws and you know…my depression came back (lawl). I think this last time it was partly because I literally couldn’t be bothered to care about eating well while I had to also deal with my in-laws and their fuckery. I was sad, and I got sadder, and fatter, and fatter. Then I was well above what I weighed before I started losing weight again. All the while, people would still say “you weigh what?” and “there’s no way you weigh that much”. Interjection: Can I just say, this was all incredibly difficult. I am pretty sure I have some disordered eating habits so I was obsessive about losing the weight. I tracked everything but to an obsession and every time I cheated I had to force myself not to take laxatives or do something insane and give myself a break. Not to mention that regardless of how hard I worked, plateaus almost always made me want to give up. You constantly feel like you are fighting your body and your mind instead of using those things to better your life. I know some of that is because of me and my myriad of fucking issues, but losing weight and keeping it off is part biology, part psychology, and all difficulty. Fuck anyone who says it’s just a matter of calories in vs. calories out. Also, fuck the BMI scale. Like, for real. It’s such a stupid metric. This last time, will hopefully be my last time trying to lose weight as my husband and I have adopted the ketogenic lifestyle. We probably won’t stay this way forever, but for now, I’m content with not starving myself and eating well, learning how to cook, exercising until I feel good and not until I feel like dying, and learning to love food. However, I’m realizing more and more that part of the problem is the American ideals of working yourself until you can’t anymore and the complete lack of time one has for themselves. I’m sorry for those who don’t have the time or money to even try a diet that could be good for them. I know that my diet is almost all-consuming. Between waking up and bed-time, I don’t have a lot of time for myself because of my commute and work and that’s unfortunate. But… I have lost 25 lbs :) without dying and without starving and without the crazy level of obsession. So, that’s nice. Edit: I’d like to add that the only reason I was able to do anything at all was because I bought my own exercise equipment. I don’t do gyms. I have social anxiety, I don’t like people, and I especially don’t like people who can see me in my full fat glory sweating my ass off. Without access to exercise equipment, this would not be happening. This is something else people fail to consider when they tell obese people that they can just do it if they believe in themselves! :P"},{"instruction":"What is it like raising a very high IQ child?","output":"My parents could answer that but they won’t talk to me unless they need for me to pay the taxes on their 8500 sq foot home that I bought them."},{"instruction":"What is the biggest problem with the modern education system?","output":"One of the biggest problems I see is that schools in the US are mainly funded by state and local property taxes. This means that places like Beverly Hills and Manhattan have amazing public schools that are on par with expensive private schools. Property taxes are high in these places. On the other hand, places like Harlem or small Midwestern towns have public schools with run-down buildings, not enough computers or textbooks and underpaid teachers. Why? Because property taxes are low in these places. As you can see, this creates a lot of disparities in our educational system. You have good school districts and bad school districts. And if you’re not rich enough to afford an apartment or house in a nice area, then your children are stuck going to school in a bad district. Lastly, teachers get paid more in better school districts. So, where do you think the best teachers are going to apply for jobs? In richer neighborhoods. Some places are starting to ameliorate the above situation with charter schools, but I think the problem is systemic and needs to be dealt with in a systemic way. I think one feasible solution is to pool all property tax revenues into a single statewide education fund. Then, these funds can be distributed equally among the different districts. Or, they can be distributed to schools on a per-student basis."},{"instruction":"f you walk into a buffet restaurant technically during their lunch times but leave during dinner times assuming they are two different prices which price do you get charged?","output":"The last buffet I went to charged me on the way in, not on the way out.

Every luxury product will be cheaper like its alternative low cost. An iPhone 7 would just cost Rs. 649/- which is more than 100 times cheaper than current price. Also petrol will be cheap, and hence the transportation of goods in the country.But, exports will be quite expensive for other countries and if it’s expensive, who will buy goods from India or import stuff from India to their county? They will always prefer other countries who are exporting similar goods at low price.Investing in India will also be expensive. So out foreign investments will fall. This will affect India’s IT sector, which contributes huge amount of Indian Economy. Foreign countries will again prefer other countries for investment. Now you would think why would we need foreign investments and imports? What if we use Made in India products? If we stop using foreign products, then foreign countries will also stop using Indian products. Which decreasing imports will decrease exports. Less export means less reserves for foreign imports.A company paying software engineer about Rs. 50,000/- a month (which will be equivalent to 50,000) would prefer to pay someone else and get the work done in just Rs.3000 (which will be equivalent to 3000).So, after a while, people will lose their jobs leading to unemployment and the country’s economy will slow down.

The reason being the current luffy would get destroyed by whitebeard prime so imagine how bad he would be obliterated by a man like blackbeard. There are a lot of reasons. Blackbeard is smart he would never go into a 1 on 1 fight but luffy would do so and the straw hats woud not be able to help. If he thinks at any point he can lose the fight he will call in his crew and they scale higher than the straw hats. 2. Even if blackbeard chooses not to jump luffy I still believe in a fight blackbead will win he has more experience and 2 powerful devil fruits. Luffy does not have any move than blackbeard cant nullify with his devil fruit. 3. The last reason why he cannot beat blackbeard is because its not good for the plot its supposed to go like a naruto and jaraiya type thing.

What zoom should I go to for nebulas?","output":"The other answers appear to miss two key points. One is aperture. With a 3 inch objective lens (refractor) or mirror (reflector), it’s too narrow for 300x. You need at least 6 inches. And a 6 inch refractor is many thousands of dollars and not likely to be too portable. So to achieve 300x power, you need a reflector. Second is the focal length of the telescope. I have an 800 mm f5.6 telephoto lens that I use as a telescope. But 300x just does not work well with it. (Part of its problem may be it is a telephoto lens, not a real telescope, but I think my point about its short focal length remains.) You would likely need at least 2000 mm, maybe more. That’s nearly 7 feet. With a Newtonian or related reflector, that makes for a pretty big telescope. Here is where catadioptric telescopes come in handy. They effectively fold the focal length, making it possible to have a short (and thus portable) telescope with a longer focal length, such that 300x becomes possible. Finally, 300x is really only good for looking at planets and close binary stars. Most things in the sky are far too extended for 300x to work well. And as someone pointed out, the rotation of the earth means you either need a computer-controlled mount that can track the movement of the sky, or you have to adjust the view from time to time."},{"instruction":"Did a landlord ever offer to lower your rent so that you wouldn't leave?","output":"I have never had that experience, but it could be because where I’m at, there are a lot of people who will pay for more.

So I asked him what he meant. He said introducing new law which requires everyone to register their relationships will prevent these crimes. WHAT.THE.HELL? Here's how the conversation went. Tldr at the bottom. TLDR : He says preventing people from having relationships like dating,live-in,romantic which are legally registered will avoid crimes in relationships and he strongly believes in it. He meant people shouldn't have romantic relationships if they aren't married. I was completely stumped by his logic. 1.How exactly is legal document supposed prevent crimes? Are there no crimes involving legally married couples? 2. Why should I need government to validate/recognize my relationship to investage crimes? What exactly will this validation achieve? 3. He corrected me that sextortion doesn't apply to Men. He is right and I said it should be ammended to cover men as well. He said No need to extend it to men, instead these kind of relationships should be prohibited 4. Common sense. Let's assume you bring that stupid law in to action. How exactly will that change anything other than making India a laughingstock? Basically you are legally recognizing no-married couples. How will that prevent any crime?

Hindi is not just the largest spoken language in India but also the widely spread language in India. It is widely used in non-hindi states like Maharashtra, Odisha, Gujarat, Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Sikkim, West Bengal, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh,Nagaland, Goa, Hyderabad etc…. when I visited these states I found that most of the citizens in the above mentioned states speak Hindi along with their state language. Rajasthan, Haryana, Bihar too have several regional languages like Marwari, Bhojpuri, Mewari, Malvi, Rajasthani etc…. they all speak Hindi along with the regional languages. For me learning Hindi helped to explore the new opportunities & increased my connectivity with the majority people in India and helped my business to grow. Hindi is the most practically used language for conducting businesses in India, some peoples ego might not accept this but it is an undeniable fact that it is the language with widest reach in India. Otherwise why would a Gujarati speaking person like Narendra Modi uses Hindi in most of his speeches, why did ex PM Manmohan Singh who was a Punjabi by birth used Hindi when he was in chair? Why does a Tamilian like Nirmala Sitharaman uses Hindi so frequently as a Finance Minister? Every cricketer from non-Hindi states who represented India speak Hindi fluently. Rahul Dravid (Kannadiga), Sachin Tendulakar (Marathi), Saurav Ganguly (Bengali) communicated to each other in Hindi while playing for Team India. In the recent India vs Australia match I have found Ravichandran Ashwin (Tamilian) speaking in Hindi with Mohammed Shami (Bengali). So far Hindi is the language which has more reach in India otherwise why would a Tamilian like Ashwin speaks in Hindi with a Bengali cricketer Shami?

To the point where Star Trek: Strange New Worlds had an episode with a similar premise to Those Who Walk Away From Omelas (if you know, you know. No spoilers). Left Hand of Darkness is one of the first notable sci-fi books to deal with gender in a meaningful way with a nearly agender race (Gethenians), save for a few days a month. Le Guin later wished she went even further with how she used pronouns in the book, as she defaulted to “he” for the Gethenians[LINKED_TEXT: .] [URL: https://theliterarylink.com/afterword.html] Still, in 1967, when the book was published, a near-sexless alien race was political, as much of science fiction is, as was the way she dealt with culture, acceptance, and human emotion. If you needed more proof that this book is among the best, it won both a Hugo and Nebula Awards for Best Science Fiction Novel of the Year. Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley (1818) Mary Shelley started writing classic gothic thriller Frankenstein when she was 18 years old. Two centuries later, it is a major ancestor of both the science fiction and horror genres, tackling huge themes like the nature of life and death, immortality and genetic engineering. It is a pro-science novel that at its heart shows Dr Frankenstein as the callous fiend of the story, who created a being and was not willing to accept responsibility for his actions. In an age where the space between technical life and death is narrower than ever, and scientists are playing with the makeup of what makes us humans, Frankenstein can still teach an important lesson: just because you can, doesn't mean you should. A WRINKLE IN TIME BY MADELEINE L’ENGLE (1962) This is one of those science fiction books that treads the line between science and fantasy, though there is no denying that it’s scientific in basis with its discussions of quantum mechanics, time travel, and dimension hopping. As Molly Reiniger and others have pointed out, A Wrinkle in Time is many children’s — especially girls — introduction to science fiction. It was written with middle schoolers in mind, encouraging them to ask “but what if…” and has gone on to inspire numerous women to join the STEM field. I know it may not have been my first science fiction book (my parents are and have always been avid readers of the genre), but it’s the most memorable for me. In part because Meg sounded like me as a kid: uncool, frizzy hair, glasses, and often surly. It’s been made into two movies, adapted into a graphic novel, and into a play. There’s no denying the impact this book has had. The Stars My Destination, by Alfred Bester (1957) This landmark novel begins with a simple proposition – what if humans could teleport? – and sprawls into a tale of rebirth and vengeance that winds across the Solar System: The Count of Monte Cristo for the interstellar age. First published as Tiger! Tiger! in the UK, named after the William Blake poem, it follows Gully Foyle – a violent, uneducated brute who spends six months marooned in deep space, and the rest of the book seeking retribution for it. Solaris, by Stanislaw Lem (1961) If you think you know Solaris from the 2002 Steven Soderbergh film, the original book may come as a bit of a surprise. Written by Polish writer Stanislaw Lem in 1961, this short novel is heavier on philosophy than plot. It follows a team of humans on a space station who are trying to understand the mysterious living ocean on the planet Solaris, with little success – their research is limited to lengthy descriptions that paint a vibrant picture of the alien planet but fail to elucidate how it works. As they poke and prod, Solaris ends up exposing more about them than it does about itself, with the book demonstrating the futility of humans trying to comprehend something not of their world."},{"instruction":"What is the direct link to check the result of the SSC CHSL 2018?","output":"Calmly login into this site [LINKED_TEXT: Staff Selection Commission] [URL: http://ssc.nic.in/] and here you can check you result by entering your Registration no and password Thanks for visiting my answer"},{"instruction":"w does NFT get momentum in the art world?","output":"An NFT, or non-fungible token, essentially allows its buyer to say they own the original copy of a digital file in the same way you might own the original copy of a piece of physical art."},{"instruction":"w do I get my son to stop making music?","output":"Why do you want him to quit music?

Such was their contempt for the democratic process, and their disgusting lack of morals. Then bailing out the banks. giving them everything they wanted almost without condition. Brown missed out on making the greatest socialist move in history. A move with virtually ZERO negative effects. The banks needed cash, he could have put a series of large deposits in everyones accounts. That way the banks would have thier cash and millions would have be set free from debt slavery, and many others would have had enough to start their own businesses. All that money would eventually have to be re-paid through tax, but that is exactly what is happening now, except the taxpayers never got to see the money they are paying for.

Just as he did about offering a choice in a peoples vote.( vote for single market, customs union and EU courts OR remain.) Labour MPs were elected on a promise to honour the outcome of the referendum. Shortly after being elected many of them declared themselves “proud remainers”. So many of them didn’t represent their own manifesto, their own constituencies or the UK….. I hope for their repeated perfidy, that the labor party disappears altogether.

But let’s not include him as it would be a sin to compare him with the likes of Karna, Arjuna, Bhishma etc. Same goes for Lord Balaram. I will not include Lord Balaram in my answer as he was divine and an incarnation of Adishesha himself. Mahabharata had various warriors who were very powerful and strong and had some amazing feats to their name. Comparing the warriors or ranking the warriors has always been a matter of debate. Loads of answers get collapsed due to the disagreement of some blind fans. But still I would attempt to answer this question which already has 100 or more answers. All my points would be based on BORI CE but I will provide the footnotes from KMG as it’s easier to find and read. Let’s rank these warriors on the basis of their feats and records. (10). Ghatotkacha The mighty demon son of Bhima had innumerable feats to his name but his real prowess was shown on the 14th night.He created his own army of Rakshasas out of his illusions. Such was the valour of those rakshasas that they made the powerful Karna retreat and defeated them. Ghatotkacha roared like a lion and terrified by this, the elephants exuded urine. The men were extremely miserable. Once twilight has passed, the rakshasas become even more powerful on earth. In every direction, they brought down a shower of boulders. Iron wheels, catapults, lances, javelins, spears, shataghnis and battleaxes showered down incessantly. On seeing the fierce and terrible state in the field of battle, the kings, your sons and Karna were distressed and fled in different directions. He defeated Dronacharya various times.He overpowered Aswatthama in a fierce fight using his illusions.His Rakshasas were very powerful and were killed in a very fierce fight. Why is he not ranked a bit higher? He was defeated by Aswatthama various times. His rakshasas were killed by Aswatthama. He never overpowered Aswatthama except for instance.He could not get an upper hand over Karna until the very last moment. (9). Abhimanyu The powerful son of Arjuna is already known as the bravest warrior from Mahabharata due to his extraordinary feats on the 13th day of Kurukshetra War where he singlehandedly created havoc in the Chakravyuha made by Kuru Army.He defeated Duhshasana in archery battle and the latter fled away from the battlefield.He defeated Karna 5 times and overpowered him once on 13th day. He first defeated defeated Karna and his brother had to come for saving Karna. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #btrAw] He defeats Karna then for the second time with the use of normal arrows and Karna fled away from the battlefield. He shattered that net of elephants, horses, chariots and infantry. The immensely illustrious Abhimanyu angrily routed them with his arrows. Karna was afflicted by Abhimanyu’s many arrows. He fled on swift horses and the array was shattered. [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #dtIRi]Abhimanyu then killed six of Karna’s advisors in front of him after overpowering Karna in an archery duel. This incident occurred after the incident given below. Phalguna’s son once again pierced Karna in the ear with a barbed arrow. Angering him even more, he pierced him with fifty arrows. Radheya pierced the great warrior back in turn. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Covered with arrows all over his limbs, he looked extremely radiant. Extremely enraged, he caused Karna to be covered in blood. Covered with arrows and streaming blood, the brave Karna was also resplendent. Both of them were beautiful with arrows on their bodies, and blood flowed from their wounds. Those great-souled ones looked like flowering kimshukatrees. Subhadra’s son destroyed six of Karna’s advisers, who were brave and wonderful in the art of fighting, together with their horses, charioteers, standards and chariots. [LINKED_TEXT: [3]] [URL: #RmcLd]Abhimanyu even defeated Dronacharya, Aswatthama, Brihadbala, Kripacharya, Duryodhana, Karna, Kritavarman and Shakuni even though all these people attacked him in a group.[LINKED_TEXT: [4]] [URL: #gbgbA] Beholding them broken and routed, Drona and Drona's son, and Vrihadvala, and Kripa, and Duryodhana, and Karna, and Kritavarman, and Suvala's son (Sakuni), rushed in great wrath against the unvanquished son of Subhadra. Almost all these, O king, were beaten back by thy grandson. Abhimanyu was made chariotless. He was deprived of a bow fairly by Karna. He still managed to defeat or overpower Aswatthama with a mace.[LINKED_TEXT: [5]] [URL: #LuVHv] Why does the brave hero get 9th rank and not any higher rank? Abhimanyu faced various defeats in his life which cannot be ignored. He was defeated on 1st day itself by Bhishma, 12th day by Bhagadatta etc. 8). Bhagadatta He was probably the most powerful fighter who fought on the back of an elephant.He had almost defeated Ghatotkacha on 1st day of war itself.He was an important warrior for the Kurus and was very instrumental during Bhishma’s reign as General of Army.His Valour on the 12th day was amazing.His elephant had almost killed Bhima that day.He defeated a Group attack which had Abhimanyu and Bhima in it. Such was the power of his immensely powerful and infallible Vaishnavastra that Lord Krishna himself had to save Arjuna.[LINKED_TEXT: [6]] [URL: #Sqzab] There’s no need to prove that why he is at 8th. There are tons of better warriors than him. (7). Satyaki He is undoubtedly the most underrated warrior of Mahabharata.He had started creating havoc from the first day itself where he along with Abhimanyu managed to make Drona and Bhishma retreat.He defeated Shakuni various times in the war.Satyaki had defeated Bhishma in the war.He defeated Karna on the 12th day when he attacked Karna along with Arjuna, Bhima and Dhristadyumna. Karna was present with his brother so it was not a group attack. Then Bhima, jumping down from his own car, like a second Garuda, slew with his excellent sword five and ten combatants amongst those that supported Karna. Mounting once more on his car and taking up another bow, he pierced Karna with ten shafts and his charioteer and steeds with five. Dhrishtadyumna also taking up a sword and a bright shield; despatched Charmavarman and also Vrihatkshatra, the ruler of the Naishadhas. The Panchala prince then, mounting upon his own car and taking up another bow, pierced Karna with three and seventy shafts, and uttered a loud roar. Sini's grandson also, of splendour equal to that of Indra himself, taking up another bow pierced Suta's son with four and sixty shafts and roared like a lion. And cutting off Karna's bow with a couple of well-shot shafts, he once more pierced Karna on the arms and the chest with three arrows. The king Duryodhana, and Drona and Jayadratha, rescued Karna from the Satyaki-ocean, as the former was about to sink into it. [LINKED_TEXT: [7]] [URL: #XOvhB]His valour on the 14th day was just next to Arjuna on that day. He defeated everyone who came in his way and successfully penetrated the 3 complex vyuhas formed by Dronacharya.He defeated Dronacharya on the way whom even Arjuna avoided that day. Even Sanjaya cross-verified this fact just after this paragraph. Apart from this, he defeated Kritavarman, Jalasandha and almost every warrior who came in his way.Satyaki defeated Karna. Karna became very sad after being defeated and climbed upon Duryodhana’s chariot. Satyaki defeated Dushasana and various other brothers of Duryodhana and spared their lives for the sake of protecting Bhima’s vow.Satyaki defeated Aswatthama, Kritavarman and hundreds of other maharathas. Satyaki had various powerful and amazing deeds but these are enough to describe him. Even though, he is so powerful. Why is he placed at 7th rank? Satyaki was defeated various no. of times by Karna even though he defeated him twice or thrice.Karna defeated Satyaki 8 times in the Kurukshetra war itself. Such was Karna’s prowess that Satyaki couldn’t defeat him even though he attacked Karna in a group.Satyaki had a fair amount of defeats in his life. He was defeated by Jayadratha on day 13 as Jayadratha’s boon only included the 4 Pandavas.Other than these, I can’t recollect his defeats. You may tell me in the comments. (6). Bhishma Bhishma’s exploits as a warrior are well known. He had some amazing feats in his life but the problem is that they were overshadowed by his fair amounts of defeats in his latter life.Bhishma had the power to stop the flow of River Ganga.Bhishma defeated thousands of kings who had arrived from all around the world with ease, during the Kashi Princess’ Swayamvara.Bhishma defeated Parshurama in a battle which lasted for around 23 days. The fact that he was defeated was accepted by none other than Lord Parshurama Ji himself. He in fact accepted this 2 times.He once accepted it when Bhishma had readied his blazing Brahmastra. He accepted it once again in front of Amba. Bhishma was among the only few who managed to defeat the mighty warrior Arjuna. Arjuna was fighting mildly against Bhishma. Krishna became enraged at this. Bhishma defeated all the Pandava soldiers and the Pandavas including Arjuna on day 7th. He was aided by Shalya.[LINKED_TEXT: [8]] [URL: #fvpgQ] He was invincible. Why is he at 6th rank? He managed to defeat Arjuna when Arjuna was fighting mildly with him. Check out the screenshot I had provided.He was made to retreat by Satyaki.Bhishma in his old age was not as powerful as he was in his youth.He had himself accepted a no. of times that he was inferior to Arjuna. (5). Bhima The mighty son of Vayu was among the best mace fighters of his era. His archery skills are most of the time underrated.He killed 98 brothers of Duryodhana in archery fights, Duhshasana with a sword and Duryodhana with a mace.He killed powerful Rakshasas like Hidimba, Baka, Jatasura etc.He defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling battle.He killed Keechaka with his bare hands.He killed the powerful Yakshas who were guarding the beautiful flowers.He defeated Dronacharya and Bhishma various times in the Kurukshetra war.Such was his prowess that he defeated Karna 6 times on day 14th itself. I’ll provide information about all his victories. Don’t worry. Most of the times, being chariotless is mentioned as being defeated. This was how it was calculated by Sanjaya.Here, Bhima made him chariotless and forced him to ascend someone else’s chariot. The word ‘vanquished’ is clearly mentioned there. Here, Bhima again defeated Karna. He made him chariotless. Karna was afllicted by Bhima’s arrows and had to go on another chariot. Dhrithrashtra himself terms this as ‘retreat’. Here again, Bhima was overpowering Karna. Bhima deprived Karna of his bow and killed his horses. Duryodhana himself thought that his friend was confronting difficulties and was going to be ‘devoured’ by Bhima. Bhima again deprived him of his chariot and again Sanjaya mentions it as a defeat Bhima again makes him chariotless and defeats him. He even brought down the standard of Karna Bhima again made him chariotless and Duryodhana has to send his brothers to save Karna. Bhima even defeated Duryodhana a no. of times in various archery encounters.Bhima killed 2–3 akshouni or even more army of the Kauravas.He was more fearful than anyone else for Dhrithrashtra and for Duryodhana. A warrior who defeated Karna should be above Karna. Why is he ranked so low? The reason is that he was defeated a number of times by Karna.I will mention only one of Bhima’s defeat by Karna as the answer is already getting too long. He spared Bhima’s life here. Other than this, Karna defeated Bhima 10 or more times on 16th and 17th day. Bhima was even defeated by Dronacharya, Aswatthama etc. (4). Dronacharya The powerful preceptor was very powerful and had some amazing feats to his name. He survived for 15 days and did a pretty decent job as a warrior.He was one of the best strategists who knew almost every war formation.He killed around 2 to 3 akshouhinis of warriors.His skills as a warrior can be estimated by the fact that he defeated group attacks which had Bhima, Satyaki, Yudhisthira etc. in it.Such was his prowess that he defeated Arjuna on day 14 and Arjuna had to avoid him and attack other warriors. It is clearly mentioned there that Drona was invincible.[LINKED_TEXT: [9]] [URL: #aHqRO] Even though he had so many feats, why is he not at third or second or first rank? Dronacharya had fair amounts of defeats in his life.He was defeated by Yudhisthira who was not such a powerful warrior on the 14th night. Dronacharya used a lot of celestial weapons on him but he couldn’t defeat him. Yudhisthira countered every weapon used by Drona. Drona had to abandon Yudhisthira. Dronacharya was defeated by Arjuna, Satyaki, Bhima etc. (3). Aswatthama The powerful Brahamana was among the most destructive warriors. His skills were almost untouched by any warrior except Karna, Dronacharya and Arjuna.His feats are enough to show his ultimate prowess as warrior. He fought mildly with the Pandavas till day 15 but showed his real strength after his father was killed.Aswatthama was only next to Karna on the 14th night. He was destroying all the rakshasas and almost defeated Ghatotkacha.He killed the demon son of Ghatotkacha, Anjanaparva. He killed an akshouni of nairritas who were a type of rakshasas. He overpowered and defeat Ghatotkacha various times.Here, Ghatotkacha was made chariotless and Dhristadyumna, Bhima arrived to assist him. This clearly indicates he was overpowering him. He made Ghatotkacha unconscious and almost kills him. He caused all the Pandava soldiers to run away. Such was his valour, that he killed an akshouhini of Ghatotkacha’s demons instantly. His Narayanastra on 15th day made all the Pandavas, soldiers and everyone surrender it. It can be named as a defeat for every Pandava including Arjuna etc. Even Aswatthama told that they were defeated. Such was the power of that weapon, that it slayed an akshouhini of soldiers.Aswatthama then became enraged and defeated Dhristadyumna and Satyaki. Aswatthama even defeated Bhima even though Bhima had attacked him in a group. Even, the Agneyastra weapon of Aswatthama killed an akshouhini of soldiers. It had to be countered by Arjuna’s Brahmastra. I have already given you information about Aswatthama’s destructive power. He killed 4 akshouhinis which are proved by me. Other than these, he might have killed 1 more. A total of 5–6 akshouhinis were destroyed by Aswatthama alone.His Valour on the last day was immense. He killed all the remaining soldiers of Pandavas. He killed the Upapandavas, Dhristadyumna and Shikhandi in fierce fights. Lord Shiva himself had entered his body. Such was his prowess that Shri Krishna had to take Arjuna, Satyaki and other 4 Pandavas away from the camp that night. He is not ranked above because Karna and Arjuna were better than him. (2). Karna The mighty son of Surya was very powerful and was the best in Kauravas. His feats are enough to describe his prowess as a warrior.His performance in the Rangabhoomi was better than Arjuna according to Yudhisthira.He defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling match in a short time.He defeated all the kings in the Swayamvara of Kalinga Princess. They included powerful kings like Rukmi, Jarasandha etc.He defeated Satyaki various no. of times in the Kurukshetra war.He defeated Bhima 9–10 times and even spared his life once.He defeated Nakula, Yudhisthira and Sahadeva and spared their lives.He defeated a lot of group attacks which were done on him. He was the best when it came to countering group attacks.He defeated every major Pandava warrior except Arjuna in the Kurukshetra war (directly).He indirectly defeated Arjuna when he had used his Bhargavastra. Arjuna accepted his incapablity to counter it. Why is he not ranked above Arjuna? You will get all the information regarding this ahead. (1). Arjuna The mighty son of Indra was the most powerful warrior of Mahabharata. His skills were unmatched. He had no one equal to him in archery except Krishna and Balarama. His feats bear testimony to his strength.He killed 30 million Nivatakavacha demons using his powerful celestial weapons.He killed 1 million Gandharvas using his agneyastra.He defeated all the major Kuru warriors in th Virata War singlehandedly which included Karna, Aswatthama, Bhishma, Dronacharya, Duryodhana etc.In the Kurukshetra war, he was just at his best.He defeated Dronacharya various number of times.He defeated Bhishma a lot of times.He killed important warriors of Kauravas including Shrutayu, Shrutayudha, Bhagadatta etc. He was among those who caused the greatest carnage and destruction.He killed 7 akshouhini army on day 14th itself. Such was his prowess that he was almost incvincible that day and was only defeated by Dronacharya.He also defeated an angry Aswatthama on day 15. This feat was very difficult to accomplish as Aswatthama had already defeated Bhima, Satyaki, Dhristadyumna etc. Apart from this he had various feats which bear testimony to his strength. Now why is Arjuna ranked above Karna? Read yourself. I will provide all proofs from authentic versions. If you have any complaint, tell me in comments. Please don’t downvote or mass report. I have mentioned everything as it was given in the texts. Encounters between Karna and Arjuna. Arjuna alone managed to defeat Karna 4 times in the Virata battle. Contrary to the popular belief, Lord Hanumana was not protecting the chariot of Arjuna as the use of divine weapons was limited or very less in that battle. That battle was more about killing the charioteers or making them retreat. Arjuna managed to do that 4 times. Arjuna first defeated Karna when both of them were alone. Karna retreated after getting humiliated . [LINKED_TEXT: [10]] [URL: #VTLPq] This repeated once again when Karna came back after sometime.[LINKED_TEXT: [11]] [URL: #aStXP] Later Karna attacked in groups only to be defeated twice by the strength of Arjuna’s celestial weapons. First time, he defeated them with an Aindrastra [LINKED_TEXT: [12]] [URL: #HJolU] and the second time he defeated them with his sammohana weapon.[LINKED_TEXT: [13]] [URL: #fFIPx]They never faced in a full fledged combat in the Kurukshetra war except the last battle. Other that these Karna was defeated by Arjuna twice on the 14th day where he was saved both the times by Aswatthama. 1st defeat of Karna of 14th day. Drona’s son, Aswatthama saved Karna here by severing Arjuna’s arrow. In that battle, the mighty-armed Phalguna struck Vaikartana Karna with one hundred arrows that penetrated all the inner organs. The powerful son of a suta had blood flowing from all his limbs. However, the brave one pierced Phalguna back with fifty arrows. On witnessing his dexterity in battle, Arjuna could not tolerate it. The brave Partha Dhananjaya severed his bow and quickly struck him between the breasts with nine arrows. It was a time when speed was of the essence. Wishing to kill him in the battle, Dhananjaya then quickly shot an arrow that was as radiant as the sun. But as that arrow descended forcefully, Drona’s son severed it with a sharp arrow that was in the shape of a half- moon. Severed, it fell down on the ground. [LINKED_TEXT: [14]] [URL: #ZXMDq]2nd defeat of Karna by Arjuna of 14th day is mentioned in the same link which I have provided as a footnote for the above one. In this one, Karna was made chariotless by Arjuna and Aswatthama saved him. O king! At this time, on witnessing Karna’s valour, he drew his bow back up to his ears and dispatched Karna’s four horses to the land of the dead with four supreme arrows. With another broad-headed arrow, he brought down his charioteer from the seat of the chariot. While your son looked on, he covered him with arrows. In that encounter, he was thus shrouded. His horses were slain. His charioteer was killed. Confounded by that net of arrows, he did not know what he should do. O great king! On seeing that he was without a chariot, Ashvatthama took him on his own chariot and continued to fight with Arjuna. [LINKED_TEXT: [15]] [URL: #XhtIJ]Other than this, Karna was also defeated by Arjuna when Kripacharya saved Karna and took him on his own chariot. Sanjaya continued, 'Beholding the son of Pandu rushing towards him like an elephant towards a rival elephant, Karna fearlessly proceeded against Dhananjaya. Partha, however, soon covered Karna who was thus advancing with great impetuosity, with showers of straight shafts, equipped with wings of gold. Karna also covered Vijaya with his shafts. The son of Pandu then once more shrouded Karna with clouds of arrows. Then Karna, filled with rage, pierced Arjuna with three shafts. The mighty car-warrior, Arjuna, beholding Karna's lightness of hand, could not brook it. That scorcher of foes shot at the Suta's son thirty straight shafts, whetted on stone and equipped with blazing points. Endued with great might and energy, he also pierced him, in rage, with another long arrow on the wrist of his left arm, smiling the while. Karna's bow then dropped from that arm of his, which had thus been pierced with great force. Then the mighty Karna, taking up that bow within the twinkling of an eye, once more covered Phalguna with clouds of shafts, displaying great lightness of hard. Dhananjaya then, O Bharata, smiling the while, baffled with his own shafts, that arrowy shower shot by the Suta's son. Approaching each other, those two great bowmen, desirous of counteracting each other's feats, continued to cover each other with showers of shafts. The battle that took place between them, viz., Karna and the son of Pandu, became exceedingly wonderful, like that between the two wild elephants for the sake of a she-elephant in her season. Then the mighty bowman Partha, beholding Karna's prowess, quickly cut of the latter's bow at the handle. And he also despatched the four steeds of the Suta's son to Yama's abode with a number of broad-headed shafts. And that scorcher of foes also cut off from the trunk the head of Karna's driver. Then, the son of Pandu and Pritha pierced the bowless, the steedless, and the driverless Karna with four shafts. Then that bull among men Karna, afflicted with those shafts, specially jumping down from that steedless car, mounted upon that of Kripa. Beholding the son of Radha vanquished, thy, warriors, O bull of Bharata's race, fled away in all. [LINKED_TEXT: [16]] [URL: #jxxvD]Karna was killed by Arjuna on day 17th. The battle was not dominated by Karna , it has been removed as an interpolation by BORI CE. He managed to break the string of Gandiva just once and not 11 times. He just overpowered him on 1 Instance. Whereas, Arjuna overpowered Karna most of the time in that battle.[LINKED_TEXT: [17]] [URL: #FvvjG] I have tried to answer your question in the best way I could. My appeal to all those who read the answer is to accept the facts as it is and comment and tell me if I have given wrong information. Please don’t downvote and report to collapse this one. I have consumed 2 hours everyday from last 3–4 days for writing this answer. To answer your question in short, Arjuna was the most powerful warrior except Shri Krishna and Shri Balarama Ji. My answer is based on authentic versions of Mahabharata which are KMG and BORI CE. Footnotes are provided using KMG Mahabharata.

Does this mean Node.is is inevitable or will keep growing forever? No, plenty of other technologies are growing too. Within a few years WASM stacks as a front end (and even as lightweight powerful portable containerisation alternative) will be big, reducing the need for every full stack app to have a JavaScript front end. Lots of people still consider native front ends worth taking the time to develop separately for each platform. Flutter still exists. Plenty of technologies exist that allow the developer to avoid thinking about JavaScript as much as possible by transpiling some completely different language into JavaScript and so keep back and front end in the same language that way, enabling a whole different set of advantages (eg Clojure and ClojureScript). Sometimes a really great back end is worth keeping even if it restricts some of the front end optimisation that is possible, and while many people really like what’s possible with full stack JavaScript, lots of people hate the idea of full stack JavaScript. So, yes it will, but it’s not the only trend that is happening. It’s pretty much taking over any other use of Javascipt server side/middleware and that’s not everything."},{"instruction":"'s said that the Hidden Bible Code says the rapture is in 2021.

There are picky eaters all around. We all have things we like and dislike. But, I believe most of us who were raised in France heard our parents say: try. At least 1, 2 or 3 bites. I remember my mother lovingly frying lamb brain in a pan. I do not like the texture of it. I had to try it in 3 different meals before she finally gave up. That is gross. If I still cannot eat lamb brain (marshmallow cooked on a fire has the same texture, but sweet instead of salty), I enjoy now asparagus, mussels, fish, cauliflower, lettuce, and all kind of fruits and vegetables. It opened my mind and mouth on all cuisines around the world. My digestive system still has a hard time with beans but it is getting there. I did the same with My daughter : she had to sit at the table to eat her meals and use proper manners. It means use a knife and a fork, have a napkin, wait for the others to finish their dish before the next one, stay sitted until the end of the meal, help setting up and clearing the table… normal stuff for French, Harder for her American cousins.

But I’ll assume for the purpose of your hypothetical that he only encountered women in the group portion of the interview (if there was one), or he was hired at a lower level (so, not so many interviewers) and they all happened to be male. Since I am female and you’ve said I’m his boss, I assume he enlisted a companion to join us for the meeting where he informed me he refuses to have individual meetings with myself or any other woman. I would get HR involved before proceeding further. We would need to understand whether this was due to a religious belief or mental illness (which would count as a disability). Either might trigger consideration of whether we could make accommodations for him. A corporation is expected to look for reasonable accommodations for religious reasons or disabilities, meaning, we would try to find a job for him which allowed him to contribute successfully to our company, but we are not obligated to keep him as an employee if he cannot contribute even with accommodations. (I’m not an HR person, so my description is not precise, but I think the gist is correct.). Whether we could accommodate him would depend on things like how large our company is (could we find him a male boss who needs someone to do a job he’s qualified for?), whether there are jobs which are very solitary (since we could not have him in a client-facing role, or one where he interacted with other people in the office besides his boss, since invariably there would be times he would need to meet with women). If there’s a role where he is giving support only over the phone or online to a different office, we could check whether he is comfortable interacting with women in that way. If there are no appropriate roles, I expect the decision would be made to fire him. That decision would be made by HR, not by me. If he said it wasn’t a religious belief or mental illness, then the solution would be simple. He would be fired."},{"instruction":"Did a landlord ever offer to lower your rent so that you wouldn't leave?","output":"no but it does happen"},{"instruction":"investing in cryptocurrency still profitable?","output":"The answer to this question depends on your individual goals and risk tolerance.

Here it is: The piano produces tone by percussion. You press a key, a hammer hits a string once, the tone rings out then begins to decay immediately as you hold down the key. You create sustain effects with the pedal, the volume and length of decay are determined by how hard you strike the keys. You can overlap chords and produce legato lines through the expressiveness of controlled decay. The organ produces tone by wind effect. You press a key, a stopper opens allowing air to flow past a reed or pipe whistle, the tone continues at the same volume as long as you hold the key down, then stops immediately when you release the key. Key pressure is irrelevant, and volume is controlled by how hard the bellows are being pumped. Sustain effects on the organ can only be created by continuing to hold down the desired keys, so changing smoothly from one chord to another is the exact opposite of playing the piano. On piano, you can lift your hands off the keyboard while the pedal sustains your previous chord until you’re ready to replace it with another. On organ, as soon as you lift any finger, that tone stops, so moving smoothly between chords requires keeping common tones in play while changing others subtly, or even one note at a time, but always playing something, which can lead to some gnarly, un-piano-like fingering situations. I started to think of it like playing music backwards, pulling sound through and out of the organ, rather than hitting the strings of the piano for percussion effects."},{"instruction":"What's your review of Amazon Prime's Farzi?","output":"It was an amazing experience and worth watching. FARZI (Prime video) Raj & DK are the new age directors. They know what the audiences want on OTT platform. Their best work is that how nicely they blend humor in such tense situations and other is their writing. I like that one quote of the legendary filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock- While in Bollywood they say entertainment, but it was for the past, now audiences don’t want such stories and on OTT not at all. I loved that how deeply they researched about the currency notes and system of RBI. Learned a lot of things from the series. I was just curious how much fake money did they print for the web series LOL. CAST- I mean it’s very difficult to select who was the best character in the series, every character was so well written. The three leads Shahid, KK, Vijay Sethupati are powerhouses of talent. Even Sunny’s friend Firoz played by Bhuvan Arora has shined in his performance. Raashi Khanna played her role well. Still if I had to choose my favorite, I would go with the minister Gehlot 😂😂. The duo of Gehlot and Sethupathi deserves a separate show. Both uses each other for their own advantage and their conversation entertained me a lot. DIALOGUES- I think we must forgive Hussain Dalal (who wrote dialogues for Brahmastra) and now it’s time to praise him. Dialogues were on point. Especially of Sethupathi and KK Menon. Not to forget the abusive words which gave a laughter ride. STORY & WRITING- As I said earlier, Raj & DK they keep their basics on point. All the characters were given layers, be it Sunny who was frustrated from his middle-class life, Michael who sacrificed his married life for his job, Mansoor Dalal who wants power but has to work under officials. MUSIC & CINEMATOGRAPHY- I think the songs and bgm could’ve been improved yes, it is good but could’ve been better. Cinematography was awesome, and few longs shots which are signature style of Raj & DK. HUMOR- The highlight of the series. Raj & DK knows how to play with the humor. Dialogues were apt, delivery was perfect. Kudos to the casting director who chose Vijay Sethupati, I just love his Hindi dialogues. Ending was done in such a way that it’ll keep the curiosity alive until the next season comes up. Now stakes have gone bigger, Sunny will take revenge, he’s on rampage mode. Good to know that they’ve made a cinematic universe of their own. Second season will take a lot of time because before that Family Man will have its 3rd season and the directors are busy in making other web-shows. (Citadel India and Guns aur Gulab). Highly recommended and I saw this series with my family, it has bad words, but my mom can manage it, otherwise there’s no vulgar scenes.

GRE coaching is essential for those candidates who wish to crack it in the first attempt itself. There are certain things, which you need to consider before choosing the GRE coaching classes and some of them are listed below: Find a well-qualified GRE tutor Make sure that your GRE tutor is highly-qualified before taking admission in any GRE institutes. It is good to ask them directly about their qualifications and certifications to become a GRE trainer. Make sure that your GRE tutor is qualified enough to teach you every GRE sections. It will be good if the tutor had qualified for GRE or is a graduate from any of the foreign universities. Experience of the GRE coaching center GRE teachers with experience in teaching various GRE subjects would be an excellent choice if you are aiming to crack the exam in the first attempt. However, you may also consider hiring a GRE trainer from your city or country, to help you understand and learn the basics of all the GRE sections. If possible check out GRE teaching videos of the trainer, to gauge whether she would be a great hire for your GRE training requirements. The personality of the GRE trainer The personality of the tutor is as important as that of experience and qualification. Learning all the GRE sections would require great lesson plans. Ask the GRE trainer or institute about the lesson plans they offer for your course or level. It’s even OK to ask if the trainer has a proper timetable of his teaching plans. Student’s opinion While you search for n GRE trainer or training center, always check out reviews posted by previous or existing learners. Reviews will tell you how good a GRE trainer would be and what are his areas of expertise in teaching each GRE subjects. If the majority of the learners have posted positive reviews about the GRE coaching institute or tutor, and he seems to be a perfect hire for you, then go for it. A word of caution here, there are maybe proxy reviews so check the genuineness of the reviews. Location and fees structure Take some time and do a little research on GRE tutors around you. Don’t hesitate to choose those GRE trainers who are far away from your city and provides good training. Find out their fees structures and compare them with others. Some of them may be charging heavy fees and are really bad at training. So, better watch out for such GRE institutes and always make the right decision."},{"instruction":"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982) worth watching if you found Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) to be plodding and maddeningly slowpaced?","output":"Yes, an overwhelmingly yes.

It was the fourth time that week we heard the same announcement, and it surely wasn’t the last time—there were still two assessments next week. We had three assessments, each with two parts to take; each was a two-hour test daily, with no breaks. Each determined if we graduated. Students as young as third grade are made to take anywhere between two and three standardized assessments yearly across many of the 50 States—Assessments that are each two-hours and emphasized heavily. Test performance is now tied to both school funding, and the evaluation of teachers and administrators [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #JWpWL]We were told a flurry of things about these assessments- PSSA’s and Keystones here in Pennsylvania—including we had to do well, else we risked our teacher being fired. Tell that to a room of 8- and 9-year olds and tell me you don’t expect some of them to feel pressured to perform well. Teachers in the Science, Mathematics, and Literature domains are forced to follow a highly specific set of classroom guidelines; they are forced to have school administrators change their classroom structure to get better scores per assessment. These assessments are spoken about for the entirety of the courses containing them; they are emphasized and it is required to pass these tests in some districts. Not only that, but it is also translating to in the classroom issues amongst students as well. These assessments encompass the SAT and ACT, otherwise known as College-Readiness Exams…which determine what colleges you can and cannot go to in many circumstances. In the classroom, students are suffering from more and more stress as a result of these exams. Many of them determine the course placements, ignoring outside forces influencing scores. Additionally, they are starting this routine of testing from far too young of an age. In a report from the Center for American Progress, Lazarín (2014) found that students in grades 3 through 8, as compared with students in earlier and later grades, spend the most time on testing during the school year, averaging around 15 to 16 hours. On average, students in grades 3 through 8 are taking 10 exams throughout the school year, as compared to around 6 exams for students in grades K-2 and 9-12 (Lazarín, 2014). In part because of state-mandated summative tests, many districts have imposed additional testing requirements, including “interim” or 3 “benchmark” assessments, which contribute to the time students spend testing each year. In many cases, these district assessments require more time than state testing (Lazarín, 2014). [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #HnNLy]Kids that young should not be taking that number of high stakes assessments, yet it happens every single year. Imagine, Anna is in ninth grade, her sister Bella is in third. Bella is spending the entire month of March it seems coming home with test preparation packets to complete. Her Easter break is riddled with nerves their mother must help calm. Anna is in three advanced courses, in English, Biology, and Algebra. Anna must take a state-mandated assessment in all three of those areas that year and on consecutive days. She isn’t given a break beside the weekend. Both girls spend their Easter stressing—Bella because these assessments are said to determine her classroom placement the following year, and Anna because these assessments determine if she is allowed to graduate with her class. Neither can do anything but worry, despite your reassurance because of the pressure placed on them to succeed. And the teachers aren’t the ones placing pressure on these students—it's the administration telling teachers to. This happens countless times a year per state, maybe not exactly but closely. Yet, nothing is done about it. The number of Standardized State Mandated Testing I, myself, have taken since I stepped foot in third-grade tallies to be near 17, not including my Benchmark assessments as there have been far too many to count. To date, I have taken the PSAT and the SAT each once, with the intent to take the ACT in February. That’s a total of at least 20 Standardized Assessments since I turned 8; a total of 20 in 8 years. If that’s not excessive, I don’t know what is. What’s wrong with the Current Education System here in the states? My worth has boiled down to a number in school. Whether it’s my student ID or my test score results, I’m nothing more than a number to my administrators. They stopped seeing my peers and me as students, as people, and changed to seeing as numbers. We are nothing more than a statistic to them, and it’s saddening. Some teachers see us as people, yet some still see us as an oppurtunity for a pay raise if they just get us to excel on those ruddy tests. In my opinion, the standardized tests have little by little devalued the current education system, and to the extreme of students no longer being students but mere numbers.

Here are a few: Standardized testing: The emphasis on standardized testing is often criticized for placing too much importance on test scores and limiting the ability of teachers to teach creatively.Funding disparities: The way schools are funded in the US often leads to significant disparities between wealthy and poor areas. This can result in underfunded schools in low-income areas, which can lead to a lower quality of education for those students.Lack of focus on practical skills: Many argue that the current education system does not do enough to prepare students for real-world challenges and the job market. There is often a lack of focus on practical skills like financial literacy, critical thinking, and problem-solving.College affordability: The cost of college in the US has been rising rapidly and has led to a significant amount of student debt. This can make it difficult for students from lower-income families to pursue higher education and can limit their opportunities later in life.Teacher shortages and low pay: There is a growing shortage of teachers in many areas of the US, and many teachers are paid relatively low salaries compared to other professions. This can make it difficult to attract and retain high-quality teachers, which can negatively impact the quality of education that students receive.

After all, a mathematician’s inherent ability to project which cards would appear on say…a blackjack table…means they could predict the outcome with reasonable certainty, right? It’s called counting cards. And it’s perfectly legal. In fact, there are many documented incidents where either individuals or groups have employed card-counting to bankroll thousands of casino dollars! I have a niece who does this very thing. Tagging along while her husband played blackjack, she grew weary of watching him piss away their retirement. And as she sat and watched the carnage, it occurred to her that every deck has a predetermined number of cards - 4 suits & 13 ranks. It didn’t take her long to deduct that, if there are 4 aces in each deck of cards, all one needed to know was how many decks were in play to get the total number of aces. And, of course, if this worked for aces it would work for the other ranks as well. Utilizing this method, she almost never loses. The fact that she’s a rather frumpy-looking gal with kids in tow keeps her under the radar. The guys at the table rarely give her a second glance...until she starts winning. And make no mistake: my niece clears more in a night than most of us earn in a week. Not a bad side job, if ya ask me. As she so eloquently expressed: “I don’t have a gambling problem. It’s only a problem if I’m losing!” Hard to argue with logic like that! But let me be clear: counting cards isn’t easy. If it was, we’d all be doing it. It also warrants saying that casinos are usually privately owned - which means they can refuse service to anybody at any time. When they discover someone draining their bankroll, they simply ask them to leave & not come back. But my niece isn’t stupid. She doesn’t mess with the big boys. She sticks with local tournaments where the people - and the venue - is always changing.

A Socialist government means a a system where govt appropriates all resources and then distributes it amongst citizens. Although in theory it seems like a ideal system, but it is not. Appropriation of resources by govt means there is no initiative for citizens to produce effectively. Many laws like MRTP and many other similar laws actually punished efficiency. Distribution of resources by govt means a system where citizens look up to government for its needs, they know that govt will provide for it. This system of patronage might work some time till govt officials are honest and ideal. But over a long period it is not easy to find committed, honest persons for such a system. This is basis of corruption as everything is with government and its allocation is decided by people who might start to profit themselves. This is the primary reason as to why this type of government has failed nearly every where. In India corruption is seen in areas where there is govt monopoly or overwhelming control, telecom, coal, defence etc. USA has nearly always favored private enterprise and rewarded private initiative. The government is present in areas like infrastructure and basic utilities and does not involve itself in running commercial enterprises. As the govt is not present in large number of areas, corruption is lesser."},{"instruction":"w can we hold the government more accountable for decisions that benefit corporations at the expense of the American people?

That is exactly why the EC is in place, to prevent the population centers from choosing the president and the rest of the country having no voice. The polls were way off because so many people either choose not to participate in or were not available for polls. People came out of the woodwork to vote for Trump and unless the Democrats can get a viable candidate to run against him they will do it again and he will get 4 more years.

These videos exist to generate ad revenue. There is no other motivation or purpose to them, so they eschew all usual standards of honesty and lie outrageously. The more outrageous the fraudulent claims the greater the clicks and the greater the ad revenue. The way the system on YT is set up encourages nonsense and it really has been a race to the bottom with a plethora of bullshit videos on such stuff as the flat earth and relatively few genuinely educational and informative ones.

At the time I was an analyst in the Project Controls group for Power Plant Construction. There was a women in our group that was pretty dynamic. She was the let’s-stop-talking-about-it-get-it-done type person. A little pushy but I appreciated her attitude. But on rare occasions she let her list of successes go a little to her head. We were in a meeting discussing approaches to track cost productivity on a group of small projects (Plant Improvement Projects). She threw out an algorithm we should use to arrive at sophisticated projections of final project costs. My ears perked up and I said, “That won’t work.” Sometimes she got a little huffy if challenged. She then said that she used this before and it indeed will work. “In fact, John (our manager) would agree with me.” I stood and put up examples on the white board showing the fallacy of her process. She then stood and said, “Apparently you aren’t used to working with this kind of sophisticated process. I am going to get John!” She then stormed out. A few moments she walked in with our Manager. She immediately started explaining her algorithm and how it should be applied with PIP projects. John nodded sagely and asked, “So what’s the problem?” She pointed at me and said that I refused to buy into it. John asked, “Why?” I went to the white board and gave a simplistic explanation on why my alternate equation would work and hers wouldn’t. She grinned broadly as if it was obvious that I didn’t know what I was talking about. John said, “Actually, Jerry is precisely right. I guess I should point out that Jerry developed this idea a couple of years ago and tried it twice of groups of small projects. The results was just about dead on.” Her chin dropped. She was so sure of herself and so it should have been obvious that our manager would agree. She dropped in her chair and didn’t say anything else. Later I sat down with her over cups of coffee. “Why didn’t you say so instead of humiliating me that way?” I told her that she needed the opportunity to present her ideas. The only problem was she wouldn’t entertain any alternate views. Then she pushed it over the edge by involving our boss. She sort of humiliated herself. I finished by saying, “But — I am your champion. You plow through the full you get stuff done. Just be careful. Sometimes it is cool to dial it back a little.” Three years later when I became manager she was the first person I grabbed to be in my department."},{"instruction":"You are having a big argument with your spouse.

Most of the people are watching and remembering this movie just because it is last known movie in which our beloved Sushant Singh Rajput has made his onscreen presence. But the movie itself is pure class and takes you on an emotional roller coaster ride. The movie is told from the point of view of Kizzie Basu (played by Sanjana Sanghvi) who is struggling with thyroid cancer and has very few friends to boast off. The actual fun begins when we see Manny (played by Sushant Singh Rajput) dancing to the tune of title song. The moves leave you in awe and the song itself is master piece composed by our very own A.R.Rahman. The whole song was a single take and damn Sushant is amazing. Manny is a lively personality who believes in living life to the fullest despite the inevitable circumstances facing death. The chemistry between Manny and Kizzie is superb and you admire the way two banter and how that turns into love. The little moments of flirting, romance and selfless care dramatically folds you and you are left in tears by the end. You admire the way Manny does everything to fulfill one dream of Kizzie despite all the odds. That’s what life is all about – what difference you can make in others life. The short span of happiness soon turns into sorrow as both are found struggling to stay alive with cancer. Sushant as Manny is a performance you will remember for a long long time. Dialogues, acting and powerful dance moves all compliment his lovely smile. Would have been great if he could hear all the praise he is getting and the difference he has made with his short but fruitful career on this Bollywood world. Sanjana Sanghvi compliments well and she surely has a great future ahead. A perfect blend of beauty with acting. Sahil Vaid as Manny’s friend is great and equally comical. Saif Ali Khan has played a small yet a role which gives a valuable lesson. Mukhesh Chhabra has been sublime with his direction and casting – Sushant being the proof. The songs are damn good and each song has a different persona and charm with ‘Dil Bechara’ title track and ‘Main Tumhara’ being the best. The dialogues are one of the best you have come through in recent times. The movie is of short duration and the emotional impact is a lot to take. Few scenes are worth remembering like the ones where Manny is listening to his own Eulogy. The movie if released in theatres would have created havoc. The movie is sure to leave you in tears and the fact that Sushant is no more with us impacts you more. A star was lost too soon. The movie is streaming free on Hotstar and a great gesture by them to make it available to everyone in memory of Sushant Singh Rajput. Grab you popcorn and tissues as well, because this one is sure to touch your heart and soul like no other movie. \\"Perhaps, the difference between what is miserable, and that, which is spectacular, lies in the leap of faith\\"- Sushant Singh Rajput For detailed review of this movie and other movies and books, follows us on our blog.

We gave them planes, tanks, ships, intelligence support, supplies, convoys of material and other equipment. They did not fight beside us and the other Allies, why did this happen?","output":"The Soviets were fully committed against the Germans. As other responses have said, both sides suffered huge numbers of casualties, mostly due to the massive scale of the Eastern front and the large Soviet manpower reserves. Another reason the western and soviet forces didn’t fight side by side is the lack of access to each front. The only way to get resources to Russia is either through the far north, or the Far East (Vladivostok). Even then, the materiel would have to travel large distances to get there, and it would generally be a logistical nightmare."},{"instruction":"w do I get my neighbor to accept the survey staking of our shared property line that is in dispute?

I can honestly say its the best money I ever spent. Compare it to the cost of a college education except instead of learning how to earn a living doing what everyone else in a given industry does, you're learning how to earn a fortune. I am of course making the assumption that you're looking to learn about publishing books or marketing books or something similar given the category the question is listed in. Online courses and coaching do several things to improve your outcomes in any arena: Teach you new information that would be unavailable or very costly to acquire in terms of time elsewhere Help you avoid mistakes which cost money and time Give you a structure for learning and staying committed to making important changes and improvements All that said, there are some bad courses and poor coaches out there - so you may hear horror stories or find yourself in such a situation. I suggest asking for a refund if you feel ripped off or were misled by false advertising or promises unkept. But don't let the risk of a bad course or coach stop you, because the risk of not learning and improving is far, far greater than any minor financial investment."},{"instruction":"What NBA team has gone the longest without a championship?","output":"The late 50's to late 60's Lakers with Jerry West and Elgin Baylor."},{"instruction":"What happens when you get pulled over doing 100 mph?","output":"This has actually happened 3 times. Twice in my heavily modified 68 Z/28, once on a Harley police dresser. I could write a book about some of the shit I got into with the Camaro, so I'll try to make it short. The DUH story first. Very late at night on a 4 lane hwy. Headed home from a swap meet in the ATL., hauling ass. County pops up coming at me, took him a while to catch up. I had slowed way down, he finally catches up lights blazing. Said he thought he had the wrong bike, I couldn't have been going that fast on a dresser. I told him it must have been that crotch rocket that passed me a couple of minutes ago. DUH. Thanksgiving morning, mid 70's. I had broken up with the best looking wench in the 5 county metro area the night before. Spent all night crying in my whiskey. Was committed to family dinner in LIJ. Drank about a 1/2 pint in a glass of milk to get sobered up enough to drive. Got to the red light in Canton, ended up in a long line of cars being led by some drunk in a pickup going about 25 mph. Finally said screw this, cogged 1st and hit it. Passed about 10 cars, failed to notice GSP 2 cars behind me. Had gotten 2 or 3 miles up the road and saw a bullet with blue lights about a 1/2 mile behind me. Was stopped, out, and sitting on the fender when the trooper got there. He said it was a good thing I stopped, he had given up on catching me and was calling in a roadblock. I told him EVERYTHING, guess he felt sorry for me. Told me to be careful, have a nice dinner with my folks. Said he was never close enough to get a good radar reading, but it had broken a hundred. Wrote me a warning ticket and sent my sorry ass up the road. Same Camaro. Me and Paul sitting around getting wasted in the ATL, decided to take off for P.C. Somewhere this side of the FLa. line on a 2 lane country road making very good time. Had pased every car I ran up on, finally caught one running about as fast as me. Took a while to get enough of a sight line to pass him. Cogged 3rd and passed him. About the time I hit 4th saw a reflection in the woods. GSP. Damn. Same drill, was sitting on the fender when he got to me. Said he was running VASCAR, not radar, and the numbers were rolling so fast he thought he had picked up a plane passing over. Asked me why I was driving so fast, I told him I guessed I was in a hurry. Asked how much I had been drinking, told him nothing since we left the ATL. Said he was going to have to breath test me at the county jail, about 20 miles away. Asked me if Paul could drive. Paul got out and immediately rolled down the embankment. Trooper said well, Paul ain't drivin'. Said I could leave the car, might not be there when I got back. Said he could call Luther to bring a wrecker, but he'd be pissed at that time of the night, no tellin’ what he'd charge me. Or Homer could drive it. Hadn't noticed Homer sitting in the Troopers car. Homer gets out, big ol' country boy in overalls, no shirt, barefooted with tobacco juice running down his chin. I said if he can drive a stick I guess so. Trooper said stick was no problem, it was the automatics he couldn't figure out. Get to the jail, get frisked again, Trooper got pissed when he finds my Buck knife he'd missed. Homer gets out of my car, said damn, thats the fastest car I done ever drove. Passed breath test, got a ticket for like 60 in a 45 and was let go. Now the funny part. This car had a close ratio m22 rock crusher in it, would run half as fast in 1st as it would in 4th. 3rd gear ratio was close enough to 1st that you could actually start off in 3rd. Apparently Homer couldn't figure out my short throw race shifter. Paul told me Homer could only find 3rd and 4th. Laughed my ass off and drank another beer. Me and Dr. Hip were riding around in Doraville one afternoon and I thought I'd show him how I could bump it and get the front wheels 3 or 4 feet off the ground. Just as soon as I showed my ass popo comes over the hill. Same drill, sitting on the fender when he got there. D.ville LT. His first words were “boy, I can tell you what color your oil filter is\\". Busted. Said I shouldn't do that around here, if some of the local boys saw me they would want to race. Told me to be careful and git back to where I belonged. Thank you officer. Had one other oil filter incident on Old National Hwy. on a sunday afternoon. Got locked up on about 10 charges. Went to court, the judge said what is all this bullshit and tore up all the tickets and deposited them in the trash can.

The first is when I was in labor with my 2nd child. I waited as long as I could to go to the hospital. By the time I went in, I was very close to delivery. Now, I don’t know what this nurse’s problem was, but she didn’t even seem to believe I was in active labor. Maybe she’s seen a lot of false alarms? That still doesn’t excuse her. The first thing she did is ask me what I would rate my pain level. I said 7 or 8. Now, I have a very high pain tolerance, and so I may not have been acting in a way that someone else might. I have had 4 children and while in labor I remain calm, I don’t yell or scream, and I can generally speak and communicate through the pain, even with no medication. But this nurse just looked at me said “If you were at 7 or 8, you wouldn’t even be able to speak right now.” I was dumbfounded. What?? This nurse had the audacity to tell a woman in labor how much pain she WASN’T in??? She continued to ask me questions, and had a rather snotty attitude. No one had even checked me yet to see how soon I was going to deliver. I could feel the pressure of the baby starting to enter the birth canal, so I interrupted her and told her that the baby was coming out. She insisted that it wasn’t, and that I was faking it. She checked my cervix when I insisted and she told me I wasn’t even fully dilated. After some more questions I interrupted her again and told her THE BABY WAS COMING OUT AND I WAS PUSHING! She checked me again, and believe me, I have never seen a nurse FLY out of the room so fast. She was yelling for doctor down the hallway. The baby was crowning. No way in hell was my cervix was not fully dilated when I told her the first time. Baby continued to come out like she was on water slide. The doctor barely made it to the room. He was really upset that the nurse didn’t get him sooner. Someone let me know afterwards that the hospital was not keeping her, and the reason she went so fast out the door was that she would have had mountains of paperwork to do if I delivered without the doctor in the room. I still don’t know why she acted the way she did, but it was one of the worst experiences of my life."},{"instruction":"Time doesn't exist for a photon, but do sequences of events exist in a photon?","output":"No. A photon only “exists” at two points: where it is created and where it is destroyed.

Each Sprint provides a working increment of the product. So how do we decide what goes in a Sprint? Sprint Planning helps us in ascertaining this. Every Sprint begins with Sprint planning when the entire Scrum team gets together to agree on what needs to deliver in the Sprint (Sprint Goals). It is one of the vital Scrum events, and getting this right is crucial for necessary for the success of Sprint. Let’s discuss this in detail · What is Sprint Planning? · Timing for Sprint Planning · Who attends the Sprint Planning Meeting? What is Sprint Planning? [LINKED_TEXT: Sprint planning] [URL: https://www.toolsqa.com/agile/scrum/sprint-planning/] is an event in the [LINKED_TEXT: Scrum ] [URL: https://www.toolsqa.com/agile/scrum/what-is-scrum/]that initiates the [LINKED_TEXT: Sprint] [URL: https://www.toolsqa.com/agile/scrum/sprint/]. It’s the first event that happens during a Sprint. According to [LINKED_TEXT: Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint_planning], the main purpose of Sprint planning is to define the scope of delivery and how to accomplish that work. It sets up a common goal for the team, and everyone’s focus is to achieve that goal during the Sprint. Before we go any further, let’s review some terminology that we will be using in this article. I would recommend that you read our articles on Product Backlog and Sprint for more details. · Product Backlog – It’s a single source of requirements for everything needed in the product. It includes new features, changes to existing features, bug fixes, infrastructure setups, etc. · Story – It captures the description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. E.g., As a customer, I want to register on the website, so that I can browse the products on the site. Note that the Scrum doesn’t say that the requirements need to be in the story format. As per Scrum, you can have the requirements in any form, though the story is the most popular format to document requirements. Timing for Sprint Planning We timebox the Sprint Planning to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually quicker. As a thumb rule, we can multiply the number of weeks in your Sprint by two hours to get your total Sprint planning meeting length.

First we spoke to the kids about our expectations. Then we explained that there would be positive and negative consequences for the family rules. The “rules” were posted in the kitchen on a dry erase marker board so there could be no confusion. For example: Go to church on Sundays and youth group on Wednesdays and don’t cause any issues for one month. Negative Consequence: stay home while the family is eating out. Your meal will be peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Positive Consequence: go out to dinner as a family (we did have to set a dollar amount for what they could select from the menu). Restaurant was a mutual decision. Pick up your room and change your bedding by 8 PM on Saturday. The rest of the week they could just keep their door closed & we wouldn’t say anything about the condition of their room. Negative Consequence: maid service will cost you 1 per minute per item that has been pick up in the cleaning of your space. Out of place items were collected in a trash bag and held for ransom. Maid service did not include changing the bedding. When one of the boys was in his teens and working I had to pick up his room. It took me 18 minutes (I used a stop watch to keep track of the time). He came and said“Not bad for maid service”; handing me 18. He wanted to get his BK sneakers back. I handed him one shoe and reminded him that it was per item. Shoes = 2 items. Positive Consequence: receive extra money to purchase an item you want or need. Everyone of our teens drove a car that they chose to and from school & to work. We provided enough gas to get to and from school plus extra to get to jobs. They were responsible to take care of their cars. If they broke something; they were required to fix it & pay for their parts (with help). Drive your car & keep it clean, without any damages for one month or needing a rescue because you forgot to put in gas or locked your keys in the car. Negative Consequence: riding the bus to school and work until your car can be driven again. Second offense on locking the keys in the car; pay the locksmith. Positive Consequence: one paid car wash per month. Maintain your grades at school: Negative consequences: D’s reduced your positive consequences at 0.50 per D. Positive consequences: 1 for A’s, 0.75 for B’s, 0.25 for C’s. Do not cause issues with your teachers: Negative consequences: Ride the bus to school for the next semester. Positive Consequences: extra 2.00 per teacher who tells us how wonderful you are. One of our daughter’s made fun of her German teacher in front of the whole class, for speaking German with a Spanish accent. Her teacher was very hurt by this. So no car for an entire semester. Doing something against the rules: Negative consequence: you will be asked to think about what your consequence and give the parents what you think would be a fair consequence. Positive consequence: you have a great life with no restrictions The daughter that made fun of the German teacher, thought that it would be okay to take her car when she was suppose to be riding the bus. When it was discovered that she had done this she was asked to think about what her consequence should be. She came up with no phone at home for a month. This included no messages. So no incoming calls or outgoing calls. Her 9 year old brother really liked this one as he usually answered the phone at the house. Informing parents of where you are going & what you will be doing: Negative consequences: you are basically under house arrest for a reasonable amount of time - decided between parents and the offender. Positive consequences: you get to go places with your friends within reason. Take you dishes back to the kitchen after eating where you want in the house: Negative consequence: your dishes will be placed inside your bed. I would throw back the covers & put the dishes on the sheets; then put the covers over the top. Positive consequence: you get to sleep in a clean bed. There were other positive and negative consequences that we used and we found that our family life was quite peaceful…"},{"instruction":"Why do people from other countries think the USA’s healthcare system is so great?","output":"Nobody thinks that outside of the United States, the US healthcare system is a total unmitigated disaster of monstrous proportions."},{"instruction":"w do I earn with a CPA lead?","output":"Simple by promoting the others products.

People are saying that if 1 dollar becomes equal to a rupee, the companies will shut down and leave. well, no one wants that. but that could happen. now think, why do you purchase Coca Cola when its costlier than Indian Cold Drinks? its because of its Name in Market. and if like 1 Rupee becomes equal to 1 Dollar, it does not mean labor in India will be more costlier. yes it will be a bit more expensive but the salaries will automatically set itself to current economy. if a ER in India is earning 75k PM, it doesnt mean after 1 becomes 1 Rupee, the salary will be same and companies will have to pay amount equal to 75000 to them. if they are paying 3k in US then they will be paid same in India(theoretically). labor in india is not only cheaper because of Dollar Rate. it is also because of Population. yes, our population is too high that there is no limit in Skilled Labor. so due to high and easy availability of labor makes it cheaper. Why its not possible that just like currently, USSD is used to compare other currencies, in future Rupee becomes strong and then it will be used as a stranded. anything could happen. but for right now, lets just hope that does not happen. i would love 1 = 10 Rs. but not 1 Rs. = 60 right now. P.S.: our Govt is trying not to let that happen. so it is very difficult from our side. its only possible if there is Higher inflation in US than India while assuming, India’s Inflation rate remains same."},{"instruction":"Because of depression and not at all wanting to see my therapist for my appointment, I canceled. I’m exhausted with therapy although I have a good therapist, I feel I failed or can’t control my behavior so what’s the point. What to do?","output":"Depression is the result of you being coward to live in the presente moment. Be brave, live in the present moment, and depression will be gone. Depression is the result of you making a choice —mostly unconsciously— to live in the past. You think that the past is safer because you know it. But the past is gone, is memories, is death… and you end the same… death… depressed.Anxiety is the result of you making a choice —mostly unconsciously— to live in the future. You think that “If a get the new job I’ll be rich,” ”If she loves me, I’ll be happy.” But the future doesn’t exist yes, and you fear that you won’t be neither rich nor happy… and get anxious.To get rid of depression or anxiety make a new choice —that time consciousliy— to live in the present. To live in the present, feel your body. Your body is always in the present! The only thing that we have is the present. Past is gone, it’s memories; learn from it. Future is still to come; we don’t even know if we’ll be here when it comes. HOW TO HEAL: The first thing that you must do is clean up all the blocked emotions and stress that you have —we all have— in your heart. Those are like ‘coloured glasses’ that tint everything we see and feel. They are, also, the way our mind controls us.Then, you fill your heart with your own love, your own trust, and your own appreciation. You are the only one that can fill your heart. Nothing external will do. You’ll become responsible of your life and happiness.You find your inner place of peace and joy. And intuition is developed. You’ll know from deep inside yourself all the answers —and the questions!— that you need to know.To attain that, I use deep meditation. I use the Isha system. Deep meditation means to let your thoughts pass by and give guidance of your life to your heart. You become responsible of your life and happiness. You find your inner place of peace and joy. And develop intuition. Emotions are like water: if they flow, they are clear and healthy; if they stagnate, they root. If you totally block them —like a dam— then they most surely will explode.So, let them flow. Just choose the right place to do that. Never in the face of another person, just in a matrix or pillow. A wise person is the one that strives to achieve the perfect balance between mind, feelings, and will to become the best human being he/she can be. Only if you love yourself, trust yourself, and appreciate yourself... those are the foundations of self-worth and self-esteem... will you be able to really love another person and be loved.Remember that you learn to love by loving yourself; to trust in you is learned by trusting in you; to appreciate you is learned by appreciating you. Start small and soon you will see big changes. Praise, bless, thank everywhere, everyone, every time. It’s a change in your attitude toward life.

Here are some key points to consider: Potential for High Returns: Cryptocurrencies have a history of delivering significant returns, with some coins experiencing exponential growth. While past performance does not guarantee future results, the potential for substantial gains continues to attract investors.Diversification: Cryptocurrencies provide an opportunity to diversify your investment portfolio beyond traditional assets like stocks and bonds. By including cryptocurrencies, you can potentially reduce the overall risk and increase the potential for higher returns.Growing Institutional Adoption: Institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies has been steadily increasing, with major companies, financial institutions, and even governments showing interest and involvement. This increased institutional support can contribute to the legitimacy and stability of cryptocurrencies as an investment asset class.Technological Innovation: Cryptocurrencies are built on blockchain technology, which offers various benefits such as transparency, security, and efficiency. The ongoing development and innovation within the crypto space have the potential to disrupt traditional industries and create new opportunities for investors.Hedge Against Inflation: Inflationary concerns continue to linger, and cryptocurrencies are often considered as a potential hedge against inflation. Some cryptocurrencies have limited supplies, which can protect against the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation.Global Financial Inclusion: Cryptocurrencies enable financial inclusion by providing access to financial services for individuals who may not have had access to traditional banking systems. This increased accessibility can drive adoption and contribute to the growth of cryptocurrencies.Decentralization and Autonomy: Cryptocurrencies offer decentralization and autonomy, allowing individuals to have direct control over their funds without relying on intermediaries such as banks. This appeals to those seeking financial independence and a more inclusive financial system. Despite these potential advantages, Volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and security concerns are among the factors that should be carefully evaluated before investing.

For example, magazines, clips, assault rifles, assault guns, assault weapons, ARs, etc.","output":"Probably not. Not really, at least. It is a rather wide field, with plenty of jargon, which varies between different groups of people who deal with firearms, regionally and whatnot. The terms you mention are a pretty wild mix, some of them change meaning over time and context, some are used as shibboleths by certain communities… I'll try for an ideology-free, as matter-of-fact as possible approach to those terms you mention, here, nevertheless, while catching some of the more common ‘shibboleth’- type usages, and maybe providing some background on how they got there: Magazines: are, in a cartridge-using firearm-context, reusable contraptions more or less integral to the gun that keep multiple cartridges ready for immediate reloading and firing. They can beinternal magazines (like with most manually repeating firearms (an M1 Garand has an internal magazine, as do most semi-automatic rifles, almost all bolt-action guns, your run-of-the-mill lever action guns, most repeating shotguns, technically revolvers, etc.), ordetachable magazines. Like pretty much all modern semi-auto pistols and military rifles have. Usually a sort of spring-loaded box that gets loaded with cartridges beforehand, and is just dropped and replaced as needed. Or carefully retrieved when empty and reloaded and reused, under less dire circumstances. Clips are (in current parlance, anyway) contraptions used to hold a convenient number of cartridges for loading into a gun's magazine (internal or detachable) that is designed to be discarded after reloading your gun's magazine. Only there are plenty of corner cases. And historic use. The above-mentioned M1 Garand, for example, uses something called an en-bloc clip. In contrast to so-called stripper clips, it's designed to go into the gun with the cartridges, and provides some of the functionality of a magazine. An M1 can't easily (if at all) be loaded with multiple individual cartridges at once without a clip… Here's the first bullshit shibboleth: detachable magazines have been called ‘clips’ colloquially for ages. I've seen FBI instructional films from the sixties/seventies that referred to semiautomatic pistols’ detachable magazines as ‘clips’. And gun magazine articles (never mind everyday usage) going well into the late Nineties. At some point, it became fashionable amongst a certain sub-group of firearms enthusiasts to ridicule those who'd call a detachable box magazine a ‘clip’ as clueless.‘Assault rifle’ is another of those not-really-as-clear-cut-as-some-make-it-out terms. The most common definition today is ‘a relatively light-weight, select-fire (can fire single shots or fully-automatic, according to the position your fire selector is in), intermediate cartridge rifle with a large-ish detachable magazine’. Which is pretty much the original definition of the late WW2 German Sturmgewehr (of which assault rifle is the direct translation). Problem with that is that ‘intermediate cartridge’ meant different things to different people at different times, as did ‘light-weight’. Or ‘Sturmgewehr’, for what it's worth. The ‘shibboleth’ here? If you call anything that lacks full-auto or burst fire capability an ‘assault rifle’, a certain demographic of gun enthusiasts will decry you as clueless. In this case, maybe not entirely without merit.‘assault guns’ are a purely administrative/legal category that is at best loosely tied to actual technical properties of the firearms classed as such, as far as I can tell. Except in a military context, where assault gun refers to a type of self-propelled artillery/armoured fighting vehicle…As are ‘assault weapons’. Only that term doesn't have a military meaning I'm aware of.‘AR’, in a US-centric firearms context, almost universally refers to the AR15 platform. What would be considered one, again, depends on who you're talking to. Shibboleths abound. Basically, simplifying a bit for brevity, the AR15 was the semi-auto-only, civilian version of the M16 (or the other way around). After patents ran out, a veritable industry of civilian-US-market focused manufacturers of AR-15 type rifles developed. Some ‘inspired’ by the operating principles but pretty far off, many literally parts interchangeable. Most in the AR15/M16s native .223 Remington/5.56 NATO, some in all sorts of other calibres. What any individual will consider ‘an AR’ is very much down to individual preference. That there were, historically, a few other entries in the AR line of firearms developed by (simplifying a lot, again) Eugene Stoner for ARmalite corporation, the best known of which is the AR10, which was originally developed for the .30-06 cartridge, but then changed over to 7.62x51 NATO (.308 Winchester), and was more or less the direct antecessor of the AR15/M16, doesn't help simplify matters. Well, that's the quick brief, seriously simplified version of a brief on a teensy little part of firearms-related jargon. On the other hand: don't let the true believers and keyboard warriors drag you down. In civilised discourse, using words that have been (technically mis-) used that way for decades or centuries to discuss the matter doesn't mark you a clueless wanker. Your counterpart insisting you use what they perceive as correct terminology while understanding perfectly well what you're talking about does mark them as that, though."},{"instruction":"What are some arguments I can make to fight a fire hydrant ticket?

It is an holistic approach to health that focuses on the body, mind, and spirit. Ayurveda is known as an effective form of treatment for a variety of medical conditions, including diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood sugar levels. It is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as unhealthy eating habits, lack of exercise, and certain medications. Diabetes can lead to serious health complications if left untreated, such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Ayurveda aims to restore balance and harmony to the body, which is essential for proper functioning of the body’s systems. Ayurvedic treatment for diabetes involves a combination of lifestyle changes, herbal remedies, and dietary modifications. One of the most commonly prescribed ayurvedic remedies for diabetes is the use of herbal medicines. These are natural substances that are used to treat the symptoms and root causes of diabetes. The most common herbs used for diabetes management are: • Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia): This herb has been used for centuries to help lower blood sugar levels. It is believed to stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin, which helps the body to regulate sugar levels. • Gymnema sylvestre: This herb is known to help reduce sugar cravings and decrease cholesterol levels. It is also believed to help improve the production of insulin. • Turmeric (Curcuma longa): This herb has anti-inflammatory properties and is believed to help reduce blood sugar levels. • Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum): Fenugreek is believed to help improve insulin sensitivity, which can help with blood sugar control. • Amalaki (Emblica officinalis): This ayurvedic herb is known to help reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. In addition to herbal remedies, ayurveda recommends lifestyle modifications and dietary changes for diabetes management. These include: • Limiting carbohydrate intake: Eating a low-carbohydrate diet can help to control blood sugar levels. • Increasing physical activity: Regular exercise can help to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. • Avoiding processed and fried foods: Eating a diet that is high in fresh fruits and vegetables can help to improve overall health. • Limiting sugar intake: Eating too much sugar can cause blood sugar levels to spike. • Practicing yoga and meditation: These activities can help to reduce stress and improve overall health. Ayurveda is an ancient form of traditional medicine that has been used for centuries to treat a variety of medical conditions, including diabetes. Ayurvedic treatment focuses on restoring balance and harmony to the body through lifestyle modifications, herbal remedies, and dietary changes. While there is no cure for diabetes, ayurvedic herbs and lifestyle changes can be used to help manage the condition and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications.

It is about three times the height of Mount Everest and is still considered an active volcano.The planet Mars has the largest canyon in the solar system, called Valles Marineris. It is over 4,000 kilometers long and up to 7 kilometers deep in places.Mars has seasons similar to Earth's, but they last almost twice as long due to the planet's longer year.The atmosphere on Mars is very thin, about 100 times less dense than Earth's atmosphere.

However, there are some societal and cultural aspects that have been suggested as potential contributors to the higher rates of depression experienced by certain generations, such as millennials and Generation Z. Here are a few factors that have been commonly discussed: Increased pressure and competition: This generation has grown up in a highly competitive environment, with pressure to excel academically, professionally, and socially. The constant comparison through social media and the desire to meet societal expectations can lead to feelings of inadequacy, self-doubt, and low self-esteem.Economic challenges: Many individuals from this generation have faced economic difficulties, including student loan debt, a competitive job market, and financial instability. These challenges can lead to stress, anxiety, and a sense of hopelessness about the future, which can contribute to depression.Technological advancements and social media: While technology has brought numerous benefits, the constant connectivity and exposure to social media can have negative effects on mental health. The pressure to maintain an idealized image, cyberbullying, and the fear of missing out (FOMO) can all contribute to feelings of loneliness, isolation, and depression.Changing social structures and support systems: The traditional support systems, such as close-knit communities and extended families, have evolved over time. With more people moving away from their hometowns and increased reliance on virtual interactions, individuals may feel a lack of social support and belonging, which can contribute to depressive symptoms.Awareness and destigmatization: It's also worth considering that the increase in reported rates of depression could be influenced by greater awareness and reduced stigma surrounding mental health. As society becomes more open to discussing mental health issues, individuals may be more willing to seek help and share their experiences, leading to higher rates of diagnosis. It's important to recognize that these factors are not exhaustive, and individual experiences and circumstances can vary widely. Depression is a complex condition that can have various causes, including genetic predisposition, biological factors, traumatic experiences, and other personal factors. If you or someone you know is struggling with depression, it's crucial to encourage seeking professional help from mental health experts who can provide appropriate support and treatment"},{"instruction":"Which one would win, Spinosaurus or Deinosuchus?","output":"Boros 0.00001% >>>>>> Kaguya with Expansive Truth Seeking Ball"},{"instruction":"w would you handle a situation in business where an employee tells you they refuse to meet individually with a female or attend a business lunch with a female, because morally a married man should not meet 1 on 1 with a woman?","output":"Morally, thats a pretty uptight guy but as a business owner I wouldn't have my male employees or myself meet one on one with a female client outside of my office.

Biscuit, originally, would have referred to any type of hard, flat, and crisp bread, whether sweet or not.

Moreover, the hectic schedule of big cities will take up most of your time and you will get less time with you for your self study (which is the nitty-gritty of your preparation). Not making hand written notes.I have seen people sitting in class and listening to the instructor just like watching a movie. They do not make notes thinking that they will get the Xerox copy of someone with good handwriting or from some local photocopy shop. When you write your own notes you not only get involved in the ongoing class fully but when you revise them later you also remember the points which your instructor told you while teaching them. Love or hate toward a particular subject.You may have special interest in a particular subject but studying more than required will do no benefit. Similarly, devoting less time to a subject you find boring will cost you dearer. Getting diverted after 3–4 months.Lets say you start your preparation with all your heart and soul.

Revising more, practising less .If you revise your notes frequently, that is a good thing but just revising them and not practising numericals will be of no use.

For at least 8 years, most road racing teams have made the same choice. But, it depends a lot upon where you live and what kind of riding you do. Disc brakes have been widely used on mountain bikes for almost 20 years and cyclocross bikes for 15. For some time, they have been the default brake systems for virtually all racers and high end bikes in these disciplines. In those applications, disc brakes have marked and distinct advantages. Their chief advantage is that unlike rim brakes, discs are virtually impervious to mud ,dirt, and moisture and they have superior stopping power in loose or wet conditions. But for over 20 years, road racers and manufacturers have virtually ignored disc brakes for high end road bikes. And for good reasons, the benefits of disc brakes on the road traditionally don’t outweigh their negatives, including additional weight, complexity, and negative aerodynamics. Rim brakes are light, exceptionally easy to service, and can be streamlined into an aero frame. In a close group road race, any advantage to being able to stop faster than the bike on front of you is outweighed by the dangers of stopping faster than the following bike. Pelotons are wary of any hard braking, no less a mixed pack of discs and rims. If there is lots of climbing, historically you added more than a pound in weight with discs. If there is a crash or a flat, it’s easier to get back riding on a rim brake than lining up and straightening rotors. Disc brake bikes don’t travel as well in boxes or carry containers. So, assuming dry conditions and good roads, rim brakes give up little in stopping power for a lighter easier rim brake system. For the typical amateur or recreational rider, there is an incredible investment in rim brakes. Your old wheels become useless on a new disc brake bike, which means those upgrade wheels or hub power meter can’t be used. My wheels are worth far more than my current frame so I’d basically have to drop several thousand more to duplicate my current wheel sets. Even through axles will require me to change my racks or buy adapters to transport my bikes. If you are starting from scratch, that might not be a consideration, but if you are budget minded, you are going to see a lot of high end rim brake wheel sets going on sale, new and used, as the gear queers go chase the latest tech, and manufacturers start to sell their new high end bikes with discs. Until disc brakes start to get crazy light, you are still going to have weight weenies, climbers and time trialers choose rim brakes for the foreseeable future so it’s not like your rim brake bike is going to be obsolete within the next 5 years. Forget everything I said above if you generally ride in wet or muddy conditions. Discs are nice because you can run wider tires, which is nice in the wet. Discs offer clear advantages in stopping in the rain. If you’re gravel riding on loose surfaces, or commuting on harsh roads or traffic conditions, then discs are better. Also, forget what I said if you have a deep pocketbook, disc brakes are the future and jumping on board early should make it easier to upgrade in the more distant (5plus years) future. But the truth is that if money is no object, you’re going to buy a whole new bike in 5 years anyway. On the other hand, e-shifting is great if you ride in areas where you are constantly shifting. I’m in the middle of rolling hills, and I’m a spinner not a masher, I go up and down my 11 speed drivetrain on most of my home rides and e shifting is bullet proof. You can cross chain on an e-shift bike in a pinch and use every gear. It’s quieter and rarely needs adjustment since there are no cables to stretch. If you need to adjust it, it’s easy. Unlike discs, virtually every pro or racer above CAT 2 have made the switch for races. It’s dead on reliable. My buddy has mechanical DA while I’m riding Di2 Ultegra. I would never switch with him. I also ride at my vacation home on the flat New Jersey shore. There, I ride a vintage 1978 Masi GC with Campy Superrecord downtube friction shifters and ancient rim brakes. It has only a six speed straight block freewheel and most of the riding is in close large groups. Under those conditions, I would invest in neither disc brakes nor e-shifting. I’m not even convinced that there is any advantage to brake shifters or index shifting in that application. I use 3 gears per ride and if we climb 100 feet over 50 miles, it’s a lot. There, the steel frame and smooth tubulars are all I really need for an enjoyable ride. Friction shifting is super quiet because you can adjust your chain line perfectly. If I’m touching my brakes hard in a paceline, there is something wrong with me or my companions. Riding along in perfect quiet on a hand made steel frame on the flats is sublime. I wouldn’t ride the old Masi on the hilly roads near my home. I’d be miserable. So, the final answer for you should depend on what kind of riding you’re doing and where you ride. For rolling hills, I’d go e shift every day of the week. Wet rainy conditions, I might want discs. Flat dry conditions, who cares?"},{"instruction":"Magnesium and helium have zero electron affinity but calcium don’t. Why?","output":"Electron affinity is defined as the energy change that occurs when a neutral atom in the gas phase gains an electron to form a negatively charged ion. When an electron is added to an atom, it can either release energy or absorb energy, depending on the electronic structure of the atom. Atoms with a stable electronic configuration, such as the noble gases, tend to have a high ionization energy and zero or very low electron affinity, since they do not readily accept additional electrons. Magnesium and helium have full valence shells, and therefore they have stable electronic configurations. In the case of helium, it has a completely filled 1s subshell, so it has a very high ionization energy and zero electron affinity. Similarly, magnesium has a stable configuration with two valence electrons in the 3s orbital, which also results in zero electron affinity. Calcium, on the other hand, has two valence electrons in the 4s orbital, which is not completely filled. This makes it easier for calcium to accept an additional electron to form a stable ion with a noble gas configuration. Therefore, calcium has a non-zero electron affinity, unlike helium and magnesium."},{"instruction":"Why is there an exclamation mark on an empty battery icon and my Kindle paperwhite won't start?","output":"Thank you all for your answers & tips.

Under the dominate “the capital” was the emperor’s head. Wherever that head was was the capital city … or town … or camp … or tent. The court tended to follow the emperor around as much as possible. The bulk of it would at least hang out near wherever his long-term base camp was. Civil service administration was less mobile, but of necessity through much of the third century it operated out of Dalmatia/Illyria or Pannonia, most notably Sirmium — the primary HQ for the Roman Army for much of the 3rd Century and birthplace of 10 emperors — and then Salona & Split. Constantine did, however, aim at making Constantinople into the new Rome (the city, not the civilization and polity). He certainly succeeded in making it a 2nd one, complete with its own Forum, Senate, Comitium, and Circus Maximus/Hippodrome. What it did not have was pagan temples or Vestals virgins (married to Rome). There is some debate as to whether the new Senate house included an altar to Victory. And of course with Constantinople’s construction, it supplanted Sirmium and Split as well as Rome. But of course he didn’t change the name of the Empire. The Imperium Romanum had long since ceased to be a patchwork collection of foreign conquests under the despotism of Latium (the “country” of which Rome was the central city). It had become a multi-ethnic but basically mono-cultural nation (even if a cultural mulligan stew) of a people who were not only united under Roman law, but who were all “Romans” — i.e., Roman citizens. Indeed by the time Constantine founded Constantinople there hadn’t been an actual ROMAN emperor since Nerva (apart from 2 extremely short-lived 3rd Century emperors/usurpers who lasted 2 and 8 months respectively)."},{"instruction":"What are some good unknown destinations to travel in 2019?","output":"Congratulations on the most thoughtless question this week.

Many countries in Middle East also adopt Sharia law. Nobody bother by their way of governance except the USA-led West. Any law is just a way to control people. Let us discuss human nature. I study ancient civilizations. I find all cultures have creators. All creators made the same sun, rain, humans, animals, plants etc. It means it is the same creator. All humans are creator’s children. Creator gives us different wisdom. It means creator designed a diverse world. You use flour to bake cakes. I make noodles. Diff wisdom. Diversity. So there should be many cultures & religions in the world. Some spread their religion to other cultures & wipe out local religions. That is, they have damaged creator’s design of diversity. Yet they claim they love creator. They suppress the god-given wisdom of creator’s other children. They violate human right - indigenous people’s cultural right, according to article 8.2a in UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Yet they claim they love fellow humans ie creator’s children. UN says all gods & religions are equal. When China asks them not to propagate that theirs is the only true one, they cry religious suppression. China also asks them not to erect a big cross outside a building. Keep (small) crosses inside their private property. A cross was an old tool for criminals on death sentence. It damages local belief in Feng Shui. Again they cry religious suppression. Lesson learnt about human nature: Leaders work for POWER & MONEY. Love of creator is just a slogan to gather followers to build power. Followers take leader’s word as truth. Lack independent & critical thinking. Dismiss different views right away. Stay inside box. Another human nature: those who cry suppression are the ones who disrespect/suppress others, or break law. Bullies. Human nature applies to politics too: Different wisdom will develop different ways to govern a country. God of democracy calls for mutual respect & coexistence with the different. We don’t tell neighbors how to manage their home. Same for governance of a country. To force western values onto others that have diff situations & cultures is dictatorship. To leaders, democracy is just a slogan & tool to destabilize & control other countries. They worship god of human rights. Yet they kill tens of millions of fellow humans in democracy wars in the world. They worship god of freedom. Yet they don’t give others freedom to have their way of governance according to their situation. Why religion & politics are the same thing? Because it is the same human nature. Just diff slogans. Followers give up their freedom of thought to their leader+media. Our brain controls our speech & action. It means followers have given up all freedoms. As a puppet, they repeat the words of leader+media and do what leader+media want them to do. If a leader+media do harm to humanity, followers are accomplices. B Clinton started globalization. For cheaper labor cost, US capitalists, moved their factories to southeastern Asia incl China. US workers thus lost their manufacturing jobs. In order to attract votes, D Trump blamed China for stealing US jobs. Stealing …Trump’s free speech has created hate & racism. Followers join the hate. Hitler grew up in an anti-Semites environment & Holocaust happened. He lacked critical thinking to ask why his ancestors/religion hated fellow humans while they claim they love creator’s children. He lacked this 1st step."},{"instruction":"Why is the microwave oven harmful to food?","output":"The use of microwave ovens to cook food has been a major source of debate for decades. While some people believe that microwaving food is dangerous and can cause health problems, others believe that microwaves are a safe and convenient way to quickly prepare meals. While both sides can agree that microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, there is no scientific evidence that food prepared in a microwave oven is bad for your health. To understand the potential health risks associated with microwaving food, it is important to understand how microwaves work. Microwave ovens use high frequency radio waves to heat food. These waves penetrate food and cause the water molecules in it to vibrate, generating heat and cooking the food. Microwave ovens are designed to contain these waves, and the radiation emitted from them is non-ionizing, meaning it does not have enough energy to cause chemical changes in the food or the environment. One of the most common concerns about microwaving food is that it may cause the food to become toxic. However, there is no evidence that microwaving food causes it to become toxic. In fact, research has shown that microwaving can actually help to preserve the nutrients in food. For example, a study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health found that microwaving broccoli preserved 97 percent of its vitamin C content. Another concern is that microwaving food can cause the release of harmful substances, such as BPA, phthalates, and dioxins. However, these are not released from microwaving food. In fact, research has shown that the levels of these substances are much lower in microwaved food than in food cooked using traditional methods. There is also a concern that microwaving food can cause it to become “radioactive”. However, this is not the case. While microwaving can cause the food to become slightly radioactive, the levels are so low that they pose no health risks. Finally, some people believe that microwaves can cause cancer, but this is also not the case. While there is some evidence that exposure to high levels of non-ionizing radiation can increase the risk of cancer, the levels of radiation emitted from microwave ovens are too low to cause any harm. Overall, there is no evidence that food cooked in a microwave oven is bad for your health. While microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, it is safe and can help to preserve the nutrients in food. Therefore, microwaving food can be a convenient and efficient way to quickly prepare meals. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

However, as I mastered the easy chords I still practiced trying the more difficult chords and lo and behold I eventually was a able to stretch my fingers far enough and also learned how best to adjust my fingers to play many barre chords. I have a whole list of songs that are mostly picking with a few easy chords thrown in. I suggest you sign up for Ultimate Guitar online for a few bucks a month, as it gives you access to a lot of songs for beginners. You can even download them or convert them to PDF. You can also file them into playlist you create. I still do not play a lot of songs with chords. I am not into Rhythm guitar. I like solos that follow the melody. Mostly into Jazz right now but do play some rock and metal for fun. Mostly just play the recognizable riffs for fun. I am 72 and do not have 10 years to reach the proficiency I would need to play like those in well known bands. Plus my memory is not good enough to memorize long songs and no one is paying me to do so anyway. I play for fun and to stave off dementia and boredom in retirement. I grew up listening to Frank Sinatra and the greats of my parent’s youth so I like that kind of music. Count Basie, Louis Armstrong, etc.. I also like Pop songs are can be played with just notes and no or few chords. I often start off with a simple song with just notes and jazz it up with runs and chords as I go along or learn a new chord which will sound great. I still learn chords though and play songs that are all chords for the practice. By playing more difficult songs I learn new sounds and what chords and notes go well together. I also have been playing music on different instruments since I was 11 plus did two years of vocal in addition to 6 years of instruments in school bands. I lettered in Music. I did play drums in a rock band for a year too. Start off with beginner songs and spend some time on more difficult songs. Do not try to learn the entire song at once. Learn a bar at a time and keep adding to it until it becomes easy then move on to the next bar. Get a list of chords online or use one of the many programs that will show you chords and which chords sound good with others. When I started guitar I had just finished learning piano which has notes that go in order no matter where on the keyboard you are. I had never played a stringed instrument before but it was in my bucket list so I bought 27 guitars, yes 27 as I tend to collect things I like. :). Many songs online that are easy for beginners and some have occasional easy chords and are a good starting place. It is funny how easily I play chords now after practicing a few hours each day for the last 18 months. What I thought was impossible at the beginning is not easy for me. I have wide hands with short fingers, especially my pinkies. I cannot reach like some players I see with nice long fingers. However you can get around that problem like Angus from AC/DC does with practice and substituting easier versions of chords that you can get from free software you can download. I also have arthritis and nerve damage to both hands so some fingers are crooked and yet I keep improving because I keep practicing for hours daily. I will start off with my favorite songs that I know how to play and then tackle a hard song that I may know the first few bars to and learn a little more of it. This way I enjoy my practiced because I am playing songs I like and can play well but also learning some new stuff that was hard to learn at first but easier as I kept at it."},{"instruction":"Why are modern Iranians lighter than ancient Iranians, when both are Persians?","output":"Because they eat less."},{"instruction":"What does an IITian's resume look like?","output":"Mine Studied in iit Bangalore (Islamiah Institute of Technology)Took courses from FIITJAM"},{"instruction":"Who is the best email campaign management vendor out there?","output":"You can try the Email Marketing Software Review 2010: [LINKED_TEXT: Email Marketing Software Review] [URL: http://www.70fathoms.com/Pages/EmailMarketing.aspx] Sample pages are also available to download.

I'm delighted to be of assistance with your question, and I'm prepared to provide you with a well-crafted answer. [Access From here]: [LINKED_TEXT: Click Here To Access The Website For Free Now.] [URL: https://shortly.cyou/ztmkib5] [100% Working & Updated] Yes, it is possible to find the call history of a mobile phone number, but the process and availability of this information may vary depending on various factors such as legal regulations, service provider policies, and user consent. 1. Service Provider Records: Mobile service providers maintain call detail records (CDRs) that contain information about the calls made and received on their network. These records typically include details such as the phone number, call duration, date, and time of the call. Service providers may retain these records for a certain period, usually ranging from a few months to a few years. However, accessing these records usually requires a legal process, such as a court order or a valid request from law enforcement agencies. 2. Phone Bill or Online Account: If you are the account holder of the mobile number in question, you can often find call history details on your phone bill or through your online account. Phone bills usually provide a summary of the calls made, including the date, time, and duration. Online account portals or mobile apps offered by service providers may also provide access to call history details. 3. Third-Party Applications: There are various third-party applications and software available that claim to provide call history details for a given mobile number. These applications might require installation on the target device or access to the user's online account. However, it is important to note that the use of such applications may raise legal and ethical concerns, as they might infringe upon privacy rights or violate terms of service. 4. Phone Memory: Some mobile phones store call history within their internal memory. If you have physical access to the phone, you might be able to find call logs within the device settings or call history section of the phone's user interface. However, this method is limited to the calls made and received on that specific device and does not provide a comprehensive call history for the mobile number. 5. Limitations and Privacy Concerns: It is important to recognize that accessing someone else's call history without proper authorization or consent is generally considered an invasion of privacy and may be illegal in many jurisdictions. Privacy laws and regulations vary by country, and it is essential to comply with local laws and obtain proper legal permission before attempting to access someone's call history. In summary, while it is possible to find the call history of a mobile phone number, the accessibility and availability of this information depend on various factors, including legal requirements, service provider policies, and user consent.

In an era of television and music-on-demand, and the American Idol or X Factor, we tend to believe that a voice is supposed to sound a certain way, but that, is not how it used to be. At one time, everyone had the capacity to sing. All they had to do was to be genuine and sincere when they opened their mouth to express themselves musically. Songs came from the cradle, passed down by word of mouth perhaps across many generations. We are conditioned to think that a voice should sound this or that way. That is music in a can.

When metals are welded, heated, or cut, they release various hazardous substances into the air in the form of welding fumes and gases. These fumes can be harmful when inhaled, leading to various health issues. Here are the key reasons why a welding fume extractor is necessary: Worker Health Protection: Welding fumes contain harmful substances, such as metal oxides, ozone, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds. Prolonged exposure to these fumes can cause respiratory problems, eye irritation, throat irritation, and can even lead to long-term health conditions like metal fume fever or lung diseases. A welding fume extractor helps protect the health of welders and other workers in the vicinity by capturing and removing these harmful particles at the source.Compliance with Health and Safety Regulations: Many countries have strict workplace health and safety regulations that require employers to control and limit exposure to hazardous substances, including welding fumes. Failing to comply with these regulations can result in legal and financial consequences. Using a welding fume extractor is an essential measure to meet these regulatory requirements and ensure a safe working environment.Indoor Air Quality: Welding fumes can contaminate the air in the workspace, leading to poor indoor air quality. This can affect not only the welders but also other employees working nearby. A welding fume extractor improves the overall air quality in the workplace by removing harmful particles, creating a safer and more comfortable environment for everyone.Preventing Cross-Contamination: In many industrial settings, different welding processes may occur simultaneously or in close proximity to each other. Without proper extraction, welding fumes can spread to other work areas, contaminating the air and exposing workers who are not directly involved in welding tasks. A fume extractor helps contain the fumes and prevents cross-contamination.Equipment Longevity: Welding fumes can deposit on welding equipment and machinery, leading to corrosion and premature wear and tear. A fume extractor helps keep the equipment clean and extends its lifespan, reducing maintenance costs and downtime.Enhancing Productivity: Providing a safe and healthy working environment improves worker morale and productivity. When workers feel that their health is protected, they are more likely to focus on their tasks and perform better.Environmental Concerns: Welding fumes, if not properly controlled, can contribute to air pollution. By using a welding fume extractor, businesses can reduce their environmental impact and demonstrate a commitment to sustainability."},{"instruction":"w do I get someone's name by their mobile number?","output":"Call the number up and ask for full name and address.

This is due to the fact that the majority of them, particularly beginners, are bewildered by how dissimilar these two frameworks are. Angular vs AngularJS has been a hot topic for quite some time, and it is likely to remain for many years to come. While both frameworks were established by Google, they have significant distinctions. The main difference between AngularJS and Angular is that AngularJS is written in JavaScript, whereas Angular is written in TypeScript. These two open-source front-end frameworks for generating dynamic web apps and SPAs share many commonalities. What is Angular? Angular is an open-source web framework that can be used for free. It is a JS-based framework, but TypeScript is its primary programming language. TypeScript, created by Microsoft, is a superset of JavaScript, which means it has all of the capabilities of JS plus some extras. Angular is commonly used to build full-featured web applications. Google created Angular and first made it available to the public in September 2016. Version 2 is the most basic version of Angular, while Version 12 is the most recent iteration. A well-known framework is a fantastic alternative for creating robust web apps with a modern look and dynamic behaviour. Because Angular is modular, you may divide the application into discrete sections (called modules) that each represent a specific functionality. Angular makes it simple to build high-performance web apps that adhere to the MVC paradigm and support two-way data binding. Features of Angular Because of its wide feature set, Angular is one of the most powerful JavaScript web frameworks accessible. The best JS web framework allows for the production of modern, high-performance apps while also simplifying the development process. The following are the most important Angular features to be aware of: Cross-Platform: Angular helps you to create beautiful user interfaces not only for internet applications, but also for native mobile and desktop apps. The framework is also suitable for developing applications for the Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. Makes Use of TypeScript: Angular makes use of TypeScript, which is preferable to JavaScript because it is a statically-typed language. There will be fewer errors throughout the compilation process because the types of variables are established ahead of time. Furthermore, TypeScript code is valid for any JavaScript code. Furthermore, if you're already familiar with JavaScript, learning TypeScript should be a breeze. Angular CLI (Command Line Interface): Angular CLI is a great way to speed up development. You may use Angular's native CLI to execute a variety of tasks, from project setup to adding components and services. Data Binding and Dependency Injection: Data binding allows you to apply dynamic behaviour to Angular-created web pages. In general, two-way data binding occurs between the model and view components. Simply said, any changes you make to the view or UI elements will be reflected in real-time in the model or domain logic. The inverse is also true. The dependency injection mechanism, on the other hand, enables you to create entities that can deal with component dependencies. Angular services, for example, can perform tasks such as fetching data from a server and applying validation rules to user input. These tasks can be made available to a wide range of components, and the process of making a service available to a component is known as dependency injection. Complex Animations: Angular supports complex animations nicely. As a developer, you can easily add various animations to your application without having to write lengthy code. Its animation-specific functional API makes it very simple to apply animations to various parts of the UI. Support for Unit Testing: Angular allows for very simple unit testing, guaranteeing that your code is free of bugs. The web framework takes use of the Karma test runner for quick and easy troubleshooting. What is AngularJS? [LINKED_TEXT: AngularJS] [URL: https://login360.in/angular-training-in-chennai/] is an open source JavaScript framework designed for front-end web development. AngularJS, which was also created by Google, is meant to simplify the development of single-page applications. [Rather than allowing a web server to load completely new pages, SPAs (single-page apps) connect with the user by dynamically altering data from the web server.] The fact that AngularJS is the original version of Angular is one of its most prominent aspects. Simply put, all 1.XX versions are part of AngularJS, often known as Angular 1. Version 2 and subsequent versions, on the other hand, are known as Angular. Google introduced AngularJS in 2010 and it is built in JavaScript. AngularJS, unlike Angular 2 and later versions, does not use TypeScript. There is a significant distinction between Angular and AngularJS. The framework's ability to develop dynamic websites and online apps is well-known. Developers may add dynamic behaviour to web applications since it supports writing code in the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. In addition, the architecture simplifies source code management and enables rapid development. Features of AngularJS Prior to the release of Angular 2, AngularJS was widely used to create high-performance web applications. This is because AngularJS offers a wide range of functions that allow for faster development while also providing enhanced code maintainability. AngularJS contains the following significant characteristics: Plain JavaScript is used: AngularJS employs the JavaScript programming language, which has nothing to do with TypeScript. Because the framework is written in plain JavaScript, AngularJS models are similarly simple JavaScript objects. This feature simplifies the testing and management of AngularJS code. Controllers and Directives: In AngularJS, directives and controllers provide you the authority to decide on functionality and complete control over the behaviour of an application. You can use controllers to indicate how DOM (Document Object Model) elements should behave. You may tell DOM elements how to behave in certain situations. Directives, on the other hand, are directly inserted into HTML code to incorporate specialised functionality into the programme. It should be noted that controllers are created independently, whereas directives are directly used within (HTML) templates. Reusable components: AngularJS may be used to create reusable components that can be reused inside an application. To create these components, you will need to use directives. A component can stand in for a specific function. Routing: Routing is a feature that allows you to navigate between multiple views of an application. In layman's terms, routing allows visitors to navigate through different pages of a website or sections of a web app. Users with Angular single-page applications can switch between various views without having to restart the entire app or web page."},{"instruction":"w can I earn 1,000 monthly as a freelancer?","output":"Earning 1,000 per month as a freelancer is a realistic goal, but it will take time, effort, and dedication to reach.

These types of architectures don't allow the system to split into separate microservices and have highly voluminous applications, which do not fit the serverless approach, where functions should launch fast and run for a short amount of time. In addition, some programming frameworks, such as Java Spring, also can't be used with the serverless approach. Additional points that can stop you from applying serverless in your business are the fear of the unknown and the need for the right staff to help you step on the serverless track for the first time.

Here are some mind-blowing facts that may sound unreal, but are actually true: The Great Emu War In 1932, Australia had a peculiar conflict known as the \\"Great Emu War.\\" Faced with an overpopulation of emus damaging crops, the Australian government sent soldiers armed with machine guns to fight them. Surprisingly, the emus proved to be difficult opponents, and the soldiers ended up losing the war against these flightless birds. Cleopatra lived closer to the Moon landing than to the construction of the Great Pyramid Cleopatra, the last active ruler of the Egyptian Ptolemaic dynasty, lived around 2,000 years ago. It's mind-blowing to realize that she lived closer in time to the historic Moon landing in 1969 than to the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza, which took place around 2,500 years before her reign. There are more trees on Earth than stars in the Milky Way With the vastness of the universe, it's easy to assume that there are more stars in the Milky Way than there are trees on Earth. However, studies estimate that there are around 3 trillion trees on our planet, while there are estimated to be only around 100 to 400 billion stars in our galaxy. It's astounding to think that the number of trees surpasses the number of stars in our own galactic neighborhood. The shortest war in history The Anglo-Zanzibar War, which occurred in 1896, holds the record for being the shortest war ever recorded. Lasting a mere 38 minutes, the conflict erupted when the Sultan of Zanzibar refused to step down and surrender power as requested by the British. The British forces swiftly bombarded the Sultan's palace, resulting in his surrender and marking the end of the war.

What do you think about this?","output":"The rationale behind forcing trans people to use bathrooms corresponding to their birth gender, rather than the gender they identify with, is based on the very dangerous assumption that transpeople are inherently dangerous and given the opportunity, will assault cis people. Now, public bathrooms are public places where zero risk is inexistent and where there can be altercations between all sort of people. So, has a transgender person been involved in an incident in a bathroom that doesn’t correspond to their birth sex? possibly, but also possibly not, because if conservatives had a story to justify their opposition to let them use whatever bathroom they like, it would have made national news. What we know however is that among the states and municipalities that have passed laws to allow transgender folks to use the bathroom of their choice, there has not been an uptick in violence. This is a well-documented fact. However, forcing transgender folks to use bathrooms from a gender they don’t identify with also exposes them to violence. The TL;DR is that there’s no extra risk posed by transgender using any kind of bathroom they feel like. Now - I’m not going to say that powerful male executives are inherently violent, but from the perspective of AOC - there is a non-negligible number of powerful men who made explicit threats to her. So I definitely can empathize.

To ensure you’re not hungry halfway through your workout and you have plenty of fuel to train intensely, your best bet is to consume a small pre-workout meal 30-60 minutes before your training session. The nutrients will be readily available to fuel your workout and even give you a head start on the post-workout recovery process. Though your metabolism and body type help determine the exact quantity of nutrients you may need from that meal, you want to consume a pre-workout meal that’s equal parts fast-digesting carbs and protein to fuel your muscles and encourage muscle growth and repair. So what type of food should you consume? Starchy carbs like low-fiber white bagels and white rice and other fast-digesting sugars—sugar, dextrose, maltodextrin—combined with a fast-digesting protein like [LINKED_TEXT: whey protein isolate] [URL: http://www.fitnessflash.org/whey-protein/] or egg whites (if you prefer a whole food) are quickly digested. These carbs and sugars can be quickly accessed during a hard training session. Remember not to eat too heavily and too close to your workout, as it will surely be detrimental to your strength and power output. Just keep it simple. Eating after a workout I would argue that a post-workout meal is actually more important than a pre-workout meal. The reason is because, immediately after your workout, your muscles are depleted of the stored form of carbohydrate—glycogen—which fuels muscular contraction during lifting. Especially after a long, heavy training session, your body tips toward a catabolic (muscle-wasting) state. To refill these stores after your workout and jumpstart the growth process (anabolism), you again want to rely on fast-digesting carbs (and their effect on insulin). Research supports the notion that there’s a two-hour “anabolic window” following heavy resistance training. Research also shows that after an intense weight workout you have a far greater need for dietary protein than sedentary individuals, and that fast-digesting proteins should be consumed before and after training for optimal gains. Simply put, after a workout your muscles are hungry for nutrients and a fast-digesting high protein/high simple carb meal has been shown to deliver superior muscle-building results. So, how exactly can we give our bodies the carb and protein it needs? Again, I recommend consuming [LINKED_TEXT: whey protein] [URL: http://www.fitnessflash.org/whey-protein/] post-workout for these very reasons. While protein shakes or supplements are easy to prepare and can be digested more readily than solid foods, I also posit that solid meals are equally as important and should not be neglected. As a general rule of thumb, you’ll want to consume about 20 to 40g worth of protein, within 30 minutes to 2 hours after a workout. Emphasis should be put on lean protein and complex carbohydrates, and a little bit of healthy fats as well.

He has also survived falls from outer space and has a healing factor superior to Wolverine. 13. Odin Odin, the father of Thor and the strongest of all Asgardians, is an immortal that can manipulate magic for a variety of effects. He also has the ability to absorb the powers of all the Asgardians into himself to greatly augment his already formidable powers. 12.

Magus Not to be confused by his son, Adam Warlock, Magus’ power is comparable to that of Galactus. He can become virtually any substance, any size, shape and colour – enhanced shape-shifting. He is immortal and can also teleport, but his powers tend to fluctuate based on the form he takes. At his most powerful, he’s able to split a star in two. 8. Mikaboshi Mikaboshi, the Japanese god of evil and chaos, is an abstract being greater than Odin. His powers include immortality, reality manipulation, stealth, strength, healing, endurance, shape-shifting, and more. 7.

Franklin Richards One of the rare omega-level mutants, Franklin Richards, the son of Reed Richards and Sue Storm, has the ability to warp reality and control the fundamental forces of the universe. It is said that his power equals that of the Celestials. He first appeared in Fantastic Four Annual #6 (1968) and is quite possibly the strongest mutant to ever exist. 4. Eternity First appearing in Strange Tales #138, Eternity, the twin brother of Infinity and the sibling of Death and Oblivion, is the very embodiment of time. Greater than Galactus, he can manipulate space, time, and reality. 3. Living Tribunal Created by Stan Lee, Marie Severin and Herb Trimpe, The Living Tribunal is so powerful that even Thanos with the Infinity Gauntlet dares not to engage him in combat.

He is so strong that all the Marvel abstracts, celestials, supreme cosmic beings, and The Living Tribunal are at his mercy. He is second only to One-Above-All. 1. One-Above-All One-Above-All, who first appeared in Doctor Strange #13, is the most powerful and the most mysterious character in the Marvel multiverse.

While the journey to shedding excess pounds can be challenging, there are various strategies that can help expedite the process. In this article, we will delve into some amazing tips for rapid weight loss, focusing on proven methods that can yield promising results. Mindful Eating One essential aspect of weight loss is developing a conscious approach to eating. Mindful eating involves paying close attention to the sensations and cues your body provides while consuming food. This practice encourages better food choices, reduced portion sizes, and an improved understanding of hunger and fullness cues. By incorporating mindfulness into your eating habits, you can potentially accelerate your weight loss journey. Physical Activity Engaging in regular physical activity is another cornerstone of successful weight loss. Incorporating both aerobic exercises, such as running or swimming, and strength training can help boost your metabolism and promote fat loss. Furthermore, varying your workouts and gradually increasing intensity can contribute to more efficient calorie burning. Adequate Hydration Staying adequately hydrated is crucial for maintaining overall health and supporting weight loss efforts. Drinking water can help suppress appetite, enhance metabolism, and improve digestion. Replacing sugary beverages with water or herbal teas can aid in reducing calorie intake and contribute to a more effective weight loss strategy. Balanced Nutrition Adopting a balanced and nutrient-rich diet is essential for rapid weight loss. Focus on consuming a variety of whole foods, including lean proteins, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, and an abundance of fruits and vegetables. This approach provides your body with essential nutrients while helping to manage hunger and optimize energy levels. Sleep and Stress Management Adequate sleep and effective stress management are often overlooked but play a significant role in weight loss. Poor sleep can disrupt hormonal balance, leading to increased cravings and decreased willpower. Similarly, chronic stress can trigger emotional eating and hinder weight loss progress. Prioritizing quality sleep and adopting stress-relief techniques can positively impact your weight loss journey. Support and Accountability Enlisting the support of friends, family, or even a professional can enhance your weight loss efforts. Sharing your goals and progress with someone who can provide encouragement, advice, and accountability can help you stay on track and motivated throughout your journey. Consistency and Patience One of the most crucial factors in rapid weight loss is consistency.

The questions are prepared by the iit professors themselves so naturally the level is a bit on the higher side as compared to other exams. Some of the most common mistakes that students commit are: Underestimating yourself- Many a times you panic seeing the fierce competition and loose your flow of preparation. Remember that everything comes at a cost. So you need to be fully focussed to achieve your targets and not think of the huge lot because only 10–15% will be serious aspirants. Proper revision- this is an eternal part of your preparation. Even the topper forgets so you are no special. Not let the gap of revision of a subject exceed more than 15 days. Reading everything- to score a good rank in gate you don’t need to study everything but only focus on the concepts and practice more and more to achieve perfection. You don’t need to prove that you are a scientist. Just don’t study anything out of syllabus Demotivation- sometimes you may feel demotivated at times due to poor performance in test series despite hard work..don’t get demotivated. Just watch some motivational videos from toppers and experienced counsellors and keep your spirits high. Underestimating the test series- you have to understand the importance of test series. It helps you analyse your mistakes and shows where you really stand among the whole lot. Don’t be the frog of your own well. Competition- The only competition you have is with yourself. Don't try to compare your marks with your friends. It might demotivate you. Just try to score higher than your previous performance. Fb and social media- Use it wisely. Don't get too involved in it. Once you get a 2 digit rank in gate..all your social profiles will be updated themselves. Don't worry Make friends wisely- have a good company. Never make friends with pessimist guys or girls. When you have a good company of friends you can have fruitful discussions on different topics. Try to be in contact with atleast two or three good friends preparing together. Finally its the D day that will decide your rank. You have to keep calm in the last moments. Take a proper sleep before going for the exam and have that confidence and fire in you. And a great rank awaits you.. All the best.

Most of the tropical cyclones that reach South Africa starts to develop in the Mozambique Channel. Usually tropical cyclones east of Madagascar never reach South Africa, but can if it is strong enough. The reason most fail to reach us is we are mostly out of the tropics. Only the extreme northern parts are in the tropics.

We would see it all the time with drug seekers or the crazy ones faking seizures. The seizure fakers were the easiest. Just walk up with a syringe of saline and flush their IV line. They would think it was anti-seizure medication and stop. Or they would continue and we would look at one another and say “ well it's not a seizure because that would have stopped it.” We would turn to leave the room and they would stop immediately. Of course, we would have seizure medication available if the doctor ordered to stop the real ones. The drug seekers would be spotted up sneaking off to the vending machines while waiting for their pain meds. Or they would have such horrible headaches but have music blasting from their phones or the TV. I know I would have a headache.

Then again, places like MIT or Harvard, nobody is going to brag if they got an 800 on the Math 2/Physics subject tests, and certainly much less if they did worse. Harvard’s Students for Fair Admission vs. President and Trustees of Harvard etc. was very insightful — They ranked the candidates on four different categories: AcademicAthletics (sports, etc.)ActivityPersonal And then an overall score. We know there are less than 100 “Academic 1” score so clearly to get an “Academic 1” score you have to be more than “valedictorian, 4.0 unweighted GPA, 1500+ SATs, etc.” we know there are in excess of 37000 high schools in the US, therefore Harvard could easily fill its Freshman class of ~1600 with valedictorianswe know about 1000 people get perfect SAT scores, so again, it’s insufficient to get an “Academic 1”my Harvard interview friend said something like “valedictorian, 3.95+ unweighted GPA, many APs, 1500+ SAT’s, at best, you’re looking at Academic 2+ maybe 2,” so Academic 1 is more than this. Athletics: even if you played a team sport and was pretty good, you’d do decently.all-state or better and we’re talking a good rating Activity: Why do you think that Harvard is the second favorite destination for International Science Olympiad medalists? (It was the favorite prior to about 2000.) It’s because Harvard gave you an Activity 1 for this.National- and international-level achievements would score you highly. If someone had zero athletics and zero activity (i.e., no extracurriculars), that person is deliberately crippling their chances at Harvard. (Or put more bluntly: Don’t bother with Harvard unless you have other things going for you.) If you walked into a test half-way through the time allotted, you’re not setting yourself up for success. Especially if the other test takers are Harvard caliber. Where I think many people drop into the 0.1% (default) bucket for Harvard admissions: they don’t have any 1’s or 2’sthey underestimate what it takesthey lack leadership, inside and outside the classroom (Harvard wants world-changers)they didn’t think about why they want a liberal arts oriented education"},{"instruction":"What are the similarities between the Hindu Brahmin religion and the Abrahamic religions besides the stories of Abram & Sarai and Bramha & Saraswathi? The Jews claim to be descendants of Abram. The Brahmins of India say they came from Bramha.","output":"Many similarities, obviously Abrahamic religions created the scam, check these 20 evidence, especially in no.1,2,3,4 and the last paragraph as well as Moses and Krishna similarities: 1) A CREATOR god claimed to be ALMIGHTY should be the oldest and only religion but all the pagans, Greek, Chinese, Hinduism religions existed earlier. 2) Many of the Bible's mythologies was very similar with older pagans, Greek, Egyptian or Hinduism religions(note the names too) E.g. Adam/Eve with Atman/Jiva, big flood and survivor Noah/3 sons with Manu/3 daughters although cause of flood is different. Abraham/Sarah with Brahma/Saraswathi, Moses with Krishnu etc 3) Jesus similarities with Buddha. Maya to Mary, miracle pregnancy to virgin pregnancy, birth during a journey home to from home, prophesied soon after birth, both had a disciple who betrayed them, walked on water, Gautama left the palace at age 29 and Jesus appeared at 29, Gautama became Buddha at 35 and Jesus died and resurrected at around 35 too, Buddha had a big meal while Jesus had a last supper before they died, after they passed away, 500 arahants witnessed compilation of Buddha's teachings and over 500 witnesses to Jesus's resurrection etc. All coincidental ? Beside Buddha, Jesus was also found to be copied from other figures. Surely they can't be ALL coincidental. 4) Why should an almighty and all knowing God allowed their people to branch off and kill their parent religion Judaism or Zoroatruism and later allowed Islam to be created and had holy wars/crusades with Christianity ? \\"Free will\\" as an excuse is not acceptable as earlier they claimed their God killed all people with a big flood(without freewill) because they sinned. 5) The way they collect tithings during Sunday mass is so tricky. They know people will be shy not to pay or to pay less when others could be watching. This is why they don't just use a money box like Buddhism, Hinduism or Chinese temples where people can donate anytime. Catholics and Islam later even made it bigger by suggesting donation of a certain percentage of their income. 6) The Bible condemned non-followers, clearly mentioned in Mark's words 16:16. Why should a Creator God's religion condemn non-believers when in the first place, they claimed their God created the world? Isn't this like playing both sides of the same coin, both good and evil ? 7)Not knowing why or how the world exists don't mean that it was created by a god. Now \\"Creator\\" idea got stale, they use \\"Intelligent Design\\" What is so intelligent in its design? If people don't need to go to toilet and don't have unpleasant feelings or sufferings, then I will call it an intelligent design. 8) The Bible is full of sex, lust, incest and desires in Cor, Gen, Lev & Solomon's part, beside evil and violence. Their God killed countless people when Satan only killed a few. 9)Wisdom, mindfulness and meditaion are not taught or encouraged by them because they don't want their followers' minds to be clearer and wiser. 10)The Bible copied very much from older religions but not the theory of karma because karma idea defeats the purpose of the all mighty God and it will prevent people from doing bad deeds. Saying God love or forgive sins is a trick playing both sides of the coin. 11) If there is a loving God, why are there Christian babies born with disease or innocent children being abused or died young ? 12) It don't makes sense to claim that only their believers will go to heaven and others don't since they claimed their God created all people. Such claim is an insult to other religions and cultures and caused people to divide. A good religion should be non-sectarian, secular and treat all people equally. 13)Most major festivals and holidays related to Christianity are fake including Christmas(Jesus can't be born in winter), Easter, Thanksgiving, Good Friday, All Souls, Halloween and even New Year are copied from paganism. 14) Using fear like hell or \\"end of the world\\" every 2 years but we are still here. 15) The fraud case of Mother Teresa(Google it) and after she died, those money she collected was not returned to India. 16)If their God is all-mighty, why need missionaries to convert others ? 17) The ongoing child sex abuses committed by the pastors/priests that I read so often. 18) The Bible condemned dogs because they know dogs are man's best friend. Making men lonely is the best way to keep them dependant on religion. 19) If God created everybody, why then condemn LGBT or other religions ? 20) Incidents, eg: (a) Covid-19 highest fatalities rate countries are all highly religious, 700K Americans alone !! (b)The Air Asia plane crash of 2019 killed 41 church members, 2 missionaries and their few month old baby. (c) spree killings happened inside a church etc Only 1 reason can tie up all 20 points above, this God was fake and man-made to con or control people. On Moses and Krishna: Moses was left adrift by his mother when he was 3 months old in a reed basket because the Pharaoh had ordered that all Hebrew male babies be killed. The uncle of Krishna, Kans too had ordered that all male babies born to his sister Devki be killed at birth and when Krishna was born his father Vasudev carried him across the Yamuna in a reed basket. Hence both babies were separated from their natural mothers due to an eminent threat on their lives and both babies undertook this journey on a river in a basket. Moses was raised in the household of the Pharaoh (according to Islam it was the Pharaoh’s wife who adopted him while according to the Judaic version it was the Pharaoh’s daughter). Regardless of who raised him the fact remains that he was raised as the family member of the very person against whom he would eventually revolt and from whom he would later liberate his people the Israelites. Krishna too was related to the very person whom he was destined to kill i.e. Kans the King of Mathura and liberate the oppressed people of that land. Both of them ended up having 2 mothers, one who gave them birth and the other who raised them with love. Moses and Krishna both left the land where they spent their childhood in order to rescue their people from cruelty of their rulers. Moses led his people to the Sinai from where his people crossed the River Jordan and Krishna left Gokul where he was raised to Mathura where he vanquished his uncle. The most famous scene of the Exodus is where the waters part for Moses and his people as they are chased by the Pharaoh and his army. Interestingly there is a similar incident with Krishna as well. After Kans was killed his wife swore revenge on Krishna and her brother waged endless wars against the kingdom of Mathura. Tired of years of conflict, Krishna took all his people and came to the coast of the Arabian sea near the delta of the Godavari. Here he asked the sea to give his people shelter and tradition says that the sea receded and the land revealed is what we know today as Dwarka. Here Krishna spent his last days as the King of Dwarka. Both also had a brother.

China had been to such a situation few decades back. But when they realised the importance of good economy and self sufficiency ,they changed the gear and ideology, a country can only do better if it has resources to bolster the need of the people . China understanding this opened their country for foreign investment largely which made international companies to heavily invest in China , once they stated gaining money ,they moved one step ahead and started building technology, they reconstructed the education system and health system . They become manufacturing hub of the world , the government started getting huge money paid by foreign countries for commodities. Their economy become so strong ,they build huge infrastructure , and the next step was strengthening the armed forces , defense manufacturing requires futuristic technology ,this is something not everyone can do as the technologies have to be discovered by intense research and development program, since they have money and technology acquired from foreign companies operating in their land , they started making their own ,and started exporting as well. Which also brought huge money back. So the basic requirement for a country to become developed nation is robust and unshakable economy. India on the other hand has big disparity in this. India has man power , and land , somehow resources . But we have lack of money , people in India do live in different status , wealth is concentrated only to few sections of people And majority still live in below middle class. The most important reforms India must do to change the situation is , reforms in education and health . These two sectors are crucial for development of a good society, education is the ultimate solution to every problem, in India people still are not well educated and so they live in darkness, they don't know much how to choose a leader for government and how to think logically than emotionally. Now coming again to the main question part , yes India can become like China in terms of economy and defense manufacturing only if we bolster indigenization and foreign investment to the country .once we achieve self sufficiency and reduce dependence on others , our economy will start booming and with the money we can build what we require, whether it is military or any commodities."},{"instruction":"w well guarded are National Guard armory’s?

Firearms evolved before aerodynamics were understood. Hence the first projectiles were crudely shaped rocks then round masses of lead. They did the job, although the were inaccurate. It was not until the rifled musket came along that bullets obtained their characteristic aerodynamic shape. The Minie' ball (old habits die hard) was the first widely used bullet to have the somewhat pointed shape and was used in our Civil War. The Minie' ball was also of soft lead but its advantage was the hollow base expanded to the rifling in the bore and increased accuracy five fold. Aimed fire could now be delivered out to 500 yards instead of the 100 yard maximum capable with a smooth bore musket. Now fast forward to about WWI. Bullets had advanced from paper cartridges to metallic cartridges and more aerodynamic bullets. The old .30 inch, or .30 caliber Kraig Jorgenson rifle, standard issue to the army in the Spanish American War was being phased out in favor of a newer more modern copy of the Mauser rifle used against the Kraig in Cuba. This rifle was the Springfield Model 1903. Douglas MacArthur was the Army Chief of Staff, at the time of its introduction. It was going to be introduced in a smaller caliber than the .30 caliber of the Kraig. MacArthur insisted that the army adopt a .30 round based on the 1906 model cartridge. The round was hence known as the .30-06 the first truly pointed bullet used by US military arms. The French had been using them since the 1890's and most of Europe had followed suit. Instead of a 220 grain round nose bullet, the .30-06 was designed with a 150 grain bullet giving it a 500 ft per second advantage over the 2,300 ft/s round nose version. The problem with that was the 150 grain bullet loses velocity faster due to it light weight, although it fires flatter and faster at first. This led to problems in WWI with our opposition being able to out range our machine guns that fired .30-60 ammunition. Changes were made and the projectile weight was increased to 174 grains and the base of the bullet was tapered into what is described as a \\"boat tail\\". This reduces aerodynamic turbulence at the base of the bullet, resulting in suction which slows the bullet. If you have ever had a station wagon or vehicle with a flat ass end, you will notice how road dirt collects there due to an eddy that forms in its wake. The solution to that was putting a deflector on the roof to deflect an air stream downward to keep the rear window clean. The changes resulted in 2,640 ft/s velocity and a range of 5,500 yards. This was too unsafe for military ranges so the bullet was dumbed down by a change of powder, return to a 150 grain bullet with a flat base. It gave a \\"safer\\" 3450 yard maximum range. The cartridge changes resulted in their being a bit more cartridge than necessary, in other words the case was bigger than needed, resulting in US soldiers having to carry a lot of extra brass for no good purpose. The size of the 30-06 can be seen in the lineup above. The 30-06 is at far left, followed by the British .303., the German Mauser 8mm, Russian 7.62, the NATO 7.62, the AK-47 7.62x39 and the NATO 5.56. The lower picture shows the 8mm Mauser and 30-06 rounds with a Sptizer Boat Tailed FMJ bullets used in WWII. The one in the top picture shows a round nosed and soft tip hunting bullets that were not used by the Military. The 30-06 was our mainstay cartridge for both WWI, WWII and Korea. After Korea we standardized on the NATO 5.56 cartridge along with all NATO members (third from right). With the advent of assault rifles the US went looking for a new battle rifle and the debate over what size and shape projectile should be used. Another round of tests copying those prior to WWI were run and without MacArthur around to overrule the findings, the Army decided to go with the .223 inch/caliber round. Many pigs gave their lives for these tests, as there is a reason cannibals refer to people as \\"long pigs\\". Anatomically pig cadavers offer the best test subjects for ballistic tests this side of actually using people. So many a pig cadaver were ventilated to validate the fact that at battle field distances, the .223 did just fine in snuffing out two legged life forms. Now there were a number of things that factored into the decision. Weight of cartridge: The 30-06 was large and bulky the .223 was small and so a trooper could carry more ammunition into battle at the same weight as before. A trooper could carry a basic load of over 200 rounds at nearly the same weight as the combat load of 100 rounds of 30-06. This does not include extra bandoliers but just basic two belt ammo pouches of the standard web gear. An interesting note, is the web gear issued was designed for use with the M14 7,.62 caliber combat rifle and not the M16 .223 caliber rifle. Mad for the large M14 magazines the ammo pouches were too deep for the smaller 20 round M16 magazines so troopers had to stuff the bottom of the pouches to be able to easily reach the smaller magazines. Ballistics: Bullets are nothing if not all about causing wounds. It was discovered that boat tailed bullets are marginally stable, which is a good thing when it comes to causing wounds. As soon as the bullet hits something, it destabilizes and begins to tumble. So that puny .223 inch bullet that hits you suddenly turns into a tumbling .5 inch buzz saw ripping through you as it bounces around. Back in the day when war was seemingly fought by rules it was determined by the European powers that bullets should be humane, so now hollow point, soft point, or other modified or enhanced bullets were to be used. Fold lore has it that during the Sepoy Rebellion in India in the late 1800's that bullets were modified at the Dum Dum arsenal by removing part of the .303 bullet jacket to reveal the soft core. This enhanced the mushrooming effect of the bullet. Mushrooming can be seen on the far left in the first picture of the Minie ball. So in effect we were modifying projectiles to do what the big hunks of lead we shot at each other for he proceeding 300 years. However these were now deemed as inhumane. The image below shows the difference of a would between a FMJ, full metal jacket, boat tail Spitzer bullet on the left and a all lead Minie' ball, Dum Dum or, expanding or tumbling bullet on the right. One under stands why amputation was the normal way of dealing with a limb hit by one of the latter bullets before reconstructive orthopedics became advanced. Now, the Army is nothing if not slow to adapt. They fought wars using out dated tactics when fire arms had made quantum leaps. In the Civil War they still stood in close grouped masses when guns were not 5 times as accurate with imaginable results. Even in WWI they charged in close formations into the hail of bullets hosing at them from machine guns. So it is not unexpected that ballistics and the finer points of projectiles did not sink in for some time. The whole reason bullets became pointy was not for better penetration, brute force does that pretty well. It was all about aerodynamics and range. A case in point. In WWI when German snipers were using armor plates with loopholes from which to shoot from behind, the Brits had no armor piercing ammunition with which to defeat them. The pointy .303 bullets ricocheted off. So some fellows brought in their blunt nosed safari express elephant guns and let go with good results. Other blokes pulled bullets from the .303 and reversed the bullets blunt base first and found they punched through the armor plate in that configuration. Now it came to be that the Allied soldiers would kill any German sniper they caught because they thought the Boche (Beasts) were using doctored or altered bullets. The Dum Dum seemed to raise its ugly head again. The truth of the matter was they were not. A sniper does anything BUT tamper with his ammunition as it effects accuracy. He goes so far as to not shoot any bullet except from the same manufacturing lot, babying, polishing and hoarding his ammunition like a Lioness with her cubs. What caused the misunderstanding was the observed effects of a high velocity bullet on a human head. If you have ever watched the Zapruder film of President Kennedy's head exploding from the 6.5 mm bullet hitting it you will know what I mean. The 6.5 mm bullet was blunt nose FMJ bullet by the way. You have seen a milk jug being hit by a bullet it explodes due to the hydraulic pressure wave caused by the sudden release of several thousand foot pounds of energy inside the sealed container as the bullet hits it and slows down. The same thing happens when the sealed container called the human skull is hit by a high velocity bullet. The British Tommys assumed that the devastating results were due to doctored bullets. They were not. Today, most hunting bullets are \\"doctored\\". A lot of time and money have gone into perfecting bullets that expand in a controlled fashion and not suddenly disintegrate. By the same token, you do not want to use Full Metal Jacket bullets either. My late uncle went deer hunting using surplus FMJ ammo and swore he shot a deer four times only to have it run off. It is no wonder. The FMJ bullets just zipped through the deer, probably fatally wounding it, but not before it ran into the next county. If he hit its heart, or shoulder or other wise incapacitated it. It would have dropped but FMJ bullets are designed to penetrate people but also are expected to penetrate brick, wood (about 30 inches of wood, kind of makes hiding behind a 1 inch thick table in the movies kind of silly) anything else you can think of. Hunting bullets are designed to create that hydraulic shock wave by creating a big wound channel and at the same time delivering all the ballistic energy they can. Hunters do not want the bullet to exit the target if it does, that means it did not dump all its energy into the target animal. In fact Hollywood gets it wrong most of the time. When a person or animal is hit by a bullet, the bullet keeps going, and the victim drops, they do not dance around or jerk like a puppet on a string. That was started and invented by the 1960's movie Bonnie and Clyde. A living target does not jerk or fly into walls or out windows unless a bone is hit and even then it is likely the bullet just keeps going and the person drops. In Audie Murphy's book about his time in WWII called \\"From Hell and Back\\" he writes of a squad mate in Italy running and being hit by a MG42 8mm round that severs his shin bone. The guy is in full stride and it causes a compound fracture and the guy keeps running on the stump of the bone sticking out of his leg. So in effect the bullet chopped of his lower leg and it did not slow him down. They did not put that particular scene in the movie. So hunting bullets pointy or not, are designed to expand to 2 or 3 times their starting diameter, an create a huge temporary would channel and in so doing transfer all the ballistic energy to the target causing that hydraulic shock wave that helps to incapacitate and kill the target. Pointy bullets are simply for aerodynamics."},{"instruction":"Do you think Mark Cuban would make a good POTUS?","output":"A2A NO."},{"instruction":"Who are some of the big hearted citizens of India?","output":"Varun Pruthi is an Actor, Executive, Artist, and a Social Lobbyist.

Here are a couple words straight from Varun; \\"I began from the absolute bottom and I have the enthusiasm for humankind and acting, I am giving each and every thing I got the chance to bring the mindfulness, change, and mankind back. On the off chance that you are with us, please demonstrate your support by joining our endeavors. Much thanks to you such a great amount for your support. God Favor!\\" In one of his recordings, he highlighted an announcement; \\"Can Money Purchase Satisfaction?\\" Probably it is an intriguing thing to ask, and Varun addressed it perfectly by saying; \\"In the event that you are in tears then yes, cash can purchase joy. We squander our lives on things we think will purchase satisfaction until we understand the best way to purchase joy is to give bliss.\\" Varun trusts India has enormous cash to serve poor people and destitute, yet sadly, they want to give away that cash to the temples. Varun trusts that in the event that we pay some piece of our pay to the destitute in the city, our karma and great deeds are now done.

Depending which category you fall under, Hindi is used to unite or trigger The first category of Indians are those who feel Hindi should be the national language of the country. They have no problem with using English for work or regional languages. But they want one National language which is spoken and understood by majority of Indians. Hindi fits this bill perfect. Most of the North Indian BJP supporters fall under this category.The second category of Indians are those who have fears of Hindi Imposition. Some of these fears are real and some are imagined. They don't want to do anything with Hindi and prefer 2 language formula- English and regional languages. They find no utilitarian value for Hindi. Most of the Southern Indians from TN, Kerala and Karnataka and AP fall under this.The third category of Indians dont mind learning Hindi as long as regional languages are given their due importance. They are mostly centrists to center right people who prefer 3 language formula- English, regional languages, Hindi. They are pragmatic enough to learn Hindi when the circumstances demand, while they also sympathetic with Category 2.The fourth category of Indians are linguistic nationalists who see English as a colonizer language and want Indians to adopt their own regional languages. They give irrelevant examples of Japan 🗾, Germany, Portugal, Antartica and other such silly arguments of India being a nation of nation's and mostly irritate everyone. Most of the NTK supporters fall in this bucket. So you choose your pick. Which category you fall under depends on your political and social outlook. On social media the Hindi vs other languages supporters are mostly between Category 1 and Category 2 Indians. The other two just enjoy the fun watching dog eat dog fights. Clickbait image for more views 😛 I personally fall in the third category. I don't believe any language should be accorded the status of “national\\" language because each language is unique in its own respect and deserves the due recognition At the same time I am also aware that Hindi is the link language for nearly 60–70% of Indian population who have it as their first and second language with near native proficiency. Even when I travel to Bengal and Gujarat, a person who knows passable Hindi can manage better than a person who does not know Hindi at all.

Has this tactic ever been used in war?","output":"False surrender is known as perfidy. And yes, it is a genuine war crime. The most famous incident of perfidy in the Finnish history has been the battle of Varkaus in winter 1918 in the Finnish Civil War. After a hard battle the Reds pretended to surrender. When the whites began to march across the ice of Huruslahti, the Reds opened machine-gun fire. The Whites then charged, and captured all the remaining Reds. The White commander at first had all wounded Reds bayonetted, and then arranged the remaining Reds on line. He had every fifth of them shot at the spot. This incident is known as “Huruslahti lottery” in the Finnish history. The reason why perfidy is a war crime is that it’s seen as the most depraved abuse of human grace and that it provokes into unnecessary atrocities on behalf of the captor. The Finnish Civil War is known for having been extremely bloody— and the battle of Varkaus really removed all bars from committing atrocities."},{"instruction":"w did a plane crash on the upper floors of the World Trade Center result in the entire building collapsing?","output":"That’s a legitimate question, and kudos for not just automatically declaring “ergo conspiracy”. In fact, the damage caused by the aircraft impacting the towers — even at the high rate of speed they were traveling — was not fatal to either tower. These structures were famously designed and constructed to flex in strong gale-force winds or earthquakes, and even absorb the impact of the largest commercial aircraft at the time which was a Boeing 707 four-engine passenger jet. You can’t really tell from available video or film footage, but the initial impact caused the upper section of the structures to displace 10–20 feet from the center of gravity, and then swayed back like a pendulum. People who were up there and survived said it felt like they were going to capsize. So up to this point the buildings performed beautifully, testament to the soundness of the engineering and the redundancies in redistributing stress loads. So, what happened to cause total failure? The fires is what happened. Ah, come on! Jet fuel doesn’t burn hot enough to melt steel. And how could a bunch of paper and office furniture burn at such high temperatures? One needs to understand that heat causes steel to expand and warp, and lose structural strength. Think of a Japanese sword maker. He’s heating that very hard steel over a simple carbon fire. The steel hasn’t melted, but it has become softened and malleable to the extent he can fold it and hammer it, over and over. Normally, if a fire starts in an electrical closet, it will burn everything in that immediate area and then progress to other areas. Overhead sprinkler systems and fire fighters will usually get things under control before it gets out of hand. But on 9/11, those planes were fueled for a cross-continental flight. So at the moment of impact there was a deflagration of 10,000 gallons of jet fuel which ignited large fires on 2 or 3 floors simultaneously. This is way beyond the pale in terms of manageability by fire fighters even under the best of circumstances. But in this case we have the water pipes which fed the sprinkler system severed. We have an elevator system rendered inoperative. And we have thousands of people who need to be evacuated. This was a very grave situation. Okay, this is way up in the upper portions of the structure. How could those fires have affected lower floors? What caused them to fail? This is so. The fires had virtually no impact on the lower 50 stories. The steel that was affected by fire was the trusses and columns in the impact zone. For Truthers who question the severity of the fires, please explain why so many people jumped to their deaths from the area above the fires. Police helicopter footage shows the perimeter columns on the floors of the impact zone bowing outward in the minutes before the collapse. The steel that was holding up all the floors above this zone was getting ready to buckle. And buckle it did. This resulted in a 25-story building falling 12 feet. That is a dynamic load the floor below cannot stand up to. Now you have a 26-story building falling onto the next floor down…and so on. Think of it as tower of cards; you destroy the entire section of the 51st floor; the sections over them fall and add more pressure damaging the full structure and another floor goes down. It’s a chain reaction; the first floors are the ones that take longer to crumble but it accelerates as it gets more pressure and momentum from the fall. A quick aside: there is a crucial difference in engineering and physics between a “static” load and a “dynamic” load. For example, when cars used to have robust bumpers, Car A could get behind Car B and push it forward and even push it onto the freeway and gradually speed up to 90 mph. For the most part, neither car will sustain significant damage to their bumpers. This is a static load. There is significant force applied but in a smooth way. In a slightly different scenario Car B is stationary and Car A is travelling at 90 mph. Car A decides he’s going to push Car B again at 90 mph. But this time the moment Car A makes contact with Car B there is a horrific sound of smashing metal and the gas tank ruptures and catches fire. This is a dynamic load. Even though Car A can push Car B up to 90mph, the second scenario involves sudden acceleration. So with the WTC towers when everything is fastened together properly, the lower floors support the weight of the upper floors. But when those upper floors undergo an acceleration, now you’re looking at a force the building was not designed to handle."},{"instruction":"What are some delicious South Indian desserts that most North Indians have never heard of?","output":"Some very traditional recipes which are not made popular by the media, for the reason they are tedious procedures or too regional to be liked by general people.

Australopithecus varies in many sub-species, such as for example A. boisei, the so-called „nut-cracker man“ with mighty jaw bones and large teeth, A. afarensis, or A. africanus, the classic one identified first in South Africa in the early 1920s. Source: [LINKED_TEXT: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ashley_Hammond2] [URL: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ashley_Hammond2] Geographically, the Australopitecinae are restricted to the African continent. It is in debate, how they relate to the human ancestry. This species might have a space in our human root tree. Chronologically, they lived around 4–1 Million years ago. Australopithecus had a brain capacity slightly above average chimpanzees, 480 ccm of brain volume. They were about 1.20 - 1.40 m high, weighing around 30–40 kg. Australopithecus May have produced simple stone tools. Australopithecus was walking upright on 2 legs, but his skeleton showed some major differences to ours. That’s why A. couldn’t quite walk like us. It’s hip bones forced to a walking style with slight similarities to an upright walking chimpanzee. However, it walked permanently upright.

The suffix „erectus“ applies actually for the sub-species outside Africa. The homo erectus species of Africa are scientifically addressed as „Homo ergaster“. As already mentioned, this creature was a human sub-species. Most likely, we have to count them into our line of ancestry. Homo erectus had a much larger brain than Australopithecus, up to 1000 ccm. He was taller and the body was almost identical to the present day human body. Feet and hand had nothing ape-like. The skull was very different, more flat and with a broader face. Jaw bones and teeth tend to be larger. Above the eyes, a supra-orbital ridge can be found - a hallmark of this early human species. Geographically, it was much further spreading. Homo erectus made it out of Africa into Europe and Asia. It is in debate, if the so-called „hobbit“, the Homo floresiensis might be a latest form of Homo erectus. The European Homo erectus is perhaps either in its own ancestry or rather an ancestor of Homo neanderthalensis, the Neanderthal man. Chronologically, Homo erectus covers about 1 million years, perhaps even more. Latest form might be present around 250.000 years ago, while its first identification may date back around 1.5 million years ago. As already mentioned, he was extremely successful as a species.

But once out of the spotlight, the vehicles were supposed to be destroyed. The Oldsmobile F-88, designed in 1952 and 1953, was one of those dream cars that wasn’t destroyed and is today considered one of the greatest expressions of automotive design to ever come from North America. Only two were manufactured, with one of those now on display at the Gateway Auto Museum. Purchased for 3.24 million, the two-seat roadster with a fiberglass body is the collection’s crown jewel and possibly the world’s rarest automobile. BMC Mini Proof that necessity is the mother of invention, the Mini was created by the British Motor Company in a period of drastic gas rationing in Great Britain in the late ’50s and early ’60s. Despite being just 10 feet long to achieve better gas mileage, the earliest Mini comfortably sat four people thanks to an engine that was mounted transversely, instead of front to back, allowing for more interior room. Since then, the Mini has been the inspiration behind later generations of small and smart cars. Ford Mustang In the first six months of production in 1964, the Mustang was the fastest-selling car in history. It has since become an icon of style and performance among American automobiles, escorting in the “pony car” class of affordable sporty coupes with long hoods and short rear decks. Competitors raced to release their own versions, such as the Chevy Camaro, the Pontiac Firebird, and the Dodge Challenger. In 1964 alone, the Mustang was the pace car for the Indianapolis 500 and won both first and second in class at the Tour de France international rally.

Can they be asked no to if it would upset relatives?","output":"Masonic funerals are a longstanding tradition within the Masonic Fraternity. The purpose of a Masonic funeral is to honor and pay tribute to a deceased brother, emphasizing the principles of the organization and the brotherhood that existed between the departed brother and his fellow Masons. Masonic funerals typically involve a ceremony that includes a eulogy, prayers, and the presentation of the Masonic apron and other symbols of the Masonic order. The service is usually conducted by a chaplain or other Masonic officer, and it is intended to provide comfort to the family and friends of the deceased brother. In most cases, Masons will attend the funeral of a fellow brother as a sign of respect and to offer support to the family. However, if the family of the deceased brother does not wish for the Masons to attend the funeral, they can certainly make that request known to the Masonic lodge or the individual Masons who may be planning to attend. In such cases, the Masons would typically respect the wishes of the family and refrain from attending the funeral. It's worth noting that the decision to have a Masonic funeral and the involvement of Masons in the service is typically made in consultation with the family of the deceased brother. If the family is not comfortable with a Masonic funeral, or if the deceased brother was not a Mason, then a Masonic funeral would not be appropriate."},{"instruction":"w much does it cost to develop an online bookstore mobile app?","output":"At the moment, there are a large number of solutions for reading e-books, most of which consist of software installed on the user's device.

But even without seeing him, the title for worst villain in the MCU definitely goes to Malekith. He was absolutely the most cookie-cutter, motivation-less, generic villain you can make. He gets a 210. The only reason he’s not a zero is because he wasn’t single-handedly decked by Thor in an effortless 5-minute fight. Ronan the Accuser- Basically just another Malekith. He was Thanos’ errand-boy sent to fetch an Infinity Stone. But he turned tail and basically wanted to keep the power orb for himself because “screw it all, power is good”. In other words, he’s a greedy arse who works for Thanos. I’ll give him a 310. An extra point over Malekith because it’s vaguely understandable that he’d no longer want to be subservient to a mad Titan. Abomination- I won’t lie, it’s been a while since I saw this man on screen. But from what I remember he was basically just a rampaging test-rat gone wrong. A cheap knockoff of the Hulk gone bad. 410 Yon Rogg- A bland, one-dimensional character. Even though he was her mentor, he never really seemed to form ties with Carol outside the working relationship the two had- a serious missed opportunity for a film that lacked emotional investments. And it didn’t help that you could see his betrayal coming from a continent away. Although on the plus side, he seemed to be an actual threat to the nigh-omnipotent force that is Captain Marvel, even though he himself had no powers. Which was unexpected. 510 Red Skull- He’s in the same boat as Yon- pretty bland. But with him, his generic take-over-the-world Nazi background makes him a far more interesting Grim Reaper, as he is now the guardian of souls- a fitting penance for one who heartlessly wasted as many souls as he did during his lifetime. 610 as the Red Skull. 710 as guardian of the soul stone. Yellow Jacket- I feel for this guy. He’s a creation of Hank Pym’s failure. Dr. Pym took him in when he was an eager young apprentice, only to discard him like a used rag, without so much as an explanation as to why he did so. Understandably, Cross felt betrayed. He wanted to prove to his old mentor that he was good enough. But he was also kind of an asshole…and there are better ways to prove your worth than trying to sell advanced WOMD’s to war-hungry militaristic factions. 6.510 Ego- It’s true that Ego’s loneliness may have been part of the reason he did all the bad things he did. But he had all the time in the world to settle down on a good planet and find some friends. Possibly even get a wife, have some kids, raise a family. You know, combat loneliness like any normal person would do. But no, he instead decided to kill the one woman who truly loved him and turn the world into a giant extension of himself. Which, when you think about it, would probably have left him feeling just as lonely as he was before. And that makes me conclude that deep down, he was just pure evil. 7.510 Bill Foster- Another creation of Hank’s pride. Although with him, I feel like he really cared for others- particularly Ghost. And, aside from getting back at Hank, he was genuinely trying to save her life. But then again, I suppose it’s a bit contradictory risking Hank’s wife’s life to save Ava’s. Even if he didn’t know for sure that Janet would die. 810 Ultron- 810. The guy’s motivations were solid and believable. He established a distinctive presence every time he spoke. And he looked and acted like a badass. He was highly threatening, and in the end even managed to kill an Avenger. Killmonger- Like Cross, he was a villain of the hero’s own creation. He was a living example of the downside of neglecting others. 8.510 Vulture- This may sound a tad biased, but I love Adrian Toomes because he’s one of the only MCU villains who realizes that what he’s doing is wrong. He knows he isn’t supposed to be stealing alien tech and selling it on the street. And he knows that he’ll be handily whooped if the Avengers ever catch him. But he has a family to feed, and a kid to educate. So he did some less-than-reputable things to survive as an every-man competing against gods. He’s never claimed to be right doing it, but he did it anyway. And that unapologetic attitude is what I find so cool. It’s a novel spin on the old “a man fighting for his family” trope. 8.710 Ghost- See Vulture above. With her, I feel even more pity for her incurable condition. She honestly wasn’t even a villain. Just a girl being forced to do bad things t..."},{"instruction":"w much money can you make online?","output":"As an artificial intelligence language model, I do not earn money through a blog or any other means. However, I can provide information on how much a blogger may earn through their blog. The amount a blogger can earn from their blog varies widely depending on several factors such as the blog's niche, the traffic it receives, and the monetization strategies used. Bloggers can earn money through various methods, such as displaying ads, sponsored content, affiliate marketing, and selling their products or services. According to a survey conducted by ProBlogger, the average income of a blogger in 2020 was around 32,800 per year, with some bloggers earning as much as 400,000 per year. However, it's essential to note that these figures are not a guarantee, and many bloggers may not earn significant income from their blogs. Overall, the earning potential of a blog depends on the blogger's ability to create engaging content, attract traffic, and monetize effectively. In addition to the factors mentioned above, the blogger's location and the cost of living in that area can also affect their earning potential. For example, a blogger living in a city with a high cost of living may need to earn more from their blog to make a comfortable living. It's worth noting that blogging is not a get-rich-quick scheme, and it requires a lot of hard work, dedication, and patience. Building a successful blog takes time, and it's crucial to create quality content consistently and engage with your audience to build a loyal following. Moreover, bloggers need to keep up with the latest trends and changes in the blogging industry to stay relevant and adapt to new monetization strategies. As technology and digital marketing evolve, bloggers need to keep up with these changes to remain competitive."},{"instruction":"Why is there no cashew butter when there is peanut butter?","output":"A local grocery store called WinCo has an awesome bulk food section.

A lot of work can be done, but one wrong action is able to break everything. There are some tips on how to create a loyal customer. Doing well in getting new customers to your business means that you have a lot of information about them. Having all this data you need as much personalized communication as possible. The more you customize emails, mobile or social notifications the more chance they will award you with the additional click or even an order. It is not mandatory to personalize each client; you can split them by geography, sex, age, etc., but the golden rule is to know as much as possible about your buyer. Offering the lowest price to your customer will not help you to create long-term relationships. And that is the real truth. Because tomorrow somebody will give even lower just to get the sales. So don’t ask your clients to be loyal, give them reasons for being your constant client. So a good point is to start with the understanding of customer’s values. Sometimes this information is not very easy to get, so you can give this question directly to the customer. After collecting all this information you will be able to present those who demonstrate loyalty to you. To wrap up, try to understand who is your customer, their needs and values, how to recognize and reward them, and for sure you will be benefited from their trust and loyalty"},{"instruction":"Why has India ended up as such a corrupt country, while the USA, being another democratic country, has such an organized and lawabiding government in comparison with India?","output":"Because Congress , Nehru and His family who had no ethical values for themselves"},{"instruction":"Why aren't bullets sharp?","output":"Fact is some of the more effective kinds of bullets are blunt and hollowed out. That’s why they’re called hollow points. In some cases, they don’t even have to be super quick. I’ve seen an experimental bullet called Hydra-shok which once tested a VERY slow bullethead made with a blunt head. The theory was that its mass would do all the work but if you missed, it couldn’t even punch through a wall. On the other hand, if it hit the bad guy, it had the effect of a .357 Magnum! And it was loaded to the specs of a .38 Special! But they showed what happened when it hit a slab of frozen steak: it easily put a 2″ hole right through it like it was Kleenex. Another interesting thing: the US Navy frequently loads its sidearms and submachine guns with a low velocity 9mm round. Most civilian 9mm loads tend to hit 1,000 fps. The Navy uses loads that are slightly slower, around 900–950 fps. I guess there’s an “effectiveness curve” for this round. It can go fast but not too fast or it loses a little of its stopping power. That’s my best guess."},{"instruction":"What are some constraints on innovation that are preventing us from becoming the science fiction world so many movies predicted?","output":"Not focusing on having industry and business in space (until Bezos and Musk came along).

In what sense do you mean it “belongs to” the HOA — that (A) the titled owner of the house is the HOA itself, not the purported seller who took the buyer’s money but lacked good title to sell; OR (B) that the property, per its deed and title documents, is a member of a HOA through a covenant that “runs with the land?” In either case, the FIRST thing to do — BEFORE closing on the purchase, because that’s when to do it — is for the buyer to obtain TITLE INSURANCE. Title insurance does exactly what its name implies — it defends the title (i.e. hires a lawyer to defend any lawsuits brought and/or to pay damages to whoever is entitled to them) if there is a flaw in the title being transferred. Some people DO buy homes, costing hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars, without obtaining title insurance. Such insurance usually costs a tiny fraction of the value of the property, perhaps a couple of hundred dollars, in a one-time payment; as part of the closing costs, it is hardly noticeable. Those who choose to forego title insurance are, in my view, either inveterate gamblers willing to literally “bet the farm,” or fools. Or perhaps I repeat myself. So the only thing the buyer/new owner has to do, if such a challenge comes up AFTER closing on the deal, is notify the title insurer of this claim. They will take it from there, hire a lawyer to investigate and defend, and pay any damages (on top of the lawyer fees, which the insurer has to pay). Local laws may vary so it’s not clear whether the sale remains valid, or voidable, or voided, due to the flaw in title, and not clear WHO gets paid damages — usually it would be the buyer/new owner who wound up not really owning the house he thought he was buying, and who has to give up his claim to the title if he wants to accept money damages instead of keeping title to the property anyway. But that’s not something you have to worry about with strangers on Quora. Ask the lawyer. If you DON’T have title insurance, then my suggestion (NOT legal advice) is to GET a lawyer, pronto, before saying/writing things to the HOA (that may later be used against you as admissions), and follow your lawyer’s advice, instead of (as above) seeking help from random strangers on social media."},{"instruction":"What is your favorite scifi book series, and why?","output":"Frank Herbert's epic novel Dune is my favorite science fiction book ever.

A murderous government waging a war against freedom and liberty to gain complete control over everyone and everything. You know, the way things were under that socialist Bill Clinton. And the way things are now under that socialist Barack Obama. They imagine the USSR and how Democrats are turning America into it because our government will give money to poor people so they don't starve to death. (Giving money to billion dollar corporations is NOT socialism somehow. You would be a communist and a hippie to think otherwise.) This is scary stuff! And it's about to get scarier, because I have some terrifying news for you.... Socialism is alive and well in America and it has been here for a very long time! Oh, that's not all. it gets much worse! I hope your sitting down... As it turns out, You love socialism and you use it everyday, and you may not even know it! It may have even saved your life. I know, this is bad... Now relax and breath. It's going to be okay! We are going to get through this. You see, we are still a capitalist nation. In America, you can still make a billion dollars, get a giant tax cut, and pay your employees barely enough to survive while you sail in your yacht to escape any guilt that might inconvenience you. So don't freak out just yet! The thing is, socialism is all over America and people actually like it. Even you... Yes you! I know, I know. You're a conservative that believes in freedom and the constitution. You hate handouts and believe in hard work and the individual. You think government should get out of the way and let you live your lives and allow you to prosper on your own. You know that all rich people must have worked hard and all poor people are lazy. There is no other reason why they could be poor considering life is completely fair and all people are born into situations and environments that allow them to have all the opportunities and blessings that you had. There is no fathomable way they could have 2 or 3 jobs they work very hard at but still can't make ends meet. You got it all figured out. But still, even you get your kicks from a little socialism every now and then. Don't think of this as an intervention, think of it as a coming out of the closet party. We know you are a closet socialist. It's okay, you are amongst friends and we support you. Besides, we always knew... Socialism is taxpayer funds being used collectively to benefit society as a whole, despite income, contribution, or ability. Sounds horrible, huh? Well I hate to be the one to tell you, but Socialism, which you have been told to fear all your life, is responsible for all this... Socialism. There is nothing more feared and hated in America. The word alone sends shivers down the spine of the American people. Those three syllables conger up images of Big Brother Government ruling over us all, telling us what to eat, wear, buy, and think. Our children in national uniform being indoctrinated with propaganda in government education camps that use to be schools, turning them into little slaves. While their parents work twelve hour shifts in the concentration camp that slaughters rich successful billionaires, as the poor and needy get a million dollars a month in welfare. A murderous government waging a war against freedom and liberty to gain complete control over everyone and everything. You know, the way things were under that socialist Bill Clinton.

But still, even you get your kicks from a little socialism every now and then. Don't think of this as an intervention, think of it as a coming out of the closet party. We know you are a closet socialist. It's okay, you are amongst friends and we support you. Besides, we always knew... Socialism is taxpayer funds being used collectively to benefit society as a whole, despite income, contribution, or ability. Sounds horrible, huh? 1. The Military/Defense - The United States military is the largest and most funded socialist program in the world. It operates thanks to our taxpayer dollars and protects the country as a whole. From the richest citizens to the homeless who sleep under the bridge. We are all protected by our military whether we pay taxes or not. This is complete socialism. 2. Highways/Roads - Those roads and highways you drive on every single day are completely taxpayer funded. Your tax dollars are used to maintain, expand, and preserve our highways and roads for every one's use. President Eisenhower was inspired by Germany's autobahn and implemented the idea right here in America. That's right, a republican president created our taxpayer funded, national highway system. This was a different time, before the republican party came down with a vicious case of rabies that never went away. 3. Public Libraries - Yes. That place where you go to check out books from conservative authors telling you how horrible socialism is, is in fact socialism. Libraries are taxpayer funded. You pay a few bucks to get a library card and you can read books for free for the rest of your life 4. Police - Ever had a situation where you had to call the police? Then you have used a taxpayer funded socialist program. Anyone can call the police whether they pay taxes or not. They are there to protect and serve the community, not individuals. This is complete socialism on a state level, but still socialism all the same. Would you rather have to swipe your credit card before the police will help you? 5. Fire Dept. - Hopefully you have never had a fire in your home. But if you have, you probably called your local taxpayer-funded fire department to put the fire out. Like police, this is state socialism. You tax dollars are used to rescue your entire community in case of a fire. It use to be set up where you would pay a fee every month to the fire dept. for their service. If you didn't pay, they let your house burn down. Sadly, a man from Tennessee had this exact situation happen to him in 2011 because he didn't pay his 75.00 fee. I guess that small town in Tennessee would rather let people's houses burn down that resort to evil socialism. So don't take for granted the fact that you have a 24/7 fire dept. to put out your burning home thanks to socialism. 6. Postal Service - Like having mail delivered directly to your front door and paying next to nothing to send mail anywhere you want? Well it's all made possible by socialism. 7. Student Loans and Grants - Did you go to College? If you did, you family might not have been rich enough to pay your way through. So you got your education anyway through student loans and grants from the federal government at taxpayer expense. Of course you have to pay back the loans, but if not the government, did you know anyone else who was going to lend you tens of thousands of dollars? Probably not. So the taxpayers lent you the money and you paid it back with slight interest. The government grants you accepted were gifts from the taxpayer and the federal government that you did not have to pay back. Socialism got you through school. 8. Bridges - Along with our highways, our government used your taxpayer dollars to build bridges. This allows the public to travel across rivers without having to sail or swim. 9. Garbage Collection - Like having your garbage collected once a week instead of having to drive it to the landfill yourself? Thank socialism. 10. Public Landfills - Taxpayer dollars are used to have places to dump all of our garbage that is collected by taxpayer funded garbage men. 11. War - That's right! War would not be possible without socialism. Your tax dollars are used to fight wars for your country. This is Big Government at it's biggest. Private companies don't attack other countries, at least not yet. Government is the only entity in America that can defend us from foreign enemies and our tax dollars are used for every second of it. Socialism has brought down Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein, and Bin Laden. War may very well be the most socialist thing on this list. 12. Farm Subsidies - Our government uses taxpayer funds to pay farmers and businesses to provide their income and keep them growing food for the public. 13. CIA - The Central Intelligence Agency is vital to America's security. The CIA is completely taxpayer funded to protect the public from enemies. 14. FBI - The Federal bureau of investigations is a taxpayer funded government agency. 15. Congressional Health Care - As Republicans in congress warn us of the evils of government-run health care, most of them are covered by taxpayer-funded government-run health care. You literally pay for their health care while they tell you that paying for your neighbors health care through a public option or single-payer system is socialism. They are 100% correct, it is socialism. They're just not telling you that they like their socialist health care, they just don't think you should have it. They are afraid you might like it better than the private insurance you have now that funds their campaigns and gives them money to push what is best for them and not for you. Members of congress are free to opt out of their evil government health care, but most of them don't because deep down, they like socialism too. 16. Polio Vaccine - In the 1950's polio ravaged the United States. Until Dr. Jonas Salk invented a cure, finally ridding America of this terrible disease. Dr. Salk could have sold his vaccine in the free market and made millions and millions of dollars. Instead he gave it to the federal government to begin eradicating polio. He said that he made plenty of money as a scientist and felt it was too important to try and profit from or create a business around. 17. EPA - Republicans hate this taxpayer-funded government program because they have the nerve to tell corporations that they may have to follow environmental rules ad regulations for the greater good of the earth and the people who live on it. But if you don't like breathing mercury, drinking dirty water, and breathing in chemicals, you should like this example of socialism working for the people. 18. Social Security - You pay a tax to help ensure that our grandparents and senior citizens of America have money to live off of when they are retired or too elderly to work. I love hearing rich people bitch about this one because the truth is that they do not pay a social security tax, like most payroll taxes. This little piece of socialism helps prevent our senior citizens from sinking into poverty and starving to death. 19. Museums - Many museums are privately owned by organizations and groups, but many are also taxpayer-funded state, national, and federal museums. 20. Public Schools - Can't afford to send your children to an expensive private school? Thanks to socialism and government, you child can still get an education. Public education has been under attack for decades in this country by the radical right because public schools don't teach Christianity to your children and it enables people like Barack Obama to work hard, gain scholarships, and eventually become President of the United States. 21. Jail/Prison System - Many murders and criminals are behind bars right now and not out on the streets because of our taxpayer-funded, federal and state run jails and prisons. Taxpayer money is collected and used to help protect all of society from murders, molesters, rapist, etc. I know there's a lot of disagreement and controversy about how to handle our prison system, but I think we can all agree that serial killers should not be freed into society. There are also many private prisons in the United States. However, they have a higher escape rate than their socialist counterpart. Besides, don't you see the bad incentives in having a private prison system that profits from having people in prison? Since a business's top goal is to make more money than the year before, the only feasible agenda would be to get everyone in prison. 22. Corporate/Business Subsidies - This is the type of socialism that is acceptable in the Republican party. You tax dollars are given to big corporations to do things they should be doing anyway out of morals and ethics. Like not sending jobs overseas and hiring people. Wouldn't you like a nice big check just for not breaking the law? To be fair though, many businesses do earn their subsidies by advancing green technology and practice, donating to charity, helping communities, etc. They aren't all bad. People just get mad when big billionaire oil companies get billions of their taxpayer dollars while they're paying 4 at the pump. For the corporations that don't earn their subsidies other than donating to their very own political party, it's merely welfare. Though however you look at it, it is socialism. 23. Veteran's (VA) Health Care - Our soldiers bravely go to foreign countries and risk their lives at the request of their government and the American people. For those who survive, we as a country feel committed and obligated to ensure that they have everything they need for the rest of their lives for their service to us in which we could never fully repay. So we the taxpayers fund their health care in a government-run single-payer system for veterans. Many soldiers return with mental and/or physical health issues that would cost them thousands in a private health care plan. Socialism funds the military, the overall war, and also takes care of our troops when they return home. 24. Public Parks - Like going to the park on a sunny day? Just being able to walk right in, or at the worse pay a small fee? This is once again the work of socialism. If it were private, it wouldn't be a park, it would be someones back yard. That small or non-existent fee will turn into a 15 fee faster than you can say \\"No Trespassing\\". 25. All Elected Government Officials - From the Supreme Court, to the President of the United States and all the way down to the County Dog Catcher, taxpayers pay their salary and provide the funding for them to do their job. We pay for every aspect of their job. So in a sense, I guess you could say our whole country is run on socialism. 26. Food Stamps - Republicans fill with bitter contempt knowing that our government at the expense of the taxpayer is giving poor people money to buy food they couldn't otherwise afford. This, like welfare, is what the right thinks socialism is all about, along with mass murder. However, just like corporate welfare, welfare is socialism. I'll just end this one with a quick story. I have been down and out in periods of my life and sought assistance via food stamps. Even though I was what anyone would consider poor, I was not poor enough to get food stamps. Which means people who do get them, must really, really need them. As far as my personal experience, they weren't thrown around like candy the way the right would have you believe. 27. Sewer System - Do you like having a sewer system to remove waste and prevent pollution and disease from seeping into our environment? Thank the taxpayers of America and the socialist system it operates in. 28. Medicare - Medicare is one of the most liked socialist programs in America. Most of us don't mind paying taxes to provide our senior citizens with health care and hope the next generation will do the same for us. If you don't believe me, just look at almost any poll. Most seniors would not be able to afford private health care. So this form of socialism is a life saver for this nation's grandparents and senior citizens. 29. Court System - Whether it's the murder trial of the century or a case in a small claims court, the taxpayers of America fully fund our courts and legal process. You may pay for your own lawyer, but the courtroom, judge, and jury is paid for through socialist means. 30. Bird Flu Vaccine - You don't have bird flu right now and probably aren't worried about it because our federal government used taxpayer funds to pump vaccines all over America. 31. G.I. Bill - The G.I. bill allows veterans to pursue an education by using taxpayer dollars to help them pay for most of their schooling. It also helps them with loans, savings, and unemployment benefits. 32. Hoover Dam - Remember when our country use to build things? Our government built the Hoover Dam using taxpayer funds. It is now a vital source of power for the west coast. 33. State/City Zoos - American families have been going to the zoo for generations. A place where kids and adults can have fun seeing creatures and animals from all over the world and learn at the same time. Many zoos are ran by the state and/or city, using taxpayer funds to operate and even bring the animals to the zoo. 34. IRS - I know, the IRS is about as popular and well liked in America as a hemorrhoid, but think about it. The IRS is the reason that we have anything. The IRS collects taxpayer funds for the federal government. The government then dispenses these funds to our military, states, and social programs. If there is no one collecting taxes, no one will pay them. If no one pays taxes, our country shuts down. Without money to operate, nothing operates. This may sound like a good thing to some radical republicans, but for those of us with sense, we know this means anarchy in the USA. The IRS gets a bad rap because if you don't pay your taxes or owe them money, they can be ruthless. Like everything else, the IRS is not perfect, but without them we literally have no country or no means to run it. 35. Free Lunch Program - Some children are living in poverty by no fault of their own. I'm not saying it is even their parents fault, but you surely cannot blame a child for the situation they are born into. In most if not all states, there are programs where children who live in poor households can receive school lunch for free. The taxpayers of the state pay for this. Sounds like socialism to me, and also the moral and Christian thing to do. 36. The Pentagon - Our defense system in America is a socialist system from top to bottom. We as taxpayers fund the pentagon completely. 37. Medicaid - Our government uses taxpayer funds to provide health care for low-income people. Republicans, the compassionate Christians that they are, absolutely hate this program. What they fail to understand is that when people can't afford to pay their outrageous medical bills, they don't. This bill does not disappear. The loss that the insurance company, doctor's office, or hospital takes gets passed down to everyone else. So covering people and giving them a low-income option reduces costs for them and everyone else. This is the main argument behind a health care mandate. It's not to force you to buy health care out of cruelty. If everyone is covered, costs drop for everyone. If you have no compassion for the uninsured, you can at least understand the rational in a selfish sense. 38. FDA - The Food and Drug Administration is far from perfect. It is infested with corporate corruption and they have been wrong many, many times. Countless times they have approved things that they later have to apologize for and have banned things that would have helped people. However, they have also stopped many harmful foods and products from being sold to the public and protect us everyday from poisons being disguised as products. While not perfect, they are needed to prevent harmful food and drugs from being sold to you and you family. Without them, corporations can send whatever they want to your supermarkets and drug stores without any testing or evaluation. I don't mind my taxes going towards a middle man to inspect the safety of the products we are being sold everyday. 39. Health Care for 9/11 Rescue Workers - After beating back GOP obstruction, Democrats finally passed a bill last year to allow government to help 9/11 rescue worker's with their health care after many came down with horrible lung diseases from the toxins they breathed in rescuing people from smoldering buildings. These brave citizens risked their lives and health to help complete strangers. They deserve more, but covering their health care is a good start. 40. Swine Flu Vaccine - Do you have swine flu right now? Then thank government and the socialist structure. 41. Disability Insurance (SSDI) - For those who are disabled and cannot work, our government provides an income for them via taxpayer dollars as opposed to the other option of letting them starve to death. 42. Town/State Run Beaches - Like going to the beach? Like it when the beach is clean and safe? Like having lifeguards on staff in case of an emergency? Then once again, thank the taxpayers and the socialist structure that makes it all possible. 43. Corporate Bailouts/Welfare - The whole point of this post is to prove that we ALL use, benefit from, and like socialism. This example is a form of socialism that the republicans not only like, but fight tooth and nail for. They don't like it when socialism is used for working/poor people, but when it's for millionaires and their corporate donors, socialism becomes as American as apple pie. The middle/working class who are the majority of taxpayers pay for welfare for corporations and people who have more money than all of us combined. When our government bails out a bank or gives a subsidy to a billion dollar corporation, you are paying for it. 44. State Construction - Ever see those construction workers in your town fixing potholes, erecting buildings, repaving highways and roads, and fixing things all over town? They themselves and the work they do is taxpayer-funded state socialism. 45. Unemployment Insurance - All your working life, you pay payroll taxes. Some of these taxes go toward a program that temporarily provides for people who lost their jobs until they can find another one. You pay for others, others pay for you. Especially these days, you never know when you might lose your job. You may need temporary assistance until you get back on your feet. The government recognizes this. UI also keeps the economy moving in times of recession because people still have some money in their pockets to buy goods and promote demand. 46. City/Metro Buses - If you lack transportation, you can catch a city bus. Taxpayer funds and the fee you pay to take the bus make it possible for millions of people to go to work. 47. WIC - WIC is a federally funded program to assist women, infants, and children. WIC helps low-income families by providing funding for nutrition, education, and health care for children. 48. State Snow Removal - Even though sometimes it may take them longer than you like to get to your street, do you like having snow plow service to clear our roads and highways in the winter? This is a state socialist taxpayer-funded service. 49. PBS (Public Broadcasting Service) - PBS operates on donations and government funding. The provide non-partisan news and information to the public. They are the home of Sesame Street, Masterpiece Theater, and The Antiques Roadshow. Surveys show that they are literally the most trusted name in news. I wonder how Fox feels about that? 50. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - The CDC helps promote and enact the health and safety of the public along with helping to prevent and control illness and disease. The CDC is a government program that operates on taxpayer funding. 51. Welfare - Is there anything the republicans hate more? Of course I'm talking about the welfare that goes to poor people. Corporate welfare is not only accepted in the republican Kabul, but it's mandatory that we give our tax dollars to billionaires and not question the logic of it. Though if you look at it realistically and not through the red scare glasses in which the right sees the world, welfare helps the economy. As I've said many times, when poor people have money in their pocket, they buy things made and sold by companies. This creates a demand. To keep up with demand, businesses must hire to keep up. If you yanked everyone who is on welfare off of it tomorrow, the economy would take a blow and lose jobs due to the down tick in consumer demand because we just took what little money they had away. 52. Public Street Lighting - Like being able to see at night when you walk or drive? Thank Socialism. 53. FEMA - If Disaster strikes, FEMA is there to help pick up the pieces. As a part of homeland security and an agency of the federal government, they use taxpayer dollars to help cities, states, and towns recover and rebuild. I don't know to many private companies that could assist in disaster relief and ask nothing in return. Thank God for socialism. 54. Public Defenders - Ever been in trouble and couldn't afford a lawyer? Well the taxpayers and the government make sure you still get representation. 55. S-CHIP (State Children's Health Insurance Program) - S-CHIP is a program that matches funds to states for health insurance for children in families that cannot afford insurance but make too much to qualify for Medicaid. Your tax dollars go towards covering uninsured children, is that so wrong? 56. Amtrak - Amtrak transports tens of millions of passengers a year in 46 states and three Canadian Providences. It is owned by the federal government and your tax dollars are used to fund it. All aboard!! 57. NPR - National Public Radio operates on private and federal funding along with public donations. NPR has been one of the most trusted news sources in America for over 40 years. 58. The Department of Homeland Security - Created after the terrorist attacks on 9/11, this heavily federally funded department of the U.S. government helps protect us from future terrorist attacks. This is the third largest department within the United States government. 59. OSHA - Do you have a safe and healthy workplace that provides training, outreach, education, and assistance? Thank OSHA! Brought to you by the taxpayers of America and socialism. 60. State and National Monuments - The Lincoln Memorial. Mount Rushmore. The D.C. National Mall. All brought to you and maintained with your tax dollars. Socialism is patriotic? 61. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) - The USDA enforces regulations on the farming, agriculture, and food industries to ensure food safety, natural resources, and hunger worldwide and in the United States. Your tax dollars are used to help keep what you are eating safe and even feed those who are not eating. 62. Government Scholarships - if you work hard in school and show true potential, our government will give you a scholarship towards college so you can advance your education. Your tax dollars have been used to send future doctors, lawyers, scientists, and even presidents of the United States to college. 63. Department of Health and Human Service - The overall goal of HHS is to promote, implement, and ensure the health of the American people. Your tax dollars are used to do this. Government looking out for the well being of it's people, imagine that! 64. Census Bureau - Every ten years, our government collects data about our people and economy, to better serve and represent us. From the forms that are sent to your home for you to fill out and send back in and to the census worker who shows up and kindly asks you to fill out the form if you don't send it in, all taxpayer funded socialism. The information collected is used to better understand the economic situation and population in your area. Not to enslave you in a FEMA camp. 65. Department of Energy - This taxpayer funded cabinet of the federal government oversees nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors, energy conservation, radioactive waste disposal, and energy production. To those of you who care about our environment and would rather not witness a nuclear holocaust might consider this money well spent. 66. Customs and Border Protection - the CBP is the largest law enforcement agency in America. This is big government that republicans actually do like because they don't like Mexicans immigrating to our country like our ancestors did. However, this taxpayer funded, socialist agency of the federal government regulates trade, imports, and immigration. 67. Department of Education - This cabinet of the federal government is actually the smallest. They administer and oversee federal assistance to education. They also collect data and enforce federal laws and regulations involving education. Even though the right thinks that this department is indoctrinating your children, they actually have no control over curriculum or standards. 68. Secret Service - Your tax dollars are used to provide highly-trained, skilled professional bodyguards to protect the President of the United States. 69. Peace Corps - The Peace Corps is a volunteer program run by the government that helps people outside of the US to understand our culture as well as helping us learn about other cultures. However they are more well known for their work with economic and social development in less-fortunate countries. Sounds very Christian for being a socialist program, huh? 70. Department of Justice - The DOJ is responsible for enforcing the law. Socialism keeps our civilization intact. 71. National Weather Service - Like knowing when a storm, tornado, earthquake, or snow is coming? Socialism makes this possible and available to everyone. 72. The White House - Our taxpayer dollars through a socialist means pays for the house that the president and his family live in during a presidents time in office. 73. Government - Like it or not, our country would not be a country without a government. Every single day, government on state and local levels serve us in ways we simply take for granted. Government as an entity operates and functions on our tax dollars through a socialist structured funding system. From the military down to the county dog catcher, socialism turns the wheels that make our society function. 74. Law - Laws and rules make our democracy possible. Remove these laws and you have sheer anarchy. Laws do not appear out of thin air. To have law, you need a government. You need elected lawmakers to make the laws and a government to implement and enforce them. Socialism is responsible for every law in this country. Without our government and lawmakers which exist thanks to socialism, there would be no laws. So the laws themselves, are enforced and implemented thanks to socialism. 75. Civilization - As an American citizen, you enjoy freedoms that many in other countries do not. Like anything else in this world, our government is not perfect, but you should be thankful everyday that your country has a government that feels an obligation to serve the people and protect their rights and freedoms. This is completely possible because of government, taxes, and socialism. Do you think the private sector would do a better job of governing our country? Do you think corporations would enact laws to help protect and serve you and your family or them and their profits? The reason you can read this blog and the reason I can write it whether you agree with it or not is because of the freedoms we have here in America enforced and protected through socialist means. Our entire civilization depends on us being a people united. Socialism is a glue that binds us together and makes possible the things that we could not accomplish as individuals working against each other. I don't care who you are. You benefit from at least one or more of these 75 American Government-Run, Taxpayer funded Socialist programs, agencies, and laws. My overall argument is not for a completely socialist nation. This would not work. A completely capitalist nation would not work either. I'm just simply saying that I, as a Democratic Socialist, feel that the two can co-exist. I know this because they always have. Socialism and capitalism have always co-existed in America. I also believe in freedom. I believe options are a form of freedom. Right now in the United States of America, I can send mail through the public postal service or I can choose a private option like FedEx. I can send my kids to public school or private school. As liberals, we don't want a government takeover, we want options. We think we should have the freedom to be able to choose to have government health care if we don't like our private plan. If we are 18-64, we have no options or freedom over our own health care. I don't understand why this isn't viewed as a corporate takeover of health care. Socialism is not a bad thing. It is a foundation in this country of ours. Claiming socialism is bad because of radical and non-factual comparisons to Hitler and Stalin is like saying all guns are bad because of the Columbine killers and Jared Loughner. National socialism and communism are very, very different from Democratic Socialism here in America. I'd explain further but this topic is for another post, this one is long enough. Besides, socialism defeated Hitler. So let's just stop the madness and have a serious discussion about socialism and the role it plays in America. \\"Let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an alien power over us.

The barn used to be red colored. Is there a specific barn red color that was used in the early 1900s? Why did they use red anyway?","output":"I’m doing some restoration work on an old barn. The barn used to be red colored. Is there a specific barn red color that was used in the early 1900s? Why did they use red anyway? Okay, before I get into busting the plethora of disinformation that is so prevalent on the Internet, let me answer the basic questions first. Is there a specific barn red color that was used in the early 1900s?Yes. The specific color would that color associated with the paint ingredients that were available locally, or that were commonly available via routine commerce. Typically the red color came from iron oxide which is both mined and produced as a byproduct of iron working; the other source was iron-rich clay deposits. Thus, the particular color shade will be determined by what was available locally because in some cases it was local clays that were used for the colorant which is why local colors can vary from vibrant red to yellow-red or brown-red. In other cases it was not uncommon to find barns painted yellows, browns or even blues based upon what materials were available in that geographical area. In some cases plain old limewash was used making the barns white, but then they turned yellow or gray with age; some were stained by the dust blowing off plowed fields making for varying colors. Secondly, the shade will vary depending upon the other base ingredients such as whether it was milk paint or limewash. Milkpaint produces a darker color while limewash base produces a much lighter color. Why did they use red anyway?Simple fact of the matter is that red is one of the most common natural pigments and it’s a bright cheery color especially considering that most of the red barns were locate in areas that suffer through long ugly winters. Now it’s time to bust some of the Internet disinformation… Red Lead was not used as barn paint unless someone got it for free because the cost to produce red lead oil-base paint was quite high … and Red Lead is actually orange and is readily visible by looking at the Golden Gate bridge which is painted the color “International Orange” which is produced using Red Lead. Thus, unless the farmer was incredible rich and his barn was international orange color, rest assured that it wasn’t painted with red lead paint. Red Lead oil-base paint was typically only used on very expensive steel structures like the Golden Gate bridge. Blood paint isn’t red, it’s brown and doesn’t hold up at all in the environment unless it’s in a milkpaint or limewash base, and nonetheless, it will dry to a brown hue. White Lead is NOT used as a colorant in paint, it’s used as a curing agent and cured film strengthener. Titanium dioxide is the primary white pigment used, zinc oxide is secondary and was most common historically. White lead is nearly translucent when added to oil-base paint and using enough to turn the oil white would result in smearing on a dry paste which is nothing like any kind of “paint”. Small amounts of white lead and limestone are used as a curing agent in oil-base paints and varnishes. Milkpaint is made from skim milk, not sour milk. Lead-base paints are no more toxic to WDOs (Wood Destroying Organisms) than any other paint. Oil-based paints are more resistant to WDOs because it’s a stronger and deeper penetrating coating than modern latex. Milkpaint is also more resistant to WDOs than modern latex paints. The best protection from WDOs is provided by real limewash. Both limewash and milkpaint benefit from the addition of copper acetate in the admixture. Real limewash cannot be made with calcium hydroxide (slaked lime a/k/a masonry or garden lime), it must be made from calcium oxide (unslaked lime a/k/a quick or hot lime)."},{"instruction":"What do I need to know about the University of Toronto?","output":"GET INVOLVED!

It'd rather depends on what's going on with NASA at the time and what the political climate is. The truth is that NASA does sometimes release certain information somewhat prematurely just because it spurs interest in what NASA is doing. Certainly they are very careful not to claim things that aren't true. But it would be expected that they would release photos of something they say that some scientists are speculating could be a fossil. The truth is that there could be a lot of debate as to what they have found really is. Remember many years ago when that Mars Rock was found on Earth that had what some scientists were speculating could be fossils? It took a very long time for most scientists to be convinced that they were not fossils, and even at that there's still some debate on the subject. If potential fossils are found on Mars, it could take years of study to establish whether or not they are truly fossils. NASA certainly isn't going to sit on the information for all that time."},{"instruction":"Why does Modi celebrate Deepavali every year with the Indian Army, even though India is a secular country, and he does not celebrate other religious festivals?","output":"Ok! I don’t have a large following in Quora but after seeing so many answers to this highly contentious question, I feel that I should get a say in from the “secular” perspective. First of all, let’s answer the question. The constitution gives us the freedom to follow any religion(s). The same applies to the PM believe it or not (as he/she is not a French citizen but an Indian citizen). So, it is ridiculous to demand that the PM should celebrate Eid, Christmas and all other festivals. The PM has every right to celebrate Diwali and not Eid if he wants to. Anyone forcing him to celebrate all festivals or no festivals at all is going against the constitution. What’s more. The OP is thoroughly confused. Eid is celebrated not Ramadan. Celebration begins when Ramadan ends! Ramadan is essentially a month of fasting and refraining from “evil” deeds. Now, coming to secularism of the constitution as per my understanding. India’s constitution is essentially secular in the sense that it does not follow any particular religion. The articles in the Indian constitution are not based on Gita/Quran/Bible etc etc. The constitution is based on the simple premise of justice, equality and liberty for all citizens across gender, caste and religion. It is concise and precise with very less ambiguity. It does not have to be re-interpreted like majority of the religious texts to reconcile with changing times. Provisions can be added/deleted/amended (unlike in case of religious texts) as per the needs of the ever-changing society. Note: I said that the religious texts themselves cannot be “amended” but the interpretation may change (and it should change). Understanding religious texts is difficult because most are written in languages that majority of Indians are clueless about (read: Sanskrit, Arabic). The constitution is however easy to understand (available in Hindi/English/and all other regional languages). The constitution deals with the problems that the nation faces now and is likely to face in the future (not the problems of 5000 years ago or 7th century). So, the constitution is most certainly “irreligious” which translates to “secular” even though the word was not used while drafting it. Another thing to note is that, a secular constitution does not demand it’s citizens to be secular too. Given the diversity and complexity within the nation, a “secular” constitution is a must (more of a compulsion) to accommodate all these different ideas/beliefs which are often conflicting in nature. But, it must always stand behind it’s fundamental premise i.e. justice, equality and liberty for all citizens across gender, caste and religion especially when religion/caste-ism threatens this. So any regressive practice in the name of religion has to be outlawed. A uniform civil code has to be implemented and religion should be relegated to the personal sphere which is precisely what secularism entails. Things like personal law boards, caste-based reservation (was a temporary measure) etc etc are dilution of secularism and have to be done away with. We must strengthen the secularism of the constitution to ensure that our country continues in the progressive path and not abuse it by using terms like “sickularism”! I get that it is intended to be used for the “pseudo-secularists” but abusing/misunderstanding the term is not going to help. Secularism is not over-rated, it is the oxygen of the nation. Without it, our nation is bound to fall into anarchy. It is indispensable whether anyone likes it or not! Jai Hind! PS: I feel I have to mention this as well. A secular constitution calls for separation of religion and state (governance, law etc etc). It has never been against personal faith. It gives freedom to everyone to follow any religion personally. So, don’t bring up “France” as an argument and point at how they have banned “religious attires”! Banning people from wearing a certain dress (based on personal choice) is not secularism. France is not India. Here, diversity is respected and culture is preserved. Just that governance should be free of religious influences and basically focus on progress and development of a scientific outlook among the citizens."},{"instruction":"any way?","output":"Yes.

There were a few generals who did that, after failing to break out, for example, Gen. Gunther Angern, commander of the 16th Panzer Division, tried to slip away on Feb 2, after the surrender but when he failed, he shot himself. Surely, there were others. But there seems to be many, many more who had already passed through the cauldron of self-doubt and self-destruction. The 90,000 men who survived at the time of the surrender already had plenty of time to die - they wanted to live. Even the soldiers lying in their own filth, covered with lice in the underground hospitals who surely were going to die anyway wanted to survive, that is, until the Russians came down and burned them alive. So the the 90,000 who surrendered were determined to survive. Sadly, many of them were not in any condition to survive and 45,000 were dead in a month. Already weakened, starving, ill-clothed, sick and exhausted they simply couldn’t endure the march to captivity and were shot or bayoneted to death by the Russians, or put into unheated rail cars with no food or water until they froze to death, or were starved to death or even died of thirst and dysentery since there was no water on their journey. The 45,000 who survived were men who wanted to live. They had survived combat and privation and cold weather and betrayal by Hitler and Paulus and Manstein. Most of them would die anyway, since only about 5 or 6000 German soldiers and about 10,000 Italian soldiers ever returned from the Russian prisons ten years later, after being starved and beaten and tortured and overworked and abused in every possible way. Those men really wanted to live. There were plenty of men who killed themselves in captivity. You can read about them in the stories of Gottfried Bidermann and Hans von Luck and Gunter Keshschorekk, who encountered them while in incarceration themselves, saw them as emaciated scarecrows, close to death, dressed in rags. And when they wanted to die, they just sat back against a wall and gave up. They gave up and were dead in a day. The survivors were of one mind about this: those who surrendered to despair died very quickly despite food or warmth or companionship or the efforts of others to keep them alive. You always must have that one thing that you believe, that you focus on and if it deserts you and you succumb to despair, you will die very, very quickly. There were others, Stalingrad prisoners who would run into the electrified fencing, or attempt to escape through the wire to be shot at and killed. When they had had enough, they would die by doing things that would kill them. But by the actual surrender, the men who were going to die, had already died. The men who surrendered wanted to live. Some would kill themselves; some would be hunted down by the Russians while attempting to escape. And there would never be the enormous numbers as there were in Berlin at the end when literally piles of bodies were found in the cemeteries where people pulled the gun from the dead hand of the owner and shot themselves and then their wife would do the same thing, and so on. There were no piles of the dead from suicide. There were piles of the dead, of course, frozen into blocks, staring forever through frozen eyes, but they were killed in combat or from wounds, not suicide."},{"instruction":"f Parshuram is the incarnation of Vishnu, then why didn't Parshuram recognize Ram during the breaking of the Shiva bow event?","output":"Thanks for Q2A, No offense, beleive me, “Every country has their own version of the same Ramayana & Mahabharata in various names” so it is not India where these epics took place, but these were from “distant lands” water downed generation to generation by persons in every country!

Jupiter and Saturn were the real mission. Voyager 1 managed to also closely fly by Saturn’s moon Titan, but doing so left it in a position that forced a miss on Uranus and Neptune, so it was mission over, left coasting on a course out of the system with no further destination. Voyager 2 on the other hand, took the full tour, all four gas giants, before also running out of targets and coasting on outwards. BUT Unlike your question, in fact Voyager 1 and 2 were not at all dying, they were young and full of power, since as usual NASA had dramatically overdesigned them. Systems still operational, power still available, and the ability to relay signals still intact, a new extended mission for each was devised. They coasted outwards, further and further from the Sun, taking readings of the environment where no human instruments had ever gone. Eventually Voyager 1 reached the Heliopause, the outer limits of solar wind, true interstellar space. And sent readings and signals back on the transition, and then on the nature of that interstellar space medium and how it differed from the solar system. Recently, Voyager 2 did the same, and with a different instrument set still operational, information not only on a different area of the heliopause and of interstellar space itself, but also of different sorts. The power sources on these things are radioactive, and have an 89 year “half life” which means that in 89 years they will only be generating half the power they generated at launch. Some instruments have failed with time, others have been turned off because less and less power is available. But they may still be out there transmitting interesting information with some of their instruments when I die. Or when you die. Are you “dying” just because eventually you will? They aren’t dying.

Its a New Zealander's view on corruption in India Indians are Hobbesian: (have a culture of self interest) Corruption in India is a cultural aspect. Indians seem to think nothing peculiar about corruption. It is prevalent. Indians tolerate corrupt individuals rather than correct them. No race can be congenitally corrupt. To know why Indians are corrupt, look at their patterns and practices. Firstly: Religion is transactional in India. Indians give God cash and anticipate an out-of-turn reward. Such a plea acknowledges that favours are needed for the undeserving. In the world outside the temple walls, such a transaction is named “bribe”. A wealthy Indian gives not cash to temples, but gold crowns and such baubles. His gifts can not feed the poor. His pay-off is for God. He thinks it will be wasted if it goes to a needy man. In June 2009, The Hindu published a report of Karnataka minister G. Janardhan Reddy gifting a crown of gold and diamonds worth Rs 45 crore to Tirupati. India’s temples collect so much that they don't know what to do with it. Billions are gathering dust in temple vaults. When Europeans came to India they built schools. When Indians go to Europe & USA, they build temples. Indians believe that if God accepts money for his favours, then nothing is wrong in doing the same thing. This is why Indians are so easily corruptible. Indian culture accommodates such transaction First: Morally. There is no real stigma. An utterly corrupt politician can make a comeback, just unthinkable in the West. Secondly: Indian moral ambiguity towards corruption is visible in its history. Indian history tells of the capture of cities and kingdoms after guards were paid off to open the gates, and commanders paid off to surrender. This is unique to India. Indians' corrupt nature has meant limited warfare on the subcontinent. It is striking how little Indians have actually fought compared to ancient Greece and modern Europe. The Turk's battles with Nadir Shah were vicious and fought to the finish. In India fighting wasn't needed, bribing was enough to see off armies. Any invader willing to spend cash could brush aside India’s kings, no matter how many tens of thousands soldiers were in their infantry. Little resistance was given by the Indians at the “Battle” of Plassey. Clive paid off Mir Jaffar and all of Bengal folded to an army of 3,000. There was always a financial exchange to taking Indian forts. Golconda was captured in 1687 after the secret back door was left open. Mughals vanquished Marathas and Rajputs with nothing but bribes. The Raja of Srinagar gave up Dara Shikoh’s son Sulaiman to Aurangzeb after receiving a bribe. There are many cases where Indians participated on a large scale in treason due to bribery. Question is: Why Indians have a transactional culture while other 'civilized' nations don't? Thirdly: Indians do not believe in the theory that they all can rise if each of them behaves morally, because that is not the message of their faith. Their caste system separates them. They don't believe that all men are equal. This resulted in their division and migration to other religions. Many Hindus started their own faith like Sikh, Jain, Buddha and many converted to Christianity and Islam. The result is that Indians don't trust one another. There are no Indians in India, there are Hindus, Christians, Muslims and what not. Indians forget that 1400 years ago they all belonged to one faith. This division evolved an unhealthy culture. The inequality has resulted in a corrupt society, in India every one is thus against everyone else, except God and even he must be bribed. *BRIAN from* *Godzone NEW ZEALAND* Sadly....yes !

Are they actually trained to take down threats? What weapons do they have?","output":"You’ve asked three questions - not one. Let’s break that down a bit, shall we? What’s the point of the British Guards?Are they actually trained to take down threats?What weapons do they have? Question 1: I suppose they have multiple purposes. It seems to me that firstly, the Guards do protect the palace in a meaningful manner (more on that later). Furthermore, the positioning of the Guards, in their traditional dress, is no doubt a huge tourist attraction - the money earned far exceeds any potential losses the UK faces due to their posting. Question 2: Remember when I talked about protecting the palace? Yeah, this is where I’ll cover that. The Guards are made up of five regiments: The Grenadier GuardsThe Coldstream GuardsThe Scots GuardsThe Irish GuardsThe Welsh Guards Each of these regiments is incredibly skilled and talented at what they do - let’s look at the Grenadier Guards’ colors: And that’s not all of their awards. Doubting their skill and bravery yet? Then I give you the story of a certain James Ashworth. His Victoria Cross citation: St James’s Palace, London SW1 22 March 2013 The Queen has been graciously pleased to approve the award of the Victoria Cross to the under-mentioned: ARMY Lance Corporal James Thomas Duane Ashworth, Grenadier Guards, 25228593 (killed in action). On the 13th June 2012 the conspicuous gallantry under fire of Lance Corporal Ashworth, a section second-in-command in 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards Reconnaissance Platoon, galvanised his platoon at a pivotal moment and led to the rout of a determined enemy grouping in the Nahr-e-Saraj District of Helmand Province. The two aircraft inserting the Reconnaissance Platoon on an operation to neutralise a dangerous insurgent sniper team, were hit by enemy fire as they came into land. Unflustered, Ashworth – a young and inexperienced noncommissioned officer – raced 300 metres with his fire-team into the heart of the insurgent dominated village. Whilst two insurgents were killed and two sniper rifles recovered in the initial assault, an Afghan Local Police follow-up attack stalled when a patrolman was shot and killed by a fleeing enemy. Called forward to press-on with the attack, Ashworth insisted on moving to the front of his fire team to lead the pursuit. Approaching the entrance to a compound from which enemy machine gun fire raged, he stepped over the body of the dead patrolman, threw a grenade and surged forward. Breaking into the compound Ashworth quickly drove the insurgent back and into an out-building from where he now launched his tenacious last stand. The village was now being pressed on a number of fronts by insurgents desperate to relieve their prized sniper team. The platoon needed to detain or kill the final sniper, who had been pinned down by the lead fire team, and extract as quickly as possible. Ashworth realised that the stalemate needed to be broken, and broken quickly. He identified a low wall that ran parallel to the front of the outbuilding from which the insurgent was firing. Although only knee high, he judged that it would provide him with just enough cover to get sufficiently close to the insurgent to accurately post his final grenade. As he started to crawl behind the wall and towards the enemy, a fierce fire fight broke out just above his prostrate body. Undaunted by the extraordinary danger – a significant portion of his route was covered from view but not from fire – Ashworth grimly continued his painstaking advance. After three minutes of slow crawling under exceptionally fierce automatic fire he had edged forward fifteen metres and was now within five metres of the insurgent’s position. Desperate to ensure that he succeeded in accurately landing the grenade, he then deliberately crawled out from cover into the full view of the enemy to get a better angle for the throw. By now enemy rounds were tearing up the ground mere centimetres from his body, and yet he did not shrink back. Then, as he was about to throw the grenade he was hit by enemy fire and died at the scene. Ashworth’s conspicuous gallantry galvanised his platoon to complete the clearance of the compound. Despite the ferocity of the insurgent’s resistance, Ashworth refused to be beaten. His total disregard for his own safety in ensuring that the last grenade was posted accurately was the gallant last action of a soldier who had willingly placed himself in the line of fire on numerous occasions earlier in the attack. This supremely courageous and inspiring action deserves the highest recognition.

Only 14 men have received this award since WW2. Only 14. Out of the millions of soldiers who have come and gone in the British Army since then, only 14 have received this honor. One of those bravehearts is Lance Corporal Ashworth. So I think I’ve proven, sufficiently, that they are professionals. Let’s move on to the third point: What weapons do they carry? They carry the British standard issue SA-80 rifle, with a bayonet attached (I think). That’s all there is to it. Of course, they have been trained (extensively) in the usage of said rifle and other arms.

Most people realise this once they have grown up. Think about it - how can we feel or experience anything, once our brain has ceased to function after death? The concept of hell probably comes from Gehenna, where the bodies of the unworthy were thrown. It was their dead bodies that were burned, not their souls. The valley probably had a surface oil seam hence the perpetual fire. From Google: Gehenna is a small valley in Jerusalem. In the Hebrew Bible, Gehenna was initially where some of the kings of Judah sacrificed their children by fire. Thereafter, it was deemed to be cursed (Book of Jeremiah 7:31, 19:2–6). In rabbinic literature, Gehenna is a destination of the wicked.

I’m now firmly in the senior citizen class, so, even in New York, I will often be offered a seat by a younger person. But I’m also still fairly healthy, and standing is usually not a problem. Following is the method that personally works well for me, and I have practiced it for years: I stand with my feet about 2–1/2 to 3 feet apart, slightly wider than my shoulders. Most of the jerks and movements will be along the longitudinal line of the train, but there will also be some side-to-side movement. I stand at about a 30-degree angle to the centerline of the train. That allows me to counteract acceleration, deceleration and sideways motion. And I always hold onto something. I prefer standing next to a pole with a hand holding it about chest high. I hold on during the entire journey, not hoping I can grab something when a sudden sharp jerk occurs. I put my phone in a front pocket so my other hand is also available if called into action. If I’m carrying something, I try to hold it in a way so that hand is marginally useful. You mentioned a crowded subway car, and in some cases I cannot get into my preferred position. I always try to get my feet into my preferred stance and then grab a hanger strap for stability. If all else fails, hope for a smooth ride or a kindly neighbor to assist if you stumble. Aside: while not directly related to NYC, if you ride the Tokyo subway during rush hour there is no need for any standing method. The cars are packed so tightly that you quickly become acquainted with those around you and no matter what movement the train makes you’re not going anywhere."},{"instruction":"Why is #ISRO trending on Twitter?","output":"My mother’s Generation ( born around 1945–55 or so) Food, water , electricity ,living space everything was scarce and rationed .

(There is NO specific order in the list. Don't misjudge) True Detective season 1 This is truly a masterpiece. Suspense in this series is really awesome, it's a slow pace series just like an iron rusts (pun intended). If you want some psychological thriller mixed with mystery then this is gonna be your favourite series. But sadly it went downhill after its first season. Since this is an anthology (in which the two seasons have nothing in common) so you can just leave it after the first season. Prison break season 1&2 If you are the one who loves suspense, plot twists then I don't think there's any thing that can surpass the first season of this show. Yes it's even more suspenseful than all the others listed here. Amount of brain used in this series is unmatchable with any other series. But sadly its other seasons are not as good as its first season. But still you should watch it atleast till the second season finishes. Alex mahone in the second season is the only reason I'm recommending it. Believe me, its first season is even more better than last two seasons of Breaking Bad. Breaking Bad Hey! Come on, how can someone answering this forget to mention this name, huh? This is legendary series in history of the tv cinema. It's a slow pace series, it might get a little boring in the initial seasons but believe me giving it up there would be the worst of the worst choices you can ever make in your life. Hannibal Believe me this series is going to be at the top of your list if you've enjoyed watching true detective or any other psychological thriller show. Some of you must have watched silence of the lamb, do you remember the name '’Hannibal Lector\\", oh how can you not!. This show has got very gore scenes. In the initial few episodes it can bore you a little but believe me once you get to the 8th episode of the first season, you'll become fan of Mads (actor who played Hannibal lector). The professional killer who is really 'professional’. I'm still fan of this show and especially the character Hannibal lector, mads is really a great actor. Dark If you love to watch sci-fi then this is another masterpiece for you. It has got very complicated plot, specially it would be hard for you to remember the relationships between the characters. I really enjoyed watching this show, i had to be a little alert while watching it. If anyone has loved watching the movie “Predestination\\", then here you've got a bigger cake of your flavour. Sherlock When I had watched this show first time, this had become my favourite show. I was surprised by the smartness of Sherlock Holmes and his super deductive power. But later on when i watched other smart tv series then i realised it was just some magically smart character that they were showing us. I just realised it and then it was really hard to digest the scenes that I've watched in it. But still I'd recommend to watch it, it's not bad. It's just like I had just overestimated it. House MD The protagonist “Dr. House\\" in this show is somewhat inspired from Sherlock (BBC version). But Dr. House is way more humerously rude than Sherlock or any other character. He is the wittiest character I've ever seen. Watch some of its funny clips on YouTube, you'll love this character once you witness his wittiness. Money Heist Another good show that could be better if they would have removed the unnecessary emotional dramas between the teammates of EI Professor. This show has got a really interesting character, EI Professor, a genius who had precalculated the moves played by policia. Except “Alicia Sierra\\" there was no one in this show who can match up to the professor's intelligence. And they made her in his team too. It has also got some stupid scenes with no logics at all. But still you can give it a try, it's worth to watch especially if you haven't tried the above mentioned shows. Given below are some shows which I'll watch in future or I'd be watching it at the time you are reading this answer. WestworldDexterNarcosBlack mirror And many more others.

(could probably regrow is eye if he wanted, but he doesn’t since he’s actually worse with it) Abilities/Skills: Strategics/Tactical Analysis: Slade is easily one of the greatest strategists and tactician on Earth. Always calculating his opponents moves before hand; he even single handedly defeated the JLA roster. Equal to Batman: Intimidation His height: LeadershipMartial Arts Skill: Slade was trained in hand-to-hand combat. While in the Army, he proved himself to be their best fighters. Later, he received martial arts training in several forms of combat. After mastering these martial arts he furthered his studies when he sought an assassin known as Natas to train him in the ways of Ninja and had studied assassination techniques. —->[LINKED_TEXT: Noah Heraman's answer to What is the Deathstroke fight style?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Deathstroke-fight-style/answer/Noah-Heraman?ch=10&share=c964fe29&srid=urOn0V]SwordsmanshipStealthMarksmanship he never misses: Weaponry: Slade is a natural expert and master of all forms of tools, weapons, and firearms.

Slade is superior physically in every way possible to Ra’s, the best change Ra’s has is making this a sword fight. and even then, Slades broad sword is much stronger and more powerful. It can cut through nearly anything: Slade is noted on the LOA and how they operate along with Ra’s al Ghul himself, so he basically has instant prep for this encounter which is practically granting him the win. so yeah, Ra’s definitely dies. as for Savage, he has impressive healing: [Scandal stabs him in the neck and stomach and he shrugs it off]: [LINKED_TEXT: An arrow through the brain and mouth barely slows him down] [URL: https://imgur.com/a/UYSXEiR]: [LINKED_TEXT: Being stabbed through the gut doesn't even impact him] [URL: https://imgur.com/a/oR9k3t3]: Regardless though, Slade would probably still put him down also. especially with Slades strength: And Promethium Broad Sword: He should still take out Savage with ease, since mostly the thing with Savage is that you can only scale him to other characters like Cyborg, Flash, and Aquaman who are characters Slade has fought and beaten. 1 pressure point should be more than enough to put Savage down: QUICK NOTE: That being that Slade took out with that pressure point is Crush whose Lobos daughter, who also like Lobo possesses accelerated healing to the point of being able to function after having blood drained from her body and falling off a cliff. (Given that she’s Lobos daughter alone, already should show you how powerful her healing is) either that, or Slade just one shots Savage with his plasma staff. Blows through Grundy (Grundy has accelerated healing): DEATHSTROKE (2016) ISSUE 40 (NOTE: Jericho did possess Grundys body, however Grundys durability was still intact with his accelerated healing.) so yeah, this goes to Deathstroke and it’s not even close. til next time, take care."},{"instruction":"Can someone who is wellinformed about guns tell me all the terminology related to guns?

Americans who believe in certain rights, like the one to own firearms, simply do not trust people who ask questions like this. First, there is the overheated rhetoric - “weapons of war” to describe a rifle no self-respecting troop would ever take into combat, the “military-style” talking point that says nothing, and often, ignorant about what “semi-automatic” means. Then, there is the reality that the same people campaigning against guns are just fine with things like cash bail being eliminated, the arrested being released immediately, and criminals elevated above the law-abiding. As it is, there are scores of gun laws from the federal level on down to the state and local. By now, a sane person would have realized that 1) inanimate objects are not the issue and 2) there is no magic law that will stop criminals from being criminals. When some politician talks about “no one needs….” X weapon, it’s not a far leap to believing that person would favor a total ban. It’s not up to some old person in a suit to dictate what I or anyone else needs, especially when the rules they want to impose on the rest of us do not apply to themselves. The anti-gun crowd’s irrational fear of metal things is not my problem. Go solve your pathologies on your own, without attempting to erode the rights of the law-abiding. Do people believe there is an effort to strip away their right to own a weapon? They see what this same class of politician thinks about the first amendment, so it stands to reason the second would also come under attack."},{"instruction":"Why do some people like to stay in an abusive relationship?","output":"With me, it was because I didn't think I would find anyone else :( but I have left now.

Here's Why. Writing is central to modern business. Employees write all day long: emails, reports, marketing copy, customer support texts and chats, and more. In a recent study by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, 73% of employers said strong writing skills are more important to them than nearly anything else. Only leadership skills and the ability to be a team player ranked higher. Jason Fried speaks for the majority of employers in his book, Rework: \\"If you are trying to decide among a few people to fill a position, hire the best writer.\\" Benefit #1: The best writers are clear. Most writing has two objectives: to explain and to persuade. A strong writer pursues clarity by conveying ideas in simple, readable language. A weak writer, on the other hand, flees clarity by hiding the poverty of his ideas behind big, confusing words. For employers, strong writers use clarity to eliminate confusion, sustain client relationships, and close more sales. Benefit #2: The best writers are specific. Good writing requires courage. A strong writer makes the strongest, boldest case they can for their idea and stands behind it. They take a risk. On the other hand, a weak writer tries to avoid responsibility by using words that are vague or intentionally ambiguous -- weasel words like \\"can,\\" \\"could,\\" \\"may,\\" \\"might,\\" \\"up to,\\" \\"possibly.\\" For employers, strong writers build trust with customers and clients, while weak writers damage a brand's credibility. Benefit #3: The best writers write to serve their audience. The biggest difference between a strong writer and a weak one is who they are writing for. A weak writer writes mainly for herself. A strong writer writes for her audience: the people who will be reading their work. For employers, strong writers nurture customers and clients, writing words that resonate with their thinking and making them feel heard and understood. Remember: When your company hires the best writers, you gain clarity, specificity, and the ability to serve your audience at a higher level."},{"instruction":"'m facing with this awkward situation where my 400 watt incandescent bulbs burn out at a crazy rate.

Is it really profitable?","output":"You can start dropshipping without investment. To get started, it is enough to start a page on social networks or register in the marketplace, place the goods of the supplier with whom you managed to agree, and receive orders. Without advertising and paid promotion at the start it will not be easy, there will be few customers. But there is enough time to understand how interesting it is for you, whether everything is working out and whether you need to inject money. Dropshipping is good because you can start with a minimal budget. The supplier manages the warehouse, packaging and delivery of goods, tracking inventory. The dropshipper only organizes distribution channels and deals with sales. All trading is done online - all you need is a laptop and free time. You do not have to spend money on the purchase of inventory and equipment, on warehouse management. Dropshipping can be managed from anywhere in the world where there is Internet access. It is enough to get in touch with suppliers to manage the business. For example,[LINKED_TEXT: HLTS dropshipping] [URL: https://hlts.kr/en/] provides services to promote products for clients from various industries. You can also sell goods in any zone. You are not tied to a specific region - it all depends on the suppliers and their logistics capabilities. Dropshipping allows you to sell any number of products. The size of the assortment is limited only by the chosen niche and the ability of the seller to negotiate with suppliers. If an ordinary company grows, its costs increase greatly.

It has a wider and lower seat than an upright bike. Additionally, recumbent bikes put less strain on your joints, which is ideal for those with arthritis, and are much easier to balance on and sit comfortably.Indoor cycling has become an effective way for fitness and burning off a few pounds. It gives good cardio workout as it targets large muscle groups such as quadriceps, hamstrings and the glute muscles. Science has been evolving to produce the optimum fitness machine taking into account the posture, muscle groups targeted and comfort while working out. The two major indoor exercise bike types are the upright and the recumbent bikes. The recumbent bikes have some advantages over the conventional upright bikes.Recumbent bikes extend the angle of the knee joint in a way that the knee and the hip don’t flex as much during each rotation. Because of this, these bikes are a great option for those who have arthritis. Moreover, unlike the upright bikes, the pedals are in front, which takes the pressure off the lower back. Recumbent bikes are extremely useful machines for maintaining your cardiovascular health, losing weight, and increasing strength. What’s more, they are safer and more comfortable as compared to upright bikes. Hence, they’re a better choice for those with arthritis and limited mobility.

First agreeing with most others: After you shift down, ride on softer gravel, grass, or snow on the side of the road, wait for a flat space or uphill, then shift to neutral or turn off the motor to finish stopping, etc. (All this works in both manual and automatics, more or less effectively, in spite of what others said, this is an emergency you’ve waited many weeks to get advice on, so use your transmission to keep from doing even worse damage.) If all else fails, Dad said remember to hit something soft like a bush or farmer’s crops, and if you can’t hit something soft hit something cheap.

NO. It does not matter where you studied or even what you studied for that matter. As long as you have the motivation, the analytical/problem solving skills and can collaborate with others, you are fit to be hired Let me tell you a couple of brief stories about colleagues who had the most humble beginnings yet ended up doing fine for themselves. One of my teammates studied Literature at a community college and wanted to go to graduate school for further studies. While he was stuck at the Chicago airport because of a snowstorm, he chanced upon a copy of a programming book (I believe it was an introductory text on python meant for middle school kids). Having a penchant for reading and finding himself bored, he read the 80 odd page book in a few of hours and wrote a few basic programs with the help of some online coding environment (which shielded him from any installation hassles). To augment his income, he started working for a tech consulting company on the side. The consulting firm who would often place him as a contractor in small to mid-level IT companies for short term projects. At the end of one such contract, they told him he needed to move to California (he lived in Michigan), for this little known startup called Nest. Though he hated moving away from the place where he grew up, he agreed because the money was good. He also realized he had come to like the objectivity of involved in software engineering compared to the subjective nature of literature. There was no “open to interpretation” rule in programming, he said. The code you wrote was “interpreted” just like you wrote it. No ambiguity. Through a series of acquisitions, hard work and good fortune, he now finds himself working at Google. No Ivy league or a computer science degree. Another colleague of mine grew up in foster homes throughout his adolescence because his parents were addicts and rarely there for him. He wanted to give back to the last foster family he stayed with for over 5 years and hence taught himself how to program (because someone told him that it pays well). He could not afford to college so he just went to a career fair of a state college near his home and sent his resume to any recruiter who would listen. Because he had no college degree, he was often rejected and turned back. He recalled that one of the recruiters gave him a coding challenge that he was able to work his way through thereby landing an entry level job at a startup. He slowly worked his way up in the industry and is currently a Director at Google. No Ivy League or a CS degree. I studied computer science in my undergrad and grad school and in no way regret that decision or advise people against college degrees.. The point I am trying to make is that, good software engineers can come from anywhere. And companies like Facebook, Google etc know that (including their recruiters). The first thing I was told on the first day of my internship orientation at Google was, “Be Audacious”. I don’t think, they would be preaching that if they foolishly believed that only Ivy League graduates deserved to work there. While a college degree from a good school/college never hurt anyone and indeed expands your skillset, but it is not a sure shot ticket to working at a tech company (in any capacity I might add and not as an engineer). **Disclaimer: I am not a spokesperson for my employer and the expressed views, opinions are my own**"},{"instruction":"Did Alec Guinness really predict James Dean's death?","output":"Alec Guinness claimed that James Dean's new car left him with a cold, ominous feeling and that he apparently warned Dean about driving it.

Whatever happened to keeping the enemy in the dark of your plans? Is it just politics, hubris or stupidity?","output":"First, by publicly saying “we just sent more Gustavs to Ukraine” a country does several things. They provide hope for Ukraine. They reduce the public pressure to say “why don’t we send our troops in to Ukraine and fight them Russki’s?” And in a Democracy, there is value (and an expectation) in sharing general information with the public (even in a war). Second, you assume that the US (along with many other nations like Poland and England) has publicly stated what equipment they’ve transferred, what support they’ve provided and not left out details. And you’re wrong. I know for a fact that your assumption is wrong. I guarantee you that the United States has not stated what kind of “support” our intelligence community is currently providing Ukraine in this battle (but I highly suspect that a lot of it is real time intelligence that allows for better targeting). I guarantee you that the US military has provided a range and depth of support that hasn’t been publicly discussed. Remember those Polish MiG-29s with the convoluted Polish plan on how to get them to Ukraine? The US JCS wisely and publicly said it wasn’t workable. And there hasn’t been another word by Ukraine about desperately needing more jets. And the Ukrainian Air Force is still flying, still contesting the airspace over Ukraine. Cogitate on that for a moment and see what conclusions you reach. And again, the Polish plan for the MiG-29 exchange wasn’t implemented. So ponder on this and see what explanations you have for why Ukraine is no longer pleading for strike aircraft."},{"instruction":"w and from where can I buy cheap flight tickets?","output":"See, there are many agencies and websites that say that they offer the world’s cheapest flight tickets.

[LINKED_TEXT: Regular Physical Activity:] [URL: https://www.digistore24.com/redir/307885/MAGEMBERICHARD/] Engage in regular exercise or physical activity. Physical activity helps your body utilize glucose for energy and can improve insulin sensitivity.

Additionally, incorporate strength training exercises to build muscle mass, which can enhance blood sugar control. 3. [LINKED_TEXT: Monitor Carbohydrate Intake:] [URL: https://www.digistore24.com/redir/307885/MAGEMBERICHARD/] Be mindful of the types and amounts of carbohydrates you consume. Carbohydrates have the most significant impact on blood sugar levels. Choose complex carbohydrates with a lower glycemic index, such as whole grains, legumes, and non-starchy vegetables, which are digested more slowly and have a gentler effect on blood sugar compared to refined carbohydrates. 4. Portion Control: Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overeating. Balancing your carbohydrate, protein, and fat intake throughout meals can help prevent sharp spikes in blood sugar levels. Use measuring cups or a food scale to become more aware of appropriate serving sizes. 5. Stay Hydrated: Drink an adequate amount of water throughout the day to support overall health and help regulate blood sugar levels. Limit sugary beverages and alcohol, as they can cause blood sugar fluctuations. 6. Stress Management: Chronic stress can impact blood sugar control. Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as practicing relaxation techniques (deep breathing, meditation, yoga), engaging in hobbies, spending time with loved ones, or seeking support from a mental health professional. 7. Regular Monitoring: If you have diabetes, monitor your blood sugar levels regularly as advised by your healthcare provider. This will help you understand how your lifestyle choices and medications are affecting your blood sugar levels and enable you to make necessary adjustments. 8. Medication and Medical Care: If you have been diagnosed with diabetes, follow your healthcare provider's recommendations regarding medication, insulin, or other prescribed treatments. Regularly attend medical appointments to assess and manage your blood sugar levels effectively. It's important to work with your healthcare team, including doctors, nurses, dietitians, and diabetes educators, to create a personalized plan tailored to your specific needs and medical condition.

I was diagnosed with uterine cancer and the doctor wanted to (using his words) “whip it out, you don’t need it, spare organ”. Well it got my back up so I went to Sydney from Cairns, a 2,600km journey to get a second opinion. I had no idea about the lung cancer. I smoked my normal, a pack a day all the way to Sydney. And it was a long journey since we meandered down through Queensland and New South Wales doing possibly triple the mileage. I had another driver to help me drive, but while he was a good driver he took risks. He over took a whole train of cars and bus and only just got in to the right lane of traffic in the nick of time. Thus I told him we would drive on the lonely roads out in the sticks. It took a month and a half to do the 4 to 5 day journey that most people do from Cairns to Sydney. Remarkably I noticed that the cough was lessening on my way down and particularly saw a lessening in both the cough and phlegm near Brisie, Brisbane I should say. By the time I got to Sydney I was no longer coughing nor bringing up any phlegm. The diagnosis in Sydney was grim. Stage 4 ovarian cancer with metastases to the uterus, cervix, bowel and both lungs. And they found type 2 diabetes as well. The surgeon told me that if I’d been operated in Cairns to remove my uterus I most likely would not have survived the operation as it is major surgery and the overall condition of my body was very bad. Anyway the doctors said “nothing we can do for you”. I was not about to give up on my life, and most especially as I had seen symptoms disappear on the way to Sydney and not only just the cough and phlegm. So I went to a Chinese herbalist I had seen years earlier. I was still smoking like a chimney. What the heck. However when the herbalist saw me with a cigarette in his waiting room he told me that if I didn’t stop smoking he wouldn’t treat me. That made me sit up and of course it was what made me stop. I finished the packet I had and rolled all the butts into the last cigarette in one of my husbands roll your own papers. I used a eyebrow plucker to hold that last cigarette so I could smoke it to the finish. I was lucky though that he took the opportunity to also quit smoking. I know now that the herbs did not help me have the spontaneous remission that I had by the middle of the following year, but I do think they were good for my overall health. Since I stopped i decided not to start smoking again. Did my smoking cause the lung cancer? I would say a definitive NO! After research I have done I found that the body tissues /cells that experience some difficult conditions, e.g. insults from smoking, undergo what is known as cellular adaptation. For instance they are replaced by more robust cells. This is called metaplasia. Such changes can take place in the esophagus, stomach and other areas of the body. Biomedical scientists and doctors see that in some cases the person gets cancer and they, IMO, jump to the conclusion that the stem cells that gave rise to the robust cells got it wrong somewhere along the line, had some miscopied gene or something went wrong and that led to cancer. But this is only conjecture. When I think back there were many suggestions made to me by people, who I came to call “bad influences”. Some of these suggestion made use of warnings on cigarette packets of “smoking causes lung cancer” and they were either verbally or implied in some way or through mental suggestions by closely related ones, that I was damaging my lungs by smoking. In fact one guy used to say jokes like “what did one coffin say to the other coffin?” and the answer was “Is that you coffin” but it was said so that the sound of the word “coffin” sounded like “coughing”. This was part of the foul game play and there were involved a very close relative. I have found that these suggestions (and other with respect to other parts of the body) were what caused me to react to an idea of a danger of possible harm to my lungs and thus develop the lung cancer metastases. It is not quite so simple. I had lost some money in a bad business venture at the time, which for me was a lot of money. So there was the emotion of sadness. I found that this is instrumental in the development of both ovarian and lung cancer. I discuss how and why the body develops cancer in my second video in this answer: [LINKED_TEXT: Kyrani Eade's answer to Does the distinction drawn by doctors between \\"organic illnesses\\" and psychiatric illness play into the old stereotype that psychiatric illness isn't genuine? What would be less pejorative terminology?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Does-the-distinction-drawn-by-doctors-between-organic-illnesses-and-psychiatric-illness-play-into-the-old-stereotype-that-psychiatric-illness-isnt-genuine-What-would-be-less-pejorative-terminology/answer/Kyrani-Eade] but I will briefly mention some thing here too. I had subsequent episodes of cancer and took the opportunity to study it at the cellular level by a very unconventional method of observation.. Vipassana or insight meditation. I am good enough to see at the cellular and sub-cellular level but not at the molecular level. However I can make out some proteins, especially those on the cell membrane. And I have had plenty of experience since there was eight cancer episodes, where some cancers developed and many, many attempts since where I have been able to arrest the situation before there is any problem. I found that the ideas are not enough to cause the body to react. The body has high intelligence and knows that while the ideas and mental images may create some reactivity in the area, it is counted as mirror neuron response. However if there is sensory information going back to the brain from the said area, then the body takes it seriously. I had sadness, which affects the lungs. It affects the lungs because sadness affects water metabolism. The lungs manage water more carefully under these circumstances so as not to allow any dehydration owing to crying or other upheaval associated with sadness. This is also true in the bowel with the emotion of grief and depression. I didn’t have depression but I did have grief. In both cases owing to the increase care, one could say, in water metabolism, there is sensory information going back to the brain. So ideas of “lungs getting damaged” and “it got gutted” with respect to the money I lost and images of attacking my abdomen, my body moved to try and build some sort of protective barriers. And of course the only barrier the body can build is a cell barrier, hence the cancer tumors. Once I left the area and the people, who were involved in the foul game play, my body was slowly beginning to clear away the barriers as they were no longer relevant. I realize now that had I resolved the loss and eliminated the sadness, the remission would have gone a lot faster. As it was I was able to come to terms with the loss over a six month period and away from the “bad influences” and as I did my body effected the spontaneous remission. My lungs are very healthy now, better than any time since childhood. There are attempts to adversely influence me, using ideas of “you can smell this awful gas” etc.. And there were on a couple of occasions some vague smells that were momentary and may have arisen out of the suggestions. But, I can recognize them as hateful suggestions and thus bogus, so I can avoid developing any cancer, even in short periods where there may be some sadness. EDIT: I see from the comments that people are skeptical and I can’t blame them when the public, me included until recent years, believe the official story about carcinogens and damaged DNA and miscopied genes. But after I started to research the matter some years ago, I found to my astonishment that the research on cancer does not support the official story. In fact if the truth be known the evidence we have from the medical research points very strongly to a nocebo effect, i.e., a person’s bodily reaction to ideas and perceptions of a danger of possible harm to some part of the body. I discuss the medical evidence in this long answer: [LINKED_TEXT: Kyrani Eade's answer to How can we understand self healing and can cancer be treated or suppressed?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-understand-self-healing-and-can-cancer-be-treated-or-suppressed/answer/Kyrani-Eade]"},{"instruction":"there a way to permanently delete files on a computer where even the FBI can't find the info?","output":"There are programs that will overwrite the data.

The current rule is that a player must be at least one year removed from high school graduation in order to be eligible for the NBA draft. This rule was implemented in 2006, and it has been in place ever since. There are a few reasons why the NBA implemented this rule. One reason is that the league wanted to ensure that players had more time to develop their skills before entering the NBA. Another reason is that the league wanted to avoid the exploitation of young players. There have been a few high school players who have been successful in the NBA, but they are the exception rather than the rule. Most high school players are not ready for the physical and mental demands of the NBA. Here are some stats about high school players who have been drafted into the NBA: There have been a total of 41 high school players drafted into the NBA. The first high school player to be drafted was Darryl Dawkins in 1975. The most recent high school player to be drafted was Kwame Brown in 2001. Only 14 of the 41 high school players who have been drafted have gone on to have successful careers in the NBA. The rule that prohibits the drafting of high school players is controversial. Some people believe that the rule is necessary to protect young players, while others believe that the rule is unfair to talented high school players. Only time will tell if the NBA will ever change the rule that prohibits the drafting of high school players.

This usually involves meditation and all meditation is a conscious attempt to contact the soul or higher self.In this ever moving constantly busy world it can be hard to find a quiet place away from the noise and bustle, so do what you can.The safest meditation is to focus on the brow chakra between the eyebrows. Close your eyes and align your focus to that point. It can help to place a finger between your brows so you know where to focus. When you have the focus remove your finger.You will have to check yourself that you are still focused there as your focus will drop to the solar plexus centre by itself. Do 10 mins meditation each day for a week then start to make it longer over the following weeks and go as long as you like. You will get the hang of it.The longer and more focused your meditation, the “deeper” you will go.Remember to check that you are still focused every now and then as your alignment will wander.The journey within is far more rewarding than any journey in the material world."},{"instruction":"What are the best telegram groups for civil service preparation?","output":"hello guys, There are many channels on telegram which are useful to you If you are preparing for civil services .

I have been deeply involved with around thirty companies over the last twenty years and touched hundreds of others, and there is no ‘typical’. The CEO has to lead and manage, set the vision and tie everyone else's vision together, taking the best bits of what the company experts think. Finding and persuading people who are better able than him/her and employing them. Anyone in a start up has to be prepared to do whatever is necessary. I remember being the one to field technical questions from a potential customer. The customer needed a coffee so I sent the CEO to go and get us both one. The CEO had to act as a tea boy because it was a small company and we needed tea boy. In a small company every one has to be aware of the bottom line and the impacts of their actions on it. The company culture is generally set initially by the CEO though not always. As the teams build they will have their own cultures and may start to change the overall atmosphere. Initially there may be only the CEO hence the need to start the culture. The most important thing a CEO can do to grow the company every day is to inspire and empower the people employed.

The options with Uber are - Paytm or Cash - or at least this was the method 3~4 years ago. Credit Card could also be registered and used I think. Anyway Paytm was convenient. Except for a small snag. One needed to have at least 40% or so more money in the wallet than the expected and predicted fare. I thought nothing of it. I thought that sometimes the fare could jump dramatically in case of traffic jams, etc. and hence this was reasonable protection because once you selected a mode of payment, one had to make full payment that way. No case for 70% Paytm, 30% cash, etc. Once I had Rs. 175 in the wallet, the predicted fare was Rs. 225 and I was told that I needed to have at least Rs. 250 more in the wallet. Fair enough. But by mistake, I transferred Rs. 2500 instead of Rs. 250. When I realised this, I went through the ride and was left with Rs. 2452.45 in the wallet. I thought “why to keep so much money in the wallet that pays no interest?” So I decided to reverse transfer Rs. 2000 back to my bank. Paytm told me that Rs. 40 will be deducted as transfer charges. WTF? I was livid. That day I realised a few things. Paytm is cheating. My bank did not charge me for transferring money to Paytm wallet but Paytm wants me to keep money in the wallet or penalise me.Paytm is not paying any interest on wallet money.Just suppose that there were 1 lakh Paytm wallet users (I was sure that there are more). Each keeps a Rs. 200 as an average balance in the wallet. This means that Paytm has a free kitty of Rs. 2,00,00,000 or Rs. 2 Cr . Imagine all this money with no interest to pay! I stopped using Paytm that day. A couple of days later, I cleaned up the wallet, paid the 5% transfer fees too. But I said - never again Paytm. Fortunately, G-Pay is around now and I don’t need to keep a wallet balance there."},{"instruction":"Every year, the top 5 mutual funds changes.

This is due to the Money Laundering Regulations, which when I was an auditor with one of the big accountancy firms, we were required to keep up to date on. The point is that criminals may pass the proceeds of crime through banks to launder it - make it look like it came from somewhere legitimate. So banks and accountants have a professional responsibility to look out for this, ask the customer questions about large amounts, and inform the police if it still looks dodgy. (Or in my case, report it to the Money Laundering Reporting Officer so they can decide if the police should be informed.) They even do it with online banking - usually there’s a maximum limit per transfer and you frequently get asked “Are you sure you know what you’re doing?” Click Yes to go ahead. There are so many scams where the scammer will ask you to transfer money to another account - which is in fact theirs so you’ve lost it. It’s annoying but the bank is doing what it can to keep your money safe. I am reminded of last time my Mum did this. All she was doing online was withdrawing some savings to put into another bank where it would earn more interest, but they still asked because it looked a lot. Fair enough - they were looking out for her."},{"instruction":"When is the best time to format?

Talking of what is it like being a farmer,I feel proud that we farmers are the ones who are the bread and butter to the whole world. In olden days farmers used to have plentiful of water resources available and nowdays due to urbanization there is scarcity of water and also we should take into consideration the global warming effect also. Farmers strive day and night for growing crops without the problems they have.But the scene today has changed. No government is talking about agriculture they want foreign companies to invest money in India and start industries. Now a days we are seeing that farmers are committing suicides in each and every state of the country. We should feel sorry that this type of situation is happening in the agricultural country like India. Why? Farmers are not even getting the suitable cost from crops they are growing. And they are unable to pay the loans they take. I would like to state one situation here If we go to a branded shop to buy some clothes we would like to buy them how much they cost without bargaining. But when it comes to buying of vegetables in a market we bargain for a very small amount. Aren't they eligible to get that small amount too for working in day and night.? It's my opinion.

Is this borderline high?","output":"Normal pressure is 120/80 or lower. Your blood pressure is considered high (stage 1) if it reads 130/80. Stage 2 high blood pressure is 140/90 or higher. If you get a blood pressure reading of 180/110 or higher more than once, seek medical treatment right away. Why is high blood pressure a problem? High blood pressure increases your risk of cardiovascular disease (heart or blood vessel disease). When your blood pressure is high, your heart has to work harder just to pump a normal amount of blood through your body. The higher pressure in your arteries may cause them to weaken and bleed, resulting in a stroke. Over time, blood vessels may become hardened. This often occurs as people age. High blood pressure speeds this process. Blood vessel damage is bad because hardened or narrowed arteries may be unable to supply the amount of blood the body's organs need. The higher artery pressure may lead to atherosclerosis, in which deposits of cholesterol, fatty substances, and blood cells clog up an artery. Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of heart attacks. It can also cause strokes. The added workload on the heart causes thickening of the heart muscle. Over time, the thickening damages the heart muscle so that it can no longer pump normally. This can lead to a disease called heart failure. Your kidneys or eyes may also be damaged. The longer you have high blood pressure and the higher it is, the more likely it is you will develop problems. How does it occur? There are no clear causes of essential hypertension. However, many different factors can increase blood pressure, such as: being overweightsmokingeating a diet high in saltdrinking a lot of alcohol. Other important factors include: Race. African Americans are more likely to develop high blood pressure.Gender. Males have a greater chance of developing high blood pressure than women until age 55. However, after the age of 75, women are more likely to develop high blood pressure than men.Heredity. If your parents had high blood pressure, you are more at risk.Age.

It was very competitive, but I guess that's to be expected when you have a bunch of smart, ambitious young people who are vying after a limited amount of spots in management, and eventually partnership. I was a little out-of-step with the culture of the firm, because I was older when I started and I had a child who was born shortly after I started working there. Most of the associates, seniors and managers would go drinking after work, and hang out with each other on weekends. I chose instead to spend all my free time at home with my wife and daughter. It didn't necessarily hurt my career, though, because in my start class, I was promoted to senior before the rest of the people in my start class - after I had been working there only a little over a year. When I was offered the Controller position in our city's board of realtors, I decided to make the jump because it was a great organization, and the work hours were a lot better for a father with a child to help raise. Although PwC wasn't necessarily the best fit for me, I certainly don't regret my experiences there. I learned an awful lot, and met some really cool people.

Node.js “popped up” exactly when Java was peaking but was being seen (and still is seen) as “startup / agile company hostile”. At the same time, Python was just starting getting the libraries that would benefit it so much in our days. At the same time, PHP was at an all times low, mostly deranged and abandoned. Node.js brought the promise of incredible scalability, “one language for the full stack”, speed, asynchronous execution and functional programming. Now, several years have passed. Java imo is slowly getting beaten (Oracle’s myopic decision to license it… and license it with restrictions that were considered acceptable perhaps in 1995–2000 tops). Its functional programming centered successor, Kotlin, didn’t really take off. Nor Scala went “viral”. Python enjoys a great success but… in data / finance analysis, and AI. Not much any more as a web platform, despite Django and Flask being very good at it. PHP has basically reborn, with version 7. It’s twice as fast, it finally implemented function arguments type checking, uses 1/6 of the memory it used to need, had a ton of security (libsodium…) and language upgrades. Powerful frameworks, like Laravel, were created, so that you can create Vue.js frontends driving PHP backends all within one environment.But PHP is still suffering from the years of neglect, many companies transitioned over to Node.js because back then (2009–13) they believed PHP would not have been a safe investment any more. Plus PHP is an humble, affordable workhorse, with no pretense of being “cool”, for “intellectual progressive devs” or something. It’s getting back into the competition, but I don’t know if it’ll recover to full. Node.js has flourished instead. Today it’s suffering some growth pains. What good is being able to just learn one language for the full stack, if you then have to learn and use a plethora of tools? Plus, the competition nowadays went to Javascript vs EC6 vs Typescript on one side, and choice of React vs Vue.js vs Angular.js (and others) on the other. Imo the Javascript community has to work harder to get a more “shared” solution, with less intermediate steps from code to deliverable assets. Otherwise they risk seeing Laravel getting PHP back to the competition, as it offers a “one stop shop” solution that is totally viable for the lower and middle end of the companies. That is, the majority of them."},{"instruction":"What are the major benefits of natural hand wash?","output":"In today's fast-paced world, hand hygiene has never been more important.

Here are some strategies to manage software documentation and facilitate knowledge transfer within development teams: Standardize Documentation Practices: Establish consistent documentation practices, such as using a standard template for documenting code, design decisions, and project documentation. Define guidelines for documenting code comments, API references, and system architecture to ensure clarity and uniformity across the team.Use Version Control Systems: Utilize version control systems like Git to manage and track changes in code repositories. Encourage developers to commit and document their changes, making it easier to trace the evolution of the codebase and understand the reasoning behind specific modifications.Create a Centralized Knowledge Base: Maintain a centralized knowledge base, such as a wiki or documentation portal, to store important project-related information. Document project requirements, design principles, coding standards, and guidelines for team members to access and contribute to the knowledge base.Conduct Regular Code Reviews: Encourage peer code reviews as a means of knowledge sharing. Code reviews allow team members to gain insights into different approaches, learn from each other's coding styles, and provide feedback for improvement. Document key learnings and best practices identified during code reviews.Pair Programming and Shadowing: Encourage developers to engage in pair programming or shadowing activities, where one developer collaborates closely with another to work on a task or project. This facilitates real-time knowledge transfer and promotes shared understanding of the codebase and development practices.Conduct Documentation Workshops or Training Sessions: Organize workshops or training sessions to educate team members about effective documentation practices. Cover topics such as code documentation, writing clear and concise technical documentation, and using relevant tools and platforms for documentation management.Document APIs and Interfaces: Documenting APIs, interfaces, and dependencies is crucial for understanding how different components of the software interact. Use tools like Swagger, API Blueprint, or OpenAPI to create comprehensive and up-to-date API documentation that developers can refer to when integrating or consuming APIs.Encourage Knowledge Sharing Sessions: Organize regular knowledge sharing sessions or brown bag sessions where team members can present and discuss interesting or challenging technical topics. This provides an opportunity for developers to share their expertise, demonstrate innovative approaches, and foster a learning culture within the team.Foster Collaboration and Communication: Encourage open communication and collaboration within the development team. Foster a supportive environment where team members can freely ask questions, seek clarification, and share knowledge. Utilize team communication tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams to facilitate ongoing discussions and knowledge sharing.Maintain Documentation as Living Assets: Regularly update and maintain documentation to reflect changes in the software and evolving best practices. Encourage developers to contribute to the documentation and highlight any areas that need improvement or clarification. By implementing these strategies, development teams can effectively manage software documentation, promote knowledge sharing, and ensure a smooth knowledge transfer process within the team. This leads to improved collaboration, enhanced productivity, and better overall software development outcomes."},{"instruction":"Can India, Russia, North Korea, & China together defeat the USA alone in a war, if it happens in 2025?

You really can’t go wrong with either. It’s like choosing between the 5600x and i5–12400f…. they’re both about the same in benchmarks and other performance metrics. However, the 6-core Ryzen 5 7600x will beat out both. It really comes down to the CPU you plan to buy and the price you’re willing to pay. If you plan for specific workloads, then it would be good to research which CPU is best for your needs. Multi-threaded workload performance between the Core i9–13900k and Ryzen 9 7950x is fairly similar. However, the 13900k does have an edge in Gaming performance…. which you probably won’t notice unless you play games with an RTX 4090 on a 1080p super refresh rate monitor…. which would be a waste. There is also AMD’s Ryzen 9 7950x3d which is almost as good as the others two aforementioned processors at multithreaded workloads but is a little bit ahead of the 13900k in gaming. At this point, you might as well look at what the entire platform has to offer. AMD has two viable platforms out right now which are socket AM4 and AM5, while Intel has their lga1700 platform. Intel’s lga1200 platform pales in comparison to the aforementioned platforms, so I only suggest going with their lga1200 platform if you can get parts for pennies on the dollar. AMD’s socket AM5 platform has an unbelievably strong upgrade path. So if you can afford that one, it will last you the longest. Intel’s lga1700 platform supports PCIe 5.0 to the primary PCIe x16 slot and it has a somewhat better upgrade path in comparison to AMD’s AM4 platform.

And, not surprisingly, California is doing so. And this is a great example of incremental restriction by gun-control advocates with the intent to remove our second amendment rights. California started out by eliminating our rights under interstate commerce to buy ammunition by mail from affordable sources. Instead California residents are required to purchase ammo face-to-face from a state licensed dealer - even if no local dealers carry the caliber you need. The next step in the process kicks in on July 1 of this year - when everyone who wishes to buy ammunition must pay to be background checked and acquire a license from the state (renewable at some undesignated interval for additional fees) before you can go buy ammo face-to-face from your state licensed dealer - who now will be required to log those purchases just like a gun sale. The next item being bandied about is a purchase limitation. After that - what next? The worst of it is that California has a requirement for the ammo purchase license to be used starting July 1 but has not finalized the process/procedure to apply for that card nor finalized all of the forms and required reporting procedures for the dealers. It's now the end of March - any bets on whether CA can complete this AND manage to process cards for everyone in the state who wants one in the next 3 months? One of the dealers I use has started calling this AMMOGEDON - I think they may be right. Now, it's worth pointing out that this was done before - on a national level with the Gun Control Act of 1968 - which required dealers to keep logs of all handgun ammunition sales. It became very apparent by 1984 that the recordkeeping was serving absolutely no purpose and had not been useful in solving even one crime in that period - and later in 1986 the recordkeeping law was repealed. So, is California going down the road to insanity - repeating the same bad idea expecting a different result - or do they have additional designs on the second amendment with these and additional future restrictions? Really - California - do we even need to ask that question? And finally, what use would keeping such records do? Seriously. What would be the benefit? Will you be able to track criminals or crimes knowing who bought ammo? Do you really think that criminals or \\"mass\\" shooters buy so much ammo as to be distinguished by such purchases? With the exception of the Las Vegas shooter, mass shooters seldom fire more than 50 rounds (a box or two of ammo). And criminals? Do you really expect them to go to the range and practice (actually, their marksmanship argues against them EVER practicing). So, what good is monitoring sales going to do? It won't help you stop a crime. It hasn't ever helped solved one in the past. And the only thing that you might be able to pinpoint with such a scheme are those citizens who practice more diligently than others.

It is fairly complicated, but the Laser Institute of America and ANZI have tried to simply the situation by being somewhat conservative. For visible lasers, assuming the initial beam size is about a millimeter in diameter, different classes of lasers are defined. By the way, the laser beams do spread out or diverge due to diffraction, and wavefront error, for a typical laser pointer the spread angle is about 2 milliradians, which is about 7 arc minutes or about one tenth of a degree. If the power is less than 0.4 mW, it is a class 1 laser. Less than 1 mW is a class 2 laser. Less than 5 mW is a class 3R laser. Less than 500 mW is a class 3B laser. Above 500 mW is a class 4 laser. Class 1 lasers are considered eye safe. Class 2 lasers are considered eye safe if you blink and look away when exposed to the beam. Because the beam spreads with distance, a class 2 laser is eye safe beyond some range. However, the occular distraction can cause accidents up to some much longer distance.Class 3R lasers are the most powerful that can legally be sold as laser pointers. At close range, they can cause permanent eye damage, but normally this does not happen because you are some distance from the pointer and you blink. Class 3B lasers can cause permanent eye damage, even at some distance. They can also cause painful damage to skin tissue. Under certain circumstances at close range, they can cause eye damage just by looking at close range at the reflected spot on a wall, some plastic, wood or other object. Class 4 lasers are hazardous because even looking at the reflected spot from a diffuse material at some distance can cause permanent eye damage. In experiments that I was involved in in the 1970s, I had to wear safety goggles because if insects or bats flew into the beam, the light scattered into our eyes even at dozens of meters away could cause eye damage. If you want detailed information for a particular situation, there are plenty of guys like me who can do detailed calculations (at 100 to 400 per hour)."},{"instruction":"w did a plane crash on the upper floors of the World Trade Center result in the entire building collapsing?","output":"The Trade Center fell or did whatever they did, by ignoring all other facts.

These two beverage giants have been engaged in a long-standing battle for market dominance, and their competitive strategies have often been nothing short of captivating. In the 1980s, PepsiCo launched the Pepsi Challenge, a marketing campaign that invited consumers to blind taste-test Pepsi and Coca-Cola to determine their preference. This clever move challenged the traditional dominance of Coca-Cola and aimed to change consumers' perception of the two brands. By emphasizing the taste factor, PepsiCo sought to position itself as the superior choice and win over a new generation of cola drinkers. Coca-Cola, known for its iconic brand and deep-rooted history, needed to respond strategically. In a brilliant counter-move, Coca-Cola decided to introduce a new formula known as \\"New Coke\\" in 1985. This bold decision aimed to address the taste preference revealed in the Pepsi Challenge and reinvigorate consumer interest in Coca-Cola. However, the introduction of New Coke did not go as planned. The public reaction was overwhelmingly negative, as loyal Coca-Cola fans expressed their discontent. This turn of events led to an extraordinary response from consumers, with protest groups forming and demanding the return of the original Coca-Cola formula. Recognizing the impact of this backlash, Coca-Cola swiftly reversed its decision and brought back the original formula, now known as \\"Coca-Cola Classic.\\" This strategic retreat, coupled with a strong marketing campaign centered around nostalgia and heritage, not only appeased disgruntled customers but also reignited a sense of loyalty and passion for the brand. This memorable episode in the Cola Wars demonstrates the high stakes and dynamic nature of business competition. It underscores the importance of understanding consumer preferences, staying responsive to market trends, and having the agility to adapt when necessary. The enduring rivalry between Coca-Cola and PepsiCo continues to captivate consumers and industry observers alike, showcasing the shrewd and often fascinating maneuvers that can shape the business landscape."},{"instruction":"Without appealing to emotion or using ad hominem attacks, how can I convince conservatives that gun regulation is a good thing?","output":"Sorry, all regulation is a waste of time and money.

Sure, if there wasn’t a deductible and insurers couldn’t raise rates for high risk drivers, it would give people an incentive to drive recklessly and in some cases deliberately wreck vehicles to get the insurance money. However, human health doesn’t work that way. For one thing, going to the doctor is a chore and is often unpleasant - e.g., needle sticks and uncomfortable physical examinations. Someone who’s not ill doesn’t benefit at all from using more healthcare services than they need. But more importantly, when you restrict access to basic services with onerous copays and deductibles, what happens is that people often forgo treatment for problems that could be easily and cheaply resolved if caught early (or better yet, prevented entirely). Consequently, patients who don’t get treated early often end up requiring very expensive, very invasive and not as effective medical interventions later on. That pain in your side? Yeah, it’s probably just an ulcer but if you don’t treat it now it could turn into stomach cancer. As the saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. So, far from saving money, these copays and deductibles actually end up costing the system far more in the long run. But of course, particularly in the USA, there’s a vindictive subsection of the population which is happy to tolerate suffering themselves just as long as those they deem unworthy suffer even more."},{"instruction":"What if Rohit Shetty directed Interstellar?","output":"Nolan fans would rush to his home to save him.

I was told that I was not in an emergency room. I needed a dark, quiet place to rest. I was in a well lit room with 3 roommates. The door was opened with people and noise in the hall. The restroom was for 8 women to share and had no doors. My migraine pain created nausea and vomiting. The nurse was angry, telling me I needed to eat and keep hydrated. I couldn’t keep a sip of water down much less a meal. I explained I could not walk to get my meal or water and asked if it could be brought to me. I was told I needed to walk to the kitchen and consume my meal at the tables. I was in complete agony for at least 72 hours. I couldn’t eat, sleep, or think. The pain just kept increasing. I finally sat up and started banging my head on the wall to deter the pain. The nurse came in and told me if I started it again I would be strapped down in the other room. A few hours before releasing me another nurse came in with a Torodol injection, fully knowing Imitrex wouldn’t touch my migraine at that point. Every minute seriously felt like a year.

Applying the “greedy landlord” analysis for anyone you think has more than you is one of the most over used scapegoats that allows people to ignore real analysis of issues. Here are a few reasons landlords may keep a space vacant over decreasing rent: 1.) Rent rates determine market rates: If you lower the rent for one space to fill it, this now becomes your market rate for the other spaces in the building. Guess what, now everyone in the building wants rents comparable to the one you lowered to fill the space. While in the short term you gained a little by decreasing rent to fill the space, in the long run it’s going to be a loss by pulling all the other rents down. 2.) Decreasing rents hurts long term leases: Commercial leases are generally longer terms compared to housing leases. So, decreasing the rent means you are going to be carrying the lower rents for a long time. You may be better to let it go unfilled for an additional 6 months with NO income for that time period than to tie yourself to lower rents over a 5 year lease. Heck in some instances it’s likely longer than that. 3.) Property value: A commercial building’s value is tied to the rent rates. Yes, you read it correctly. So, you lower rents, guess what happens to the value of the property? Now you are not only loosing rental income but your building value will be lower so you are loosing equity as well. Double the bad outcome, lowering rents to fill a vacant spot not looking so good now! 4.) Don’t forget about the bank: Most commercial property’s have bank loans on them as most landlords are not operating with “all cash”. So, their hands are tied as there is this thing called debt coverage and it goes like this: You lower the rents, rental income goes down =debt coverage down. This equals an unhappy bank. Now your property looks like a bad investment to the bank. Banks don’t lend money on bad investments. A lot of commercial loans are “term loans”. You can see where this is going! Yup, when the bank comes calling the commercial landlord gets told to take a hike. No other banker is going to jump in to support this bad investment so now the property is in foreclosure. Is that a place you would want to be and would decreasing rent to fill a space seem like a good choice to you? I could go on, but this is just a few reasons, and a lot more explanatory than the “greedy landlord” scapegoat. Please, just give this one a rest! response was edited due to my wrong use of banking lingo.

From the delicate beauty of ukiyo-e woodblock prints to the striking minimalism of Zen paintings, there is something undeniably unique and captivating about Japanese art. But what makes it so distinctive? In this article, we will explore the rich history and cultural context of Japanese art to uncover the secrets behind its enduring appeal. A Brief History of Japanese Art Japanese art has a long and fascinating history that dates back to prehistoric times. Some of the earliest examples of Japanese art are the Jomon pottery, which were created by hunter-gatherers more than 12,000 years ago. Over the centuries, Japanese art has been influenced by a wide range of cultures and traditions, including Chinese art, Buddhism, and Shintoism. Get to know about [LINKED_TEXT: Love is Calling] [URL: https://www.thefanart.com/love-is-calling-yayoi-kusama-with-poem/] Yayoi Kusama with Poem. One of the most significant periods in Japanese art history was the Edo period (1603-1868), which saw the rise of ukiyo-e woodblock prints. Ukiyo-e, which translates to \\"pictures of the floating world,\\" were popular among the common people and depicted scenes from everyday life, as well as famous actors, beautiful women, and landscapes. The popularity of ukiyo-e prints helped to establish Japan as a major artistic force in the world. Another important period in Japanese art was the Meiji period (1868-1912), which saw Japan open up to the world after centuries of isolation. During this time, Japanese artists were exposed to new styles and techniques from Europe and America, which they incorporated into their own work. This led to the emergence of new artistic movements, such as the Nihonga style, which blended traditional Japanese techniques with Western-style painting. What Makes Japanese Art Distinctive? There are several factors that contribute to the distinctiveness of Japanese art. One of the most notable is the emphasis on simplicity and minimalism. Japanese art often features clean lines, spare composition, and a focus on negative space. This can be seen in everything from Zen paintings to modern architecture. Another defining characteristic of Japanese art is its connection to nature. Many Japanese artists draw inspiration from the natural world, using motifs such as flowers, birds, and landscapes in their work. This is closely tied to the Japanese concept of wabi-sabi, which celebrates the beauty of imperfection and transience. Japanese art also has a strong sense of tradition and history. Many artists draw on centuries-old techniques and styles, such as the intricate patterns and designs found in traditional kimono fabrics. This connection to the past gives Japanese art a sense of continuity and timelessness. The Role of Cultural Context in Japanese Art To truly understand Japanese art, it is important to consider the cultural context in which it was created. Japan has a rich and complex culture that is deeply intertwined with its art. For example, the concept of wabi-sabi, which is so integral to Japanese art, is rooted in the traditional tea ceremony and the idea of finding beauty in imperfection. Similarly, the connection to nature in Japanese art is closely tied to the country's geography and climate. Japan is a mountainous country with a long coastline, and its people have long had a deep appreciation for the natural world. This is reflected in everything from traditional gardens to contemporary art installations. The importance of cultural context in Japanese art can also be seen in the role of religion. Buddhism and Shintoism have both had a profound influence on Japanese art, with many works featuring Buddhist deities, Zen gardens, and Shinto shrines. The influence of these religions can be seen not only in the subject matter of Japanese art but also in its overall aesthetic."},{"instruction":"there an affordable webbased small business accounting software?","output":"Yes, and the answer is [LINKED_TEXT: HDPOS Smart] [URL: http://www.hdpos.in/hdpos-smart/accounting-software].

I’m on CCTV business as a distribuitor for more than 18 years, and what I can tell you about today market (2017) is that eveb very big corporations and goberment and taking decisions on COST-QUALITY, and actually the 1st and 2nd factories on the world are Hikvision and Dahua on this order. Is almost imposible to compite against them, today I was reading on IPVM that is a very well known and respected site for the CCTV industry, that ADI the start producing on China it’s own OEM brand, this is the only way to compite against those brands. To produce OEM on China the King for this is Longse. My opinion is that if you have to choose from Dahua and Hikvision take Dahua, and I have two reasons for that, 1st is that Hikvision is owned by China goverment, and a lot of people doesn’t like this, they are using this as an estrategy for taking down quotes and sales, 2nd Dahua has very good price and quality, is leader in technology develop but doesn’t have agressive sale politics, specially to retail as Hikvision, so you can make more money."},{"instruction":"it possible that Ultra Instinct Goku can beat the strongest Superman in known comics?","output":"Not even close. We don’t even have to pick the strongest version of Superman for this either. Superman beats Goku Ultra Instinct in Speed, Strenght and Physicality. As I said in multiple of my answer Superman strength can vary between 200 Quintillon Tons to 300 Nonillions Tons. JLA Issue #77 Now as I said before as well, Superman can punch at a force of 190 Quadrillions joules, equivalent to 45 megaton of TNT up to 3000 nuclear bombs. Now Goku has multiple power level, starting with SSJ, SS2, SS3, Saiyan Blue, God, or Ultra Instinct. And the power level are easily and heavily multiply by the level that Goku is. But even with the DBZ show or the manga, Goku strength level has never really been mentioned. Now based on my research Goku can lift about 2 trillion tons in Super Saiyan Blue Form + Kaio-Kaioken x10 if we use how much Goku was able to lift on King Kai's planet and factor in how much his strength is multiplied. In Dragon ball chapter #39 it shows hoe powerful Goku can punch which can be measured. Well looking at the colossal damage, his punch was very powerful but not powerful enough to destroy the earth. Speed Speed wise Superman wins. Superman flew from the edge of the observable Universe to Earth in 2 months. If the distance between Earth and the observable universe is 13.8 billion light years, then Superman was flying MORE than 5 trillion times faster than a photon. This scan is not only a speed feat it's also a durability feat considering that he survived flying through a black hole. (Photon = Speed of light) so his speed reached around 3,353,083,145,000,000,000,000 mph. At one point Goku was able to cross Earth's diameter in one second in the Frieza Saga. That is around 113,710,928,179 Billion Mph) much much much faster than Light). But this statement i based on fans, the only actual statement I could find was when Goku crossed the Snake way. Now originally the snake way is around 1 Million kilometers so around 625 000 miles. Considering this two day estimate, if Snake Way was a million kilometers, Goku traveled at about 20,830 kilometers per hour (13,018 miles per hour) in order to travel in 48 hours. However, Snake Way is winding, whereas on the return trip Goku is seen traveling in a straight line over the top of Snake Way. But we can say his speed vary’s between 13,000 MPH - 113 Billion MPH. Here comes a major problem for Goku. He runs on Stamina, meaning he will not be able to last as long as Superman in a ring. Yes i know there is Senzu Bean, but depending in which universe they fight it probably doesn't exist. And that would be giving Goku an advantage, which would at least be rational to due the same for Superman a blue sun. Here comes another problem for Goku, Superman can absorb energy. The kamehameha is made of plasma. Plasma is the fourth state of matter that is an ionized gas that is created when a gas gets heated(sometimes by electricity). meaning this would do absolutely nothing against Superman. Now for my final point. Superman is immortal if he manages do die in the fight he will come back to finish it. Unlike Goku, he is NOT immortal. Yes he has been brought back to life only due to the Dragons balls. So on this note it’s clear who is the winner. Superman."},{"instruction":"What do you think about Chelsea Clinton saying she may run for elected office in the future?

A month ago Intel 13900K was best, fastest, CPU on market and then AMD came with Ryzen 7000 series and took leadership. Then Intel came with 13900KS and took over. AMD came with Ryzen 7000x3d and dethroned Intel.In few months we will have refresh from Intel side which will take lead and then AMD will come with Zen5. I think decision is not on CPU side but everything else. Ryzen 7000 needs new motherboard and expensive DDR5 while Intel supports DDR4 and DDR5 and current motherboard.If top performance is not required Ryzen 5000 is good choice to save money but its days are over - there probably will be no refresh. Intel just started with new motherboards and current generation will be ok for years to come. What could be limiting factor is AVX512 support. Some “math” oriented programs, like molecular dynamics, have significant speed improvements when using AVX512. Before only Intel supported it but with 12th gen they removed it cause of hybrid archicture (E cores do not support it). Older 12th gen still has AVX512 and could be enabled and used but was removed from 13th gen.Ryzen 7000 are first to support AVX512 (and is faster than Intel’s).So, if you need AVX512 Ryzen 7000 is your way. Or older 11th gen Intel or Xeon (quite more expensive). There is something else. As I read Ryzen 7000 has issues with DDR5, it is not as stable as Intel. This means Ryzen works ok till some 4800 but above is unstable. Intel works without issues much higher, 6400 or even higher. I had identical issue with my Ryzen 3000 but in few months issue was resolved with BIOS update.

What is the closest?","output":"Knights are extremely similar. This is true both in terms of social class and military role. Knights and samurai both occupied a social status distinctly above peasants, artisans, and merchants.Knights and samurai both were usually pledged to feudal lords who owned land. They could in some cases have land of their own, and in other cases could be itinerant and seeking a lord to support them.Knights and samurai were generally permitted to carry swords throughout the feudal period, even in times and places when sword laws were fairly restrictive.Knights and samurai both varied wildly in terms of income and earnings.Knights and samurai both had a generally hereditary status and were usually trained from an early age, but that status could be earned by someone lower-born.Both usually fought wars from horseback while wearing the heaviest available armor.Both had a dueling culture among peers.Both were supposed to hold to a code of honorable behavior (bushido, chivalry). There are not really very many easy distinctions to make between knights and samurai other than some very particular details. Archery was a much bigger part of the repertoire of samurai than it was for knights. This isn’t actually a very big deal in the big picture. Then there are also an assortment of specific cultural details, like the whole Christianity thing and religious orders of knights. On the whole, if you look at the diverse range of details for knights at various times and places in European history, it’s pretty hard to say that samurai aren’t pretty much the Japanese version of knights."},{"instruction":"Whats the #1 thing you always pray for?","output":"However, one example of a shrewd and [LINKED_TEXT: smart business] [URL: https://www.baydhabonews.com/2023/03/how-to-make-large-business-in-online.html] move that is widely recognized was when Apple co-founder, [LINKED_TEXT: Steve Jobs] [URL: https://www.baydhabonews.com/2023/03/how-to-make-large-business-in-online.html], made a deal with Microsoft's Bill Gates in 1997.

Its venom, however, is lethal in less than 10 percent of untreated victims, but the snake's aggressiveness means it bites early and often. Look how ones hand turns into if the sanke bites. Inland taipan:The venom of the Inland Taipan is extremely potent and is rated as the most toxic of all snake venoms in LD50 tests on mice. As well as being strongly neuro-toxic the venom contains a 'spreading factor' (hyaluronidase enzyme) that increases the rate of absorption. Now finally the deadly microbes The most dangerous microbes for humans are those that are easily transmitted, virulent and invasive to central organs like the blood and lung, robust survivors in the environment, have a low infection dose and are without any specific treatment or vaccine. Most of them are zoo-noses transmitted from animals and often with insects as vectors. The most dangerous microbes cause a very high mortality, are identified as high-risk agents or “bio hazard-level 4” agents and are treated at the highest level of infection protection with strict isolation measures. Dangerous microbes occur as a problem mostly in countries with low hygiene standards/high population density and in tropical-subtropical areas.

While B gets a hard one, he struggles to solve it and is unhappy. When our society was not so advanced, life was so much simpler. The same can not be said about ours. The more advanced we become, we encounter newer and more complicated challenges. Climate change, cybercrime, online bullying, and so many more.

It acts as a gateway, facilitating communication between the user and other servers on the web. When a user makes a request to access a website or any online resource, the request first goes through the proxy server, which then forwards the request to the intended destination. The response from the destination server is then sent back to the proxy server, which in turn relays it back to the user. The primary purpose of a proxy server is to enhance privacy, security, and performance. Here's how it works: Privacy: When you connect to a website through a proxy server, your IP address is masked, and the website only sees the IP address of the proxy server. This helps protect your identity and adds a layer of anonymity as your original IP address remains hidden. Security: Proxy servers can act as a firewall between your device and the internet. They can filter incoming and outgoing traffic, blocking potentially harmful requests or malicious content. Proxy servers also offer features like encryption, which can secure your data when transmitted over the internet. Performance: By caching web pages and storing copies of frequently accessed resources, proxy servers can reduce bandwidth usage and improve browsing speed. When a user requests a cached resource, the proxy server can provide it directly, eliminating the need to fetch it from the original server. This caching mechanism enhances efficiency, especially in environments with multiple users accessing the same content. Content Filtering: Proxy servers can be configured to restrict or filter certain types of content. Organisations often use proxy servers to block access to specific websites or to control internet usage within their networks. This feature allows network administrators to enforce policies, enhance productivity, and protect against potential security threats. There are different types of proxy servers, including: Forward Proxy: It handles requests from internal network devices to external servers on the internet. Reverse Proxy: It receives requests from external clients and forwards them to backend servers. It is commonly used to distribute traffic among multiple servers and provide load balancing. Transparent Proxy: It intercepts network traffic without modifying it and is primarily used for caching purposes. Anonymous Proxy: It hides the user's IP address but may still provide information about the user's activity to the destination server. VPN (Virtual Private Network) Proxy: It establishes a secure connection between the user's device and the proxy server, encrypting the traffic and providing a higher level of privacy. Overall, a proxy server acts as an intermediary, enabling users to access the internet while providing benefits such as privacy, security, improved performance, and content filtering."},{"instruction":"was speeding when a police car going the other way flashed his light bar at me.

After he'd seized the galaxy for himself nothing else mattered to him,..except for himself maintaining the monopoly on power he'd amassed over years of plotting and murdering. During the Clone Wars General Grievous was just another tool, or pawn, or any other individual that Palpatine manipulated as a means to an end. He certainly didn't respect him as a friend, acquaintance, or even as an associate. He may have given a slight nod to the generals leadership and tactical skills, but apart from that General Grievous was just another expendable goon.

Restrictions on mileage and maintenance, plus the fact that you never own the car outright and therefore always have a monthly payment, mean that leasing doesn’t work well for many types of buyers. But that doesn’t mean it’s always a bad idea. There are definitely times when it makes sense to lease a car instead of buying it. When automakers are confident that their cars have good resale value, they’ll often lower the lease rates and will make back their money when they re-sell the car when the lease expires. Similarly, if you’re uncertain whether the car you want will hold its value, leasing ensures you won’t be stuck trying to trade in a car that no one wants – it locks in what you’ll pay to always be in a fairly new car. But because you don’t own the car, a lessee must be very careful with the vehicle. You’ll pay for any damage beyond the slightest of scratches when you return your car after a few years, and also for any mileage you accumulate over the specified limit. If the car is totaled during the lease period, you typically lose your upfront payment, so you’re advised to keep that low. And if you don’t expect to be trading in your car after two or three years, whether you lease or buy, you’re probably better off as a buyer. In shopping for a new car, you can run a Google search for current lease deals; a number of websites collect the most attractive offers for each month. But just be sure you know what you’re getting yourself into for a lease, and also be diligent in researching great deals for ordinary purchases. To see which option makes the most sense for you, if leasing’s restrictions don’t already turn you off, compare the total cost of your lease to the purchase price of the vehicle (the price you’d pay, not the inflated window sticker), minus what you’d likely get in a few years when you sell it or trade it in.

This type of radiation ionizes atoms, altering their electromagnetic properties and interactions with nearby molecules. The microwave's intense heat essentially destroys everything you're attempting to prepare. This article looks into claims that this radiation is harmful to human health. The following are the health risks associated with microwaves. Here are a couple of examples: Insomnia. Sleep disorders include insomnia. The brain is an organ that controls everything in the body. Radiation is said to interfere with the brain's production of the melatonin hormone. This eventually leads to sleeplessness. According to science, insomnia is a disease that affects the body's well-being. Cancer. Electromagnetic radiations are carcinogenic in nature. All carcinogenic substances cause cancer. People who frequently microwave their foods are more likely to develop cancer, according to research. Cancer is thought to be caused by the accumulation of radiations in the body. Fatigue. Fatigue is nothing more than tiredness. When the body is unable to eliminate lactic acid that has accumulated as a result of anaerobic transpiration, it develops this condition. Electromagnetic radiations, in this case, reduce the efficient supply of oxygen to rid the body of lactic acid, resulting in fatigue.

Wavefunction collapse is not a physical process. It is a mental model, arguably a flawed one, of the most problematic aspect of the quantum theory. (NB: What follows is influenced in part by my personal views on the topic and while the facts that I present are not controversial, my views do not necessarily reflect the entirety of the physics community.) Here is the problem. The quantum theory describes the state of a physical system as a superposition (weighted sum) of so-called eigenstates (the German prefix eigen- meaning proper or something similar). An act of measurement: that is, interaction between the quantum system and a classical measuring instrument, confines the quantum system to a specific eigenstate. If the instrument is removed, the quantum system evolves into a superposition of many (possibly infinitely many) eigenstates. This evolution is governed by some variant of the Schrödinger equation, which depicts a \\"unitary evolution\\" of the quantum system's wavefunction. But when another measurement takes place, it selectively picks one eigenstate out of many. The wavefunction tells us the probabilities associated with each eigenstate but does not determine which eigenstate will prevail. This instantaneous, retroactive (!), \\"non-unitary\\" evolution of the wavefunction from a superposition of eigenstates to a specific eigenstate is what is called wavefunction collapse. This collapse is not governed by Schrödinger's equation or indeed any reasonable equation. It is essentially magic: one system (the quantum system before the measurement, with the measuring apparatus absent from the description) is magically and retroactively replaced by another (the quantum system confined by the measurement, with the apparatus part of the system's description.) An alternative view would be to assume that the quantum system has \\"known\\" about the presence of the measuring apparatus all along, even before it interacted with it. This nonlocality, somewhat surprisingly, does not bring about any violations of causality: no present-day observable is altered by how the measuring apparatus is arranged in the future. Nonetheless, this nonlocality is widely treated with skepticism. Instead, there are alternative depictions proposed, including Bohm's \\"pilot waves\\", Everett’s “many worlds” or the Copenhagen interpretation's \\"wavefunction collapse\\". Ironically, none of these interpretations actually get rid of the fundamental nonlocality of the theory (indeed, according to Bell's theorem, it really isn't possible), so they really are merely attempts to make the description more palatable to our prejudices. What the equations do say, at face value, is that a future interaction with the measuring apparatus influences the present-day (but unobservable) properties of the wavefunction, allowing the quantum system to evolve from one observed eigenstate to another observed eigenstate through unitary evolution and without any deus ex machina-like wavefunction collapse.

For that we desperately need real-time speech synthesis [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #HMQTg] and procedural animations (like Euphoria[LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #lERPk] did for rag-dolls). If you look back at the early RPGs you will see that they were vastly richer in narratives and options and customisations and endings than today’s AAA titles. This was because they were mostly text-based, and generating new text based on a few rules is trivial - not so much with speech and animations. The closest we got today is probably play-by-play commentary in sports titles, which only needs to account for a limited set of possibilities, based on the rules of the sport - and it still falls short when it comes to unique moments that the game designers didn’t plan for. We want the characters in our games to speak their minds, to react to our actions, to show emotions. For that they would need: dialog lines, pre-recorded in all the supported languages and with matching subtitles.animations, that have also been pre-recorded (using motion capture) . These are both lipsync animations (facial movement that fits with the dialog being spoken) and body animations (looping between 8 different idle animations gets old really fast, especially when the tone and emotion in what is spoken conflicts with the body language). Just imagine that when the game is nearly done, the designers realise that there are a few extra lines that they want to record - maybe a gameplay mechanic is not sufficiently explained, maybe the players can finish a quest in some way that the NPCs don’t know to react to. Someone needs to get hold of the original voice actors for all the languages supported, get them to a recording studio, record the lines, process the audio, get the files in game, test that they work well. It’s costly, it’s time consuming, it’s error prone, and it generally pushes everyone to play it safe - not too much dialog, not too many endings, not too many characters. Same for recording new animations. This is why I hope to see more effort in this direction - auto-generating speech and animations on the fly. Done right, they would be a game changer, literally. The game worlds would again be populated by characters with depth and agency, not just simple automatons reduced to playing the same 3 lines of script over and over again. We would see huge improvements in AI - because AI did improve drastically in the last decade, we just couldn’t show it in games because of all the restrictions imposed by using pre-recorded lines. There is another point I’d like to make about the future of games, after “graphics get as realistic as possible”: in some ways, we are already there. We can simulate, real-time, even on a console, a table covered with, say, papers, put it on a 4K screen running at 60fps next to a screen showing a live recording of a table covered with papers, and you couldn’t tell which is real and which is simulated. The biggest obstacle is scale - let’s say that 10 years from now we’ll be able to pull off a room full of people moving and talking, and you can put a VR headset on, “move” in that room, interact with the characters, and everything looks, sounds and feels perfectly real. But at that point we’ll still need more memory and processing power to simulate an entire battlefield, an entire city, an entire country, the whole world. And there will always be more things we need to add to the simulations - the contents of the pockets of each character, every insect on every tree, the effects of the passage of time and of the elements on every building in the game and so on. So even if you can achieve perfect quality, I think that the quest for quantity, for more things to add to the simulation, will still continue for a very long time.

Because this question has something that has to do with his office and his responsibilities as the head of a secular country. But celebrating a festival, etc are his personal choices and it should not be used as a tool to defame him in any way. And also, just consider a hypothetical scenario where he celebrates other major festivals of the country. I am pretty sure that similar question would popped up right here on quora, which would be something like this: Why does PM Modi celebrate the festivals of other religions? Has he stopped so low for votes? What do you think? By celebrating Ramadan, has Modi rubber-stamped the common notion that he is a two faced hypocrite? Is Modi right to celebrate the festivals of other religions, being a Hindu? You see what I am mean? Doesn't matter what you do or what you don't, such questions will always be asked by the people who want to bring him down. So it's our duty as responsible Indian citizens, to let his personal life be his own and not try to penalise anything and everything that he does."},{"instruction":"What is the structure of DNA?","output":"First, do you mean a strand of dna?

Unlike off-page SEO, which involves external strategies like backlinking and social media, on-page SEO concentrates on making your website more appealing to both users and search engine crawlers. Let's delve into the key components of on-page SEO and understand how it can significantly impact your website's performance. Content Optimization: Content lies at the core of on-page SEO. Crafting high-quality, relevant, and valuable content is essential for attracting both users and search engines. Incorporate relevant keywords naturally throughout your content to signal to search engines what your page is about. However, avoid keyword stuffing, as it can harm your rankings and readability. Aim to create engaging, informative, and shareable content that resonates with your target audience.Title Tags and Meta Descriptions: Title tags and meta descriptions are HTML elements that provide concise information about the content of a webpage. They appear in search engine results pages (SERPs) and play a vital role in attracting users to click on your link. Ensure that your title tags are descriptive, include relevant keywords, and are within the recommended character limit. Similarly, write compelling meta descriptions that accurately summarize your page's content, enticing users to visit your site.URL Structure: A clean and organized URL structure is beneficial for both users and search engines. Use descriptive and keyword-rich URLs that give a clear idea of the page's topic. Avoid lengthy and convoluted URLs that can confuse both users and search engine crawlers. Including hyphens to separate words in the URL is preferred for better readability.Heading Tags (H1, H2, H3, etc.): Heading tags are used to structure your content and provide hierarchy. The H1 tag should contain the main title of the page and be unique for each page. Subheadings (H2, H3, etc.) can be used to break down content into sections, making it easier for users to skim through and find relevant information. Utilizing heading tags properly not only improves the user experience but also helps search engines understand the context of your content.Internal Linking: Internal linking refers to linking to other pages within your website from relevant anchor text. This practice helps users navigate your site more easily and also helps distribute authority and ranking power throughout your website. Make sure to use descriptive anchor text and link to relevant pages that provide additional value to the reader.Image Optimization: Images are an essential part of web content, but they can also impact page load times if not optimized. Compress and resize images without compromising quality to ensure faster loading speeds. Use descriptive alt text for images to provide context to search engine crawlers, as they cannot \\"see\\" images like humans do. Conclusion: On-page SEO is a critical aspect of optimizing your website for better search engine rankings and user experience. By focusing on creating valuable content, optimizing title tags and meta descriptions, ensuring a clean URL structure, using proper heading tags, implementing internal linking, and optimizing images, you can enhance your website's visibility and attract more organic traffic. Keep in mind that on-page SEO is an ongoing process, and regularly updating and improving your content will help you stay ahead in the competitive digital landscape.

Wind turbines generate electricity by harnessing the kinetic energy from the wind, converting it into electrical energy through a generator. They do not require any type of fuel to operate. However, it's worth noting that diesel generators or backup power systems may be used in wind farms or wind turbine installations for specific purposes. These diesel generators are typically employed as backup power sources or for auxiliary systems in cases of low wind speeds or grid outages. The diesel generators can provide temporary power to maintain critical operations or to supplement the electricity supply during periods of low wind activity. The primary source of power for wind turbines remains the wind itself, which drives the turbine blades to generate electricity. The use of diesel generators in wind farms is limited and serves as a backup solution rather than the primary power source for the turbines. The aim is to maximize the use of clean, renewable wind energy while ensuring a reliable power supply when necessary.

[LINKED_TEXT: John Adams] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams] does not get nearly enough credit for his role in the American revolutionary period. Here roughly 240 years since the Revolution, Adam’s reputation has certainly faded in popular consciousness. He tends to fall into that general grouping of Founding Fathers that many consider an unusually brilliant assembly of men. Yet Adams’ brilliance stood out even among this unusually gifted assembly. The record is clear that he was far more than one among a number: his fellow revolutionaries repeatedly placed him at the center of the most important matters which confronted them.

But, it is easy to see why he is minimized in popular consciousness: John Adams was just not a warm and lovable person. He did not possess Washington’s social sophistication and it often showed famously. Consider this excerpt from a letter to his wife Abigail: There are very few People in this World, with whom I can bear to converse. I can treat all with Decency and Civility, and converse with them, when it is necessary, on Points of Business. But I am never happy in their Company. This has made me a Recluse, and will one day, make me an Hermit. [LINKED_TEXT: John Adams to Abigail Adams, August 18, 1776] [URL: http://www.masshist.org/digitaladams/archive/doc?id=L17760818ja] Adams was respected far more than he was liked even in his day. It is hard to read any recollection of Adams and not get a sense of his aloofness. But it is equally hard to read Adams’ writing and not get a sense of his incredible intelligence and dedication to the cause of Liberty. The [LINKED_TEXT: sheer volume of his written output] [URL: http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/adams-revolutionary-writings] alone would make an impression if it were not that he wrote with such articulate vision as to leave no doubt of his intellectual strength. This intellectual strength shows clearly too in the volume of his contributions to America during the Revolutionary period. Just a few high points from Adams’ revolutionary resume are enough to impress even the most ardent of his detractors: Prolific and influential publications against the Stamp Act and Townshend ActsDelegate to the First Continental CongressNomination of George Washington as Commander in ChiefPart of committee that drafted the Declaration of IndependenceHead of the Board of WarPart of delegation that negotiated the Treaty of ParisAmbassador to the NetherlandsAmbassador to Britain1st Vice-President of the United States Even trying hard to cherrypick produced a list of sufficient length that several of the bullet points will be passed over by most readers. A full list of Adams’ accomplishments in the revolutionary era would be absurdly exhausting—it would essentially be a history of the Revolution itself. But as important as his actions were, nothing was as significant as the less tangible but essential role he played as an intellectual leader of the Revolution. Consider this excerpt from an influential letter he wrote during the Revolution known as [LINKED_TEXT: Thoughts on Government:] [URL: https://www.nps.gov/inde/upload/Thoughts-on-Government-John-Adams-2.pdf] We ought to consider what is the end of government, before we determine which is the best form. Upon this point all speculative politicians will agree, that the happiness of society is the end of government, as all divines and moral philosophers will agree that the happiness of the individual is the end of man. From this principle it will follow, that the form of government which communicates ease, comfort, security, or, in one word, happiness, to the greatest number of persons, and in the greatest degree, is the best. All sober inquirers after truth, ancient and modern, pagan and Christian, have declared that the happiness of man, as well as his dignity, consists in virtue. Confucius, Zoroaster, Socrates, Mahomet, not to mention authorities really sacred, have agreed in this. If there is a form of government, then, whose principle and foundation is virtue, will not every sober man acknowledge it better calculated to promote the general happiness than any other form? Fear is the foundation of most governments; but it is so sordid and brutal a passion, and renders men in whose breasts it predominates so stupid and miserable, that Americans will not be likely to approve of any political institution which is founded on it. John Adams, [LINKED_TEXT: Thoughts on Government,] [URL: https://www.nps.gov/inde/upload/Thoughts-on-Government-John-Adams-2.pdf] 1776 There are many things striking in this short excerpt, but none are more so than his clarity. While Adams writes in a way that is comfortably modern, compare this to other writers of the 18th Century and you will get a picture of a formidable communicator. While Adams performed a laundry list of services to his new nation, dozens of which could independently headline an excellent essay regarding his profound contribution to the Revolution, none was more significant than the intellectual influence he held over the other founders. While George Washington was the soul of the revolution, John Adams was its brain. Adams’ intellectual leadership was recognized even by the giants around him. The great Enlightenment intellect [LINKED_TEXT: Benjamin Rush] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Rush] said of Adams: Every member of congress in 1776 acknowledged him, to be the first man in the house. Dr. Brownson (of Georgia) used to say, when he spoke, he fancied an angel was let down from heaven to illumine the congress. He saw the whole of a subject at a single glance, and by a happy union of the powers of reasoning and persuasion often succeeded in carrying measures which were at first sight of an unpopular nature… [LINKED_TEXT: Benjamin Rush, April 13, 1790] [URL: https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Adams/99-02-02-0911] Adams deserves equal standing with others such as Hamilton and Jefferson who get far more acclaim. He would probably be considered the most intelligent American President of all time were it not for his being surpassed by his own son, John Quincy Adams. While John Adams’ many important contributions to the Revolution in acts of both courage and unyielding devotion to principals deserve memorialization in honor, these are eclipsed by his intellectual leadership. Adams may be one of the most difficult of the United States Founding Fathers to love, or even like, but his contribution should never be discounted. He is understandably diminished both by his irascible demeanor and juxtaposition among giants, but students of history must give him his due."},{"instruction":"it a good idea to start my cybersecurity career with a PhD in cryptography?

I think there is one additonal factor however. I went to private school, and have had children who have gone to both. I feel that teacher quality and assessment contributes to private schools better college preparation. When teachers first graduate from school, they have the option of either working for a private or a public school. In my region public school teachers generally make more money and have better benefits. Private school teachers typically have smaller and fewer classes to teach. When first being hired it is very difficult to know which teacher will succeed, so let’s say public and private schools have an equal percentage of “good” and “bad” teachers after the first few years. In my experience, what later happens next is very different. Public school teachers are generally rated upon metrics that do not reflect how well they truly educate children. If they continue to achieve satisfactory performance they will generally be granted tenure. This in many cases is the “Kiss of Death” for future students. Often my kids were assigned to teachers who were truly just phoning it in, knowing that their jobs were secure. Of course. there were always a few great teachers around. There was virtual unanimity among the parents as to who these teachers were; so much so that at the beginning of each year it is a defacto lottery as to which students were granted the best teachers. This is not how an educational should function. On the private side, teachers were evaluated with significant input from both parents and students. In my experience, teachers were rated as good, not based upon how easy or nice they were, but rather how well they taught. Students and parents clearly understood that this was the most important metric. Teachers that were judged to be insufficient, were asked to move on. Thus the breakdown of public school teachers was: a few “green” teachers trying to make a name for themselves, and a whole lot a jaded teachers who do what is needed and little else. In private school you have a preponderance of motived teachers who primary interest is the education their charges."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between inductive and transductive learning?","output":"Lets begin with a train set U containing labeled training examples (x_i, y_i) where, x_i is the training instance and y_i is the corresponding label. Next, consider a test set V containing test instances (x'_i). The goal is to label the test instances x'_i correctly. Cool! We have defined the problem space now..... Now, let us see the approaches to solve the above problem via Induction and Transduction. Induction: Input : U, V may be present or not present (i.e. V may arrive in online manner) Output : y'_i for x'_i Approach : Try finding a function f, using the information available from U, such that f(x_i) = y_i. Once you find the predictive model/function f, you can predict the test instances in V in testing phase. Transduction: Input : U, V (V must be present beforehand, we must know in advance which instances need to be classified). Output : y'_i for x'_i (Actually we obtain a vector of labels for test instances, as they are available beforehand) Approach : Do not try finding a function f. Just don't do it. :-), Its not needed here. Try modeling a method which directly classifies test data. I know, its kinda hard to think of and objectify such a model, but I highly recommend to go through the pdf mentioned at the end of this answer, especially slides 11,12, and 13, for visual understanding. Some points about Inductive learning and Transductive learning: 1> Transductive learning does not build a predictive model, inductive learning on the other hand does. 2> Thus inductive learning can label new test points as soon as they are available; with very less computation, but transductive algorithm is needed to run every time a new test point arrives, thus increasing computation. 3> As said, in case of transductive learning test set should be available before hand, such that the transductive modeling of problem exploits the information available from unlabeled test data for better accuracy.

Some of the effects of earlier cuts are only now coming to the surface especially in the lower tiers of government, like the municipalities. They have been saddled with a lot of responsibilities without being given the means to carry them out properly. Education has considerable and structural funding problems.

If you ask the wrong questions, in the wrong order, using the wrong words, and include too many or too few questions, and you scrunch too many questions onto a page, you have a horrible instrument. That is why, when you present interesting or difficult to believe results, people want to see the instrument you used in the research. When you are doing qualitative research, you are serving the function of the questionnaire. Hence, you become the instrument. And, as in quantitative research that uses a questionnaire, you can ask the wrong questions, using the wrong words, using leading facial expressions, etc, etc, etc. In qualitative research, the person doing the interview is the instrument and the instrument can be good or bad."},{"instruction":"w big does a sample size need to be in a survey where the population is 200 million people?","output":"If you want to estimate the percentage of the population that has a certain characteristic (eg would approve of the current president) then the accuracy of your estimate (expressed as a confidence interval) depends on the size of your sample and the probability that a selected person has that characteristic. The calculations assume that the probability is constant and independent of who has already been chosen. For a sufficiently large population this is the case since removing one person from the population has a negligible effect on the probability that another person has that characteristic. Therefore, the size of the population is irrelevant and we can regard selecting members of the population as a Bernoulli trial (like rolling a dice). For small populations, the Bernoulli trial assumption doesn’t hold. If the population size was the same as the sample size then there would be no error at all."},{"instruction":"What are best app for photo editing?","output":"Here are some of the well-regarded photo editing apps for Android: 1.

Simple People are Tired of the Established Parties Its why they Voted for Modi many times But Today Modi is also failing many of them. He is also seen as a Politician who talks and lies and who does nothing for the Common man but boasts of everything he has done. They like AAP because AAP represents “Real Common Man” Teachers, Small Businessmen, Carpenters, Social Service Workers, Retired Civil Servants, Retired Cops - They are all One of the People. Not the Badal Family (SAD) Not the INC which is full of Gandhi Sycophants Not the BJP which is full of Hindutva Nodding Lackeys Kejriwal is a Different Type of Leader A Man of Action And he solves Common Mans Problems You have a School Issue, your AAP MLA sorts it out You have a Power Issue, you can visit your AAP MLA and they will handle it for you (Power as in Electricity not Satta power) During COVID Phase II - Retired Bank Staff say how well AAP organized and ran Delhi and how Medicines came to them through AAP Volunteers Now of course - the Propaganda Machinery will be against him. AK is not Rahul Gandhi He is a Tough Cookie and deals with BJPs Propaganda better than anyone else Whether AK is suitable to be a National Leader? Of course he is He is competent and Qualified He plans his Freebies strategically. He does real research on Things. No matter how hard BJP try - they cannot fault him despite all the rumours on Oxygen crisis. He simply did his job for his people in Delhi, Modi and Harshvardhan didnt do their Job for the People in India. So the Public Support of AAP is simply because (a) They are different (b) They come from Common People (c) They actually do work for the People instead of sitting on Dynastic Thrones like the INC or Dreaming about Grandiose Uneconomic Visions like BJP In short - They are Long Term Assets for the Nation"},{"instruction":"What is one of the best dish you ate in Bengaluru?","output":"My favorites: Bisi Bele Bath, Masala Dosa, Pani Puri & Neer Dosa: ‘Bisi bele bhath’, which translates to 'hot lentil rice dish' in Kannada language, is a wholesome meal.

It could be anything. Read my article on sequences. Introduction to Sequences Obviously, there are an infinite number of possible sequences, and thousands have been studied. Some sequences contain deep insights into number theory. A sequence could be either infinite or finite. A sequence has entries a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4,... One way to determine the entries, is to define a function f(n), and then evaluate it for positive integer values of n. a_n = f(n) f(1), f(2), f(3), f(4), ... I. Sequences From a Function 1. Constant function f(n) = c c, c, c, c, ... 2. Integers f(n) = n 1, 2, 3, 4,... 3. Even Numbers f(n) = 2n 2, 4, 6, 8,... 4. Odd Numbers f(n) = 2n - 1 1, 3, 5, 7,... 5. Counting by c's f(n) = cn c, 2c, 3c, 4c,... So, for example, \\"counting by 10's\\" would be 10, 20, 30, 40,... 6. Perfect Squares f(n) = n^2 1, 4, 9, 16, 25,... 7. Powers of 10 f(n) = 10^n 10, 100, 1000, 10000,... 8. Alternating Sequence f(n) = (-1)^n -1, 1, -1, 1,... II. Sequences where Entries are Derived from Previous Entries 9. Doubling Sequence a_(n+1) = 2a_n 1, 2, 4, 8, ... 10. Halving Sequence a_(n+1) = a_n/2 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8,... 11. Fibonacci Sequence = each term is the sum of the previous two terms a_(n+2) = a_n + a_(n+1) 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597,... If a Fibonacci number is divided by its immediate predecessor in the sequence, the quotient approximates the Golden Ratio, φ = a/b = (a+b)/a = 1.618033988.... The Fibonacci Sequence shows up repeatedly in botany. The number of petals of flowers are almost always Fibonacci numbers. III. Sequences Related to Primes 12. Primes = positive integers greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37,... 13. Composites = positive integers that are not prime 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14,... 14. Prime Counting Function pi(x) = number of primes less than x 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6,... 15. Prime Sums sigma(x) = sum of all primes less than x 2, 5, 10, 17, 28, 41, 58, 77,... 16. Twin Primes = primes where the nearest prime is 2 away 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 29, 31, 41, 43,... or making it explicit what the pairs are (3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), (17, 19), (29, 31), (41, 43),... 17. Cousin Primes = primes where the nearest prime is 4 away 18. Sexy Primes = primes where the nearest prime is 6 away 19. Prime Gaps = differences between consecutive primes 1, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 2,... 20. Mersenne Primes = a Mersenne prime is a prime number that is one less than a power of two. That is, it is a prime number of the form Mn = 2n − 1 for some integer n 3, 7, 31, 127,... 21. Fermat Numbers = numbers of the form 2^2^n + 1 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537, 4294967297, 18446744073709551617,... 22. Fermat Primes = Fermat number that is prime 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537 It is believed that these are the only five terms in the sequence. 23. Pseudoprimes = A pseudoprime is a composite number that passes a test or sequence of tests that fail for most composite numbers. There are actually different types of pseudoprimes based on what tests it passes or what qualities it shares with prime numbers. Some examples of pseudoprimes are Fermat pseudoprimes, Poulet numbers, Euler-Jacobi pseudoprimes, strong pseudoprimes, and Carmichael numbers. 24. Perfect Numbers = positive integers that are equal to the sum of their proper divisors 6, 28, 496, 8128, 33550336, 8589869056, 137438691328, 2305843008139952128,... 25. Amicable Numbers = one of a pair of positive integers where each is equal to the sum of their proper divisors of the other 220, 284, 1184, 1210, 2620, 2924, 5020, 5564, 6232, 6368, 10744, 10856, 12285, 14595,... or making it explicit what the pairs are (220, 284), (1184, 1210), (2620, 2924) (5020, 5564), (6232, 6368), (10744, 10856), (12285, 14595),... IV. Other Sequences 26. Hiccup Sequence = integers with an extra \\"1\\" 1, 1, 2, 3, 4,... 27. Asymptotic to Pi 3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.145, 3.14159,... 28. Look Up and Say 1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221,... You read the numbers out loud. When you see \\"1\\", you say there is \\"one one\\". When you see \\"11\\", you say there are \\"two ones\\", etc. 29. Palindrome Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4,... other examples include 11, 22, 33, 101, 121, 424, 1001, 246642, 332233, 100040001, etc. 30. Number of Regular Examples of Polytopes in Each Dimension 1, 1, infinity, 5, 6, 3, 3, 3,... The only polytope in zero dimensions is the point. The only polytope in one dimension is the line segment. Both could be considered regular. In two dimensions, there are an infinite number of regular polygons. In three dimensions, there are five regular polyhedra, which are the five platonic solids, the tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, and icosahedron. In the four dimensions, you have 4D analogs of each of these, plus an extra one called the 24-cell. In five or more dimensions, you only have analogs of the tetrahedron, cube, and octahedron. 31. Dimensions of Normed Division Algebras 1, 2, 4, 8 There are only four normed division algebras. The real numbers are one dimensional. The complex numbers are two dimensional. The quaternions are four dimensional. The octonions are eight dimensional. This example shows that you can not guess what the next term is in a sequence, or even if there is a next term, from simply looking at the first few terms. If you looked at the above sequence, you might incorrectly guess that the next term was 16, when, in reality, the correct answer is that there is no next term because it is a finite sequence with only four terms. In Elementary school, a student might be asked to write down the next few terms in the sequence 5, 10, 15, 20,... The teacher expects you to write 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40,... If the student wrote 5, 10, 15, 20, 1, 2, 3, 4,... the teacher would mark it wrong. However, that is a completely valid answer. That is just as much an acceptable sequence as the one the teacher was looking for. The teacher might say, \\"Assume the pattern holds\\". Well, from just looking at the first four terms, we do not know what the pattern is. Maybe the pattern is this. 5, 10, 15, 20, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 1, 2, 3, 4,... The truth is, in order to calculate the terms in a sequence, you must be given the definition of the sequence. The first few terms alone give zero indication of what the next term will be. Often on the Internet, you see so-called puzzles where you are supposed to guess what comes next in the sequence. Of course, from the point of view of mathematics, any answer is equally valid, whether or not it is what the writer had in mind. It not a test of mathematics. It is a test in psychology, trying to guess what the writer probably meant. There are sequences where we do not know whether it has zero terms or an infinite number of terms. Consider the following sequence. 32. Exceptions to the Riemann hypothesis If the Riemann hypothesis is true, then there are zero terms in this sequence. If it is not true, then there are an infinite number of terms in this sequence. Right now, we do not know which it is."},{"instruction":"As a proud Texan, I believe that for profit healthcare is the best system, it allows maximum profit for shareholders and companies.

We pay for it through taxes. But we judge a healthcare system on its ability to treat people, rather than its ability to provide profit for shareholders. I think I see the problem now though.

Is it really profitable?","output":"Dropshipping is a retail fulfillment method where a store doesn’t keep the products in stock. Instead, when a store sells a product using the dropshipping model, it purchases the item from a 3rd party and has it shipped on to the customer. As a result, the seller doesn’t need to handle the product directly. The biggest difference between dropshipping and therefore the standard retail model is that the selling product doesn’t stock or own inventory. Instead, the seller purchases inventory as required from a 3rd party—usually a wholesaler or manufacturer—to fulfill orders. While you'll argue that a consumer shouldn’t expect a premium-quality product for less than the worth of shipping, especially when it’s something purchased through an Instagram ad, sellers still need to handle any problems, complaints, and queries that arise during the transaction. Remember, as Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh discovered back within the day, dropshipping delivery times aren’t predictable, particularly if the item is coming from China. And as far as your customers are concerned, if they’re left waiting three months to receive an order, the fault is yours—and you've got to affect the chargebacks. Not to mention, if you sell a product that you simply didn’t first request a sample of, you’re taking it without any consideration that it’s as described. If it’s not and your customer is unhappy, you've got to handle the fallout. An equivalent goes for when your supplier runs out of stock after a customer has already placed an order with you. But customer service issues aren’t the sole problems you'll run into. Because the podcast Reply All acknowledged, “the pile in dropshipping seems to be in teaching folks that there’s pile in dropshipping.” For example, the online educational program Drop Ship Lifestyle offers courses priced from 1,297 to 4,997 (the latter includes a ticket to a dropshipping retreat in Bali) that promise to show people the way to “gain freedom through entrepreneurship by starting a business that gives real value to your customers and to your checking account .” The program was founded in 2012 by Anton Kraly, who found out his first e-commerce store in 2007 for a 29 investment and remodeled 1 million in sales in his second year in business. But Kraly is that the exception, not the rule. One drop-shipper interviewed on Reply All revealed she had only had two sales during a year. Another said he lost such a lot of money through dropshipping that he aroused sleeping on someone’s couch because he couldn’t afford to pay his rent. And yet today he’s peddling his own online dropshipping course, which pulled in 28,000 in its first month of existence.

R6 Siege is based on the same team that John Clark founded back in 1999, it just takes place a couple decades later. In universe, Rainbow was disbanded in 2012, then reformed in 2015, but story-wise, the book and games are all one continuous series. AFAIK, even Rainbow Six Siege’s Containment event technically takes place in the series, though the game series has had spinoffs that don’t take place in the same timeline, namely EndWar and Extraction. Ghost Recon isn’t based on any actual book made by Tom Clancy, but it certainly is inspired by it. Political tensions with Russia, tactical special forces teams, the CIA. It’s impossible NOT to see the connections to the Ryanverse. Additionally, because the R6 book takes place in the Ryanverse, and the R6 games are treated as direct sequels to the book, AND Ghost Recon Wildlands not only takes place in the same universe, it actually shares a number of characters, namely FBI SWAT team leader Eliza Cohen, GIGN operator Emmanuelle Pichon, Navy SEAL Meghan Castellano, BOPE operator Taina Pereira, SAS operator Mike Baker, and Lera Malkinova. Same with the Splinter Cell series. Not necessarily based on a book, but A. very clearly inspired by Clancy’s novels, and B. We know for a fact that it takes place in the Ryanverse along with R6. Now, it’s easy to assume that this means that every crossover in a Ghost Recon game signifies that that also takes place in the same universe, the Ryanverse, but it’s not really true. We know that GR and R6 take place in the same universe because Ubisoft outright told us. That doesn’t meant that The Predator or The Terminator take place in the same universe, because those were clearly just afterthoughts tied in, neither was based on the other. That being said, Tom Clancy’s The Division is much less so based on Clancy novels. Yes, we see special forces operators, espionage, and secret military units working with the U.S. government, but we also know for a fact that it’s NOT in the Ryanverse, so no reason treating it the same."},{"instruction":"What is the best ayurvedic medicine for diabetes?","output":"Ayurveda is an ancient form of traditional Indian medicine that dates back thousands of years. It is an holistic approach to health that focuses on the body, mind, and spirit. Ayurveda is known as an effective form of treatment for a variety of medical conditions, including diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood sugar levels. It is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as unhealthy eating habits, lack of exercise, and certain medications. Diabetes can lead to serious health complications if left untreated, such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Ayurveda aims to restore balance and harmony to the body, which is essential for proper functioning of the body’s systems. Ayurvedic treatment for diabetes involves a combination of lifestyle changes, herbal remedies, and dietary modifications. One of the most commonly prescribed ayurvedic remedies for diabetes is the use of herbal medicines. These are natural substances that are used to treat the symptoms and root causes of diabetes. The most common herbs used for diabetes management are: • Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia): This herb has been used for centuries to help lower blood sugar levels. It is believed to stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin, which helps the body to regulate sugar levels. • Gymnema sylvestre: This herb is known to help reduce sugar cravings and decrease cholesterol levels. It is also believed to help improve the production of insulin. • Turmeric (Curcuma longa): This herb has anti-inflammatory properties and is believed to help reduce blood sugar levels. • Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum): Fenugreek is believed to help improve insulin sensitivity, which can help with blood sugar control. • Amalaki (Emblica officinalis): This ayurvedic herb is known to help reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. In addition to herbal remedies, ayurveda recommends lifestyle modifications and dietary changes for diabetes management. These include: • Limiting carbohydrate intake: Eating a low-carbohydrate diet can help to control blood sugar levels. • Increasing physical activity: Regular exercise can help to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. • Avoiding processed and fried foods: Eating a diet that is high in fresh fruits and vegetables can help to improve overall health. • Limiting sugar intake: Eating too much sugar can cause blood sugar levels to spike. • Practicing yoga and meditation: These activities can help to reduce stress and improve overall health. Ayurveda is an ancient form of traditional medicine that has been used for centuries to treat a variety of medical conditions, including diabetes. Ayurvedic treatment focuses on restoring balance and harmony to the body through lifestyle modifications, herbal remedies, and dietary changes.

But the reason I’m writing an answer isn’t so much to reinforce that as it is to point out that pizza delivery isn’t the only area in which people try this exact same maneuver. I worked for just over four years at Walmart in the electronics department. One of my responsibilities there was to handle cellphone contracts. One night I was training one of our new guys how to use the contract system on the computer, get the phone set up, all that, and one of the customers we dealt with was a fellah and his friend, one getting the phone and the other paying for it. No biggie, and I helped the new associate through the process, which seemed to go quick and easy. Phone contracts, sadly, are never quick and easy. Something always goes at least a little bit wrong, and this time it went pretty bad wrong. For some reason, the system messed up and didn’t show there being a deposit needed on the account. It was only after we had gotten the contract finished and the phone set up that we scanned the bar code and the register told us they owed right around 400 up front. We apologized to the fellahs for the error, and I told them the options were to give back the phone and we would cancel the contract, or they could pay the deposit and be on their way with the new phone. The guy who was going to be using the phone picked it up and asked, “Well, what if we just walk out of here with it?” Both I and the new associate stared at him incredulously for a moment, then I patiently explained to him that we would then call the police because that would be stealing. They decided instead to hand back the phone and cancel the contract. More often, this sort of thing would happen regarding photos. Part of my duties was also to take care of both the instant print and one-hour photo areas, including checking folks out after they’d finished their prints. Most of the troubles would begin with people trying to print out copyrighted material, particularly professionally done photos since I was working in a tourist town. In order to make copies of these pictures, it was required that Walmart got copy of the proof that the person buying the prints was either the copyright holder themselves or had written permission from the copyright holder. It isn’t just company policy to do this, it’s full on enforceable copyright law. Of course, we would get several customers who simply thought we were being mean or didn’t understand this was actually a legal issue that could get us and them into a lot of trouble, so they would argue, and fuss, and occasionally threaten to simply take the pictures and leave without paying. It was at that last point that I would have to point out that we would be calling the police if they did so, as that would be theft. “You would call the police over 4 worth of pictures?!” I was asked one of these times. “Yes,” I replied. “The real question is, is 4 worth of photos worth having to deal with the cops and getting fined for much, much more?” Fortunately that did seem like too much hassle for them and they left the photos with me until they could get a copy of the copyright information for Walmart’s records, at which point I quite happily sold them the pictures. It’s really amazing sometimes how some people really don’t think out the consequences to their actions."},{"instruction":"Why don't people do their homework and study it out to realize Obama is a communist?","output":"I always love it when Conservatives tell me to “Do my homework” or “Do your own research”.

Hopefully you will too :) There was once on a time a shepherd boy whose fame spread far and wide because of the wise answers which he gave to every question. The King of the country heard of it likewise, but did not believe it, and sent for the boy. Then he said to him, “If thou canst give me an answer to three questions which I will ask thee, I will look on thee as my own child, and thou shalt dwell with me in my royal palace.” The boy said, “What are the three questions?” The King said, “The first is, how many drops of water are there in the ocean?” The shepherd boy answered, “Lord King, if you will have all the rivers on earth dammed up so that not a single drop runs from them into the sea until I have counted it, I will tell you how many drops there are in the sea.” The King said, “The next question is, how many stars are there in the sky?” The shepherd boy said, “Give me a great sheet of white paper,” and then he made so many fine points on it with a pen that they could scarcely be seen, and it was all but impossible to count them; any one who looked at them would have lost his sight. Then he said, “There are as many stars in the sky as there are points on the paper; just count them.” But no one was able to do it. The King said, “The third question is, how many seconds of time are there in eternity.” Then said the shepherd boy, “In Lower Pomerania is the Diamond Mountain, which is two miles and a half high, two miles and a half wide, and two miles and a half in depth; every hundred years a little bird comes and sharpens its beak on it, and when the whole mountain is worn away by this, then the first second of eternity will be over.” The King said, “Thou hast answered the three questions like a wise man, and shalt henceforth dwell with me in my royal palace, and I will regard thee as my own child.”"},{"instruction":"What did you get for Christmas 2017?","output":"Money from my family."},{"instruction":"w can I earn 1,000 monthly as a freelancer?","output":"Hi, There is one simple and working method Step 1 - Register on Upwork and Fiverr ( Freelancing site) Step 2 - Find what people are looking for Step 3 - On Upwork you create a seller account and on Fiverr u work as a buyer Step 4- Now search work on Upwork and buy that service from Fiverr and provide that service to Upwork You will earn more than 1000"},{"instruction":"Any recommendations for time management software (time tracking, estimates, invoices, purchase orders) for a creative agency?","output":"Seems that you’re looking for [LINKED_TEXT: TimeCamp] [URL: https://www.timecamp.com/]!

Would Jefferson have gotten upset, stormed off, and retire from politics forever? And without Jefferson, would his party have just broken up? It is hard to know. We do know that Jefferson’s election in 1800 had important effects. It was the first transition of power from one party to the opposition, and it was ultimately peaceful. Not a single shot was fired. Adams, in contrast, had wanted to continue Washington’s administration and did not, at first, change a single Cabinet member. The danger of an Adams victory might have been a sense that one party — the Federalist Party — achieved so much success that from then on, one-party government might well have become the rule, and it might have been the Federalist Party in power for a long time. Instead, the Federalist Party went away, but eventually other parties (such as the Whigs) arose to fill in the gap. Another effect of Adams’ re-election might have been the perception that the Alien & Sedition Acts were seen as just fine, even though it was a huge violation of the first amendment… (but the Supreme Court, at this point, didn’t feel the confidence to take on such a law). As it was, Jefferson and his party came to control the national government as a result of the election of 1800, and they overturned the Alien and Sedition Acts as quickly as they could. One other effect: The 12th amendment might not have been passed when it was (1802). The electoral college created a mess, because the Jeffersonians wanted Jefferson for president, Aaron Burr for Vice. But under the whacky original system (making the electoral college even worse than it is now), electors cast two undifferentiated votes — and they forgot to withhold one of their votes for Burr. This created a tie in the electoral college between Jefferson and Burr, the election then went to the House of Representatives, which in turn was tied for many ballots, and it nearly destroyed the system. The 12th amendment was passed and ratified to straighten some of this out."},{"instruction":"You are having a big argument with your spouse.

This has always been one of the limitations to offering pain relief during labor. Second: the woman would probably like to be aware enough to experience childbirth which is an indescribable experience in spite of the pain.

It is a remarkable point that Advaita Vedanta has no any founder in the realm of Indian philosophy. The concept of Brahman ( ब्रह्मण ) or Brahma ( ब्रह्म) is not something new for the Indians inasmuch as its root is already in amplified form. The Upanishadic philosophers have deeply explicated the significance of Brahman . Shankaracharya is said to have the first philosopher who explicitly explained the Upanishadic idea pertaining to Brahman in his outstanding work Brahma Sutra . The philosophy of Bhagvatapada is based on only three terms : Non-duality, Non-reality, and Non-difference. Non-duality means Oneness of the Absolute or Supreme Being. It is Advaita or not-two ( Advaita is a combination of a and dvaita in which a signifies ' not ’ and dvaita means ' dual, two’ ) . This Advaita is Transcendental Reality. According to Acharya Shankara only Brahman is real, true. Second negative Non-reality means there is no real existence of this empirical world . It is an illusion like a serpentine rope felt as a real snake in a dark room.Since worldly people accept the empirical world as real , it's Avidya or Maya. The situation of mundane world is like a twisted rope lying in a dark room. So, this visible world is a delusion . Third negative Non-difference means Individual Soul that is also real and there is no difference between Brahman and the Jiva that causes life in human beings. Brahman is Nirguna or formless while Individual soul is Saguna or Ishvara or God. In nutshell, his philosophical conclusion can presented in three phrases : Brahma Satyam, Jagan-mithya, Jivo Brahmaiva Naa Parah . It means there's no difference between Brahma and Jiva ( i.e. Individual soul carried by human beings) . In Advaita Vedanta Aham signifies ' Individual soul ’. So, ‘ Aham Brahmasmi' means the Individual soul is Brahma . It means both are sailing in the same boat."},{"instruction":"What will happen if 1 will be equal to 1 rupee?

But let’s not include him as it would be a sin to compare him with the likes of Karna, Arjuna, Bhishma etc. Same goes for Lord Balaram. I will not include Lord Balaram in my answer as he was divine and an incarnation of Adishesha himself. Mahabharata had various warriors who were very powerful and strong and had some amazing feats to their name. Comparing the warriors or ranking the warriors has always been a matter of debate. Loads of answers get collapsed due to the disagreement of some blind fans. But still I would attempt to answer this question which already has 100 or more answers. All my points would be based on BORI CE but I will provide the footnotes from KMG as it’s easier to find and read. Let’s rank these warriors on the basis of their feats and records. (10). Ghatotkacha The mighty demon son of Bhima had innumerable feats to his name but his real prowess was shown on the 14th night.He created his own army of Rakshasas out of his illusions. Such was the valour of those rakshasas that they made the powerful Karna retreat and defeated them. Ghatotkacha roared like a lion and terrified by this, the elephants exuded urine. The men were extremely miserable. Once twilight has passed, the rakshasas become even more powerful on earth. In every direction, they brought down a shower of boulders. Iron wheels, catapults, lances, javelins, spears, shataghnis and battleaxes showered down incessantly. On seeing the fierce and terrible state in the field of battle, the kings, your sons and Karna were distressed and fled in different directions. He defeated Dronacharya various times.He overpowered Aswatthama in a fierce fight using his illusions.His Rakshasas were very powerful and were killed in a very fierce fight. Why is he not ranked a bit higher? He was defeated by Aswatthama various times. His rakshasas were killed by Aswatthama. He never overpowered Aswatthama except for instance.He could not get an upper hand over Karna until the very last moment. (9). Abhimanyu The powerful son of Arjuna is already known as the bravest warrior from Mahabharata due to his extraordinary feats on the 13th day of Kurukshetra War where he singlehandedly created havoc in the Chakravyuha made by Kuru Army.He defeated Duhshasana in archery battle and the latter fled away from the battlefield.He defeated Karna 5 times and overpowered him once on 13th day. He first defeated defeated Karna and his brother had to come for saving Karna. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #btrAw] He defeats Karna then for the second time with the use of normal arrows and Karna fled away from the battlefield. He shattered that net of elephants, horses, chariots and infantry. The immensely illustrious Abhimanyu angrily routed them with his arrows. Karna was afflicted by Abhimanyu’s many arrows. He fled on swift horses and the array was shattered. [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #dtIRi]Abhimanyu then killed six of Karna’s advisors in front of him after overpowering Karna in an archery duel. This incident occurred after the incident given below. Phalguna’s son once again pierced Karna in the ear with a barbed arrow. Angering him even more, he pierced him with fifty arrows. Radheya pierced the great warrior back in turn. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Covered with arrows all over his limbs, he looked extremely radiant. Extremely enraged, he caused Karna to be covered in blood. Covered with arrows and streaming blood, the brave Karna was also resplendent. Both of them were beautiful with arrows on their bodies, and blood flowed from their wounds. Those great-souled ones looked like flowering kimshukatrees. Subhadra’s son destroyed six of Karna’s advisers, who were brave and wonderful in the art of fighting, together with their horses, charioteers, standards and chariots. [LINKED_TEXT: [3]] [URL: #RmcLd]Abhimanyu even defeated Dronacharya, Aswatthama, Brihadbala, Kripacharya, Duryodhana, Karna, Kritavarman and Shakuni even though all these people attacked him in a group.[LINKED_TEXT: [4]] [URL: #gbgbA] Beholding them broken and routed, Drona and Drona's son, and Vrihadvala, and Kripa, and Duryodhana, and Karna, and Kritavarman, and Suvala's son (Sakuni), rushed in great wrath against the unvanquished son of Subhadra. Almost all these, O king, were beaten back by thy grandson. Abhimanyu was made chariotless. He was deprived of a bow fairly by Karna. He still managed to defeat or overpower Aswatthama with a mace.[LINKED_TEXT: [5]] [URL: #LuVHv] Why does the brave hero get 9th rank and not any higher rank? Abhimanyu faced various defeats in his life which cannot be ignored. He was defeated on 1st day itself by Bhishma, 12th day by Bhagadatta etc. 8). Bhagadatta He was probably the most powerful fighter who fought on the back of an elephant.He had almost defeated Ghatotkacha on 1st day of war itself.He was an important warrior for the Kurus and was very instrumental during Bhishma’s reign as General of Army.His Valour on the 12th day was amazing.His elephant had almost killed Bhima that day.He defeated a Group attack which had Abhimanyu and Bhima in it. Such was the power of his immensely powerful and infallible Vaishnavastra that Lord Krishna himself had to save Arjuna.[LINKED_TEXT: [6]] [URL: #Sqzab] There’s no need to prove that why he is at 8th. There are tons of better warriors than him. (7). Satyaki He is undoubtedly the most underrated warrior of Mahabharata.He had started creating havoc from the first day itself where he along with Abhimanyu managed to make Drona and Bhishma retreat.He defeated Shakuni various times in the war.Satyaki had defeated Bhishma in the war.He defeated Karna on the 12th day when he attacked Karna along with Arjuna, Bhima and Dhristadyumna. Karna was present with his brother so it was not a group attack. Then Bhima, jumping down from his own car, like a second Garuda, slew with his excellent sword five and ten combatants amongst those that supported Karna. Mounting once more on his car and taking up another bow, he pierced Karna with ten shafts and his charioteer and steeds with five. Dhrishtadyumna also taking up a sword and a bright shield; despatched Charmavarman and also Vrihatkshatra, the ruler of the Naishadhas. The Panchala prince then, mounting upon his own car and taking up another bow, pierced Karna with three and seventy shafts, and uttered a loud roar. Sini's grandson also, of splendour equal to that of Indra himself, taking up another bow pierced Suta's son with four and sixty shafts and roared like a lion. And cutting off Karna's bow with a couple of well-shot shafts, he once more pierced Karna on the arms and the chest with three arrows. The king Duryodhana, and Drona and Jayadratha, rescued Karna from the Satyaki-ocean, as the former was about to sink into it. [LINKED_TEXT: [7]] [URL: #XOvhB]His valour on the 14th day was just next to Arjuna on that day. He defeated everyone who came in his way and successfully penetrated the 3 complex vyuhas formed by Dronacharya.He defeated Dronacharya on the way whom even Arjuna avoided that day. Even Sanjaya cross-verified this fact just after this paragraph. Apart from this, he defeated Kritavarman, Jalasandha and almost every warrior who came in his way.Satyaki defeated Karna. Karna became very sad after being defeated and climbed upon Duryodhana’s chariot. Satyaki defeated Dushasana and various other brothers of Duryodhana and spared their lives for the sake of protecting Bhima’s vow.Satyaki defeated Aswatthama, Kritavarman and hundreds of other maharathas. Satyaki had various powerful and amazing deeds but these are enough to describe him. Even though, he is so powerful. Why is he placed at 7th rank? Satyaki was defeated various no. of times by Karna even though he defeated him twice or thrice.Karna defeated Satyaki 8 times in the Kurukshetra war itself. Such was Karna’s prowess that Satyaki couldn’t defeat him even though he attacked Karna in a group.Satyaki had a fair amount of defeats in his life. He was defeated by Jayadratha on day 13 as Jayadratha’s boon only included the 4 Pandavas.Other than these, I can’t recollect his defeats. You may tell me in the comments. (6). Bhishma Bhishma’s exploits as a warrior are well known. He had some amazing feats in his life but the problem is that they were overshadowed by his fair amounts of defeats in his latter life.Bhishma had the power to stop the flow of River Ganga.Bhishma defeated thousands of kings who had arrived from all around the world with ease, during the Kashi Princess’ Swayamvara.Bhishma defeated Parshurama in a battle which lasted for around 23 days. The fact that he was defeated was accepted by none other than Lord Parshurama Ji himself. He in fact accepted this 2 times.He once accepted it when Bhishma had readied his blazing Brahmastra. He accepted it once again in front of Amba. Bhishma was among the only few who managed to defeat the mighty warrior Arjuna. Arjuna was fighting mildly against Bhishma. Krishna became enraged at this. Bhishma defeated all the Pandava soldiers and the Pandavas including Arjuna on day 7th. He was aided by Shalya.[LINKED_TEXT: [8]] [URL: #fvpgQ] He was invincible. Why is he at 6th rank? He managed to defeat Arjuna when Arjuna was fighting mildly with him. Check out the screenshot I had provided.He was made to retreat by Satyaki.Bhishma in his old age was not as powerful as he was in his youth.He had himself accepted a no. of times that he was inferior to Arjuna. (5). Bhima The mighty son of Vayu was among the best mace fighters of his era. His archery skills are most of the time underrated.He killed 98 brothers of Duryodhana in archery fights, Duhshasana with a sword and Duryodhana with a mace.He killed powerful Rakshasas like Hidimba, Baka, Jatasura etc.He defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling battle.He killed Keechaka with his bare hands.He killed the powerful Yakshas who were guarding the beautiful flowers.He defeated Dronacharya and Bhishma various times in the Kurukshetra war.Such was his prowess that he defeated Karna 6 times on day 14th itself. I’ll provide information about all his victories. Don’t worry. Most of the times, being chariotless is mentioned as being defeated. This was how it was calculated by Sanjaya.Here, Bhima made him chariotless and forced him to ascend someone else’s chariot. The word ‘vanquished’ is clearly mentioned there. Here, Bhima again defeated Karna. He made him chariotless. Karna was afllicted by Bhima’s arrows and had to go on another chariot. Dhrithrashtra himself terms this as ‘retreat’. Here again, Bhima was overpowering Karna. Bhima deprived Karna of his bow and killed his horses. Duryodhana himself thought that his friend was confronting difficulties and was going to be ‘devoured’ by Bhima. Bhima again deprived him of his chariot and again Sanjaya mentions it as a defeat Bhima again makes him chariotless and defeats him. He even brought down the standard of Karna Bhima again made him chariotless and Duryodhana has to send his brothers to save Karna. Bhima even defeated Duryodhana a no. of times in various archery encounters.Bhima killed 2–3 akshouni or even more army of the Kauravas.He was more fearful than anyone else for Dhrithrashtra and for Duryodhana. A warrior who defeated Karna should be above Karna. Why is he ranked so low? The reason is that he was defeated a number of times by Karna.I will mention only one of Bhima’s defeat by Karna as the answer is already getting too long. He spared Bhima’s life here. Other than this, Karna defeated Bhima 10 or more times on 16th and 17th day. Bhima was even defeated by Dronacharya, Aswatthama etc. (4). Dronacharya The powerful preceptor was very powerful and had some amazing feats to his name. He survived for 15 days and did a pretty decent job as a warrior.He was one of the best strategists who knew almost every war formation.He killed around 2 to 3 akshouhinis of warriors.His skills as a warrior can be estimated by the fact that he defeated group attacks which had Bhima, Satyaki, Yudhisthira etc. in it.Such was his prowess that he defeated Arjuna on day 14 and Arjuna had to avoid him and attack other warriors. It is clearly mentioned there that Drona was invincible.[LINKED_TEXT: [9]] [URL: #aHqRO] Even though he had so many feats, why is he not at third or second or first rank? Dronacharya had fair amounts of defeats in his life.He was defeated by Yudhisthira who was not such a powerful warrior on the 14th night. Dronacharya used a lot of celestial weapons on him but he couldn’t defeat him. Yudhisthira countered every weapon used by Drona. Drona had to abandon Yudhisthira. Dronacharya was defeated by Arjuna, Satyaki, Bhima etc. (3). Aswatthama The powerful Brahamana was among the most destructive warriors. His skills were almost untouched by any warrior except Karna, Dronacharya and Arjuna.His feats are enough to show his ultimate prowess as warrior. He fought mildly with the Pandavas till day 15 but showed his real strength after his father was killed.Aswatthama was only next to Karna on the 14th night. He was destroying all the rakshasas and almost defeated Ghatotkacha.He killed the demon son of Ghatotkacha, Anjanaparva. He killed an akshouni of nairritas who were a type of rakshasas. He overpowered and defeat Ghatotkacha various times.Here, Ghatotkacha was made chariotless and Dhristadyumna, Bhima arrived to assist him. This clearly indicates he was overpowering him. He made Ghatotkacha unconscious and almost kills him. He caused all the Pandava soldiers to run away. Such was his valour, that he killed an akshouhini of Ghatotkacha’s demons instantly. His Narayanastra on 15th day made all the Pandavas, soldiers and everyone surrender it. It can be named as a defeat for every Pandava including Arjuna etc. Even Aswatthama told that they were defeated. Such was the power of that weapon, that it slayed an akshouhini of soldiers.Aswatthama then became enraged and defeated Dhristadyumna and Satyaki. Aswatthama even defeated Bhima even though Bhima had attacked him in a group. Even, the Agneyastra weapon of Aswatthama killed an akshouhini of soldiers. It had to be countered by Arjuna’s Brahmastra. I have already given you information about Aswatthama’s destructive power. He killed 4 akshouhinis which are proved by me. Other than these, he might have killed 1 more. A total of 5–6 akshouhinis were destroyed by Aswatthama alone.His Valour on the last day was immense. He killed all the remaining soldiers of Pandavas. He killed the Upapandavas, Dhristadyumna and Shikhandi in fierce fights. Lord Shiva himself had entered his body. Such was his prowess that Shri Krishna had to take Arjuna, Satyaki and other 4 Pandavas away from the camp that night. He is not ranked above because Karna and Arjuna were better than him. (2). Karna The mighty son of Surya was very powerful and was the best in Kauravas. His feats are enough to describe his prowess as a warrior.His performance in the Rangabhoomi was better than Arjuna according to Yudhisthira.He defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling match in a short time.He defeated all the kings in the Swayamvara of Kalinga Princess. They included powerful kings like Rukmi, Jarasandha etc.He defeated Satyaki various no. of times in the Kurukshetra war.He defeated Bhima 9–10 times and even spared his life once.He defeated Nakula, Yudhisthira and Sahadeva and spared their lives.He defeated a lot of group attacks which were done on him. He was the best when it came to countering group attacks.He defeated every major Pandava warrior except Arjuna in the Kurukshetra war (directly).He indirectly defeated Arjuna when he had used his Bhargavastra. Arjuna accepted his incapablity to counter it. Why is he not ranked above Arjuna? You will get all the information regarding this ahead. (1). Arjuna The mighty son of Indra was the most powerful warrior of Mahabharata. His skills were unmatched. He had no one equal to him in archery except Krishna and Balarama. His feats bear testimony to his strength.He killed 30 million Nivatakavacha demons using his powerful celestial weapons.He killed 1 million Gandharvas using his agneyastra.He defeated all the major Kuru warriors in th Virata War singlehandedly which included Karna, Aswatthama, Bhishma, Dronacharya, Duryodhana etc.In the Kurukshetra war, he was just at his best.He defeated Dronacharya various number of times.He defeated Bhishma a lot of times.He killed important warriors of Kauravas including Shrutayu, Shrutayudha, Bhagadatta etc. He was among those who caused the greatest carnage and destruction.He killed 7 akshouhini army on day 14th itself. Such was his prowess that he was almost incvincible that day and was only defeated by Dronacharya.He also defeated an angry Aswatthama on day 15. This feat was very difficult to accomplish as Aswatthama had already defeated Bhima, Satyaki, Dhristadyumna etc. Apart from this he had various feats which bear testimony to his strength. Now why is Arjuna ranked above Karna? Read yourself. I will provide all proofs from authentic versions. If you have any complaint, tell me in comments. Please don’t downvote or mass report. I have mentioned everything as it was given in the texts. Encounters between Karna and Arjuna. Arjuna alone managed to defeat Karna 4 times in the Virata battle. Contrary to the popular belief, Lord Hanumana was not protecting the chariot of Arjuna as the use of divine weapons was limited or very less in that battle. That battle was more about killing the charioteers or making them retreat. Arjuna managed to do that 4 times. Arjuna first defeated Karna when both of them were alone. Karna retreated after getting humiliated . [LINKED_TEXT: [10]] [URL: #VTLPq] This repeated once again when Karna came back after sometime.[LINKED_TEXT: [11]] [URL: #aStXP] Later Karna attacked in groups only to be defeated twice by the strength of Arjuna’s celestial weapons. First time, he defeated them with an Aindrastra [LINKED_TEXT: [12]] [URL: #HJolU] and the second time he defeated them with his sammohana weapon.[LINKED_TEXT: [13]] [URL: #fFIPx]They never faced in a full fledged combat in the Kurukshetra war except the last battle. Other that these Karna was defeated by Arjuna twice on the 14th day where he was saved both the times by Aswatthama. 1st defeat of Karna of 14th day. Drona’s son, Aswatthama saved Karna here by severing Arjuna’s arrow. In that battle, the mighty-armed Phalguna struck Vaikartana Karna with one hundred arrows that penetrated all the inner organs. The powerful son of a suta had blood flowing from all his limbs. However, the brave one pierced Phalguna back with fifty arrows. On witnessing his dexterity in battle, Arjuna could not tolerate it. The brave Partha Dhananjaya severed his bow and quickly struck him between the breasts with nine arrows. It was a time when speed was of the essence. Wishing to kill him in the battle, Dhananjaya then quickly shot an arrow that was as radiant as the sun. But as that arrow descended forcefully, Drona’s son severed it with a sharp arrow that was in the shape of a half- moon. Severed, it fell down on the ground. [LINKED_TEXT: [14]] [URL: #ZXMDq]2nd defeat of Karna by Arjuna of 14th day is mentioned in the same link which I have provided as a footnote for the above one. In this one, Karna was made chariotless by Arjuna and Aswatthama saved him. O king! At this time, on witnessing Karna’s valour, he drew his bow back up to his ears and dispatched Karna’s four horses to the land of the dead with four supreme arrows. With another broad-headed arrow, he brought down his charioteer from the seat of the chariot. While your son looked on, he covered him with arrows. In that encounter, he was thus shrouded. His horses were slain. His charioteer was killed. Confounded by that net of arrows, he did not know what he should do. O great king! On seeing that he was without a chariot, Ashvatthama took him on his own chariot and continued to fight with Arjuna. [LINKED_TEXT: [15]] [URL: #XhtIJ]Other than this, Karna was also defeated by Arjuna when Kripacharya saved Karna and took him on his own chariot. Sanjaya continued, 'Beholding the son of Pandu rushing towards him like an elephant towards a rival elephant, Karna fearlessly proceeded against Dhananjaya. Partha, however, soon covered Karna who was thus advancing with great impetuosity, with showers of straight shafts, equipped with wings of gold. Karna also covered Vijaya with his shafts. The son of Pandu then once more shrouded Karna with clouds of arrows. Then Karna, filled with rage, pierced Arjuna with three shafts. The mighty car-warrior, Arjuna, beholding Karna's lightness of hand, could not brook it. That scorcher of foes shot at the Suta's son thirty straight shafts, whetted on stone and equipped with blazing points. Endued with great might and energy, he also pierced him, in rage, with another long arrow on the wrist of his left arm, smiling the while. Karna's bow then dropped from that arm of his, which had thus been pierced with great force. Then the mighty Karna, taking up that bow within the twinkling of an eye, once more covered Phalguna with clouds of shafts, displaying great lightness of hard. Dhananjaya then, O Bharata, smiling the while, baffled with his own shafts, that arrowy shower shot by the Suta's son. Approaching each other, those two great bowmen, desirous of counteracting each other's feats, continued to cover each other with showers of shafts. The battle that took place between them, viz., Karna and the son of Pandu, became exceedingly wonderful, like that between the two wild elephants for the sake of a she-elephant in her season. Then the mighty bowman Partha, beholding Karna's prowess, quickly cut of the latter's bow at the handle. And he also despatched the four steeds of the Suta's son to Yama's abode with a number of broad-headed shafts. And that scorcher of foes also cut off from the trunk the head of Karna's driver. Then, the son of Pandu and Pritha pierced the bowless, the steedless, and the driverless Karna with four shafts. Then that bull among men Karna, afflicted with those shafts, specially jumping down from that steedless car, mounted upon that of Kripa. Beholding the son of Radha vanquished, thy, warriors, O bull of Bharata's race, fled away in all. [LINKED_TEXT: [16]] [URL: #jxxvD]Karna was killed by Arjuna on day 17th. The battle was not dominated by Karna , it has been removed as an interpolation by BORI CE. He managed to break the string of Gandiva just once and not 11 times. He just overpowered him on 1 Instance. Whereas, Arjuna overpowered Karna most of the time in that battle.[LINKED_TEXT: [17]] [URL: #FvvjG] I have tried to answer your question in the best way I could. My appeal to all those who read the answer is to accept the facts as it is and comment and tell me if I have given wrong information. Please don’t downvote and report to collapse this one. I have consumed 2 hours everyday from last 3–4 days for writing this answer. To answer your question in short, Arjuna was the most powerful warrior except Shri Krishna and Shri Balarama Ji.

The only physical evidence/proof that can neither be placed as fraudulent evidence, nor removed and covereved up is the physical effects of radiation. So there we have the holy grail. Nuclear Physicist Stanton T. Friedman and computer scientist/astronomer Jacques Vallee has collected reports of about 4000 thousand landing marks left on the ground in 90 countries - often with rings, burn marks, sand or stones burned to glass, broken branches, excess radioactive radiation and abnormal vegetation growth or no growth for decades, which is PHYSICAL PROOF as there is no conceivable other way radiation could get there immediately after UFOs were observed.

Explain how people participating in the fraud voluntarily let themselves burn with radiation thereby risking their lives.

Explain how pilots get radiation burns in mid flight when saucers come to close?There are no nuclear powered aircrafts. 5.

[LINKED_TEXT: The Amazing Trajectories of Life-Bearing Meteorites from EarthThe Amazing Trajectories of Life-Bearing Meteorites from Earth The asteroid that killed the dinosaurs must have ejected billions of tons of life-bearing rock into space. Now physicists have calculated what must have happened to it. About 65 million years ago, the Earth was struck by an asteroid some 10 km in diameter with a mass of well over a trillion tons. We now know the immediate impact of this event—megatsunamis, global wildfires ignited by giant clouds of superheated ash, and, of course, the mass extinction of land-based life on Earth. But in recent years, astrobiologists have begun to study a less well known consequence: the ejection of billions of tons of life-bearing rocks and water into space. By some estimates, the impact could have ejected as much mass as the asteroid itself. The question that fascinates them is what happened to all this stuff.

Sign in Today, we get an answer from Tetsuya Hara and buddies at Kyoto Sangyo University in Japan. These guys say a surprisingly large amount of Earth could have ended up not just on the Moon and Mars, as might be expected, but much further afield. In particular, they calculate how much would have ended up in other places that seem compatible for life: the Jovian moon Europa, the Saturnian moon Enceladus, and Earth-like exoplanets orbiting other stars. Their results contain a number of surprises. First, they calculate that almost as much ejecta would have ended up on Europa as on the Moon: around 10^8 individual Earth rocks in some scenarios. That’s because the huge gravitational field around Jupiter acts as a sink for rocks, which then get swept up by the Jovian moons as they orbit. But perhaps most surprising is the amount that makes its way across interstellar space. Last year, we looked at calculations suggesting that more Earth ejecta must end up in interstellar space than all the other planets combined . Hara and co go further and estimate how much ought to have made its way to Gliese 581, a red dwarf some 20 light years from here that is thought to have a super-Earth orbiting at the edge of the habitable zone. They say about a thousand Earth-rocks from this event would have made the trip, taking about a million years to reach their destination. Of course, nobody knows if microbes can survive that kind of journey or even the shorter trips to Europa and Enceladus. But Hara and buddies say that if microbes can survive that kind of journey, they ought to flourish on a super-Earth in the habitable zone. That raises another interesting question: how quickly could life-bearing ejecta from Earth (or anywhere else) seed the entire galaxy? Hara and co calculate that it would take some 10^12 years for ejecta to spread through a volume of space the size of the Milky Way. But since our galaxy is only 10^10 years old, a singlhttps://www.technologyreview.com/2012/04/11/186806/the-amazing-trajectories-of-life-bearing-meteorites-from-earth/amp/] [URL: https://www.technologyreview.com/2012/04/11/186806/the-amazing-trajectories-of-life-bearing-meteorites-from-earth/amp/]All the bases of DNA and RNA have been found in meteorites - The discovery adds to evidence that suggests life’s precursors came from space: [LINKED_TEXT: All of the bases in DNA and RNA have now been found in meteoritesScientists have detected adenine and guanine in meteorites for decades and seen hints of uracil.

UAP speeds as high as mach 55 or 67.900km/h was meassured in 1954. Top speed measured to date is 30,4km/second or 110.000km/h with instant acceleration and decelleration. Another was 80.000ft to 50ft in 0,79 second. Confirmed by Pentagon. Physicist Kevin Knuth has calculated the G forces to be minimum 5000! The Tic Tac mysteriously knew the secret CAP point and waited there for pilot Fravor to catch up. It flew 100km in 3 seconds It also jammed his radar. The fact they don't TRY to shoot them down, pretty much proves they know it's not Russian or Chinese. Would the Airforce order its pilots not to shoot on Russian or Chinese drones blatantly violating controled airspace and endangering pilots? Pilots say they see them every day and training exersizes with top secret crafts are not every day (in broad daylight visible to sailors and shipping), so not the Navy's. Why would the navy search for the USOs with subs if they are ours? With all the might of Nimitz why not down one as proof and get revenge on China or who ever by copying their tech - haha??? End of mystery and the Smithsonian would be happy to have a one exhibited in the airplane sections next to the Wright Brothers plane. Imagine the ticket sales. BUT BUT - the very minimum of 15-20 pilots in both Russia and the US, that tried to shoot the m down in the 40–50s died, so also for that reason not ours. Some researchers lke Richard Dolan think the number above was in hundreds and the family members of the lost pilots was lied to. Now I need a genius to tell me what alternative explanations are left. The only one stupid me can find is ALIENS. And that's why they DON'T TRY to shoot them down. Pentagon insider Luis Elizondo is considering to violate his non disclosure security oath if the government keep hiding the truth. What else than aliens would cause such a statement??? The longest name for aliens seen to date. Aliens disclosed by no other than the former Director of CIA. Who else would need 53 words to spell ALIENS? Print an 8x10, frame it on the wall, have a good laugh 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 and THINK. The questions are often more important than the answers. Other 27 reasons most UFOs/saucers are not our stuff or tech: They are preoccupied with our nuclear installations of all kinds. The French scientific Geipan study established a clear correlation between the two. Why would weather balloons care about nukes? They shot down a dummy nuclear warhead in space while moving 8000 m/h at Vandenburg AFB 1964. And a helicopter in Italy. What hubcab or dustbin lid can do that? Some drop plasma like and other substances. Why would our tech do this? Light so strong it blinds people and animals. Why would our tech do this? They leave radiation behind on landing sites and 300 Americans got radiation burns and other bodily injuries. Why would our tech do this? They rotate in wierd manners, which would made our pilots dizzy - if manned. Why would our tech do this? They often move at an angle. Why would our tech do this? They zig zag for no apparent reason. Why would our tech do this? They often anticipate the fighter pilots next move. How can swamp gas do that? They often devide up in 3 and later become 1 again. Why and how would our tech be able to do this? The go fast UAP filmed with flir infrared camera was colder than the ocean below (minus 65 F). Do we have ANY fast moving thing that cold? They often respond to our signaling with flashlight or hand waving. Why would our military do this? At close proximity they often if not mostly interfere with and make temporarily dysfunctional our electronics. How would our tech do this? They have been reported to take controle of pilots aircraft. How can Venus do that? They can apparently prevent the pilot from shooting at them. How can Mike Wests seagulls do that! They show up in remote and militarily irrelevant locations worldwide. Why would our expensive tech do this? Some can shapes shift and change colours. Why would our tech do this? They show up near the space station. Why and how would our tech do this? They allegedly abduct people. Why would our military do this? They occationally brake branches on trees when landing. How can halucinations do this? They interfered with and deactivated or started countdown of your nuclear ICBM missiles in both USA and the Sovjet Union at least a dozen times - remotely. Why and how would our tech do this? They have killed up to hundreds of pilots in the 40s and 50s in USA and the Sovjet Union in self defense when shot at. Why would our tech shoot at our own tech? They can be as small as a tennis ball. How could our tech this small fly in WW2 - as the Foo fighters? They can be as big as miles long according to best estimates by pilots and others. Do you honestly think this is hours? IF ours why dont we see this souvereign tech used in wars or for civilian purposes? We now se the real and poor suffistication of the Russian war tech. Do you honestly think it's the Russians? Why would we make saucers that perform equally well in space, atmosphere and sub oceanic with hundreds of knots? Alain Julliet, the former head of the French Spy agency DGSE, has said UAPs are not from any country on Earth and that some have been detected going from 0 to 10,000 kph in one second, that they have been detected going faster than the speed of sound underwater, and much more. Do YOU believe we can make saucers or uboats going faster than the sound under water??? If you can't come up with reasonable explanations to these total 40 points and questions, then it's alien tech where ever it comes from. THINK.

As technology continues to shape consumer behavior, the potential for generating revenue through affiliate marketing has grown exponentially. This article explores the secrets to harnessing this powerful strategy and provides a comprehensive guide on how to make money through affiliate marketing. Understanding Affiliate Marketing Affiliate marketing is a performance-based marketing model where individuals (affiliates) promote products or services of other companies through unique affiliate links. When a customer makes a purchase through these links, the affiliate earns a commission. It's a win-win arrangement, as affiliates earn money without having to handle product development or customer service, while businesses enjoy increased exposure and sales. Choosing the Right Niche Selecting the right niche is the cornerstone of a successful affiliate marketing journey. A niche is a specific segment of a broader market, focusing on a particular topic or product category. Research various niches to find one that aligns with your interests, expertise, and audience's needs. Passion and knowledge in your chosen niche will help you craft authentic and valuable content, fostering stronger connections with your audience. Building a Trustworthy Platform A solid foundation is essential for long-term success in affiliate marketing. Whether it's a blog, website, or social media presence, your platform should reflect professionalism, credibility, and authenticity. Focus on providing high-quality content that addresses your audience's pain points and offers valuable insights. Gaining your audience's trust is crucial for converting potential customers into paying clients. Establishing an Engaged Audience A thriving audience is the lifeblood of any affiliate marketer. Engage with your audience through various channels, including social media, email newsletters, and webinars. Encourage feedback, respond to queries, and build a community around your niche. The more engaged your audience, the higher the likelihood of conversions, which leads to increased affiliate earnings. Selecting the Right Affiliate Programs Not all affiliate programs are created equal, and choosing the right ones is vital. Research various affiliate programs in your niche and assess their commission structures, product offerings, and track record of payment reliability. Look for programs that offer competitive commissions and provide resources to support affiliates in their marketing efforts. Strategic Content Creation Content is the backbone of affiliate marketing. Create valuable, informative, and engaging content that resonates with your audience. Utilize a mix of formats, such as written articles, videos, infographics, and product reviews. Your content should aim to educate and inspire, subtly incorporating affiliate links where relevant. Avoid being overly promotional, as authenticity is key to building trust with your audience. Harnessing the Power of SEO Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a critical aspect of driving organic traffic to your affiliate marketing platform. Conduct keyword research to understand what your target audience is searching for, and optimize your content accordingly. Well-optimized content can lead to higher search engine rankings, resulting in increased visibility and more affiliate conversions. Monitoring and Analyzing Performance Regularly monitor and analyze the performance of your affiliate marketing efforts. Utilize tracking tools and metrics to understand which strategies yield the best results. Identify what works and what doesn't, and adapt your approach accordingly. Continuously learning from your data will help you refine your tactics and boost your earnings over time. Conclusion Affiliate marketing offers a remarkable opportunity to earn money while sharing your passion with the world. By selecting the right niche, building a trustworthy platform, engaging with your audience, choosing the right affiliate programs, creating strategic content, optimizing for SEO, and analyzing performance, you can unlock the full potential of affiliate marketing and embark on a path to prosperity. Remember, success in affiliate marketing requires dedication, persistence, and a genuine commitment to adding value to the lives of your audience. So, take the leap, and let the journey to financial freedom and success begin! NOTE. To achieve fast and effective results in affiliate marketing, consider leveraging AI-powered tools to streamline your workflow. These advanced systems can significantly enhance productivity, optimize content creation, and boost your overall success. Keep in mind that while these tools can be valuable assets, success ultimately depends on your dedication, strategy, and commitment to delivering value to your audience.

Your registrar must finalize the transfer process, and typically, that should take no longer than 5-7 business days. How much does it cost to transfer a domain name? ICANN, the organization that oversees domains, requires that a one-year extension be added to domains when they're transferred to a new registrar. Some registrars charge an additional fee on top of the standard one-year extension (renewal) fee. However, some registrars don’t. At Domain.com, domain transfers are free. That means no fees in addition to the required 1-year renewal charge. What do I need to transfer my domain name?

The purpose of blogging can vary from personal to professional; some people blog as a way to document their daily lives, while others use it as a platform to share their opinions on current affairs or to promote their businesses. In most cases, bloggers write informally in order to engage with their audience – although there are exceptions, such as when businesses use blogs as a way to communicate more formal messages to their customers.

There are many reasons to start a blog, but one of the most common is to make money. While it is possible to earn money with a blog, it takes time, effort, and dedication to build up enough of an audience to make a significant income. If you're looking to make money with a blog, here are a few things to keep in mind: 1. It takes time to build up an audience. If you're just starting out, don't expect to make hundreds of dollars overnight. It takes time to attract readers and grow your following. 2. You need quality content. In order for people to keep coming back to your site, you need to offer them something valuable - informative articles, helpful tips, interesting stories, etc. 3. You need traffic. Even if you have great content, if no one is reading it then you won't make any money.

In any case, the solution to this question is mind-boggling and multi-layered, as power and impact are circulated across different areas and levels. No single substance or gathering completely controls the world. All things considered, power is disseminated among state-run administrations, worldwide enterprises, global associations, monetary establishments, and compelling people, and that's only the tip of the iceberg. Here are a few vital participants and elements that contribute to molding the world: Legislatures: Country states hold huge power in forming worldwide governmental issues and arrangements. [LINKED_TEXT: Superpowers like the US, China, Russia, and the European Union have impressive effects on global relations.] [URL: https://www.tetsybooks.com/?ref=abdulrahman] Worldwide Partnerships: Enormous companies in areas like innovation, money, energy, and drugs employ significant monetary impact.

NGO’s: Associations devoted to basic liberties, ecological issues, wellbeing, and more can impact legislatures and promote change. Scholastic and Exploration Organizations: Colleges and research focuses add to information, development, and strategy proposals that shape worldwide patterns. It's critical to take note that power elements are continually developing, and the scene of worldwide impact is liable to change because of movements in international affairs, financial matters, innovation, and cultural qualities. The idea of who \\"runs\\" the world is certainly not a basic one and can change contingent upon the specific circumstances and point of view."},{"instruction":"What are some tips for writing your PhD thesis?","output":"After years of arduous effort, writing up a PhD can frequently occur in a frenzy of activity in the final few months of your degree study. However, there are several measures you can take to enhance your chances of succeeding. 1. Together with your advisor, carefully plan the thesis's structure. As you proceed, compose rough versions that you may then edit as your attention sharpens on the article. 2. Academic writing need not be dull. Your work should have some flair. Consult written advice. 3. Do not list them in the order in which they occurred. Work on each chapter as it comes to you or as it relates to what you are doing right then, but come back to it all later and work it up into a consistent, logical piece, reorganising sections as required. 4. Take some time to consider your writing. Write your first draught, put it aside, and then go over it critically afterwards. Examine the text carefully to check for sense and style. You can also opt for [LINKED_TEXT: thesis editing services] [URL: https://www.editage.com/services/other/thesis-editing] to avoid typical mistakes including inconsistent language, dangling modifiers, and subject-verb disagreement. 5. The majority of universities follow a standard referencing format. Make sure you understand this and adhere to it. Citing sources in the text but not including them in the bibliography is one of the most typical mistakes made in academic writing. Prior to submission, all citations in your thesis must be double-checked against the bibliography. 6. Consider plagiarism. When quoting from other works, be sure to do it accurately and paraphrase when it helps your case. 7. Keep in mind that your thesis is an opportunity for you to showcase your work in the best possible way. Think carefully about your introductory sentences, draw the reader in with your writing, and, most importantly, be specific with your hypothesis and conclusion."},{"instruction":"w can I get a call history of any number?","output":"The ability to find the call history of a mobile phone number depends on several factors, such as the country and the mobile network operator.

Today, let's demystify these terms and uncover the key differences between them, helping you make informed choices when selecting your next signature scent. 1. Perfume: Perfume, also known as \\"parfum\\" or \\"extrait de parfum,\\" is the most concentrated form of fragrance. It typically contains the highest percentage of aromatic oils, around 20-30%. Due to its strong concentration, perfume offers the most long-lasting and intense scent experience. It is perfect for special occasions or when you desire a luxurious and captivating aroma that lingers throughout the day. 2. Eau de Toilette (EDT): Eau de Toilette is a lighter version of a fragrance, containing around 5-15% aromatic oils. As a result, EDT provides a more subtle and refreshing scent compared to perfume. It is well-suited for everyday wear, especially during warmer months or casual settings, where you want a fragrance that is not too overpowering but still leaves a pleasant impression. 3. Cologne: The term \\"cologne\\" is often used to describe a fragrance for men, but it refers to any unisex fragrance with a lower concentration of aromatic oils, typically between 2-5%. Historically, cologne originated in the German city of Cologne, where it was used as a refreshing citrus-based fragrance. Today, colognes come in various scent profiles and are great for a quick pick-me-up or as a revitalizing option during the summer. 4. Finding Your Perfect Scent: Choosing between perfume, eau de toilette, and cologne depends on your personal preferences and the occasion. If you enjoy a long-lasting and intense fragrance, opt for perfume. For a lighter and more casual scent, go for eau de toilette or cologne. Many fragrance enthusiasts love to have a diverse collection to match different moods and settings. 5.

There are a few potential risks associated with microwaving food, but overall, it is considered a safe and effective way to cook. Microwaves emit energy waves that penetrate food, causing the molecules to vibrate and create heat. This is how microwaving cooks food. Some people are concerned that this cooking method can cause the food to become “radioactive” or “toxic”. However, this is not the case. The radiation produced by microwaves is not strong enough to cause any significant damage to the molecules in food, and the only danger is from potential overheating or fire. Some research has suggested that microwaving can cause nutritional losses in food.

Here are the main differences between granite and marble: Composition: Granite: Granite is an igneous rock composed mainly of quartz, feldspar, and mica. It forms from the slow crystallization of magma beneath the Earth's surface. The interlocking mineral crystals give granite its characteristic speckled appearance.Marble: [LINKED_TEXT: Marble] [URL: https://www.rajasthan-stone-exporter.com/marble-exporter.php], on the other hand, is a metamorphic rock primarily composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals, usually calcite or dolomite. It forms from the metamorphism of limestone, a sedimentary rock, under high heat and pressure. Appearance: Granite: Granite has a distinctive granular texture with visible mineral grains, giving it a speckled or \\"salt-and-pepper\\" appearance. It comes in a wide range of colors, including various shades of white, gray, black, pink, and brown.Marble: Marble often features a smooth and elegant appearance with characteristic veining patterns. It comes in various colors, including white, gray, green, pink, and even rare hues like blue. Marble's veining adds to its visual appeal and uniqueness. Hardness: Granite: Granite is a very hard and durable stone, ranking around 6 to 7 on the Mohs scale of hardness. It is highly resistant to scratching and suitable for high-traffic areas.Marble: Marble is softer compared to granite, with a Mohs hardness of around 3 to 5. It is more susceptible to scratching and etching from acidic substances. Use and Applications: Granite: Due to its hardness and durability, granite is commonly used for countertops, flooring, and outdoor applications such as cladding, paving, and monuments.Marble: Marble's elegant appearance makes it popular for use in sculptures, decorative accents, and interior applications such as flooring, wall cladding, and countertops in low-traffic areas. Porosity: Granite: Granite is relatively less porous than marble, which means it is more resistant to liquid absorption and staining.Marble: Marble is more porous, making it susceptible to water absorption and staining, especially if not properly sealed and maintained. Maintenance: Granite: Granite requires minimal maintenance, typically needing only regular cleaning and occasional sealing to protect the surface.Marble: Marble requires more care and attention to maintain its appearance. It needs periodic sealing to protect against staining and etching from acidic substances. In summary, granite is a durable and versatile stone commonly used for functional purposes like countertops and outdoor applications, while marble is prized for its elegant appearance and is often used for decorative elements and interior applications. The choice between granite and marble depends on the specific requirements of the project, considering factors such as aesthetics, durability, and maintenance needs."},{"instruction":"When the Apollo 11 lunar module was attempting to land, Commander Neil Armstrong had to take control of the ship manually to land it safely because of an unsafe landing area.

For this trading session, you just need to understand the market structure and the upcoming pumps. Basically, one of us can’t make money just by doing trading individually, hence people use to join telegram channels, WhatsApp groups. They collectively invest in an currency/stock and due to this collectiveness, the price of that particular thing goes up, nearly upto 3100% (maximum seen by me). There are several groups and channels which use to do this kind of activities. No one of them will face loss. Ex. - I the current price of a particular stock is 5₹. They all collectively place their order at the same time. And the price start moving upwards. These kind of activities attract people out of the groups, and they also invest their money in it. This all makes the market to pump much more higher. And the amount of that particular stock may reach 40₹. All the group members collectively square-off their positions. Hence, the overall profit is 8 times the invested amount. Far better than jobs and FDs. And all these make people rich even without doing job from 9 - 5. Hope you understand this. If so, then just share this with everyone. Ping me for the exact telegram channels and groups.

While some people believe that microwaving food is dangerous and can cause health problems, others believe that microwaves are a safe and convenient way to quickly prepare meals. While both sides can agree that microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, there is no scientific evidence that food prepared in a microwave oven is bad for your health. To understand the potential health risks associated with microwaving food, it is important to understand how microwaves work. Microwave ovens use high frequency radio waves to heat food. These waves penetrate food and cause the water molecules in it to vibrate, generating heat and cooking the food. Microwave ovens are designed to contain these waves, and the radiation emitted from them is non-ionizing, meaning it does not have enough energy to cause chemical changes in the food or the environment. One of the most common concerns about microwaving food is that it may cause the food to become toxic. However, there is no evidence that microwaving food causes it to become toxic. In fact, research has shown that microwaving can actually help to preserve the nutrients in food. For example, a study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health found that microwaving broccoli preserved 97 percent of its vitamin C content. Another concern is that microwaving food can cause the release of harmful substances, such as BPA, phthalates, and dioxins. However, these are not released from microwaving food. In fact, research has shown that the levels of these substances are much lower in microwaved food than in food cooked using traditional methods. There is also a concern that microwaving food can cause it to become “radioactive”. However, this is not the case. While microwaving can cause the food to become slightly radioactive, the levels are so low that they pose no health risks. Finally, some people believe that microwaves can cause cancer, but this is also not the case. While there is some evidence that exposure to high levels of non-ionizing radiation can increase the risk of cancer, the levels of radiation emitted from microwave ovens are too low to cause any harm. Overall, there is no evidence that food cooked in a microwave oven is bad for your health. While microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, it is safe and can help to preserve the nutrients in food. Therefore, microwaving food can be a convenient and efficient way to quickly prepare meals. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

They supported several pillars necessary for the Renaissance to occur: banking, art, and architecture. At the time."},{"instruction":"Are there any disadvantages in using robots?","output":"Sure…but it’s complicated. Let’s imagine that someone invents a robot that can replace humans in a fast-food restaurant…and I’m going to pick one of the most well-known robot - Boston Dynamics’ “Spot”… This little robot is about the size of a large dog - and costs 75,000 - I suspect that’s WITHOUT the robot arm on the top - which is an optional extra. You’ll also need to program it to do the actual job. So I’m going to say that MAYBE 100,000 would suffice…certainly it’s not going to be much cheaper than that. According to Zippia - a human fast food worker gets paid an average of 11 per hour. i’m going to round that down to 10 to keep the math simple. So you could employ a human for 10,000 hours for the price of our robotic worker. An average worker does about 2,000 hours work per year - so the robot will pay for itself in 5 years…assuming it doesn’t need too much maintenance and doesn’t wear out in that time. For a large fast-food company - that might not be a terrible deal. You need thousands of these robots - so you can afford to invest a lot of money in customizing the software - you can design new equipment specially for the robot to use, etc, etc. But for a “Mom & Pop” diner - this is impossible. Investing 100,000 in ANYTHING is incredibly difficult - and a pay-back time of 5 years until it starts being cheaper than hiring a person is way too long. But worse still - the robot has to somehow be taught every subtle nuance of the job. If the customer says “Hold the lettuce” - then maybe the bot can cope with that. But “Can I have hot-sauce instead of mayo on the chicken and no pickles on the burger?”…that’s going to be tough for the robot to deal with. At Tesla’s investor day recently - it was estimated that Tesla’s new humanoid robot could cost 20,000 - and that’s getting down into the realms of the possible. With a payback time of just ONE year - it starts to look more feasible. If enough small fast food places would see that as attractive - then maybe a larger company will design software for that specific market and amortize the cost over MANY small businesses. So the key here is the cost of these devices - if someone could make a robot that could do the job for 10,000 then a six month payback time would be compelling to nearly every restaurant. No doubt robots lack the flexibility of humans - if a customer spills an entire cup of soda onto the floor - a human can grab a mop and bucket and without any training - deal with it. Adding that sophistication to a robot would be VERY tough. However, with that human flexibility comes fallibility. Humans get sick and don’t turn up for work. If that’s the guy with the keys to the restaurant - then your business doesn’t open on time. If someone quits mid-shift then chaos ensues and lots of customers get pissed at you. Robots are reliable…they have limited skills - but they perform them well every time. CONCLUSION: Sure - there are situations where robots are an incredibly valuable thing for a business - but mostly in LARGE businesses. For small operations, one or two human employees are zero investment - and can ensure much better reliability."},{"instruction":"What are your silly little parenting tricks that you're so glad you discovered?","output":"When bed time came for my boys I devised a game for when they didn't want to go to sleep which they agreed to.

Their first breakout hit after changing the band to Bill Haley and his Comets was Crazy, Man, Crazy (1953) the first (white) Rock and Roll song on the Pop charts.

A number of the people present are there to have their professional lives massively improved by a moment of concentrated approval and applause, and leading up to that moment, during the time when so many people there are in the running for that big positive kick from the Academy, the Academy toys with them a bit by hiring a comedian to make fun of as many of them as he (have there been any women?) possibly can in the time he has. Every single person there knows that if they’re famous to the public they’re subject to being roasted, that is, sarcastically made fun of, and Jada Pinkett and Will certainly fit in that category, and had every reason to expect to be made fun of. Whether people enjoy it or not, one has to consider that it is an honor, because little known people aren’t teased, only very famous ones. Jada doesn’t have some medical condition, unless you consider ever person in the country who has thinning or thin hair to be sick, which would make every man with male pattern baldness and every woman with hair loss during menopause, which is most, to be sick. Jada has been putting intense pressure on her hair for hears, if you look at her hairstyles, they are a high-tension war between competing rows of hair; that’s why she had previous described herself as suffering from traction alopecia, something that is self-induced. And the word “alopecia”, which the media suddenly decided to describe as a “medical condition”? It simply means thinning hair, which occurs for most Americans by her age. Jada, who isn’t known for anything other than harassing and tormenting her poor cuckold husband in his home and by having sex with his children’s friends and making sure everyone knows it who possibly could, has decided that her celebrity cause is her own hair. So she shaved her head, something she doesn’t have to do, and the only obvious bit of hair loss is a very thin line that looks like she had a procedure of some kind, like scalp reduction, but other than that, she has lots of healthy hair follicles all over her head, as visible as will’s shame each time he’s made one of his insincere apologies one of his “people” have insisted that he further embarrass himself with. There was absolutely nothing for Will to react to or respond to. All he did was destroy his career for good. Would I have done the same thing to Chris Rock? You mean would I have taken over the entire Oscars ceremony on live national TV, committed a criminal act of violence, and then pimp-walked off with confidence and pride before returning to my seat so I could yell more pimp-culture nonsense at a man doing his job by comparing my wife, a woman who made a big announcement just before the Oscars that she didn’t care what anyone said about her hair—an invitation if ever there was one to freely make comments about her celebrity cause she can’t stop talking about? No. And if I were there and that a-hole still got his award, I wouldn’t have stood up and clapped for him either. I would have stayed in my seat and waved my first finger back and forth in disapproval and hoped I ended up being shown on the broadcast as the only person in the room with any character or courage, but there were no such people there that night. Will Smith is finished, for good, and Jada is hated as well. So,did he help matters with his assault and yelling?"},{"instruction":"NFL continues to drop in Nielsen ratings for playoffs 2023, down 9.46% almost double digits. Why are people not watching NFL?

The brother spent two years in jail. How did he live for 2 whole years with the stain of raping his own sister? God! Three things hurt me: Indian legal system, which kept him in prison for two years.Indian laws, which can be misused by women.Indian men, who are far from getting benifit of doubt not only in court but also in society.

Aloe vera has many benefits for the skin, including moisturizing, soothing, and reducing inflammation. However, it's important to keep in mind that everyone's skin is different, and some people may be more sensitive to aloe vera than others. It's always a good idea to do a patch test on a small area of skin first to make sure you don't have an allergic reaction or sensitivity to the gel. Additionally, it's important to use pure aloe vera gel and avoid any products that contain alcohol or other harsh chemicals, which can irritate the skin and cause dryness or redness. Overall, applying aloe vera gel on the face overnight can be a safe and effective way to improve the health and appearance of the skin. However, it's always best to consult with a dermatologist or healthcare provider if you have any concerns about your skin or the use of aloe vera."},{"instruction":"Why do some gun control opponents feel that the second amendment guarantees the right to own any type of gun whatsoever?","output":"The Second Amendment says arms which covers all firearms plus some other things.

Here are the steps to follow for recommended vinyl plank installation. Get your work area ready with appropriate tools. Tape Measure, Utility Knife, Jigsaw, Tapping Block or Rubber Mallet, Pull Bar, ¼\\" Spacers, T-Square, Safety Glasses, Broom or Vacuum and, if necessary, tools for subfloor repair. Prepare the subfloor and / or take up any existing flooring, swept clean the subfloor, skim coat with ardex feather finish any low spots. All subfloors must be clean, flat, dry, and structurally sound. The correct preparation of the subfloor is a major part of a successful installation. When laying the floor, you should start laying the planks along the length of the longest wall of your room. Take the position of your windows and the direction of the light into account, too. Ideally, the light will fall along the long length of the boards. Also, take a look at the direction of any other flooring adjoining the room. Ideally, you’ll want the boards to run in the same direction. Layout Step 1: Begin installation working from left to right. Insert spacers at ends and edges where flooring meet wall. Step 2: Lock short end of flooring by inserting tongue into groove at an angle and drop in place. At end of the row, measure and cut the flooring to complete the row. Install the cut edge closest to the wall. Step 3: Use leftover flooring from first row as starter for second row. There must be at least 20cm between flooring end joints on adjacent rows. FOR TILE INSTALLATIONS: The distance between end joints should be equal to 30cm for proper appearance. Step 4: Lock long edge of flooring by inserting tongue into groove at an angle and drop in place. Slide flooring toward end of previously installed flooring until the tongue just touches the groove. Step 5: IMPORTANT! Use hammer and tapping block to tap long edge of plank to ensure a tight fit. ANY GAPPING CAN COMPROMISE THE LOCKING SYSTEM! Step 6: Attach a scrap piece of floor to bridge the gap between ends of planks. Step 7: Tap end of flooring with hammer and tapping block to lock ends of flooring together. Remove bridge and continue towards wall until installing the final flooring in the row. BE SURE TO TAP ON EDGE OF VINYL SO AS NOT TO DAMAGE LOCKING PROFILE. Step 8: Use hammer and pull bar to lock final piece in row. Insert spacer at end of row. Continue installation to final row. Step 9: Use hammer and pull bar to lock long edges of flooring on final row. INSTALLING UNDERNEATH DOOR JAMBS: Step 1: Undercut space under door jamb to allow flooring to slide freely. Tap long edge with hammer and tapping block to lock long edge. Step 2: Use hammer and pull bar to lock this piece of flooring. COMPLETION Protect all exposed edges of the flooring by installing wall molding and/or transition strips. Make sure that no plank will be secured in any way to the subfloor.For wet areas such as bathrooms caulk the perimeter of the floor with a flexible silicone caulk.Protect the finished flooring from exposure to direct sunlight to reduce fading and thermal expansion.Cutting resilient product into a fine point may lead to delamination. Use an ethyl cyanoacrylate based glue to help fuse the resilient point together. Be sure to clean all glue from the top surface immediately. Alcohol based glues may cause resilient products to swell.Adhering tape to the surface of your resilient flooring could damage the surface. Do not use tape to secure floor protection directly to the floor during construction or renovation. Instead, adhere tape to the material used to protect the floor and secure it to the base molding along the wall. A material such as ram board can also be used to protect your flooring."},{"instruction":"recently lost my younger brother to a car accident. What is the most exhaustive list of steps you can suggest for people to avoid car accidents?","output":"I am sorry for your loss. I don't know what to say. I would try to give my best possible answer. *First, when you buy a vehicle, Focus more on safety list-Airbags,ABS, Stability control, traction control,whichever is available in your budget and type of vehicle. *Also, check the crash rating of the vehicle,if available.
