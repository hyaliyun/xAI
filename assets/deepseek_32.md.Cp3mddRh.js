Jurnaliştii argumentează că presa ar fi putut fi reglementată prin legile existente şi că cei care au elaborat noua lege nu s-au consultat cu ei. Translate to English English:","output":"Journalists argue that the press could have been regulated through existing laws and that those who drafted the new law did not consult with them. A deeper insight into this viewpoint is that many journalists believe that the new law that has been implemented is unnecessary and restrictive towards their profession. Instead, they suggest that pre-existing legislation could have been used, modified, or reinforced to regulate the press effectively without imposing new restrictions or guidelines. Past evidence demonstrates that a large number of professionals in the journalism field feel disenfranchised or overlooked when governmental or regulatory entities enact changes to laws that oversee their work, in particular, without involving them in the legislative process. This is particularly true when the new laws partially or entirely transform the landscape of their work environment and the core aspects of their profession. If we go further into the argument that the existing laws could have regulated the press, it might imply that the journalists observe the new regulations as an extreme measure when the solution could have been found within the already established legal system. Journalists could feel that their knowledge and understanding of the intricacies of their work and its interaction with the law could have been helpful in creating a comprehensive and effective law. It's not uncommon for those in the field to feel that they are best positioned to provide input on laws that will directly affect their work as they have first-hand experience with the practicalities involved. The press plays a tremendous role in society, disseminating information, keeping the public informed on crucial issues and events, and serving as a watchdog over government and other powerful entities. Therefore, they form a delicate balance with the law, which seeks to regulate the press for fairness, ethics, and national security reasons. In an ideal world, this balance would be achieved through collaborative conversations between lawmakers, regulatory bodies, and journalists. Thus, the lament about the lack of consultation resonates deeply as journalists feel sidelined in decisions that directly impact their work and, to a larger extent, democracy. In conclusion, the statement implies a feeling of being overlooked or undervalued amongst journalists. It illustrates their belief in the capabilities of existing laws to regulate the press effectively and a sense of frustration and concern due to a perceived lack of consultation during the new law drafting process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Washington Post's Jason Rezaian sentenced in Iran The verdict and the sentence are not yet known. Rezaian's family said the lack of information \\"follows an unconscionable pattern by Iranian authorities of silence, obfuscation, delay and a total lack of adherence to international law, as well as Iranian law.\\" ISNA quoted the judiciary spokesman, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni Ejei, as saying that \\"this person has been sentenced, but I don't know the details of the verdict.\\" Mohseni Ejei said the ruling may be appealed by Rezaian or his lawyer in the next 20 days. Rezaian, The Washington Post's bureau chief in Tehran, was detained in Iran in July 2014 and has languished in jail for over a year despite an international outcry. Uncertainty continued to reign on Sunday. The statement from his family called it \\"another sad chapter in his 14-month illegal imprisonment and opaque trial process.\\" And Doug Jehl, the foreign editor of the Post, said on CNN's \\"Reliable Sources\\" that the mysterious announcement shows that \\"what we're seeing unfolding here is sham.\\" \\"For Iran to say that there's been a verdict but it's not final simply suggests, again, that this is not a matter for the courts, it's a matter that's being decided in the political spheres in Iran,\\" he said. John Kirby, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department, said the U.S. government has no firm information on the apparent ruling. \\"We're monitoring the situation closely, and we continue to call for all charges against Jason to be dropped and for him to be immediately released,\\" Kirby said. Timeline: Jason Rezaian in Iranian prison Rezaian's case has become a symbol of the increased dangers faced by journalists around the world. Rezaian, who has dual Iranian and American citizenship, has been detained in Iran longer than any American journalist in the past. Marty Baron, the paper's top editor, said it is unclear whether the apparent sentence has even been shared with Rezaian or his lawyer. \\"This vague and puzzling statement by the government of Iran only adds to the injustice that has surrounded Jason's case since his arrest 15 months ago,\\" Baron said in a statement. Rezaian's ordeal began last July when he and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, were taken into custody. She was later released. For months Rezaian was not told of the charges against him. Prosecutors eventually accused him of espionage and other offenses, including \\"collaborating with a hostile government\\" and \\"propaganda against the establishment,\\" according to the Post. The newspaper steadfastly denied the allegations, calling them \\"the product of fertile and twisted imaginations.\\" And the State Department called the charges \\"absurd.\\" Rezaian's trial began in May under a cloak of secrecy. Baron has called it a \\"sham\\" and the treatment of Rezaian a \\"travesty.\\" The trial reportedly concluded back in August with no announcement of a ruling. At times Rezaian has seemed like a pawn in a geopolitical faceoff. U.S. President Barack Obama faced criticism from some for concluding a deal between major world powers and Iran over Iran's nuclear program without any pledge from Iran that it would release Rezaian and other Americans held in Iran. In a speech this summer, Obama mentioned Rezaian and other Americans \\"who are unjustly detained in Iran.\\" \\"Journalist Jason Rezaian should be released,\\" the President said. Who are the Americans detained in Iran? Boxing great Muhammad Ali, an American Muslim, also urged Tehran to free Rezaian on bail. \\"To my knowledge, Jason is a man of peace and great faith, a man whose dedication and respect for the Iranian people is evident in his work,\\" Ali said in a religiously worded statement issued in March. Iran's human rights chief, Mohammad Javad Larijani, told news outlet France 24 last year that he hoped Rezaian's case would come to a positive conclusion. \\"Let us hope that this fiasco will end on good terms,\\" he said. The Post has sought to keep world attention focused on the case. On Friday, it noted that Rezaian had been detained for 444 days -- \\"the same amount of time as U.S. government employees during the Iran hostage crisis of 1979-1981.\\" The Post called this \\"a milestone significant in its injustice.\\" Jehl said on Sunday that the lack of a publicized ruling \\"suggests once again that Jason is not really a prisoner, he's a bargaining chip being used by the Iranian government to extract some concessions from the U.S.\\" Summary:","output":"Iranian authorities claim to have sentenced imprisoned Washington Post journalist, Jason Rezaian, however, the precise details of the verdict remain unknown, leading Rezaian’s family to declare that this illustrates the \\"unconscionable pattern by Iranian authorities of silence, obfuscation, delay and a total lack of adherence to international law, as well as Iranian law.\\" Rezaian, The Washington Post's Tehran bureau chief, was arrested in July 2014 and has since been held in jail, despite an international outcry.

He has received a manuscript of a play called Deathtrap written by one of his students, Clifford Anderson, that he considers near perfection.

He invites Clifford to their secluded home, decorated with weapons from Sidney's plays, to discuss it. Clifford (Reeve) arrives by train. Myra tries desperately over the course of an evening to convince Sidney to work with Clifford as equal partners, but to no avail; Sidney attacks Clifford, strangling him with a chain. Sidney removes the body but still has to convince Myra to conspire with him. She reveals nothing when they receive an unexpected visit from the psychic Helga Ten Dorp (Irene Worth), a minor celebrity who is staying with the Bruhls' neighbors.

Write a summary based on this article: Advertisement Continue reading the main story      WASHINGTON — Russia has sent advanced antiship cruise missiles to Syria, a move that illustrates the depth of its support for the Syrian government led by President Bashar al-Assad, American officials said Thursday.                              Russia has previously provided a version of the missiles, called Yakhonts, to Syria. But those delivered recently are outfitted with an advanced radar that makes them more effective, according to American officials who are familiar with classified intelligence reports and would only discuss the shipment on the basis of anonymity.      Unlike Scud and other longer-range surface-to-surface missiles that the Assad government has used against opposition forces, the Yakhont antiship missile system provides the Syrian military a formidable weapon to counter any effort by international forces to reinforce Syrian opposition fighters by imposing a naval embargo, establishing a no-fly zone or carrying out limited airstrikes.      “It enables the regime to deter foreign forces looking to supply the opposition from the sea, or from undertaking a more active role if a no-fly zone or shipping embargo were to be declared at some point,” said Nick Brown, editor in chief of IHS Jane’s International Defense Review. “It’s a real ship killer.”      Jeffrey White, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a former senior American intelligence official, said Syria’s strengthened arsenal would “tend to push Western or allied naval activity further off the coast” and was also “a signal of the Russian commitment to the Syrian government.”      The disclosure of the delivery comes as Russia and the United States are planning to convene an international conference that is aimed at ending the brutal conflict in Syria, which has killed more than 70,000. That conference is expected to be held in early June and to include representatives of the Assad government and the Syrian opposition.      Secretary of State John Kerry has repeatedly said that it is the United States’ hope to change Mr. Assad’s “calculations” about his ability to hold on to power so that he will allow negotiations for a political solution to the conflict. Mr. Kerry indicated that he had raised the issue of Russian arms deliveries to Syria during his recent visit to Moscow, but declined to provide details.      “I think we’ve made it crystal clear we would prefer that Russia was not supplying assistance,” he said. “That hasn’t changed.”      American officials have been concerned that the flow of Russian and Iranian arms to Syria will buttress Mr. Assad’s apparent belief that he can prevail militarily.      “This weapons transfer is obviously disappointing and will set back efforts to promote the political transition that is in the best interests of the Syrian people and the region,” Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the senior Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement on Thursday night. “There is now greater urgency for the U.S. to step up assistance to the moderate opposition forces who can lead Syria after Assad.”      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey and the committee chairman, added in a statement, “Russia is offering cover to a despotic ruler and defending a bankrupt regime.”      Syria ordered the coastal defense version of the Yakhont system from Russia in 2007 and received the first batteries in early 2011, according to Jane’s. The initial order covered 72 missiles, 36 launcher vehicles, and support equipment, and the systems have been displayed in the country.      The batteries are mobile, which makes them more difficult to attack. Each consists of missiles, a three-missile launcher and a command-and-control vehicle.      The missiles are about 22 feet long, carry either a high-explosive or armor-piercing warhead, and have a range of about 180 miles, according to Jane’s.      They can be steered to a target’s general location by longer-range radars, but each missile has its own radar to help evade a ship’s defenses and home in as it approaches its target.      Two senior American officials said that the most recent shipment contained missiles with a more advanced guidance system than earlier shipments.      Russia has longstanding interests in Syria, including a naval base at the Mediterranean port of Tartus.      As the Syria crisis has escalated, Russia has gradually augmented its naval presence in the region. In January, more than two dozen Russian warships sailed to the Black and Mediterranean Seas to take part in what the Defense Ministry said was to be the country’s largest naval exercise in decades, testing the ships’ ability to deploy outside Russian waters.      A month later, after the Black Sea exercises ended, the Russian Defense Ministry news agency said that four large landing vessels were on their way to operations off the coast of Syria.      “Based on the results of the navy exercises in the Black and Mediterranean seas,” the ministry said at the time, “the ministry leadership has taken a decision to continue combat duty by Russian warships in the Mediterranean.”      Russia’s diplomatic support of Syria has also bolstered the Assad government.      At the United Nations, the Russians recently blocked proposals that the Security Council mount a fact-finding trip to Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon to investigate the burgeoning flood of refugees, according to Western diplomats.      Jordan had sought the United Nations visit to make the point that the refugee situation was a threat to stability in the region, but Russia said that the trip was beyond the mandate of the Security Council, diplomats said.      When allegations that the Assad government had used chemical weapons surfaced, Russia also backed the Syrian government’s refusal to allow the United Nations to carry out a wide-ranging investigation inside Syria — which Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, said was an attempt to “politicize the issue” and impose the “Iraqi scenario” on Syria.      Russian officials have repeatedly said that in selling arms to Syria, they are merely fulfilling old contracts. But some American officials worry that the deliveries are intended to limit the United States’ options should it choose to intervene to help the rebels.      Russia, for example, previously shipped SA-17 surface-to-air missiles to Syria. Israel carried out an airstrike against trucks that were transporting the weapons near Damascus in January. Israel has not officially acknowledged the raid but has said it is prepared to intervene militarily to prevent any “game changing” weapons from being shipped to Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group.      More recently, Israeli and American officials have urged Russia not to proceed with the sale of advanced S-300 air defense weapons. The Kremlin has yielded to American entreaties not to provide S-300s to Iran. But the denial of that sale, analysts say, has increased the pressure within Russia’s military establishment to proceed with the delivery to Syria. ||||| Article Excerpt      Russia has sent a dozen or more warships to patrol waters near its naval base in Syria, a buildup that U.S. and European officials see as a newly aggressive stance meant partly to warn the West and Israel not to intervene in Syria's bloody civil war.      Russia's expanded presence in the eastern Mediterranean, which began attracting U.S. officials' notice three months ago, represents one of its largest sustained naval deployments since the Cold War. While Western officials say they don't fear an impending conflict with Russia's aged fleet, the presence adds a new source of potential danger for miscalculation in ... ||||| Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story      CAIRO — The black flag of jihad flies over much of northern Syria. In the center of the country, pro-government militias and Hezbollah fighters battle those who threaten their communities. In the northeast, the Kurds have effectively carved out an autonomous zone.                              After more than two years of conflict, Syria is breaking up. A constellation of armed groups battling to advance their own agendas is effectively creating the outlines of separate armed fiefs. As the war expands in scope and brutality, its biggest casualty appears to be the integrity of the Syrian state.      On Thursday, President Obama met in Washington with the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and once again pressed the idea of a top-down diplomatic solution. That approach depends on the rebels and the government agreeing to meet at a peace conference that was announced last week by the United States and Russia.      “We’re going to keep increasing the pressure on the Assad regime and working with the Syrian opposition,” Mr. Obama said. “We are going to keep working for a Syria that is free of Assad’s tyranny.”      Photo      But as evidence of massacres and chemical weapons mounts, experts and Syrians themselves say the American focus on change at the top ignores the deep fractures the war has caused in Syrian society. Increasingly, it appears Syria is so badly shattered that no single authority is likely to be able to pull it back together any time soon.      Instead, three Syrias are emerging: one loyal to the government, to Iran and to Hezbollah; one dominated by Kurds with links to Kurdish separatists in Turkey and Iraq; and one with a Sunni majority that is heavily influenced by Islamists and jihadis.      “It is not that Syria is melting down — it has melted down,” said Andrew J. Tabler, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and author of “In the Lion’s Den: An Eyewitness Account of Washington’s Battle with Syria.”      “So much has changed between the different parties that I can’t imagine it all going back into one piece,” Mr. Tabler said.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Fueling the country’s breakup are the growing brutality of fighters on all sides and the increasingly sectarian nature of the violence.      Recent examples abound. Pro-government militias have hit coastal communities, targeting Sunni Muslim civilians. Sunni rebel groups have attacked religious shrines of other sects. A video circulating this week showed a rebel commander in Homs cutting out an enemy’s heart and liver, and biting into the heart.      Analysts say this shift in the nature of the violence will have a greater effect on the country’s future than territorial gains on either side by making it less likely that the myriad ethnic and religious groups that have long called Syria home will go back to living side by side. As the momentum seesaws back and forth between rebels and the government, the geographic divisions are hardening.      After steadily losing territory to rebels during the first two years of the conflict, government forces have progressed on a number of key fronts in recent weeks, routing rebel forces in the southern province of Dara’a, outside Damascus and in the central city of Homs and its surrounding villages.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      These victories not only reflect strategic shifts by government forces but also could further solidify the country’s divisions.      Since mass defections of mostly conscripted soldiers shrank the government’s forces earlier in the uprising, it has largely given up on trying to reclaim parts of the country far from the capital, said Joseph Holliday, a fellow with the Institute for the Study of War in Washington.      Instead, the government has focused on solidifying its grip on a strip of land that extends from the capital, Damascus, in the south, up to Homs in the country’s center and west to the coastal area heavily populated by Mr. Assad’s sect, the Alawites.      Other than hitting them with airstrikes or artillery, Mr. Assad has made little effort to reclaim rebel-held areas in the country’s far north and east.      Photo      The character of those fighting for Mr. Assad has changed, too. As the uncommitted defected, the loyalists remained. “All of these defections and desertions basically created a more loyal and therefore more deployable core,” said Emile Hokayem, an analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies, who is based in Dubai. “At least you know who is fighting for you.”      Mr. Assad has also come to rely more heavily on paramilitary militias that draw largely from his Alawite sect and other minorities who consider him a bulwark against the rebels’ Islamism. More recently, fighters from Lebanon’s Shiite militant group Hezbollah have added extra muscle, especially in the border region near the town of Qusair, an area dotted with Shiite and Sunni villages that has seen intense fighting in recent months.      This new focus on tightening his grip on the country’s center suits Mr. Assad fine, said Abdulrahim Mourad, a Lebanese politician and former Parliament member who visited Mr. Assad in Damascus last month.      “He told jokes, was very funny,” Mr. Mourad said. “He was very relaxed and relieved.”      In the void left by the government in the country’s north and east, rebel groups have seized swaths of territory and struggled to establish local administrations.      Although the Obama administration and its allies share the rebels’ goal of removing Mr. Assad from power, they have little else in common with the many rebel brigades that define their struggle in Islamic terms and seek to replace Mr. Assad with an Islamic state. Among them is Jabhet al-Nusra, or the Nusra Front, the local branch of Al Qaeda, which the United States has blacklisted as a terrorist group.      The war’s duration and the competition for resources have left the rebel movement itself deeply fractured. Few effective links exist between the rebels’ exile leader, Gen. Salim Idris, and the most powerful groups on the ground.      And recent months have seen increasing fights among rebels, diminishing their ability to form a united front against the government. This week, the Islamist Shariah Commission in Aleppo went after rebels accused of looting. The council sent fighters to surround the group’s headquarters and arrested some of its members, confiscating trucks full of looted goods. The haul in one neighborhood included five washing machines and a television.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Another video, circulated this week, showed a Nusra Front leader in eastern Syria standing behind 11 bound and blindfolded captives. After announcing that they had been sentenced by an Islamic court for killing Syrians, he drew a pistol and shot them in the back of the head, one by one.      Activists later identified the man as a Saudi citizen named Qaswara al-Jizrawi. They also determined that the executions took place months earlier since Mr. Jizrawi was killed in March in a gunfight between his and another rebel group that left dozens of people dead on both sides.      In Syria’s northeastern Hassakeh Province, the country’s largest Kurdish majority area, residents have taken in Kurds fleeing violence elsewhere, expanded the teaching of the Kurdish language in schools and raised militias that have clashed with rebel brigades. Many local Kurds are linked to groups in Turkey and Iraq and hope to use the uprising to push for greater autonomy.      These spreading fissures leave little optimism that Syria can be stitched back together under one leadership in the near future.      “The only real outcome I see in the next 5 to 10 years is a series of cantons that agree to tactical cease-fires because they are tired of the bloodletting,” said Mr. Holliday, the analyst with the Institute for the Study of War. “That trajectory is in place, with or without Assad.” ||||| Summary:","output":"The article reports that Russia has supplied Syria with advanced anti-ship cruise missiles, showing its deep support for President Bashar al-Assad's government, according to American officials.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who told his friend that he could certify that the offensive smell have been of the most head-and-stomach distending nature? is inside the article: By mid-1858 the problems with the Thames had been building for several years. In his  novel Little Dorrit—published as a serial between 1855 and 1857—Charles Dickens wrote that the Thames was \\"a deadly sewer ... in the place of a fine, fresh river\\". In a letter to a friend, Dickens  said: \\"I can certify that the offensive smells, even in that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending nature\\", while the social scientist and journalist George Godwin wrote that \\"in parts the deposit is more than six feet deep\\" on the Thames foreshore, and that \\"the whole of this is thickly impregnated with impure matter\\". In June 1858 the temperatures in the shade in London averaged 34–36 °C (93–97 °F)—rising to 48 °C (118 °F) in the sun. Combined with an extended spell of dry weather, the level of the Thames dropped and raw effluent from the sewers remained on the banks of the river. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attempted to take a pleasure cruise on the Thames, but returned to shore within a few minutes because the smell was so terrible. The press soon began calling the event \\"The Great Stink\\"; the leading article in the City Press observed that \\"Gentility of speech is at an end—it stinks, and whoso once inhales the stink can never forget it and can count himself lucky if he lives to remember it\\". A writer for The Standard concurred with the opinion. One of its reporters described the river as a \\"pestiferous and typhus breeding abomination\\", while a second wrote that \\"the amount of poisonous gases which is thrown off is proportionate to the increase of the sewage which is passed into the stream\\". The leading article in The Illustrated London News commented that: We can colonise the remotest ends of the earth; we can conquer India; we can pay the interest of the most enormous debt ever contracted; we can spread our name, and our fame, and our fructifying wealth to every part of the world; but we cannot clean the River Thames., can you guess it ?

In the provided text, the narrator refers to the female subject as \\"Sweet girl\\", which indicates an affectionate relationship or connection. Additionally, the narrator provides context where the female subject has stitches and underwent an ultrasound, revealing that the narrator is aware of the subject's medical history and is likely responsible for her well-being. The reference to \\"We're trying to make do without the cone collar\\" also suggests that the narrator is involved in taking care of the female subject since they are making decisions regarding her recovery and comfort. Furthermore, the subject's happiness to see the narrator likely stems from the bond between them, as a result of their guardian-role, and the comfort and safety this relationship brings. The other options, such as the narrator being unknown to the subject or being a stranger, would not elicit the same happiness and excitement. In contrast, a familiar and caring guardian provides a sense of security and companionship that would make the subject react as described.  In conclusion, the text provides sufficient evidence to support that the female subject is happy to see the narrator because the narrator is her guardian and takes care of her well-being, ultimately providing her with a sense of security and emotional connection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Though there are about 400 languages from all over the world that are in danger of disappearing completely, Zoque-Ayapaneco, a native Mexican language is considered the most likely to become extinct, because the only two people in the world that speak it fluently do not talk to each other! And, it's not because they live in different countries, states or even villages. In fact, Manuel Segovia and Isidro Velazquez, both in their 70s, live within 500 yards of each other, in the village of Ayapa in the Southern Mexican State of Tabasco. They, however, refuse to communicate because they simply don't have much in common. Segovia is apparently a little flank in nature while Velazquez is described as shy. Segovia was at least able to talk in Zoque-Ayapanece with his brother until he passed away about 12 years ago, and still manages to practice it with his family, especially his son Manuel, who for the last five years has been trying to learn it and hopes to become fluent enough to teach it to the next generation. Velazquez on the other hand, has not been heard speaking in the language with anybody. The two men say the language used to be widely spoken in the village, but the younger generation _ it for fear of being laughed at, and it therefore began to die a slow death, as the elders passed away. Unless the two men get their acts together, the only way to hear the language will be to either listen to Manuel's not-so-fluent statement or see them talk in a documentary entitled \\"Lengua Muerta\\" (Dead Language) that is being filmed to capture Zoque Ayapaneco and 364 other native Mexican languages that are in a similar state.

Write a question about the following article: World War I began as a clash of 20th-century technology and 19th-century tactics, with the inevitably large ensuing casualties. By the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernised and were making use of telephone, wireless communication, armoured cars, tanks, and aircraft. Infantry formations were reorganised, so that 100-man companies were no longer the main unit of manoeuvre; instead, squads of 10 or so men, under the command of a junior NCO, were favoured. Artillery also underwent a revolution. In 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. By 1917, indirect fire with guns  was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably aircraft and the often overlooked field telephone. Counter-battery missions became commonplace, also, and sound detection was used to locate enemy batteries.","output":"How did the modernization of technology and the reorganization of infantry formations during World War I influence the shift in tactics and communication by the end of 1917?"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is Plant ecologists study the composition of local and regional floras, their biodiversity, genetic diversity and fitness, the adaptation of plants to their environment, and their competitive or mutualistic interactions with other species. a good answer to this question? Options: (A). yes (B). no","output":"(B). no While the given statement provides valuable information about the study of plant ecology, it does not directly answer the question regarding plant habitats. A more detailed and long answer addressing plant habitats would be as follows: Plant habitats refer to the various environments in which plants grow, thrive, and reproduce. These habitats can be natural or man-made and are determined by factors such as geography, climate, altitude, soil type, and species interactions. Understanding plant habitats is crucial because it helps ecologists and conservationists maintain, protect and restore ecosystems. Here is a comprehensive explanation of different types of plant habitats: 1. Terrestrial habitats: These are land-based habitats characterized by diverse plant communities. Terrestrial habitats can be broadly classified into the following categories:    a. Forests: This habitat is dominated by a dense canopy of trees and an understory of smaller plants. Forests can be further categorized into tropical rainforests, temperate forests, and boreal forests, based on temperature, precipitation, and the type of vegetation.    b. Grasslands: Grasslands are open areas dominated by grasses and herbs, with a minimal presence of trees. They can be further classified into savannas, temperate grasslands, and steppes, depending on the location and climate.    c. Deserts: Deserts are areas with minimal precipitation, extreme temperature fluctuations, and sparse vegetation. Desert vegetation primarily consists of drought-tolerant species like cacti, succulents, and shrubs.    d. Wetlands: Wetlands are areas where water covers or saturates the soil for extended periods. They support specialized plant communities, such as marshes, swamps, and bogs, that have adapted to the saturated conditions. 2. Aquatic habitats: These habitats are found in both freshwater and saltwater environments. The main types of aquatic habitats include:    a. Lakes and ponds: These are standing freshwater habitats that support a variety of submerged, floating, and emergent plants.    b. Rivers and streams: These are flowing freshwater systems with diverse plant communities adapted to various water flow rates and conditions.    c. Estuaries: These are areas where freshwater meets saltwater and provide a unique habitat for salt-tolerant plant species.    d. Coastal and marine habitats: These habitats are influenced by tides, waves, and saltwater. They can include shores, coral reefs, tidal pools, and seagrass meadows. 3. Anthropogenic habitats: These are human-created or modified environments that now support plant communities. Examples include agricultural fields, landscaped parks, and urban gardens. Overall, the diversity of plant habitats reflects the vast array of plant adaptations and ecological strategies employed by different species. These habitats are critical for the maintenance of life on Earth since plants are the primary producers and serve as the base of entire ecosystems. By studying plant habitats and understanding their responses to factors such as climate change, land use changes, and invasive species, scientists can develop strategies to protect and conserve these crucial ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information:  - Judaism (from , derived from Greek , originally from Hebrew , \\"Yehudah\\", \\"Judah\\"; in Hebrew: , \\"Yahadut\\", the distinctive characteristics of the Judean ethnos) encompasses the religion, philosophy, culture and way of life of the Jewish people. Judaism is an ancient monotheistic religion, with the Torah as its foundational text (part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible), and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the covenantal relationship that God established with the Children of Israel. With between 14.5 and 17.4 million adherents worldwide, Judaism is the tenth-largest religion in the world.  - The Habsburg Monarchy or Empire, occasionally also styled as the Danubian Monarchy (\\"Donaumonarchie\\"), is an unofficial appellation among historians for the countries and provinces that were ruled by the between 1521 and 1780 and then by the successor branch of Habsburg-Lorraine until 1918. The Monarchy was a composite state composed of territories within and outside the Holy Roman Empire, united only in the person of the monarch. The dynastic capital was Vienna, except from 1583 to 1611, when it was moved to Prague. From 1804 to 1867 the Habsburg Monarchy was formally unified as the Austrian Empire, and from 1867 to 1918 as the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  - The Austrian Empire (modern spelling \\"\\") was an empire in Central Europe created out of the realms of the Habsburgs by proclamation in 1804. It was a multinational empire and one of Europe's great powers. Geographically it was the second largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire (621,538 square kilometres [239,977 sq mi]). It was also the third most populous after Russia and France, as well as the largest and strongest country in the German Confederation. Proclaimed in response to the First French Empire, it overlapped with the Holy Roman Empire until the latter's dissolution in 1806. The \\"Ausgleich\\" of 1867 elevated Hungary's status. It became a separate entity from the Empire entirely, joining with it in the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary.  - Solomon Judah Löb HaKohen Rapoport ( June 1 , 1786 -- October 15 , 1867 ) ( Hebrew :     ) , was a Galician rabbi and Jewish scholar . He was born in Lemberg , Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria . He married in 1810 Franziska Freide Heller , the daughter of the well - known Aryeh Leib Heller , and was instrumental in publishing the work Avnei Miluim of his father in law . He wrote both the index , sources and numerous comments . After various experiences in business , Rapoport became rabbi of Tarnopol ( 1837 ) and of Prague ( 1840 ) . He was one of the founders of the new Wissenschaft des Judentums movement . His chief work was the first part of an ( unfinished ) encyclopaedia ( Erekh Millin , 1852 ) . Equally notable were his biographies of Saadia Gaon , Nathan ( author of the Arukh ) , Hai Gaon , Eleazar Kalir and others . Thrown upon his own resources about 1817 , Rapoport became the collector of the meat - tax on farmers . He had already given evidence of marked critical ability , though his writings previously published were of a light character -- poems and translations . His critical talent , however , soon revealed itself . In 1824 he wrote an article for Bikkure ha - ' Ittim on the independent Jewish tribes of Arabia and Abyssinia . Though this article gained him some recognition , a more permanent impression was made by his work on Saadia Gaon and his times ( published in the same journal in 1829 ) , the first of a series of biographical works on the medieval Jewish sages . Because of this work he received recognition in the scholarly world and gained many enthusiastic friends , especially S. D. Luzzatto . After the fashion in rabbinic circles , Rapoport was known by an acronym \`\` Shir '' , formed by the initial letters of his Hebrew name Shelomo Yehuda Rapoport ( Shir literally means \`\` song '' in Hebrew )  - The First Partition of Poland took place in 1772 as the first of three partitions that ended the existence of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by 1795. Growth in the Russian Empire's power, threatening the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Austrian Empire, was the primary motive behind this first partition. Frederick the Great engineered the partition to prevent Austria, jealous of Russian successes against the Ottoman Empire, from going to war. The weakened Commonwealth's land, including what was already controlled by Russia, was apportioned among its more powerful neighborsAustria, Russia and Prussiaso as to restore the regional balance of power in Central Europe among those three countries. With Poland unable to effectively defend itself, and with foreign troops already inside the country, the Polish parliament (Sejm) ratified the partition in 1773 during the Partition Sejm convened by the three powers.  - The PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, formally the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after 1791 the Commonwealth of Poland, was a dualistic state, a bi-confederation, of Poland and Lithuania ruled by a common monarch, who was both the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania. It was one of the largest and most populous countries of 16th- and 17th-century Europe. At its peak in the early 17th century, the Commonwealth spanned some and sustained a multi-ethnic population of 11 million. The union was formalized by the Union of Lublin in July 1569, but the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were in a de-facto personal union since 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned King \\"jure uxoris\\" Wadysaw II Jagieo of Poland. The First Partition of Poland in 1772 and the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 greatly reduced the nation's size and the Commonwealth disappeared as an independent state following the Third Partition of Poland in 1795.  - The Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, also known as Galicia or Austrian Poland, became a crownland of the Habsburg Monarchy as a result of the First Partition of Poland in 1772, when it became a Kingdom under Habsburg rule. From 1804 to 1918 it was a crownland of the Austrian Empire. After the reforms of 1867, it became an ethnic Pole-administered autonomous unit under the Austrian crown. The country was carved from the entire south-western part of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth. Among the many ceremonial titles of the princes of Hungary was \\"ruler of Galicia and Lodomeria\\".  - Poland, officially the Republic of Poland, is a country in Central Europe, situated between the Baltic Sea in the north and two mountain ranges (the Sudetes and Carpathian Mountains) in the south. Bordered by Germany to the west; the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the south; Ukraine and Belarus to the east; and the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad Oblast (a Russian exclave) and Lithuania to the north. The total area of Poland is , making it the 69th largest country in the world and the 9th largest in Europe. With a population of over 38.5 million people, Poland is the 34th most populous country in the world, the 8th most populous country in Europe and the sixth most populous member of the European Union. Poland is a unitary state divided into 16 administrative subdivisions, and its capital and largest city is Warsaw. Other metropolises include Kraków, Wrocaw, Pozna, Gdask and Szczecin.  - In Judaism, a rabbi is a teacher of Torah.

Given the question: Information:  - Virgin Records is a major record label first founded by English entrepreneur Richard Branson, Simon Draper, Nik Powell and musician Tom Newman in 1972. The company grew to be a worldwide phenomenon over time with the success of its platinum performers such as Janet Jackson, Roy Orbison, Devo, Genesis, Keith Richards, the Human League, Culture Club, Simple Minds, Lenny Kravitz, dc Talk, the Smashing Pumpkins, Mike Oldfield, Spice Girls and more on their list of artists. It was later sold to Thorn EMI in 1992.  - Michael Gordon \\"Mike\\" Oldfield (born 15 May 1953) is an English musician and composer. His work blends progressive rock with world, folk, classical, electronic, ambient, and new-age music. His biggest commercial success is the 1973 album \\"Tubular Bells\\"which launched Virgin Records and became a hit in America after its opening was used as the theme for the film \\"The Exorcist\\". He also recorded the 1983 hit single \\"Moonlight Shadow\\" and a rendition of the Christmas piece \\"In Dulci Jubilo\\".  - Universal Music Group, Inc. (also known as Universal Music Group Recordings, Inc. and abbreviated as UMG) is an American-French global music corporation that is a subsidiary of the Paris-based French media conglomerate Vivendi. UMG's global corporate headquarters are in Santa Monica, California.  - Musica universalis (literally universal music), also called Music of the spheres or Harmony of the Spheres, is an ancient philosophical concept that regards proportions in the movements of celestial bodiesthe Sun, Moon, and planetsas a form of \\"musica\\" (the Medieval Latin term for music). This \\"music\\" is not usually thought to be literally audible, but a harmonic, mathematical or religious concept. The idea continued to appeal to thinkers about music until the end of the Renaissance, influencing scholars of many kinds, including humanists. Further scientific exploration has determined specific proportions in some orbital motion, described as orbital resonance.  - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.  - A record label or record company is a brand or trademark associated with the marketing of music recordings and music videos. Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers. The term \\"record label\\" derives from the circular label in the center of a vinyl record which prominently displays the manufacturer's name, along with other information.  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - Island Records is a Jamaican-English record label that operates as a division of the Universal Music Group (UMG). It was founded by Chris Blackwell, Graeme Goodall and Leslie Kong in Jamaica in 1959. Blackwell sold the label to PolyGram in 1989. Both Island and another label recently acquired byPolyGram, A&M Records, were both at the time the largest independent record labels in history, with Island in particular having exerted a major influence on the progressive UK music scene in the early 1970s.   - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing.  - In celestial mechanics, an orbital resonance occurs when two orbiting bodies exert a regular, periodic gravitational influence on each other, usually because their orbital periods are related by a ratio of two small integers. The physics principle behind orbital resonance is similar in concept to pushing a child on a swing, where the orbit and the swing both have a natural frequency, and the other body doing the \\"pushing\\" will act in periodic repetition to have a cumulative effect on the motion. Orbital resonances greatly enhance the mutual gravitational influence of the bodies, i.e., their ability to alter or constrain each other's orbits. In most cases, this results in an \\"unstable\\" interaction, in which the bodies exchange momentum and shift orbits until the resonance no longer exists. Under some circumstances, a resonant system can be stable and self-correcting, so that the bodies remain in resonance. Examples are the 1:2:4 resonance of Jupiter's moons Ganymede, Europa and Io, and the 2:3 resonance between Pluto and Neptune. Unstable resonances with Saturn's inner moons give rise to gaps in the rings of Saturn. The special case of 1:1 resonance (between bodies with similar orbital radii) causes large Solar System bodies to eject most other bodies sharing their orbits; this is part of the much more extensive process of clearing the neighbourhood, an effect that is used in the current definition of a planet.  - EMI (officially EMI Group Limited, originally an initialism for Electric and Musical Industries and often known as EMI Records and EMI Music) was a British multinational conglomerate founded in March 1931 and was based in London. At the time of its break-up in 2012, it was the fourth-largest business group and family of record labels in the recording industry and was one of the big four record companies (now the big three). Its EMI Records Ltd. group of record labels included EMI Records, Parlophone, Virgin Records and Capitol Records. EMI also had a major publishing arm, EMI Music Publishingalso based in London with offices globally.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - Music of the Spheres is an album by English musician Mike Oldfield , released in the United Kingdom on 17 March 2008 . The album , Oldfield 's second album with Mercury Records and his first classical work , is based on the concept of a celestial Musica universalis . The album features New Zealand soprano Hayley Westenra ( on \`\` On My Heart '' ) and Chinese pianist Lang Lang on six tracks . Music of the Spheres was nominated for a Classical Brit Award in 2009 .  - Tubular Bells is the first album by English musician Mike Oldfield, recorded when he was 19 and released in 1973 when he was 20.  - The term harmonic in its strictest sense describes any member of the harmonic series. The term is employed in various disciplines, including music and acoustics, electronic power transmission, radio technology, etc. It is typically applied to repeating signals, such as sinusoidal waves. A harmonic of such a wave is a wave with a frequency that is a positive integer multiple of the frequency of the original wave, known as the fundamental frequency. The original wave is also called 1st harmonic, the following harmonics are known as higher harmonics. As all harmonics are periodic at the fundamental frequency, the sum of harmonics is also periodic at that frequency. For example, if the fundamental frequency is 50 Hz, a common AC power supply frequency, the frequencies of the first three higher harmonics are 100 Hz (2nd harmonic), 150 Hz (3rd harmonic), 200 Hz (4th harmonic) and any addition of waves with these frequencies is periodic at 50 Hz.  - Mercury Records is an American-based record label owned by Universal Music Group. In the United States, it operates through Island Records; in the UK, it is distributed by Virgin EMI Records.  - \\"Moonlight Shadow\\" is a song written and performed by English multi-instrumentalist Mike Oldfield, released as a single in May 1983 by Virgin Records, and included in the album \\"Crises\\" of the same year. The vocals were performed by Scottish vocalist Maggie Reilly, who had been collaborating with Mike Oldfield since 1980. It is Oldfield's most successful single, reaching number one on a number of charts around Europe.    'music of the spheres ' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'genre'?

Question: suppose planting more trees happens, how will it affect LESS bad effects of pollution.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: less To answer this question, let's break down the process of how planting more trees can affect pollution: 1. Trees absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. By increasing the number of trees, there will be more CO2 removed from the atmosphere. This helps in reducing the excess CO2 and restoring the balance of the carbon cycle. 2. With a reduction in excess CO2, the greenhouse effect can be somewhat mitigated. This can aid in slowing down global warming, which is believed to be caused by the excess buildup of greenhouse gases like CO2. 3. Although planting more trees does not directly affect the ozone layer, it can contribute to reducing the overall levels of air pollution. This includes the pollutants that are responsible for damaging the ozone layer, such as methane and CFCs. 4. Lastly, trees can act as a natural filter for some of the pollutants that cause acid rain, like sulfur dioxide. As the trees absorb these pollutants, there will be a lesser amount getting into the atmosphere, which can eventually lead to a decrease in acid rain. In summary, planting more trees can have a positive impact on reducing the severity of some of the harmful effects of pollution. Therefore, the answer is B: less."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

TOKYO — Moody’s, the credit ratings agency, lowered Japan’s credit rating by one notch on Wednesday, warning that frequent changes in administration, weak prospects for economic growth and its recent natural and nuclear disasters made it difficult for the government to pare down its huge debt.      Hours after the downgrade, the government announced a 100 billion credit facility to help the Japanese economy ride out a spike in the yen in recent weeks amid the global market turmoil, which has battered Japan’s export-led economy.      “Taking into account that there is a lopsided rise in the yen, I felt that swift measures were needed,” Yoshihiko Noda, the finance minister, told reporters.      Moody’s Investors Service lowered Japan’s grade by one step to Aa3, the fourth-highest rating, the company said in a statement.      The downgrade brings Moody’s rating for Japan in line with Standard & Poor’s, which lowered the country’s grade by one notch to AA-minus in January, the fourth highest on its scale. Moody’s had put Japan on review for a downgrade in May.      The action comes after a round of downgrades by major ratings agencies of sovereign debt, and amid concern that the debt crisis in Europe could escalate. On Aug. 5, S.& P. cut the sovereign debt rating of the United States for the first time in the country’s history.      Markets in Tokyo largely shrugged off the downgrade, the latest in a line of many.      Trust in Japanese government debt “remains unwavering,” Japan’s finance minister, Yoshihiko Noda, told reporters after the downgrade.      Still, the move, a week before the country’s ruling party is to select a new prime minister, could put additional pressure on the incoming administration to balance budgets. The government financing of the recovery from the March 11 earthquake, tsunami and subsequent nuclear crisis is expected to reach as high as 10 trillion yen (130 billion).      Even before the disasters, Japan’s debt was expected to soar to almost 220 percent of its gross domestic product next year, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which would rank it as the largest debt-to-G.D.P. ratio in the world. Japan, however, has long been able to borrow at low nominal rates because of unwavering appetite by domestic investors for government debt.      Moody’s said that it was worried by large budget deficits and the buildup of government debt. Frequent change in leadership had prevented the government from pursuing long-term fiscal reform, the agency said, while the recent disasters had delayed recovery. Meanwhile, weak prospects for economic growth were also hampering efforts to curb the country’s debt burden, the agency said.      Deflation and sluggish growth has long weighed on Japan’s economy, eroding the country’s tax base and forcing the government to issue debt to finance its budget. Meanwhile, spending on pensions and social welfare has soared as the country’s population ages.      The global economic crisis further darkened Japan’s economic outlook, as has the recent tsunami and nuclear accident. Global market turmoil in recent weeks has also wreaked havoc with the Japanese economy, driving up the value of the yen and hurting its export-led economy.      The credit facility unveiled on Wednesday aims to spur Japanese spending on corporate acquisitions and resources overseas, according to a statement released by the Finance Ministry.      By spending yen for dollars and other currencies, the ministry hopes that the currency will weaken somewhat. A strong yen hurts Japanese exporters because it makes their goods less competitive and erodes the value of their overseas earnings when repatriated into yen.      The ministry also said it would step up monitoring of currency markets by asking financial institutions to report on positions held by their currency dealers.      Prime Minister Naoto Kan, meanwhile, is expected to step down by the end of the month amid criticism of his handling of the response to the disasters, making way for Japan’s fifth prime minister in six years.      Mr. Noda, the finance minister, is among a field of candidates to replace Mr. Kan. He has supported more aggressive steps, including raising taxes, to tackle the country’s debt. Debate over Japan’s finances has been sidelined by the country’s recovery and reconstruction needs, however. ||||| Credit ratings agency Moody's criticised the instability at the top of Japanese politics on Tuesday as it slashed the country's credit rating and warned that its mountain of debt needed to be tackled.      Moody's cut Japan's rating by one notch to Aa3, its fourth highest rating, and said a tougher deficit reduction plan was urgently needed. The move came just hours before Japan took fresh steps to help corporations cope with the strength of the yen, including a 100bn (£60bn) fund to help fund overseas acquisitions.      Japan has the highest debt-to-GDP ratio of any country in the world, with its borrowings estimated to hit 233% of annual economic output in 2011. Moody's said the rapid turnover of Japanese prime ministers – five different men have held the job since the credit crunch began in August 2007 – had prevented the government from turning \\"long-term economic and fiscal strategies into effective and durable policies\\".      Naoto Kan, the current prime minister, is expected to resign next week, triggering yet another leadership battle – and potentially dealing another blow to Japan's debt-reduction plans.      \\"A divided Diet [the Japanese parliament] and tensions within the ruling Democratic party of Japan risk both the timing and implementation of the reform plan. Indeed, the imminent change in the party's presidency and the election of a new prime minister reflect the factious nature of the country's politics,\\" Moody's warned.      Kan had proposed a fiscal consolidation plan this year, after March's devastating earthquake added to the country's economic problems. This included doubling the sales tax later this decade. Moody's argues that more needs to be done to achieve a primary budget surplus by 2020.      Otherwise, it said, \\"even under the government's more vigorous and optimistic economic growth scenario, a decline in the debt-burden trajectory would remain elusive\\".      The downgrade did not alarm traders as most of Japan's debt is bought by domestic investors, meaning it is less reliant on the international credit markets. The Nikkei 225 closed 1.07% lower at 8639.61.      Moody's told reporters in Tokyo that it did not see the eurozone debt crisis spreading to Japan, and maintained a \\"stable\\" outlook on the country's debt.      Recent twists in the financial crisis have driven up the value of the yen to record levels, hurting Japanese exporters. Finance minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to take \\"decisive action\\" to prevent speculators pushing the yen higher, as he announced that 100bn of credit will be made available to companies to help them borrow cheaply and invest overseas. Noda also stepped up the monitoring of foreign exchange positions held by currency dealers.      \\"We decided to compile the package to show our strong determination that we will act if current yen rises persist, or if the yen rises further,\\" Noda said.      The package received a lacklustre reception in the financial markets, though, where there was disappointment that Japan had not intervened in the foreign exchange markets to actively push its currency lower, as it did three weeks ago. The yen rose slightly, hitting ¥76.53 to the dollar. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Moody's, a credit ratings agency, lowered Japan's credit rating because they are worried that the country's government has had many changes and is having a hard time with its big debt. This can also make it difficult for Japan to grow economically and recover from natural disasters.

Тушь для ресниц Translate to English","output":"Mascara for Eyelashes Mascara for eyelashes is a cosmetic product used primarily to enhance the appearance of the eyes by lengthening, volumizing, and darkening the eyelashes. It has been a popular beauty item for centuries, with its roots tracing back to ancient Egypt, where kohl was employed to darken the eye area. The modern-day mascara, however, made its debut in the early twentieth century and has seen significant transformations and improvements since then. Mascaras come in various types and formulations, including waterproof, smudge-proof, lengthening, and volumizing. Each type of mascara caters to specific needs and preferences and often includes a unique combination of ingredients to achieve the desired result. The critical components of mascara can be divided into three categories: 1. Pigments: Typically, iron oxides or titanium dioxide are used to impart color to the lashes. These pigments can be black, brown, or even colored in more playful shades like blue, green, and purple. The pigments help create the illusion of fuller, longer, and more dramatic lashes. 2. Waxes and Oils: These ingredients help form a smooth, creamy texture and help the mascara glide easily onto the lashes. Commonly used waxes and oils in mascaras are beeswax, carnauba wax, and rice bran wax, as well as mineral oil, lanolin, and castor oil. They also contribute to the product's durability and provide hydration to the lashes. 3. Polymers: Polymers are responsible for holding the mascara in place on the lashes, ensuring a uniform and smudge-proof application. They also help maintain the curl and volume of the lashes throughout the day. Polymers such as PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone) and VP (vinylpyrrolidone) are commonly used in mascara formulations. To choose the right mascara, consider factors like your natural eyelash type, the desired outcome, and the occasion at which the mascara will be worn. For instance, if you have short or sparse lashes and want to create an illusion of length and fullness, opt for a lengthening and volumizing mascara. On the other hand, if you plan on wearing mascara at the beach, pool, or during a workout, invest in a waterproof formula to ensure that the product remains intact. Application of mascara typically involves using a brush, wand, or comb that is coated with the product. To apply, start at the base of the lashes and wiggle the applicator outward in a zigzag motion, ensuring that you coat every single lash. Add additional coats for a more dramatic look, but be cautious not to build up too many layers, as this can lead to clumping and an unappealing spider-like effect. To remove mascara, it is crucial to use a gentle makeup remover or cleanser designed specifically for the eyes. Avoid rubbing the eyes vigorously as this could result in the loss of eyelashes or irritation. Instead, soak a cotton pad in the remover and gently press it against the lashes, allowing the product to dissolve before gently wiping it away. Mascara is an essential beauty staple and has a long-standing relationship with boosting confidence and enhancing the natural allure of one's eyes. With the multitude of options available, it's easy to find a mascara that caters to your unique needs, preferences, and desired outcome."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There was no menu screen to start.I did go to the main menu to verify that it was what I would expect, and it also has Chinese characters along with the English menu selections. Nothing special. Nothing disruptive.The only thing that kept me from giving a 5-star rating is that a hard-core acoustics person (aka: husbands) will probably find the sound to be slightly tin-y.

So you can plan for the occasion when you want to send the card. For example, you can send your e-card on a certain day and then visit the person with some flowers the next day. This will surely create a good impression on the persons you love and give them a great surprise. We have never forgotten the importance of saying sorry to our beloved ones. But sometimes we fail to do so, because we are not brave enough to face those we hurt. Some e-cards allow us to express our feelings in a more thoughtful way. Although some people still would rather buy traditional cards in the shops for the persons they love, especially when they want the cards to last a long time, more and more people are choosing to send greetings on the Internet.

If you squeezed the spring together (compressed it), it will expand. If you pulled it apart (stretched it), it will compress. This happens because springs like to be in their original shape, like how you like to stretch after sitting cramped for a while. When you let go, the spring goes back to its normal shape because of the energy stored inside it. Question 2: China is a very big country with many people. Some parts of China are rich, with tall buildings, fancy cars, and lots of technology. But other parts of China are poorer, where people don't have as much money or things like houses or food. So, China has both rich and poor areas, but overall as a country, China has been growing economically and becoming stronger. No, Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing.

Given the question: Background: A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \\"dilute\\" their risk of attack, each individual being just one of many in the group. George C. Williams and W.D. Hamilton proposed that group living evolved because it provides benefits to the individual rather than to the group as a whole, which becomes more conspicuous as it becomes larger. One common example is the shoaling of fish. Experiments provide direct evidence for the decrease in individual attack rate seen with group living, for example in Camargue horses in Southern France. The horse-fly often attacks these horses, sucking blood and carrying diseases. When the flies are most numerous, the horses gather in large groups, and individuals are indeed attacked less frequently. Water striders are insects that live on the surface of fresh water, and are attacked from beneath by predatory fish. Experiments varying the group size of the water striders showed that the attack rate per individual water strider decreases as group size increases.

PUBLISHED:. 10:17 EST, 22 August 2012. |. UPDATED:. 01:44 EST, 23 August 2012. The parliamentary head of Angela Merkel's party has warned that crisis-wracked Greece has 'no room for manoeuvre' ahead of talks this week between the German chancellor and the Greek prime minister. Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is due. to visit Berlin on Friday before heading to Paris for talks with French. President Francois Hollande the next day. According to Greek media, Samaras. will discuss extending a deadline for Greece to make budget cuts in return for its next slice of aid. while stopping short of making a formal request. Warning: Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, right, is expected to discuss extending the deadline for Greece to make budget cuts. But German MP Volker Kauder, left, says Greece has 'no room for manoeuvre' The Financial Times reported today that Samaras would ask for two more years to make the demanded cuts. But Volker Kauder, parliamentary group leader of Merkel's conservative bloc, told Der Spiegel weekly: 'The Greeks have to stick to what they have promised. There is no room for manoeuvre, either in terms of time or substance. 'That would be yet another agreement broken. That's exactly what led us to this crisis.' Greece's debt stands at more than 300. billion euros (372 billion), and its economy is struggling through a. fifth year of recession with unemployment above 23 percent. In an interview published today, Samaras insisted. that Athens doesn't want more money from creditors, but made clear it. would like more time to enact reforms and spending cuts. He vehemently rejected the suggestion. that it might be better for Greece to leave the 17-nation euro and. bring back its former currency, the drachma. Showdown: Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is due to visit Berlin for talks with German chancellor Angela Merkel, right, on Friday before heading to Paris for talks with French President Francois Hollande, left, the next day. That, he told Germany's mass-circulation Bild daily, would result in 'a catastrophe for Greece' and economic collapse. Samaras pledged before coming to. power to seek a two-year extension to the deadline for implementing. unpopular cuts demanded in exchange for two massive international aid. packages worth 240 billion euros that are keeping Greece afloat. But delays in implementing reforms. and austerity measures have fueled impatience in Germany - the largest. single contributor to the bailouts - and other eurozone countries. German officials and lawmakers have. made clear they're in no mood to grant significant concessions, and. speculation has grown that Greece will have to leave the euro. Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker, who chairs the eurozone finance ministers' meetings, was due in Athens today. 'Let me be very clear: we are not asking for extra money,' Samaras was quoted as telling Bild. 'We stand by our commitments and the. implementation of all requirements. But we must encourage growth,. because that reduces the financing gaps. 'All we want is a little \\"air to. breathe\\" to get the economy going and increase state income,' Samaras. added, without specifying any timeframe. 'More time does not automatically mean more money.' Asked whether Greece needs a second. debt writedown following one carried through earlier this year, Samaras. replied: 'that has never been discussed.' Some German politicians have talked. openly in recent weeks about the possibility of Greece leaving the euro,. and the vice chancellor, Economy Minister Philipp Roesler, has said. that the idea of a Greek exit has 'lost its horror.' Difficult times: Greece's debt stands at more than 300 billion euros, and its economy is struggling through a fifth year of recession with unemployment above 23 percent. This picture shows a view of the Acropolis and the Parthenon in Athens. But Athens insists the country must. remain in the euro - something which opinion polls have shown the vast. majority of Greeks want. Asked by Bild whether a return to the. drachma would be better, Samaras replied that 'the consequences would. be a catastrophe for Greece.' 'It would mean at least five more. years of recession and push unemployment above 40 percent,' he was. quoted as saying. 'A nightmare for Greece: economic collapse, social. unrest and an unprecedented crisis of democracy.' Auditors from the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund -- known as the Troika -- will release a report in mid-September on Greece's progress towards achieving the required austerity. According to Der Spiegel, this report will call for Athens to slash 14 billion euros (17 billion) from its budget over the next two years, 2.5 billion euros more than originally demanded. Der Spiegel said the extra cuts were needed because planned privatisations were not shaping up to be as lucrative as hoped and tax revenues were falling short of forecasts as Greece struggles through its fifth year of recession. Kauder reiterated that Europe should strive to keep Greece in the eurozone, but stressed that the Troika report would be the basis for further decisions. 'We should do everything to stick together. When the first difficulties appear, you don't throw the children out of the house. I am going to wait to see what the Troika says,' Kauder said. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

Write a text based on this summary: survey shows taiwanese not anxious to resume talks with china Text:","output":"A recent survey conducted in Taiwan has revealed that the majority of Taiwanese citizens are not in a hurry to resume talks with China. This finding comes amidst rising tensions between the two nations, which have seen a long-standing dispute over sovereignty and political differences. The survey, completed by a reputable research institution, sheds light on the sentiments of the general public in Taiwan regarding their relations with China. An overwhelming majority of the respondents voiced their concern about China's increasing aggression towards Taiwan, as well as its attempts to assert its dominance in the region. This has led to a marked reduction in the desire for talks among the populace. It should be noted that since the election of President Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 2016, cross-strait communication between Taiwan and China has significantly reduced. The DPP has historically advocated for Taiwan's independence and has resisted China's \\"one country, two systems\\" approach. The level of anxiety among Taiwanese citizens about resuming talks with China is further compounded by the Hong Kong situation, with fears that any potential future agreements could lead to a similar loss of autonomy. China's handling of Hong Kong has raised doubts about the viability of the \\"one country, two systems\\" model and its application to Taiwan. That being said, not all Taiwanese maintain the same view. There remains a minority who believe that it is still necessary to maintain dialogue with Beijing, given the economic ties between the two nations. For these individuals, a continued discussion could be the key to securing a stable future for Taiwan. In conclusion, this recent survey highlights the growing hesitance among Taiwanese citizens to reestablish communication with China. Fueled by ongoing geopolitical concerns and a desire for independence and autonomy, the findings suggest that any attempts at negotiating a peaceful resolution between the two nations will be met with considerable resistance. However, it remains essential to acknowledge the varied perspectives existing within Taiwanese society and to ultimately navigate a path forward that respects the wishes of the majority while also considering the minorities who advocate for renewed dialogue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The first time I saw Oscar Pistorius run, I was captivated. Witnessing him caused me to jump up and down. My 10-year-old son, an amputee since the first week of his life, calmly commented, \\"Mom, he's just a man!\\" I suppose that should have curbed my enthusiasm. But to see a man in motion without the use of feet was simply magical. I saw him as a future superhero for my son, who is missing part of his right forearm and hand. Completely inspired, I felt as though I had witnessed the Messiah. I was so captivated that I started posting his likeness all over my Facebook page. In short, I was caught up in \\"Oscar-mania.\\" Even my church pastor had preached about Pistorius. The \\"Blade Runner,\\" he said, represented Christian values. He embodied things that I wish for my son's life. Seeing Pistorius at the Olympic and Paralympic Games was amazing and did something very special to raise awareness of athletes with physical differences. However, in the hysteria, I lost sight of one simple thing that my son had been able to see: Pistorius is just a man. He has the ability to make the mistakes of mortals. He is not a god; he is a person, and I got caught up in the passion. In full: Pistorius' affidavit to court. We don't know what really happened. I would like to believe that Reeva Steenkamp's death was a horrible accident. Oscar Pistorius may or may not be guilty. But, whatever happened, there is a lesson: Too often in life, we put people on pedestals. We set them up to fail. The reality is that, despite their seemingly superhuman performances, they are just people with their own sets of challenges. The truth is, I wanted my son to have a role model. The first part of his life was filled with questions for me. I wanted someone to tell me that he would be OK. After he was born, the first couple of times that I saw someone with a limb difference, I would race up to them and start a conversation. In the beginning, this approach brought me comfort. One morning at the gym, I spotted a man with a limb difference like my son's. At the time, my baby was only 6 months old. I ran up to him and said hello. The guy turned and looked at me. In a thick French-Canadian accent, he responded, \\"Hello, my dear!\\" Completely embarrassed, I thrust my baby into his range of vision and stumbled to say, \\"He, he, he is like you!\\" Suddenly, his seductive voice changed to a matter-of-fact tone. In an instant, he said the words I have never forgotten: \\"This is your issue. Your son will never really see himself as different unless you let him.\\" He continued, \\"He is young and you control how he perceives himself. So just relax and enjoy him.\\" I was mortified and completely perplexed. But on another level, I was grateful for his words. All of this made my husband laugh. As a man who lacks hair, he remarked, \\"Honey, I don't run up to every bald guy! You should not expect to have a connection with every person whose limb difference is like our son's. After all, they are just people.\\" So there, again, was my life lesson. We want to be reminded that ordinary people are capable of extraordinary things. But, despite whatever heroic and inspiring feats we accomplish, we are all potentially capable of doing great harm. I am grateful for Pistorius' flash of greatness, and I am sad if he has fallen from it. Have you ever learned an important lesson from your children? Share on CNN iReport or in the comments below.

On 2 April 2015, 3 Iranian officers were killed by unidentified gunmen in the city of Hamidiyeh, about 25 kilometers  west of the city of Ahvaz. Additional 2 casualties were sustained by the Iranian security on 26 October 2015. In early June 2016, a Sunni group known as Suqour al-Ahvaz  blew up the Bou-Ali-Sina Petrochemical Complex in Bandar-E Mahshahr, Khuzestan. On July 2016, on two occasions Ahwazi militants of al-Farouq Brigade of the Ahwazi National Resistance blew up pipelines in the Johar as-Sabaa' district. Reportedly, members of the al-Farouq Brigade managed to escape after the operation, despite efforts of the security forces and Revolutionary Guards to track down the offenders. According to Algemeiner, the group responsible for the 11 and 17 July attacks was Suqour al-Ahvaz . In August 2016, Iran executed 3 men, charged with terror attack which led to the death of 3 Iranian policemen in Khuzestan province back in April 2015.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation? ?  St Botolph's Church is an Anglican place of worship in the village of Quarrington, part of the civil parish of Sleaford in Lincolnshire, England. The area has been settled since at least the Anglo-Saxon period, and a church existed at Quarrington by the time Domesday was compiled in 1086, when it formed part of Ramsey Abbey's fee. It was granted to Haverholme Priory about 1165, and the Abbey claimed the right to present the rector in the 13th century. This right was claimed by the Bishop of Lincoln during the English Reformation in the early 16th century, and then passed to Robert Carre and his descendants after Carre acquired a manor at Quarrington. With capacity for 124 people, the church serves the ecclesiastic parish of Quarrington with Old Sleaford and, as of 2009, had an average congregation of 50. Recognised for its age and tracery, the church has been designated a grade II* listed building. It has a tower and spire with a nave and north aisle ending at a chancel at the east end. The oldest parts of the building date to the 13th century, although substantial rebuilding took place over the following century. Renovations followed, and the local architect Charles Kirk the Younger carried out restoration work in 1862–63, when he added the chancel in his parents' memory. The high interior's three bays of arcading correspond to the three windows in the nave's south wall and the north aisle wall; those on the south wall are unusual for the hexagons and trefoils in the reticulated designs.

Miller told the court the teen's parents should share part of the blame for the crash because they never set limits for the boy and gave him everything he wanted, according to CNN affiliate WFAA      Couch is himself a victim -- of \\"affluenza\\" -- the psychologist said, suggesting the teen's life could be turned around with treatment and no contact with his parents.

Couch was given no jail time, though he could face up to 10 years behind bars if he violates the terms of his probation. Prosecutors had asked for the maximum of 20 years.      The judge's decision stunned victims' family members, who say they feel Couch basically got away with murder.      \\"Let's face it. ... There needs to be some justice here,\\" Eric Boyles, who lost his wife and daughter, told \\"Anderson Cooper 360.\\"      On the night of June 15, his wife, Hollie Boyles, and daughter, Shelby, left their home to help Breanna Mitchell, whose SUV had broken down. Brian Jennings, a youth pastor, was driving past and also stopped to help.      All four were killed when the teen's pickup plowed into the pedestrians on a road in Burleson, south of Fort Worth. Couch's vehicle also struck a parked car, which then slid into another vehicle headed in the opposite direction.      Two people riding in the bed of the teen's pickup were tossed in the crash and severely injured. One is no longer able to move or talk because of a brain injury, while the other suffered internal injuries and broken bones.      According to prosecutors, three hours after the crash, tests showed Couch had a blood alcohol content of 0.24, three times the legal limit.      \\"There are absolutely no consequences for what occurred that day,\\" said Boyles.      \\"The primary message has to absolutely be that money and privilege can't buy justice in this country -- that it's not OK to drink and drive and kill four people ... and not have any consequences to that. That's not the American dream that we grew up to participate in.\\"      Couch was sentenced by a juvenile judge Tuesday. Judge Jean Boyd told the court she would not release the teen to his parents, but would work to find Couch a long-term treatment facility.      According to WFAA, defense attorneys asked that Couch be sent to a small, private facility in California. They reportedly said the teen's father would pay the 450,000 price tag.      \\"There is nothing the judge could have done to lessen the suffering for any of those families,\\" said defense attorney Scott Brown, CNN affiliate KTVT reported.      \\"(The judge) fashioned a sentence that is going to keep Ethan under the thumb of the justice system for the next 10 years,\\" he said.      \\"And if Ethan doesn't do what he's supposed to do, if he has one misstep at all, then this judge, or an adult judge when he's transferred, can then incarcerate him.\\" ||||| The bizarre term ‘affluenza’ has touched a nerve across America. And so has the no-jail sentence handed down to a Texas teenager who killed four people and injured several others in a Texas DUI case.      Now the psychologist who coined the term and bestowed 16-year-old Ethan Couch of Fort Worth, Texas, with his best defense to avoid jail-time in the case is regretting his clever word-smithing.      “I wish I had never used the term,” psychologist G. Dick Miller confessed to CNN’s Anderson Cooper Thursday. “Everyone has latched on to it.”      But as the psychologist talked, he only seemed to create more ire associated with his novel diagnosis of ‘affluenza.’ It turns out there was no real science or school of psychological thought behind making money the prime legal defense for an over-privileged teen.      Instead, Miller suggested that the entire nation, the richest in the world, is afflicted with affluenza: Everyone from parents who give their kids too much to obese Americans with too much food to eat.      “We all suffer from affluenza,” Miller declared. “We have a nation doing that.”      Couch received a sentence of ten years’ probation after a judge bought the defense's argument that Couch was a victim of 'affluenza.' Couch’s defense lawyer said the 16-year old was not taught right from wrong by his parents, and that his parents should actually share some of the blame. The teen had faced up to 20 years in prison. Needless to say, the relatives of victims in the case were crushed.      Clearly, over-privilege was at the heart of the case, right from the start. As more reporting emerges about the devastating DUI crash that killed four people emerges, the image of the entitled 16-year-old from a moneyed family grows darker:      Ethan Couch had other arrests leading up to the crash, including for improper possession of alcohol. And according to Couch’s own friends who were in the F-350 Ford pick-up during the crash, the teen knew that his name and family money would get him off right from the start:      Couch is quoted as saying at the terrible accident scene, with bodies flung from vehicles and people dead or dying: “I’m Ethan Couch. I’ll get you out of this.”      On this, he was right.      So what is it about this case that has so touched a nerve across America?      Tell us your take in the comments.            <br>             ||||| Anderson Cooper spent the better part of a half-hour last night grilling Dr. G. Dick Miller, the defense-called psychologist who used the term \\"affluenza\\" in the troubling case of Ethan Couch, the 16-year-old who avoided serving prison time for killing four people in a drunken-driving crash this summer. Above is clip No. 2 of 3 from that interview (you can find all three clips here, but if you only have time for one, No. 2 is probably the one you want).      Josh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.      The interview itself is frustrating, in large part because I'd much rather see Cooper cross-examine Judge Jean Boyd, who is the one who sentenced Couch to 10 years' probation instead of the 20-year prison sentence that prosecutors had asked for. But she has yet to publicly defend her decision, so instead we're left with Miller, who basically argues for the position that we should always err on the side of probation and rehab over prison time.      Advertisement            That's certainly a conversation worth having, but it's not what's causing the outrage over Couch's sentence. Instead the understandable outrcy is over the perception that the relatively lenient sentence was predicated on the fact that the teen's family has lots of money—both because that was the basis for the \\"affluenza\\" defense that more or less claimed Couch didn't know his actions had consequences because he came from privilege, and because his parents are the ones footing the bill for his stay at a 450,000-a-year, in-patient rehab facility near Newport Beach as part of the sentence (a center that Cooper repeatedly, and almost compulsively, points out offers \\"equine therapy.\\")      It's hard to imagine a poor teen being handed the same sentence for committing the same crime, or even a similar one, but this too is a topic that Miller more or less dodges, preventing Cooper from landing the cathartic knockout blow that viewers no doubt were hoping for. (Then again, Miller probably wasn't the best target for that punch anyway.)            Miller also seems to blur his specific \\"affluenza\\" argument when he suggests, more than once, that Couch's is far from a special case. \\"I wish I hadn't used that term. Everyone seems to have hooked onto it,\\" he told Cooper. \\"We used to call these people spoiled brats.\\" There's also the issue that throughout the interview Miller repeatedly suggests that Couch wasn't actually responsible for the deaths of the four people that were killed in the crash. He repeatedly takes issue with Anderson describing their deaths as murders, and even goes as far as to push back against the idea that Couch killed them, granting only: \\"Four people died.\\"      Slate, along with the rest of the Internet, will no doubt have more on this story later, but for now anyone who needs a refresher on the details can find one here.      ***Follow @JoshVoorhees and the rest of the @slatest team on Twitter.*** ||||| Write a summary.","output":"The term \\"affluenza\\" gained national attention when it was used in the defense of 16-year-old Ethan Couch, who was sentenced to 10 years' probation for driving drunk and causing a crash that killed four people.

Looking for their first road victory of the season, the Bills traveled to Soldier Field to take on the second of their four NFC North rivals, the Chicago Bears, in Dick Jauron's first return to Chicago since being fired at the end of the 2003 Chicago Bears season. From the start, Buffalo was in trouble, as Robbie Gould kicked two FGs in the first quarter-- a 42-yarder and a 43-yarder. Then, in the second quarter, three straight scores came from the Bears-- an 8-yard pass from Rex Grossman to Bernard Berrian, a 1-yard run from Cedric Benson and a 15-yard pass from Grossman to Rashied Davis-- that put the Bills in a deep hole.

Step 2: Consider the impact on my decision - Seeing that the reviewer has strong negative opinions about the product, which seems to come from a place of genuine disappointment, it would deter me from purchasing the product. - The fact that they found multiple issues within the product suggests that there might be fundamental flaws, further decreasing my interest in buying it.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. News article: Now, the president's executive order purports to address this gap by extending the Hyde Amendment to these dollars as well. The problem is that, regardless of Obama's stated intentions, he can't actually do this without an act of Congress.      As Dorinda Bordlee, an attorney with the Bioethics Defense Fund, wrote: \\"If a president could do that, there would be no need to have a majority of Congress pass the Hyde Amendment each and every year to prevent abortion funding using Medicaid dollars for low-income government health care. Instead, we could have simply prevailed on each president to issue an executive order saying agencies can't use Medicaid money for abortion. Congress controls the purse strings, not the president. That's Civics 101.\\"      It is telling that the nation's largest abortion provider -- Planned Parenthood -- is claiming \\"victory\\" because \\"we were able to keep the Stupak abortion ban out of the final legislation and President Obama did not include the Stupak language in his executive order.\\"      Several supporters of the bill have argued that this debate is otherwise irrelevant because abortions aren't performed at CHCs. While currently true, this doesn't mean that CHCs wouldn't like to offer abortion among their reproductive services.      Under the new law, they can. There's nothing to stop them.      Here's why. By statute, CHCs are required to provide all \\"required primary health care services,\\" defined to include \\"health services related to . . . obstetrics or gynecology that are furnished by physicians.\\"      Federal courts long have held that when a statute requires provision of health services under such broad categories, then the statute must be construed to include abortion unless it explicitly excludes it. Voilà.      One may believe that poor women should have affordable access to abortion. This is a reasonable position and it is likely to be the result of this bill. But it is not what Americans have been led to believe is true, nor is it what most want. A January Quinnipiac University poll found that 67 percent of Americans oppose public funding for abortion, down from 72 percent in December.      Prediction: Abortions will be performed at community health centers. You can bet your foreclosed mortgage on that. There was always a will by this administration, and now there's a way.      --      In a recent column I wrote that Margaret Chase Smith was the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate. She was the first elected to both houses. The first woman elected to the Senate was Hattie Caraway of Arkansas.      kathleenparker@washpost.com      For more on the debate over abortion and health care, read Rep. Bart Stupak on \\"Why I voted for health-care reform.\\" ||||| When I saw that Kathleen Parker's March 24 op-ed, \\"Stupak's original sin,\\" defined me as a \\"backstabber,\\" it reminded me of a Bible verse. Matthew 7:3 asks, \\"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?\\"      The true motives of many blogs and organizations claiming to be pro-life have become clear in recent days: to politicize life issues as a means to defeat health care reform. One group even sent an e-mail to supporters saying they are \\"working feverishly to stop this legislation from going forward.\\"      The pro-life groups rallied behind me -- many without my knowledge or consent -- not necessarily because they shared my goals of ensuring protections for life and passing health-care reform but because they viewed me as their best chance to kill health-care legislation.      Last November, an amendment I introduced succeeded in making sure the House health-care-reform bill contained the current law prohibiting public funding for abortions. I was disappointed that the Senate could not pass my language and only mustered 45 pro-life votes, far short of the 60 votes needed to keep the amendment intact.      Many of my Democratic pro-life colleagues and I worked tirelessly in the days leading up to the final House vote on health-care reform to strengthen the legislation's restrictions on abortion funding. We proposed numerous procedural and legislative options, but ultimately all of our efforts required the 60 votes we could not obtain in the Senate.      Once it was clear that the House leadership would eventually obtain the 216 votes necessary to pass health-care reform, I was left with a choice: Vote against the bill and watch it become law with no further protections for life or reach an agreement that prevents federal funding for abortions.      Therefore, I and other pro-life Democrats struck an agreement with President Obama to issue an executive order that would ensure all Hyde Amendment protections would apply to the health-care reform bill. No, an executive order is not as strong as the statutory language we fought for at the start. We received, however, an \\"ironclad\\" commitment from the president that no taxpayer dollars will be used to pay for abortions.      Throughout history, executive orders have carried the full force and effect of law and have served as an important means of implementing public policy. Perhaps the most famous executive order was the Emancipation Proclamation signed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863. More recently, in 2007, President George W. Bush signed Executive Order 13435, restricting embryonic stem-cell research. This executive order protected the sanctity of life and was \\"applauded\\" and \\"welcomed\\" by pro-life advocates. That these same people would now claim that President Obama's executive order maintaining the sanctity of life is not worth the paper it is written on is disingenuous at best.      Some, including Parker, have criticized Obama's executive order as unenforceable in the courts and therefore just a \\"fig leaf.\\" Yet the language that critics point to is standard language with any executive order, including Bush's ban on embryonic stem-cell research. Again, many of these pro-life groups did not express concern over the Bush language but claim it is unacceptable under Obama.      To further protect against federal funding for abortion, during floor debate on the health-care reform bill I engaged in a colloquy with Rep. Henry Waxman to make clear congressional intent that the provisions in the bill, combined with the executive order, will ensure that outcome. Such colloquies are often referred to in court cases when an attempt is being made to determine Congress's intent. This, too, was no minor concession by those opposed to our efforts, and it is a tremendous victory for those protecting the sanctity of life.      I have said from the start that my goal was to see health-care reform pass while maintaining the long-standing principle of the sanctity of life. The president's executive order upholds this principle and current law that no federal funds be used for abortion. I and other pro-life Democrats are pleased that we were able to hold true to our principles and vote for a bill that is pro-life at every stage of life and that provides 32 million Americans with access to high-quality, affordable health care.      The writer is a Democratic representative from Michigan. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"The president's executive order attempts to extend the Hyde Amendment to cover the funding gap for abortions. However, this cannot be done without an act of Congress. Community Health Centers (CHCs) don't currently perform abortions, but under the new law, nothing stops them from offering abortion among their reproductive services. Significant debate has arisen as abortion isn't explicitly excluded from CHCs, potentially allowing them to provide the service under broad categories. A majority of Americans oppose public funding for abortion, but this new legislation could lead to an increase in abortions performed at CHCs. Pro-life groups have expressed concern that the executive order may not be enforceable and merely a \\"fig leaf.\\" Meanwhile, pro-life Democrats remain committed to working toward health care reform while upholding the sanctity of life. The president's order aims to maintain current law and prevent the use of federal funds for abortion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Who was Robin Hood's second in command????","output":"To find out who Robin Hood's second in command was, I will follow these steps: 1. Identify the source material: Robin Hood is a legendary character from English folklore, who is commonly depicted as an outlaw who steals from the rich and gives to the poor. The stories of Robin Hood have been adapted and retold in various forms throughout history, with different versions of the legends existing. 2. Examine the source material: While the earliest ballads, such as \\"Robin Hood and the Monk\\" and \\"Robin Hood and the Potter,\\" do not mention a specific second in command, later tales consistently feature Little John as Robin Hood's right-hand man and most trusted companion. 3. Analyze the character: Little John is known for his loyalty, honesty, and impressive fighting skills. Standing tall at approximately seven feet, he is said to wield a large quarterstaff as his weapon of choice. Together, Robin Hood and Little John face numerous adventures and challenges in their quest to help the impoverished. 4. Verify with other sources: A look at various adaptations of the Robin Hood legend, from movies and television shows to novels and comics, confirms that Little John is typically portrayed as Robin Hood's second in command. This includes popular adaptations such as the 1938 film \\"The Adventures of Robin Hood,\\" the 1960s British TV series \\"Robin Hood,\\" and the 1993 film \\"Robin Hood: Men in Tights.\\" Conclusion: Based on my analysis of the source material and the consistency of Little John's role across various adaptations, it is appropriate to conclude that Robin Hood's second in command was Little John."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

If you do not have a serger, then you could fold over the edges of your scarf fabric by about 0.5 inches (1.3 cm) and then sew a zigzag stitch along the edges to secure them.

Information:  - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions.  - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk).  - Andinichthyidae is a prehistoric family of catfishes from the Cretaceous of South America .  - Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example).  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Hospital emergency rooms treat injured fingers all the time. Without treatment, a bad cut can lead to permanent damage. But how should a person know when a bleeding cut is serious enough to require medical attention? We asked Dr Martin Brown, chairman of the department of emergency medicine at Inova Alexandria Hospital in Virginia. First, the medical term for a cut or tear in the skin is a laceration(,). Dr Brown says the length is usually not as important as the depth. He says a long cut on a finger can likely be treated without a visit to a doctor if the wound is not very deep. \\"If you have a short but deep laceration where there's been a structure underneath that's been damaged - a tendon, a nerve, a blood vessel,\\" says Martin, \\"it may, in fact, need professional attention.\\" Some injuries - like a fingertip that gets cut off - might even require surgery to repair. That requires a specialist to either file  down the bone or _ the fingertip. More often, filing down the bone is what is done because reattaching a fingertip is often not successful. How a wound bleeds can be a sign of how serious it is. Minor cuts usually produce what is known as venous   bleeding. This means the blood flows steadily from the injury. The bleeding will often stop when pressure is put on the wound. Dr Brown says in most cases holding direct pressure with clean gauze or a cloth for four to five minutes should stop the bleeding. With a cut finger, holding the hand above the heart can reduce the loss of blood. But if a cut appears to be pumping blood out with some force, this may be a sign of arterial  bleeding. This kind of injury should be treated by a medical professional as soon as possible. Even a cut that does not require medical attention must be kept clean to prevent infection. Small cuts should be cleaned gently with clean water. Use a washcloth to clean the area if the wound is dirty. Dr Brown says cuts should be covered with a clean, dry bandage. Options: A a finger cut without treatment can lead to permanent damage B the length of a cut on a finger is more important than the depth C a long but not very deep cut often doesn't need professional attention D a short but deep laceration that has been damaged need professional attention. Answer: C a long but not very deep cut often doesn't need professional attention Question: The answer to this question is:","output":"According to Dr. Martin Brown, when might a finger cut not require professional medical attention? A. If a finger cut is left untreated, it can lead to permanent damage. B. If the length of a cut on a finger is more important than the depth. C. If a cut on a finger is long but not very deep. D.

Unbeknownst to the town, Pender possesses a hidden talent - he can communicate with the spirits of the deceased. Pender has grown disillusioned with the world and often turns to these spirits for solace, wisdom, and friendship. One fateful day, Pender unwittingly uncovers a dark secret while restoring a 19th-century dresser. Hidden within the dresser, he discovers a letter that reveals a murder in the town's past that remains unsolved. The revelation consumes Pender, who embarks on a journey to uncover the truth behind the crime. Complicating matters further, the spirit of the murder victim begins to communicate with Pender. Desperate for closure, the spirit shares clues but reveals that the murderer will not be found unless Pender overcomes his fear of interacting with the living members of the community. It's a race against time; as the spirit grows weaker, so does the possibility of solving the mystery. As Pender delves deeper into the past murder case, he forms unlikely friendships with three of the town's misfits: Claire, a rebellious, down-to-earth photographer working to restore her family's reputation, Alejandro, a laid-back surf instructor haunted by a traumatic past, and Janet, a witty and sarcastic diner waitress who enjoys studying Seaview's convoluted history in her spare time. Together, the unlikely foursome uncovers a conspiracy involving three prominent families in the town, revealing that the murder was not an isolated event but part of a dark web of interconnected crimes and deceit.

Background: A Night at the Opera is the fourth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 21 November 1975 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and by Elektra Records in the United States. Produced by Roy Thomas Baker and Queen, it was the most expensive album ever recorded at the time of its release. The album takes its name from the Marx Brothers film of the same name, which the band watched one night at the studio complex when recording. A Night at the Opera incorporates a wide range of styles, including ballads, songs in a music hall style, hard rock tracks and progressive rock influences. Context: \\"Death on Two Legs\\" can be referred to as Freddie Mercury's hate letter to Queen's first manager, Norman Sheffield, who for some years was reputed to have mistreated the band and abused his role as their manager from 1972 to 1975. Sheffield denied the allegations in his 2013 autobiography entitled \\"Life on Two Legs: Set The Record Straight\\", and referred to copies of the original 1972 management contracts between Sheffield and Queen, which were included in the book as proof of his defence. Though the song never makes direct reference to him, after listening to a playback of the song at Trident Studios during the time of album release, Sheffield was appalled, and sued the band and the record label for defamation, which resulted in an out-of-court settlement, but also confirmed his connection to the song.  During live performances, Mercury would usually rededicate the song to \\"a real motherfucker of a gentleman\\", although this line was censored on the version that appeared on their Live Killers album in 1979. Other than on the live album, he said it was dedicated to a \\"motherfucker I used to know\\".  In the Classic Albums documentary about the making of A Night at the Opera, Brian May stated that the band was somewhat taken aback at first by the bitterness of Mercury's lyrics, and described by Mercury as being \\"so vindictive that he [May] felt bad singing it\\". After the song came together, it was agreed that the \\"author should have his way\\", and the song was recorded as written.  As with \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", most of the guitar parts on this song were initially played on piano by Mercury, to demonstrate to May how they needed to be played on guitar. \\"Death on Two Legs\\" remained on the setlist until, and well into, The Game Tour in 1980, and was then dropped. However, the piano introduction was played during the Hot Space and Works tours.  \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" is amongst Roger Taylor's most famous songs in the Queen catalogue. The song was initially taken as a joke by May, who thought that Taylor was not serious when he heard a demo recording.  Taylor played the guitars in the original demo, but they were later re-recorded by May on his Red Special. The lead vocals were performed by Taylor on the studio version, and all released live versions. The revving sounds at the conclusion of the song were recorded by Taylor's then current car, an Alfa Romeo. The lyrics were inspired by one of the band's roadies, Johnathan Harris, whose Triumph TR4 was evidently the \\"love of his life\\". The song is dedicated to him, the album says: \\"Dedicated to Johnathan Harris, boy racer to the end\\".  When it came down to releasing the album's first single, Taylor was so fond of his song that he urged Mercury (author of the first single, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\") to allow it to be the B-side and reportedly locked himself in a cupboard until Mercury agreed. This decision would later become the cause of much internal friction in the band, in that while it was only the B-side, it generated an equal amount of publishing royalties for Taylor as the main single did for Mercury.  The song was often played live during the 1977-81 period. Taylor sang it from the drums while Mercury played piano and provided backing vocals. It was played in the Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour in 2005 and the Rock the Cosmos Tour in 2008. Taylor would again play the song for his concerts with The Cross and solo tours, where instead of drums he played rhythm guitar.  \\"'39\\" was May's attempt to do \\"sci-fi skiffle\\". \\"'39\\" relates the tale of a group of space explorers who embark on what is, from their perspective, a year-long voyage. Upon their return, however, they realise that a hundred years have passed, because of the time dilation effect in Einstein's special theory of relativity, and the loved ones they left behind are now all dead or aged.  May sings the song on the album, with backing vocals by Mercury and Taylor. During live performances, Mercury sang the lead vocal. May had asked bassist John Deacon to play double bass as a joke but a couple of days later he found Deacon in the studio with the instrument, and he had already learned to play it.  Since Queen had named their albums A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races after two of the Marx Brothers' most popular films, surviving brother Groucho Marx invited Queen to visit him at his Los Angeles home in March 1977 (five months before he died). The band thanked him, and performed \\"'39\\" a cappella.  George Michael performed \\"'39\\" at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert on 20 April 1992. Michael cited this song as his favourite Queen song, claiming he used to busk it on the London Underground.  Recently, Queen have included the song on the setlists of their recent tours with Adam Lambert  and before Adam with Paul Rodgers; for all these tours since 2005 it is sung as it is on the album by May.

Three central concepts were derived from the 1st Amendment which became America's doctrine for church-state separation: no coercion in religious matters, no expectation to support a religion against one's will, and religious liberty encompasses all religions. In sum, citizens are free to embrace or reject a faith, any support for religion - financial or physical - must be voluntary, and all religions are equal in the eyes of the law with no special preference or favoritism.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the given passage, the answer to the question \\"Which of the following is not a form of support for religion: financial, central, or physical?\\" is central.

Given the question: Information:  - John W. Rosa Jr. ( born September 28 , 1951 ) is a retired United States Air Force Lieutenant General currently serving as President of The Citadel in Charleston , South Carolina . While on active duty , Rosa also served as the sixteenth Superintendent of the United States Air Force Academy .  - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function.  - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775.  - Charleston is the oldest and second-largest city in the U.S. state of South Carolina, the county seat of Charleston County, and the principal city in the CharlestonNorth CharlestonSummerville Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city lies just south of the geographical midpoint of South Carolina's coastline and is located on Charleston Harbor, an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean formed by the confluence of the Ashley and Cooper Rivers. Charleston had an estimated population of 132,609 in 2015. The population of the Charleston metropolitan area, comprising Berkeley, Charleston, and Dorchester Counties, was counted by the 2015 estimate at 727,689the third-largest in the stateand the 78th-largest metropolitan statistical area in the United States.  - The National Security Act of 1947 was a major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following World War II. The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the Senate confirmed James Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense.  - The United States Air Force Academy (also known as USAFA or the Air Force Academy), is a military academy for officer cadets of the United States Air Force. Its campus is located in the western United States in Colorado, immediately north of Colorado Springs in El Paso County.  - Colorado is a state in the United States encompassing most of the Southern Rocky Mountains as well as the northeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau and the western edge of the Great Plains. Colorado is part of the Western United States, the Southwestern United States, and the Mountain States. Colorado is the 8th most extensive and the 22nd most populous of the 50 United States. The United States Census Bureau estimates that the population of Colorado was 5,456,574 on July 1, 2015, an increase of 8.50% since the 2010 United States Census.  - A military academy or service academy (in \\"American English\\") is an educational institution which prepares candidates for service in the officer corps of the army, the navy, marine corps, air force or coast guard. It normally provides education in a military environment, the exact definition depending on the country concerned.  - The United States Air Force (USAF) is the aerial warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven American uniformed services. Initially part of the United States Army, the USAF was formed as a separate branch of the military on 18 September 1947 under the National Security Act of 1947. It is the most recent branch of the U.S. military to be formed, and is the largest and one of the world's most technologically advanced air forces. The USAF articulates its core functions as Nuclear Deterrence Operations, Special Operations, Air Superiority, Global Integrated ISR, Space Superiority, Command and Control, Cyberspace Superiority, Personnel Recovery, Global Precision Attack, Building Partnerships, Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - Aerial warfare is the use of military aircraft and other flying machines in warfare. Aerial warfare includes bombers attacking enemy concentrations or strategic targets; fighter aircraft battling for control of airspace; attack aircraft engaging in close air support against ground targets; naval aviation flying against sea and nearby land targets; gliders, helicopters and other aircraft to carry airborne forces such as paratroopers; aerial refueling tankers to extend operation time or range; and military transport aircraft to move cargo and personnel. Historically, military aircraft have included lighter-than-air balloons carrying artillery observers; lighter-than-air airships for bombing cities; various sorts of reconnaissance, surveillance and early warning aircraft carrying observers, cameras and radar equipment; torpedo bombers to attack enemy shipping; and military air-sea rescue aircraft for saving downed airmen. Modern aerial warfare includes missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles. Surface forces are likely to respond to enemy air activity with anti-aircraft warfare.  - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - The Charleston Harbor is an inlet (8 sq mi/20.7 km²) of the Atlantic Ocean at Charleston, South Carolina. The inlet is formed by the junction of Ashley and Cooper rivers at . Morris and Sullivan's Islands shelter the entrance. Charleston Harbor is part of the Intracoastal Waterway.  - A cadet is a trainee. The term is frequently used to refer to those training to become an officer in the military, often a person who is a junior trainee. Its meaning may vary between countries. The term is also used in civilian contexts and as a general attributive, for example in its original sense of a branch of a ruling house which is not currently in the direct line of succession.

I was amazed no traffic, extremely affordable housing market, friendly, helpful and caring people and trees as far as the eyes could see. It was top 3 places I had lived in this country. After the Tech boom peaked near 2000 and after 9/11 the flood gates opened and people spilled in from all over the Earth for the bountiful opportunities. The housing market skyrocketed and people were tripling++ the values of their homes. It is now home to some of the wealthiest counties in the US. Why is this all relevant? All the prosperity brought greed, selfishness and gluttony to a whole new level. People had massive disposable income they had never had before. Nothing is too grossly indulgent anymore and they throw away vast amounts of money trying to one up the last kids party without giving a thought to what a kid needs or the fact they are teaching kids that over indulgence is okay.

For guidance in practical application of Jewish law, the majority of Orthodox Jews appeal to the Shulchan Aruch (\\"Code of Jewish Law\\" composed in the 16th century by Rabbi Joseph Caro) together with its surrounding commentaries. Thus, at a general level, there is a large degree of uniformity amongst all Orthodox Jews.

Biographers Morecambe and Stirling believe that Cary Grant was the \\"greatest leading man Hollywood had ever known\\". Schickel stated that there are \\"very few stars who achieve the magnitude of Cary Grant, art of a very high and subtle order\\", and thought that he was the \\"best star actor there ever was in the movies\\". David Thomson and directors Stanley Donen and Howard Hawks concurred that Grant was the greatest and most important actor in the history of the cinema. He was a favorite of Hitchcock, who admired him and called him \\"the only actor I ever loved in my whole life\\", and remained one of Hollywood's top box-office attractions for almost 30 years. Wansell wrote: \\"To millions of movie-goers around the world, Cary Grant will forever epitomize the glamour, and the style, of Hollywood in its golden years. With his dark hair, and even darker eyes, mischievous smile and effortless elegance, he was, is, and always will be indelibly one of the great movie stars. Since his death in 1986, the incandescence of his screen image has not dimmed for a single moment\\". Kael stated that the world still thinks of him affectionately, because he \\"embodies what seems a happier time-a time when we had a simpler relationship to a performer.\\"  Grant was nominated for two Academy Awards, for Penny Serenade (1941) and None But the Lonely Heart (1944), but never won a competitive Oscar; he received a special Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1970. The inscription on his statuette read \\"To Cary Grant, for his unique mastery of the art of screen acting with respect and affection of his colleagues\\". On being presented with the award, his friend Frank Sinatra announced: \\"It was made for the sheer brilliance of acting ... No one has brought more pleasure to more people for so many years than Cary has, and nobody has done so many things so well\\".  At the Straw Hat Awards in New York in May 1975, Grant was awarded a special plaque which recognized the city's appreciation of him as a \\"star and superstar in entertainment\\". The following August, he was invited by Betty Ford to give a speech at the Republican National Convention in Kansas City and to attend the Bicentenary dinner for Queen Elizabeth II at the White House that same year. He was later invited in 1978 to attend a royal charity gala at the London Palladium. In 1979, Grant hosted the American Film Institute's tribute to Alfred Hitchcock, and presented Laurence Olivier with his honorary Oscar.  In 1981, Grant was accorded the Kennedy Center Honors. Three years later, a theatre on the MGM lot was renamed the \\"Cary Grant Theatre\\". In 1995, when over a hundred leading film directors were asked to reveal their favorite actor of all time in a Time Out poll, Grant came second only to Marlon Brando. On December 7, 2001, a statue of Grant was unveiled in Millennium Square, a regenerated area next to Bristol Harbour, Bristol, in the city where he was born. In November 2005, Grant again came first in Premiere magazine's list of \\"The 50 Greatest Movie Stars of All Time\\".

A war hero praised for his bravery in Iraq died after being buried under an avalanche while on a skiing training exercise. Senior Aircraftman Paul Mahoney, 26, who had been one of the last British servicemen to leave Iraq, was taking part in a training trip in the German Alps in preparation for deployment in Afghanistan with 15 Squadron of the RAF Regiment. The exercise, named 'Snow Eagle' was designed to expose servicemen to hostile terrains and during one descent, SAC Mahoney and two of his comrades were engulfed by a snow slide. While the other two were rescued, SAC Mahoney was buried and, by the time he was dragged clear nine minutes later, was dead. Senior Aircraftman Paul Mahoney was praised for his service as a gunner in Basra during his six month tour in Iraq. After the incident, on February 4, 2010, a major investigation was launched and the leader of the expedition, Flight Sgt Stephen Henderson, was charged with manslaugher - although later cleared at a court martial. It was alleged Flt Sgt Henderson failed to comply with safety regulations and ignored avalanche warnings when he led the 23 serviceman down a slope. However, an inquest into SAC Mahoney's death, held at Warrington Coroners' Court yesterday, recorded a verdict of accidental death. On the morning of the tragedy, the inquest heard Flt Sgt Henderson, who was leading the trip along with four other qualified instructors, was warned about poor weather conditions and that a level three avalanche warning - out of a possible five levels - had been issued for the area. However, he evaluated the slopes and decided the expedition should go ahead. The group left the Grasgehren ski resort in Bavaria, Germany, with the plan of climbing the Reidberger Horn mountain and then skiing down to a hut where they would spend the night. SAC Mahoney had been in the RAF for two years at the time of his death. It was on the descent that the group heard a 'woomph' sound, indicating that a weak layer of snow had collapsed beneath the surface. However, while Flt Sgt Henderson sent some students back to the ridge, he concluded the snowpack was stable and the group could continue. Two instructors stayed at the top and the students descended at 20 metre intervals with everyone intending to meet at the bottom. The avalanche struck while the group was halfway down the slope. The inquest heard that the slide was caused by sun and wind conditions, although the earlier court martial was told that it could have been triggered by the serviceman skiing over the unstable service in too large groups. Many. of the 23 servicemen were either at the bottom or within their final. stages of descent when the 400 metres wide and 200 metres long. avalanche hit. Along with SAC Mahoney, SAC Shepherd and Cpl Murray were also caught up in the collapse. SAC. Shepherd was only buried up to his waist and managed for free himself and while Cpl Murray was completely covered apart from his hand, he was quickly pulled free. SAC Mahoney was 'completely buried' and it took nine minutes later to find him, by which point he was not breathing. His comrades tried to revive him and rescue helicopters were sent to the scene but SAC Mahoney was declared dead on the mountainside. Paul Mahoney's, centre, family said they knew 'how proud he was about being in the RAF regiment' SAC Mahoney was only 26 when he died in 2010, shortly before he was due to be deployed in Afghanistan. During Flt Sgt Henderson’s court martial his legal team said that 'backcountry skiing' involved an element of risk-taking and that the he had viewed the slope as shallow and not avalanche prone. Chris. Hill, defence counsel, said: 'This is adventurous training and not a. leisure facility. The purpose was to make a journey and hopefully get to. the next hut,' he said, adding that 'rules are not to be adhered to. slavishly.' At. the end of the four-week court martial in July 2012, the six-member. board acquitted Flt Sgt Henderson. Two other servicemen were caught in the avalanche, but were pulled out in time. It was nine minutes before SAC Mahoney was dragged clear of the snow, by which point he had died. SAC Mahoney had driven armoured vehicles in Basra and was one of the last British servicemen to leave Iraq. At the time of his death, SAC Mahoney - who had joined the armed forces in 2008 - was praised as a 'brave and determined' gunner who had been one of the last British servicemen to leave Iraq. He had been driving Bulldog armoured vehicles on patrols in Basra. The RAF Regiment is the ground fighting force of the RAF, providing security for bases and carrying out patrol functions. In a statement released by his family at the time of his death they said: 'We wish to convey how proud we were of him and we knew how proud he was about being in the RAF Regiment. He was \\"one of the lads\\" who was always there for his mates.' Paying tribute to SAC Mahoney the RAF said: 'He kept us safe as he steered his armoured vehicle through the outskirts of Basrah. 'He lived life to the full and has been taken from us unexpectedly and far too early. 'Our thoughts are with his family and close friends at this difficult time. 'He will not be forgotten and his memory will live on in the hearts and minds of 15 Squadron RAF Regiment.' A full. service inquiry was also carried out in the aftermath of SAC Mahoney’s. death by the Ministry of Defence which has since made eight. recommendations in relation to the Snow Eagle exercise and seven. recommendations in relation to the wider conduct of service training. The inquest was told that 11 of the recommendations had been fully implemented and a further four were underway. A Ministry of Defence spokesman told MailOnline: 'Our thoughts remain with SAC Mahoney’s family and friends at this difficult time. 'A full Service Inquiry has been conducted, and all the recommendations from this have been or are in the process of being implemented, so that we can prevent something like this from ever happening again.'

Article: After months of promo and buzz, we finally get to see the fruits of Caitlyn Jenner’s work as executive producer on I Am Cait, the docu-series telling her story.      Here’s more Caitlyn: teal hair extensions, (sometimes) makeup-free and emotionally raw.      It opens with a very candid Caitlyn. It’s 4:30 a.m., she’s not wearing makeup and she’s feeling a little stressed.      “What a responsibility I have to this community,” she sighs with a bit of fear in her voice. “I just hope I get it right”      She’s very clear about her role: an educator and an advocate. She turns the mirror a bit away from her and showcases the issues: More murders, exponentially higher rates of suicide, throes of misunderstanding … and no contract with E! to publicly share their stories.      Not everyone has that type of platform or the money for new clothes or cosmetic surgeries and she gets that. She just wants help in whatever way she can – for now, that means becoming comfortable with herself.      A nervous Caitlyn still needs to meet some of her family:      “A very good looking woman”      We’ve seen and heard a lot from Caitlyn’s mother, Esther, over the past few months. She was part of that Diane Sawyer interview and she moved everyone to tears at the ESPYs. But here we see her off guard.      It was the first time she’s seen her child since Bruce became Caitlyn and the tension was a bit thick. She was coming over, with daughters Lisa and Pam by her side, for her birthday.      Hands twitching nervously, Caitlyn greets everyone with a big hello.      “I thought you were going to look more like me,” Pam says. Oh Pam, you slay us.      Long, flowing locks of teal      Daughter Kylie, hoping to surprise Caitlyn, shows up at her house unannounced with a special surprise: teal hair extensions.      This is the first time they’re meeting in person and Caitlyn, clad in a fluffy white robe, is shocked to see her. Immediately, she goes in for the sweetest hug.      They both go over to see Esther, who’s getting her makeup done.      Three generations of women together. Such a small moment, sure, but a very beautiful one. (And, yes, the teal works.)      A photo posted by King Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Jun 30, 2015 at 2:54pm PDT      A mother’s confessions      In a sit down between just Esther and Caitlyn, things are little more somber.      “It’s not easy,” Esther repeats a few times. She’s having a bit more of a difficult time switching from “he” to “she” when she refers to her child. Admittedly, that seems like a tough mental hurdle.      The biggest thing Esther has noticed, however, is how much freer Caitlyn is than Bruce. Their relationship was lacking before because “he wasn’t comfortable” as he was. That’s changed — while Caitlyn’s “soul and values” have not.      \\"I loved him with all my heart and I certainly love her with all my heart.” – Esther Jenner #IAmCait https://t.co/BJ5uW4NWtH — I Am Cait (@IAmCait) July 27, 2015      Yeezy’s in the house      Spotted: The series’ first Kardashian.

Now, it’s off to the closet (sans Kanye) where Kim goes all fashion diva and pokes through the wardrobe. What does she find? Nothing, just a dress that both Caitlyn and her mom Kris Jenner own.      Remembering Kyler Prescott      To close the episode, Caitlyn remembers Kyler Prescott, a trans teen who killed himself at just 14. She pays a visit, with an offer of friendship, to Prescott’s family and the two speak about Kyler’s journey.      His mom reveals just how devastating her son’s loss is — his new birth certificate with the corrected gender came just days after his death.      Caitlyn goes on to attend a memorial, ending the show with a hauntingly beautiful tribute to the fallen teen. ||||| The seed for Wide00014 was:      - Slash pages from every domain on the web:                  -- a ranking of all URLs that have more than one incoming inter-domain link (rank was determined by number of incoming links using Wide00012 inter domain links)            -- up to a maximum of 100 most highly ranked URLs per domain      - Top ranked pages (up to a max of 100) from every linked-to domain using the Wide00012 inter-domain navigational link graph |||||Summary:","output":"Caitlyn Jenner has made a TV show called \\"I Am Cait\\" to share her story.

I know the songs, I love the characters and I love the story. I can't say anything like that about The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea. It was terrible. Let's start with the story. The plot was a reversed copy of the first movie. Same situations, except in reverse! Ariel wanted to live on land, her daughter Melody (creative name) wants to live in the sea. Ariel was tricked by Ursula, Melody is tricked by Ursula's sister, Morgana. Ursula had a sister?? Not sure where that came from. Besides being a strange copy of the first movie, this movies plot seemed tired and was uninteresting compared to the first movie. Now the characters: 1. Ariel- What happened to her??!! No longer the spunky, headstrong teenager we all knew and loved from the first movie, she has now \\"grown up\\" and her personality went down the drain. Her singing voice wasn't as strong either, due to either Jodi Benson being a lot older, or the songs being so terrible that her talent was wasted. 2. Prince Eric- While he didn't have a lot of personality in the first movie, like all Disney princes, somehow his new voice and his very few lines made him even more robotic. To top it off, he just can't seem to defend himself, and Ariel becomes the tough one of the two. 3. Sebastian- Say goodbye to the lovable crustacean from the first movie, because a whiny, aggravating little crab just took his place. He also had no good songs in this movie. You can almost forget the glory he earned from singing the incredible \\"Under the Sea\\" and \\"Kiss the Girl\\" from the first movie, and it is very sad. 4. Flounder- They destroyed him!! He is not cute anymore, his voice is terrible, and he has kids now?? Who's the mother??? 5. Morgana- She appears to be Ursula's sister out for revenge against her mother, who always picked Ursula over her. So she plans to get King Triton's trident to become the new ruler of the sea. Sound familiar? Anyway, she's a very cliché villain and falls short of Ursula's greatness as a villain. She epically fails at witchcraft, she's not very tough, and not threatening at all. 6.Melody- Ariel and Eric's daughter. Ironic name because she, unlike Ariel, can't sing. Her voice is annoying, her friends (a walrus and a penguin?? Really?!) are not funny or likable, and she's exactly the same as Ariel, in reverse and not as likable. Skip this one.

Washington (CNN) -- They are the nation's first African-American President and attorney general, so Barack Obama and Eric Holder always were going to face extra scrutiny over their approach to racially charged issues. Conservative critics howled when Obama said in 2009 that police acted \\"stupidly\\" in arresting black Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates outside his home. Holder prompted a similar outcry earlier that year when he called America a \\"nation of cowards\\" about racial issues. Now past the two-thirds mark of the Obama presidency, the pair have avoided such loaded language in response to the August 9 shooting death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown by a white police officer in suburban St. Louis. \\"But in terms of what he is actually saying to the","output":"American public, Obama and Holder have not shied away from addressing the racial tensions and issues surrounding Brown's death and its aftermath. They have called for a thorough and transparent investigation, stressing the importance of not jumping to conclusions and allowing the legal process to take its course. As protests and unrest continued in the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, the President and Holder focused on encouraging open dialogue between law enforcement and the community to foster understanding and help rebuild trust. Holder even personally visited Ferguson, meeting with local leaders, law enforcement, and residents to listen to their concerns and reassure them of the federal government's commitment to ensuring justice. In the months that followed, the grand jury's decision not to indict the white police officer Darren Wilson sparked further protests and reignited the national debate on race and policing. The Department of Justice conducted its own investigation into the Ferguson Police Department, uncovering patterns of racial bias and discriminatory practices. With the support of the Obama administration, Holder announced a series of reforms aimed at addressing these issues, including increased federal oversight of local law enforcement, improved police training, and a renewed focus on community policing. These measures were intended to promote accountability, bridge the gap between the police and the communities they serve, and ultimately create a more just and equitable society. The legacy of Obama and Holder's approach to racial issues would continue to be debated long after they left office. Some critics argued that they had inflamed racial tensions and failed to adequately support law enforcement, while others praised them for initiating much-needed conversations and reforms. Regardless of the different opinions, it was undeniable that their time in office had brought the long-standing issue of racial disparities in the American justice system to the forefront of public consciousness, setting the stage for further discussions and potential future changes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Rick Santorum has raised just over 1 million since his eight-vote loss in Iowa last night, his top strategist tells POLITICO.      John Brabender, who revealed that their server briefly went down under the crush last night, said almost all of the cash came online.      This is the kind of fund-raising, coming less than 24 hours since the caucuses began, that Santorum will need to ramp up his TV presence and organization.      Read more about: Rick Santorum, 2012 Eelctions ||||| Rick Santorum's powerful finish in the Iowa caucus is bringing fresh attention to his tenure in Congress, including ethics questions that dogged him about a preferred mortgage he received from a bank run by campaign donors, and federal funds that went to a real estate developer who backed his charity.      One of the top donors to Santorum's charity was also the beneficiary of an 8 million Santorum-sponsored federal earmark, according to published reports. Melanie Sloan, a former federal prosecutor who filed an ethics complaint against Santorum in 2006 on behalf of a watchdog group, said her organization's website received a tidal wave of visitors in the past 24 hours, and in an interview she said she believes people will discover that the GOP presidential contender is \\"hardly the moral paragon he purports to be.\\"      \\"There were several instances in which Santorum appeared to have taken campaign contributions in direct exchange for legislative assistance,\\" said Sloan, whose organization, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), spent months investigating Santorum's activities while he was in office. \\"He violated Senate gift rules by accepting a mortgage from a bank in which he had no interest and which otherwise made loans only to its own investors.\\"      Santorum has rarely responded to such attacks, but at one point he wrote a letter to a Philadelphia newspaper criticizing the ethics complaints as a series of \\"disingenuous innuendo and half-truths.\\" The Senate Committee on Ethics never responded to CREW's complaint, and the two-term senator left Congress in 2007 after losing a reelection bid. A Santorum campaign spokesman has not yet responded to phone messages and email requests for comment.      For months, Santorum's record and background have escaped presidential-caliber scrutiny from rivals and reporters because he never appeared to have traction with voters in the early Republican contests. But as Santorum's GOP rivals have learned, the national spotlight can be searing. Questions about Newt Gingrich's consulting work for Fannie Mae surfaced in attack ads against him. Herman Cain bowed out of the race after reports of sexual harassment complaints dogged him for weeks. If the pattern holds true as the winnowed GOP field heads from Iowa down the rural roads of New Hampshire, Santorum will be the latest to undergo intensified scrutiny from rival campaigns and from the national media.      Perhaps the most jarring detail from his tenure in office is the unorthodox 500,000 mortgage that Santorum and his wife secured on the home in rural Virginia they had purchased for 643,361. According to a series of reports in the Philadelphia Daily News, the mortgage came from Philadelphia Trust Company, a fledgling private bank catering to \\"affluent investors and institutions\\" whose officers had contributed 24,000 to Santorum's political action committees and re-election campaign.      In advertising, the lender said it only offered its preferred rates to well-heeled borrowers who also used their investment services. But Santorum's public disclosure forms showed he did not have the required minimum 250,000 in liquid assets and was not an investor with Philadelphia Trust. His ability to secure the five-year loan led Sloan to file a complaint under a Senate ethics rule that specifically prohibits members from accepting a loan on terms not available to members of the general public. At the time, a Santorum spokeswoman told the Daily News that the mortgage terms were set at \\"market rates,\\" but did not provide further comment.      After leaving Congress in 2007, Santorum sold the house for 850,000.      Santorum Charity Backer Got Federal Earmark      The other issue that captivated Santorum critics involved a non-profit charity called Operation Good Neighbor. Santorum founded the organization to \\"illustrate compassionate conservatism\\" but did not take a formal role in its day-to-day operations. The charity was run by his campaign staffers. It operated out of the same building as his campaign headquarters. And its board included several top Washington, D.C. lobbyists who had clients with millions of dollars in business before the U.S. Senate, according to a 2006 report by WTAE, the ABC News affiliate in Pittsburgh.      The chairman of Operation Good Neighbor was Michael O'Neill, CEO of Preferred Real Estate. The company was involved in a waterfront development in Chester, Pa., that, with Santorum's help, benefitted from more than 8 million in federal grants, according to local reports.      O'Neill told ABC News that accusations suggesting the charity work and his development were connected were \\"crazy.\\"      \\"My answer is absolutely not,\\" said O'Neill, who is now out of the real estate business. \\"I was never told, 'If you do this, we'll help with that.'

Santorum also defended the federal grants in a letter to the Philadelphia Daily News, saying his efforts to win federal money for O'Neill's waterfront development represented \\"a prime example of how, when used appropriately, earmarks can be beneficial.\\"      \\"When Preferred Real Estate became interested in investing in the region, specifically in the revitalization of a blighted former generating plant, I was ecstatic -- this was exactly the type of project that could kick off a full-scale economic rebirth and help combat poverty,\\" he wrote. \\"So, working with the city, I helped bring federal money to improve access to the riverfront, renovating roads like Route 291 and Highland Avenue, as well as to better the environment of the riverfront, making it a more attractive place for Pennsylvanians to work and live.\\"      Click Here to Sign Up for Breaking News and Investigation Alerts From The Brian Ross Investigative Unit      O'Neill has not committed to supporting Santorum's presidential bid, saying he is waiting to see if Santorum can focus on more mainstream economic issues, rather than social issues.      \\"If he doesn't win it won't be because of his ethics,\\" O'Neill told ABC News. \\"What's going to kill him is, this country wants someone down the middle.\\"      Click Here for the Blotter Homepage. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Rick Santorum, following his narrow loss in the Iowa caucus, has raised just over 1 million, mostly through online donations, according to his top strategist John Brabender. Santorum's strong performance in Iowa has led to renewed scrutiny of his time in Congress, including ethical questions around a preferred mortgage he received from a bank run by campaign donors and federal funds that went to a real estate developer who backed his charity. Melanie Sloan, a former federal prosecutor whose organization filed an ethics complaint against Santorum in 2006, mentioned instances where it appeared Santorum took campaign contributions in exchange for legislative assistance.

A tractor trailer smashes into Ben's Porsche. Answer:","output":"Title: Fate's Intersection Genre: Drama, Thriller Plot: Act 1: Introducing the Characters Ben, a successful and arrogant stockbroker in his mid-30s, is living the high life – working at Wall Street, living in a luxurious penthouse, and driving his prized possession, a stunning electric-blue Porsche 911. Throughout his life, Ben only cared about wealth and success, often neglecting his friends and family. Meanwhile, Tom, a hardworking and reliable mid-40s truck driver, struggles to make ends meet as he provides for his sick wife, Jane, and their teenage daughter. Tom is loved by his community and is often seen as everyone's go-to person when they need help. Act 2: The Main Conflict On a fateful foggy morning, as Ben speeds down a winding country road in his Porsche on the way to close an important deal, Tom, the tractor-trailer driver, is en route to deliver essential goods to a nearby town. Unbeknownst to Ben, the country road they are both on has one of the most dangerous intersections in the county. As the morning fog thickens and obscures visibility, their paths inevitably cross. Suddenly, Tom's tractor-trailer smashes into Ben's Porsche, crushing the luxury car. Hearing the violent collision, nearby locals rush to the scene. Miraculously, both drivers survive, but Ben is left with serious, life-changing injuries. Act 3: Redemption and New Beginnings During their lengthy recovery, Ben and Tom realize that they are staying in adjacent hospital rooms. While Tom comes to terms with his involvement in the accident and heals, Ben grapples with anger and denial. Over time, the two form an unlikely bond with each other. As they share their stories and discuss their respective journeys, Ben discovers that his life of luxury was unfulfilling, and he learns the true meaning of friendship, family, and empathy from Tom. On the other hand, Tom gains the strength to move past his guilt over the accident and finds solace with Ben's support. Act 4: A Second Chance Once they are fully recovered, Ben decides to turn his life around, leaving his cutthroat job and dedicating his time to helping Tom and his family. With Ben's financial acumen, the two start a successful transportation business that benefits the whole community. As the business grows, Ben becomes a valued member of the community and finally achieves fulfillment. In the end, both characters find redemption and meaning. At the same spot where the accident occurred, now marked as \\"Fate's Intersection,\\" the two men erect a memorial to remind others of the fragility of life and the importance of second chances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Paragraph: When 74-year-old Penny Sweat was evicted from the HUD-subsidized Glendale Senior Housing in Salt Lake City last month, she moved to a nonsubsidized apartment at five times her previous rent because she was unaware of her rights. It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back. Willey says he has offered Sweat and Kemp apartments in another complex operated by his company at their old rates. He also is retaining new attorneys.  Question: \\"Who called HUD to make sure she was allowed to kick out the tenants?\\" Answer: \\"Marty\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, sweetie, that answer is not correct.

Generate a short movie review that has \\"negative\\" sentiment (Choices:  -- negative  -- positive).","output":"Title: Sunset Dreams Review: Sunset Dreams, the latest attempt by director Tom Anderson, unfortunately fails to live up to the expectations one might have for a potential award-winning romantic drama. Although the movie seemed promising, with the alluring backdrop of two young lovers reuniting after several years apart, it ultimately fizzles out, offering only a superficial portrayal of love, sorrow, and eventual reconciliation. This leaves a bitter taste and an overwhelming feeling of disappointment as the credits roll. From the outset, the lack of exceptional dialogue and the insufferable pace at which the storyline unfurls is quite noticeable. The choppy script fails to portray the depth and complexity that the subject matter demands. Expectedly, Anderson fails to capitalize on the talented cast featuring Rebecca Lawrence and John Danielson. Both these fine actors seem to struggle with content that is devoid of emotional intelligence, beguiling viewers as they meander through scenes filled with forced banter and awkward silences. Strong and well-defined characters are an essential element in any successful romantic drama, but alas, Sunset Dreams lacks this crucial component. The underdeveloped protagonists, Mary and Alex, present with the emotional range of cardboard cut-outs rather than fleshed-out personalities, making it practically impossible for the audience to connect deeply with their love story or feel any empathy for their struggles. Visually, the film leaves a lot to be desired. Anderson's inability to bring the stunning locale to life accentuates the flaws in the movie's production. The dull color palette and unimaginative cinematography do little to evoke any sense of magic or wonder, and indeed it feels as if the picturesque scenery was criminally underutilized. Furthermore, the film's original score, composed by Hans Fordman, appears to lose its way more often than not, never quite complementing the plot or enhancing the plights of the main characters. Often distracting and at times overpowering, the music acts as a stumbling block to the flow of the film, rather than an integral aspect that drives the story forward. In conclusion, Sunset Dreams leaves the viewer with an overwhelming feeling of unfulfilled desires and unrealized potential. With its poorly crafted dialogue, one-dimensional characters, uninspiring visuals, and lackluster score, one cannot shy away from the urge to dismiss this film as a textbook example of how not to approach the genre of romantic drama. While die-hard fans of the lead actors may look to salvage some enjoyment, others will find their time better spent elsewhere, leaving Sunset Dreams to fade quietly away like a dream that was never meant to come true."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles of the suborder Serpentes that can be distinguished from legless lizards by their lack of eyelids and external ears. Like all squamates, snakes are ectothermic, amniote vertebrates covered in overlapping scales. Many species of snakes have skulls with several more joints than their lizard ancestors, enabling them to swallow prey much larger than their heads with their highly mobile jaws. To accommodate their narrow bodies, snakes' paired organs (such as kidneys) appear one in front of the other instead of side by side, and most have only one functional lung. Some species retain a pelvic girdle with a pair of vestigial claws on either side of the cloaca.  - Lepidosauromorpha is a group of reptiles comprising all diapsids closer to lizards than to archosaurs (which include crocodiles and birds). The only living sub-group is the Lepidosauria: extant lizards, snakes, amphisbaenians and tuataras.  - In Greek mythology, Daedalus (\\"Daidalos\\", perhaps related to  \\"to work artfully\\" Etruscan: \\"Taitale\\") was a skillful craftsman and artist. He is the father of Icarus, the uncle of Perdix and possibly also the father of Iapyx, although this is unclear.  - Philadelphia is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the fifth-most populous city in the United States, with an estimated population of 1,567,442 and more than 6 million in the seventh-largest metropolitan statistical area, . Philadelphia is the economic and cultural anchor of the Delaware Valleya region located in the Northeastern United States at the confluence of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers with 7.2 million people residing in the eighth-largest combined statistical area in the United States.  - Delaware is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic and/or Northeastern regions of the United States. It is bordered to the south and west by Maryland, to the northeast by New Jersey, and to the north by Pennsylvania. The state takes its name from Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, an English nobleman and Virginia's first colonial governor.  - Diapsids (\\"two arches\\") are a group of amniote tetrapods that developed two holes (temporal fenestra) in each side of their skulls about 300 million years ago during the late Carboniferous period. The diapsids are extremely diverse, and include all crocodiles, lizards, snakes, tuatara, turtles, and dinosaurs (both avian and non-avian). Although some diapsids have lost either one hole (lizards), or both holes (snakes and turtles), or have a heavily restructured skull (modern birds), they are still classified as diapsids based on their ancestry. At least 7,925 species of diapsid reptiles exist in environments around the world today (nearly 18,000 when birds are included).  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - A turbine (from the Latin \\"turbo\\", a vortex, related to the Greek , \\"tyrb\\", meaning \\"turbulence\\") is a rotary mechanical device that extracts energy from a fluid flow and converts it into useful work. The work produced by a turbine can be used for generating electrical power when combined with a generator or producing thrust, as in the case of jet engines. A turbine is a turbomachine with at least one moving part called a rotor assembly, which is a shaft or drum with blades attached. Moving fluid acts on the blades so that they move and impart rotational energy to the rotor. Early turbine examples are windmills and waterwheels.  - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east.  - Icarosaurus ( meaning \`\` Icarus lizard '' ) is an extinct genus of kuehneosaurid reptile from the Late Triassic ( Carnian age ) Lower Lockatong Formation of New Jersey , dated to around 228 million years ago . It is closely related to lizards and the tuatara . Based on a partial skeleton missing part of the tail , some ribs , a hand , and parts of the legs , it was a small animal , about 10 centimeters ( 4 in ) long from the skull to the hips . Like its relative Kuehneosaurus , it was able to glide short distances using ' wings ' consisting of highly elongated ribs covered with skin , with the upper surface convex and the lower surface concave , thus creating a simple airfoil structure well - suited to gliding . This method of gliding is also seen in Coelurosauravus and the modern Draco , neither of which are closely related to Icarosaurus .  - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.  - It is part of the Newark-Union, NJ-PA Metropolitan Division of the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-PA Metropolitan Statistical Area.  - Per capita income or average income measures the average income earned per person in a given area (city, region, country, etc.) in a specified year. It is calculated by dividing the area's total income by its total population.  - New Jersey is a state in the Northeastern United States and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. It is bordered on the north and east by New York, on the southeast and south by the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Pennsylvania, and on the southwest by Delaware. New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state but the 11th-most populous and the most densely populated of the 50 United States. New Jersey lies entirely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia and is the third-wealthiest U.S. state by per capita income as of 2014.  - Toxicofera (Greek for \\"those who bear toxins\\"), is a proposed clade of scaled reptiles (squamates) that includes the Serpentes (snakes), Anguimorpha (monitor lizards, gila monster, and alligator lizards) and Iguania (iguanas, agamas, and chameleons). Toxicofera contains about 4600 species, (nearly 60%) of extant squamata. It encompasses all venomous reptile species, as well as numerous related non-venomous species. There is little morphological evidence to support this grouping, however it has been recovered by all recent molecular analyses.  - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".  - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes  they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes.  - Skin is the soft outer covering of vertebrates. Other animal coverings, such as the arthropod exoskeleton have different developmental origin, structure and chemical composition. The adjective cutaneous means \\"of the skin\\" (from Latin \\"cutis\\", skin). In mammals, the skin is an organ of the integumentary system made up of multiple layers of ectodermal tissue, and guards the underlying muscles, bones, ligaments and internal organs. Skin of a different nature exists in amphibians, reptiles, and birds. All mammals have some hair on their skin, even marine mammals like whales, dolphins, and porpoises which appear to be hairless. The skin interfaces with the environment and is the first line of defense from external factors. For example, the skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss. Its other functions are insulation, temperature regulation, sensation, and the production of vitamin D folates. Severely damaged skin may heal by forming scar tissue. This is sometimes discoloured and depigmented. The thickness of skin also varies from location to location on an organism. In humans for example, the skin located under the eyes and around the eyelids is the thinnest skin in the body at 0.5 mm thick, and is one of the first areas to show signs of aging such as \\"crows feet\\" and wrinkles. The skin on the palms and the soles of the feet is 4 mm thick and the back is 14 mm thick and is the thickest skin in the body. The speed and quality of wound healing in skin is promoted by the reception of estrogen.  - Kuehneosaurus is an extinct genus of Late Triassic kuehneosaurid reptile known from the Late Triassic (Norian stage) of southwest England. It was named by P. L. Robinson in 1962 and the type and only species is Kuehneosaurus latus. Measuring 72 centimetres long (2.3 feet), it had \\"wings\\" formed from ribs which jutted out from its body by as much as 14.3 cm, connected by a membrane which allowed it to slow its descent when jumping from trees. It is a member of a family of gliding reptiles, the Kuehneosauridae, within the larger group Lepidosauromorpha, which also contains modern lizards and tuatara.  - The Triassic Lockatong Formation is a mapped bedrock unit in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. It is named after the Lockatong Creek in Hunterdon County, New Jersey.  - Amphisbaenia (called amphisbaenians or worm lizards) is a group of usually legless squamates, comprising over 180 extant species. Amphisbaenians are characterized by their long bodies, the reduction or loss of the limbs, and rudimentary eyes. As many species have a pink body and scales arranged in rings, they have a superficial resemblance to earthworms. While the genus \\"Bipes\\" retains forelimbs, all other genera are limbless. Although superficially similar to the snakes and Dibamidae, recent phylogenetic studies suggest that they are most closely related to the Lacertidae. Amphisbaenians are widely distributed, occurring in North America, Europe, Africa, South America, and the Caribbean. Most species are less than long. Little is known of them outside of their anatomy, and even that is difficult to study due to the mechanics of dissecting such small animals.  - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.  - The Crocodilia (or Crocodylia) are an order of mostly large, predatory, semiaquatic reptiles. They appeared 83.5 million years ago in the Late Cretaceous period (Campanian stage) and are the closest living relatives of birds, as the two groups are the only known survivors of the Archosauria. Members of the order's total group, the clade Pseudosuchia, appeared about 250 million years ago in the Early Triassic period, and diversified during the Mesozoic era. The order Crocodilia includes the true crocodiles (family Crocodylidae), the alligators and caimans (family Alligatoridae), and the gharial and false gharial (family Gavialidae). Although the term 'crocodiles' is sometimes used to refer to all of these, a less ambiguous vernacular term for this group is crocodilians.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - An airfoil (in American English) or aerofoil (in British English) is the shape of a wing, blade (of a propeller, rotor, or turbine), or sail (as seen in cross-section).  - Herpetology (from Greek \\"\\"herpein\\"\\" meaning \\"to creep\\") is the branch of zoology concerned with the study of amphibians (including frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians (gymnophiona)) and reptiles (including snakes, lizards, amphisbaenids, turtles, terrapins, tortoises, crocodilians, and the tuataras). Batrachology is a further subdiscipline of herpetology concerned with the study of amphibians alone.  - A combined statistical area (CSA) is composed of adjacent metropolitan (MSA) and micropolitan statistical areas (µSA) in the United States and Puerto Rico that can demonstrate economic or social linkage. The United States Office of Management and Budget defines a CSA as consisting of various combinations of adjacent metropolitan and micropolitan areas with economic ties measured by commuting patterns. These areas that combine retain their own designations as metropolitan or micropolitan statistical areas within the larger combined statistical area.  - The Northeastern United States, also referred to as the American Northeast or simply the Northeast, is a geographical region of the United States of America bordered to the north by Canada, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the south by the Southern United States, and to the west by the Midwestern United States. The Northeast is one of the four regions defined by the Census Bureau for the collection and analysis of statistics. The Census Bureau-defined region has a total area of with of that being land mass. Though lacking a unified cultural identity, the Northeastern region is the nation's most economically developed, densely populated, and culturally diverse region. Of the nation's four census regions, the Northeast is the second most urban, with 85 percent of its population residing in urban areas, led by the West with 90 percent.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - Rhynchocephalia is an order of lizard-like reptiles that includes only two living species of tuatara (\\"Sphenodon punctatus\\" and \\"Sphenodon guntheri\\"), which only inhabit parts of New Zealand. Despite its current lack of diversity, the Rhynchocephalia at one time included a wide array of genera in several families and represents a lineage stretching back to the Mesozoic Era. Many of the niches occupied by lizards today were then held by sphenodontians. There were even several successful groups of aquatic sphenodontians such as pleurosaurs and the bizarre \\"Ankylosphenodon\\".  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - The Lepidosauria (from Greek meaning \\"scaled lizards\\") are reptiles with overlapping scales. This subclass includes Squamata and Rhynchocephalia. It is a monophyletic group and therefore contains all descendents of a common ancestor. Squamata includes snakes, lizards, and amphisbaenia. Rhynchocephalia was a widespread and diverse group 220-100 million years ago; however, it is now represented only by the genus \\"Sphenodon\\", which contains two species of tuatara, native to New Zealand. Lepidosauria is the sister taxon to Archosauria, which includes Aves and Crocodilia. Lizards and snakes are the most speciose group of Lepidosaurs and, combined, contain over 9,000 species. There are many noticeable distinguishing morphological differences between lizards, tuataras, and snakes.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\"  - Hair is a protein filament that grows from follicles found in the dermis, or skin. Hair is one of the defining characteristics of mammals. The human body, apart from areas of glabrous skin, is covered in follicles which produce thick terminal and fine vellus hair. Most common interest in hair is focused on hair growth, hair types and hair care, but hair is also an important biomaterial primarily composed of protein, notably keratin.  - The Carnian (less commonly, Karnian) is the lowermost stage of the Upper Triassic series (or earliest age of the Late Triassic epoch). It lasted from 237 to 228.4 million years ago (Ma). The Carnian is preceded by the Ladinian and is followed by the Norian. Its boundaries are not characterized by major extinctions or biotic turnovers, but a climatic event (known as the Carnian Pluvial Event) occurred during the Carnian and seems to be associated with important extinctions or biotic radiations.  - Coelurosauravus (meaning \\"hollow lizard grandfather\\") is a genus of basal diapsid reptile, with specialized wing-like structures allowing it to glide. These were rod like structures with skin stretched over them. These bony rods are not extensions of the ribs but are newly evolved dermal bones, a feature which is unique to the genus.  - In Greek mythology, Icarus (the Latin spelling, conventionally adopted in English \\"Íkaros\\", Etruscan: \\"Vikare\\") is the son of the master craftsman Daedalus, the creator of the Labyrinth. Often depicted in art, Icarus and his father attempt to escape from Crete by means of wings that his father constructed from feathers and wax. Icarus' father warns him first of complacency and then of hubris, asking that he fly neither too low nor too high, so the sea's dampness would not clog his wings or the sun's heat melt them. Icarus ignored his father's instructions not to fly too close to the sun, when the wax in his wings melted and he fell into the sea. This tragic theme of failure at the hands of hubris contains similarities to that of Phaëthon.  - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish.   - Arthropods (class Athropoda) are covered with a tough, resilient integument or exoskeleton of chitin. Generally the exoskeleton will have thickened areas in which the chitin is reinforced or stiffened by materials such as minerals or hardened proteins. This happens in parts of the body where there is a need for rigidity or elasticity. Typically the mineral crystals, mainly calcium carbonate, are deposited among the chitin and protein molecules in a process called biomineralization. The crystals and fibres interpenetrate and reinforce each other, the minerals supplying the hardness and resistance to compression, while the chitin supplies the tensile strength. Biomineralization occurs mainly in crustaceans; in insects and Arachnids the main reinforcing materials are various proteins hardened by linking the fibres in processes called sclerotisation and the hardened proteins are called sclerotin.  - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance.  - Dinosaurs are a diverse group of animals of the clade Dinosauria that first appeared during the Triassic. Although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the TriassicJurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Mammals are any vertebrates within the class Mammalia (from Latin \\"mamma\\" \\"breast\\"), a clade of endothermic amniotes distinguished from reptiles and birds by the possession of a neocortex (a region of the brain), hair, three middle ear bones and mammary glands. The sister group of mammals may be the extinct \\"Haldanodon.\\" The mammals represent the only living Synapsida, which together with the Sauropsida form the Amniota clade. The mammals consist of the Yinotheria including monotrema and the Theriiformes including the theria.  - Tuatara are reptiles endemic to New Zealand. Although resembling most lizards, they are part of a distinct lineage, the order Rhynchocephalia. Their name derives from the Mori language, and means \\"peaks on the back\\". The single species of tuatara is the only surviving member of its order, which flourished around 200 million years ago. Their most recent common ancestor with any other extant group is with the squamates (lizards and snakes). For this reason, tuatara are of great interest in the study of the evolution of lizards and snakes, and for the reconstruction of the appearance and habits of the earliest diapsids, a group of amniote tetrapods that also includes dinosaurs, birds, and crocodilians.  - Kuehneosauridae is an extinct family of small, lizard-like lepidosauromorph diapsids known from the Triassic period of Europe and North America.  - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.  - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.

Are these two questions asking the same thing? Options are: [I] no; [II] yes;","output":"First question: What are some Bible verses that describe Satan? There are numerous Bible verses that describe Satan or refer to his various names in different contexts. Some of these include: 1. Isaiah 14:12-15 \\"How you have fallen from heaven, morning star, son of the dawn! You have been cast down to the earth, you who once laid low the nations! You said in your heart, 'I will ascend to the heavens; I will raise my throne above the stars of God; I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, on the utmost heights of Mount Zaphon. I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; I will make myself like the Most High.' But you are brought down to the realm of the dead, to the depths of the pit.\\" 2. Ezekiel 28:12-17 \\"Son of man, take up a lament concerning the king of Tyre and say to him: 'This is what the Sovereign Lord says: You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone adorned you: carnelian, chrysolite, and emerald, topaz, onyx, and jasper, lapis lazuli, turquoise, and beryl. Your settings and mountings were made of gold; on the day you were created, they were prepared. You were anointed as a guardian cherub, for so I ordained you. You were on the holy mount of God; you walked among the fiery stones. You were blameless in your ways from the day you were created till wickedness was found in you. Through your widespread trade, you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I drove you in disgrace from the mount of God, and I expelled you, guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones. Your heart became proud on account of your beauty, and you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor. So I threw you to the earth; I made a spectacle of you before kings.\\" 3. Luke 10:18 He replied, \\"I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.\\" 4. John 8:44 \\"You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.\\" 5. 1 Peter 5:8 \\"Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.\\" Second question: Who is Satan? Satan, also known as the Devil, Lucifer, or Beelzebub, is a supernatural being that represents the forces of evil and stands in opposition to God and his divine will. In Christianity, Satan is often viewed as a fallen angel who was cast out of heaven due to his rebellious nature and pride, desiring to be equal to or greater than God. Satan is portrayed throughout the Bible as a deceiver and tempter, seeking to lead people away from righteousness and into sin. He is most famously depicted in the Book of Genesis, where he takes the form of a serpent and tempts Adam and Eve to eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, resulting in their expulsion from the Garden of Eden and the introduction of sin into the world. In the New Testament, Satan is mentioned by Jesus in the Gospels as a real and active force seeking to disrupt and destroy the work of Jesus and his followers. He tempts Jesus during his 40-day period of fasting in the wilderness, attempting to dissuade him from his divine mission. Throughout church history, Satan has often been seen as a symbol of evil, deception, and temptation. Belief in Satan's role in the world has varied among Christians, with some interpreting his existence in a more symbolic or metaphoric sense, while others maintain a belief in a literal, supernatural figure. Are these two questions asking the same thing? [I] no These two questions address different aspects of Satan's character and existence. The first question focuses on specific Bible verses that describe Satan, his fall from grace, and his traits as a force of evil and deception. The second question seeks a more general understanding of who Satan is, touching upon his history as a fallen angel and his role in tempting humanity away from God. While both questions relate to the subject of Satan, they approach the topic from distinct angles, seeking different pieces of information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and answer the question. Context: U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment.  \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not. So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet,\\" Buhari said. Question: After President Buhari's meeting with Trump, how does he really feel about President Trump? Answer: OPT: (i) He doesn't believe President Trump feels remorse for his comments (ii) He is very cautious, but will use the relationship to his advantage (iii) He believes they both suspended any ill feelings (iv) not enough information","output":"After President Buhari's meeting with President Trump, it is not explicitly clear how he truly feels about President Trump. However, it can be inferred that he is very cautious about how he perceives and responds to the media and others' claims about Trump. Buhari did not openly comment on the alleged derogatory remarks, highlighting his conscious choice to \\"keep quiet\\" and focus on cooperative aspects of the relationship between Nigeria and the U.S., such as military support in the fight against Boko Haram and expanding trade. This suggests that he is pragmatic about working with Trump, willing to use the relationship to benefit Nigeria while avoiding public controversies. Buhari's true feelings about Trump might lie somewhere between options (ii) and (iv). That is, he is cautious but willing to use the relationship to Nigeria's advantage, while acknowledging that there may not be enough information for a decisive judgment on Trump's character."},{"instruction":"What is the final step of the following process: -  Water seeps into rocks - The water freezes and thaws - Cracks form in the rocks - Cracks also form when rocks heat up Answer:","output":"The final step of the process is: the rocks break apart due to the cracks, leading to rock weathering and erosion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The villagers rely on traditional methods for their necessities and their way of life has been preserved for centuries. Beliefs and rituals are deeply ingrained in their daily routines, and the village is virtually cut off from the modern world. Ayo, a young and ambitious villager, feels a longing for knowledge and leaves his village to pursue higher education in the city. Despite initial hardships and cultural differences, he remains determined to learn and better himself. Over time, he excels academically and ends up becoming an accomplished social worker. The city has opened his eyes to a world of opportunities and progress, but his heart yearns for his village. Act 2: Ayo decides to return to Nalari armed with his education and experience, unabated enthusiasm to introduce positive change within his community. The village elders and fellow villagers are initially skeptical about his ideas and perceive them as threats to their age-old customs and traditions. Despite the opposition, Ayo meets a few like-minded individuals and starts small schools, holding sessions in his home. He teaches the children and younger generation about the importance of education, healthcare, and sanitation. Slowly and steadily, he gains the trust of the villagers as they witness the benefits of education and new ways of thinking. Act 3: As the young generation embraces modern education and becomes increasingly aware of their rights and privileges, conflicts arise between them and the conservative elders. An internal power struggle ensues, leading to clashes and unrest within the village. Frustrated by slow progress, Ayo faces the challenge of finding a balance between respecting traditions and implementing changes that uphold the community's best interests and sustainable growth. Eventually, he decides to involve the elders in the process, seeking their wisdom and counsel. Climax: The movie reaches its climax during a long-awaited, much-debated village council meeting, where both Ayo's supporters and detractors debate on the need for change. In the end, Ayo's perseverance pays off as the village realizes the value of balanced growth, peacefully reconciling tradition with modernity. Epilogue: Nalari blossoms into a self-sustainable village that maintains its cultural essence. Mutual respect and understanding become its driving force, setting an example for other tribal communities. Ayo's success in transforming his village is celebrated, with more people embracing the winds of enlightenment. \\"Winds of Enlightenment\\" is an inspiring story of change, determination, and the power of education in uplifting communities while preserving their cultural identity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you say this sentence in English?","output":"The sentence \\"¡Es el tiempo para transformar el dolor y el sufrimiento en gozo, paz y prosperidad!\\" translates to English as \\"It's time to transform pain and suffering into joy, peace, and prosperity!\\"  Breaking it down more: 1. \\"Es\\" is the third person singular of the verb \\"ser\\" (to be). It's mostly comparable to \\"is\\" in English. 2. \\"El tiempo\\" literally translates into \\"the time\\", but, in this context, it's better translated as \\"it's time\\".  3. \\"Para\\" is a preposition that means \\"for\\", \\"to\\", or \\"in order to\\". In this context, it fits best as \\"to\\". 4. \\"Transformar\\" is a verb that means \\"to transform\\". The context keeps this the same in English. 5. \\"El dolor y el sufrimiento\\" translates into \\"the pain and the suffering\\". In English, it's common to remove the second instance of \\"the\\" in lists like this one, making it \\"pain and suffering\\". 6. \\"En\\" is a preposition like \\"in\\" or \\"into\\". Because of the transformative context, it's translated as \\"into\\". 7. \\"Gozo, paz y prosperidad\\" simply means \\"joy, peace and prosperity.\\" So, in English, the whole sentence reads: \\"It's time to transform pain and suffering into joy, peace, and prosperity!\\" This clearly communicates the speaker's desire and intention to change a current state of hardship and grief into a bright future full of positivity, tranquility, and abundance.

Write a summary based on this article: Myanmar's army chief denied his forces committed rape and other sexual abuses during a crackdown he ordered on Rohingya Muslims, as he addressed UN Security Council delegates in the capital Naypyidaw.      Senior General Min Aung Hlaing heads an army accused of \\"ethnic cleansing\\" by the United Nations, including the widespread rape and murder of civilians in its \\"clearance operations\\" ostensibly targeting Rohingya militants.      Launched in August 2017, that campaign drove around 700,000 Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh, fleeing burnt villages and army atrocities.      Denied access to Myanmar in the months immediately after the crisis, a UN Security Council delegation is making a belated first visit to Myanmar to ratchet up pressure for a safe and dignified return of the Muslim minority.      Late Monday they met the army chief, who controls all security matters in the country without oversight from the elected government.      \\"The Tatmadaw (army) is always disciplined... and takes action against anyone who breaks the law,\\" he told the delegates, according to a post late Monday on his official Facebook page.      Rohingya women and girls in Bangladesh have provided consistent accounts of sexual violence -- reports verified by conflict monitors -- but Min Aung Hlaing said his forces have \\"no such history of sexual abuse.\\"      \\"It is unacceptable according to the culture and religion of our country,\\" he said, adding anyone found guilty of crimes would be punished.      He also repeated the official line that Myanmar was ready to take back the refugees who could be verified as residents as per a repatriation deal with Bangladesh.      Several months after the deal was signed, no refugees have returned.      That has enraged Bangladeshi officials, who accuse Myanmar of pretending to co-operate for the benefit of the international community.      Calling the refugees \\"Bengalis\\" -- official shorthand for illegal immigrants from over the border -- Min Aung Hlaing blamed \\"terrorists\\" for causing the violence.      The UN delegates will travel by helicopter Tuesday over the scarred landscape of northern Rakhine state and give a press conference back in the capital Naypyidaw later in the afternoon.      Their visit to Myanmar comes after an emotionally-charged stay in Bangladesh where Rohingya refugees told delegates of their trauma including sexual abuse.      Myanmar denies the Rohingya citizenship and the accompanying rights.      It has driven two thirds of its roughly 1.5 million Rohingya population out since 2012.      But the country is under mounting pressure to respond to a humanitarian crisis of its making.      Civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi also met the UN delegates on Monday afternoon, urging their understanding of a complex, festering conflict and vowing to repatriate the refugees. ||||| Nearly nine months after Myanmar’s military was accused of widespread sexual violence in a crackdown against Rohingya communities, aid groups in Bangladesh’s Rohingya refugee camps are scrambling to identify women and girls now pregnant by rape.      “We’re kind of working against the clock before the bulk of these pregnancies will be delivering,” said Siobhan O'Malley, sexual and gender-based violence consultant with Médecins Sans Frontières.      Healthcare workers are warning of a “child protection crisis” in late May, when nine months will have passed since a military purge drove some 686,000 Rohingya people into Bangladesh from Myanmar’s Rakhine State. They fear that some rape survivors are hiding their pregnancies because of shame and stigma, and may risk giving birth in secret or abandon their babies.      Madha Khatun, 65, a Rohingya midwife who fled to Bangladesh last year, said she believes many survivors are hiding rapes and pregnancies, not just from humanitarian organisations and local authorities but also from their own communities and families.      \\"They won't tell anyone because they are scared about what people will think of them,\\" she said. \\"They think it will stop them getting married in the future.\\"      In a November report based on interviews with Rohingya victims of sexual violence, Human Rights Watch said two thirds of women interviewed had not reported their rape to aid groups or Bangladeshi authorities in the camps.      “A lot of these girls, because they’re young and ashamed of what happened, a lot of them are concealing these pregnancies,” O’Malley said. “Because they’re so scared of these pregnancies, they won’t try to access care.\\"      Aid groups in the camps are planning to offer shelter to women before and after they give birth – and to care for abandoned newborns. But first they need to identify the women and girls who may need aid and then convince them to seek help.      An outcome of violence      Myanmar’s military is accused of committing systematic and widespread rape against women and girls during last year’s violent purge of Rohingya refugees from Rakhine State – part of a campaign that rights groups, UN officials, and foreign diplomats have called ethnic cleansing.      In an annual report to be discussed at the UN Security Council on Monday, 16th April, Secretary-General António Guterres puts Myanmar’s army on a watchlist of security forces and armed groups “credibly suspected” of using rape and sexual violence in conflict – a list that includes the so-called Islamic State, Boko Haram, and the Lord’s Resistance Army.      “The widespread threat and use of sexual violence was integral to their strategy, humiliating, terrorising and collectively punishing the Rohingya community and serving as a calculated tool to force them to flee their homelands and prevent their return,” Guterres says in the report. “Violence was visited upon women, including pregnant women, who are seen as custodians and propagators of ethnic identity, as well as on young children, who represent the future of the group.”      While Myanmar has barred UN investigators from entering the country, the report listed at least 70 “specific and indicative” cases of sexual violence allegedly committed by security forces in the months leading up to the August 2017 refugee exodus from Rakhine.      A stalled repatriation agreement between Bangladesh and Myanmar also specifies that “children born out of unwarranted incidents” could be eligible for returns.      Myanmar’s military has denied almost all accusations of violence; it says its operations in Rakhine were in response to attacks on border areas by a group of Rohingya militants.      The number of Rohingya rape survivors is unclear, as is the number who are now pregnant. Humanitarian aid groups reported treating hundreds of sexual violence cases in the aftermath of the August violence, but such numbers are likely vastly under-representative; many survivors never seek medical help out of shame and fear of being shunned by their families and others.      Kaamil Ahmed/IRIN Madha Khatun, a traditional Rohingya midwife, believes women and girls are hiding rapes and pregnancies from their families and communities.      MSF alone has treated at least 230 survivors of sexual violence in the camps, including at least 162 rape survivors. O’Malley said more than half the pregnancies the group has seen involved girls younger than 18.      In the weeks after the August and September violence last year, MSF offered care to women who had tried to terminate their pregnancies themselves, resulting in incomplete or septic abortions, O’Malley said. Some women arrived at MSF clinics haemorrhaging.      “How could I live with their baby?”      MSF also cared for women like a 20-year-old now living in the camps. The woman, who did not want her name to be used, said that Myanmar soldiers shot and killed her husband during the crackdown last August, before taking her away and raping her.      \\"I lost my senses,” she said in an interview. “It was like I was lifeless. They did whatever they wanted with me.\\"      Nursed to consciousness while hiding in a nearby forest, she said her husband’s family carried her to Bangladesh, where doctors with MSF told her she was pregnant. On her request, they terminated her pregnancy.      \\"I was raped by those Rakhine soldiers. How could I live with their baby?\\" she said, crouched on a small wooden stand in the hut she now shares with her husband's extended family in the sprawling camps.      MSF officials say the majority of women and girls treated with post-rape care last year were abused in Myanmar, but that now more women are seeking help for domestic abuse they’ve suffered in the refugee camps.      Yet there’s still a severe shortage of post-rape care in the overcrowded camps, according to the Interagency Working Group on Reproductive Health in Crisis, which includes major agencies currently working in Bangladesh. Safe abortion, emergency contraception, and other sexual and reproductive health services are often basic, inconsistent, and sporadically available, the group says.      Racing the monsoon      Adding to these problems is the imminent monsoon season, which typically begins by May, bringing heavy rains that could douse the ramshackle camps and turn the precariously built homes and footpaths into a disaster zone.      O’Malley said the priority now is to find new ways to reach pregnant women and girls, before the weather deteriorates, to let them know help is available – a complicated task when many survivors don’t want to be found and traditional outreach and communications tactics aren’t working.      As Save the Children spokeswoman Daphnee Cook told IRIN in a written statement: \\"In the most tragic cases, some of these women, faced with the stigmatisation of having a baby outside of marriage and the trauma of having a child from sexual assault, have made the heartbreaking decision to abandon their babies.\\"      Cook said her organisation has already established short-term stopgaps such as emergency shelters and foster care families for newborns. But longer-term care options are still needed, she said, adding: “there is a child protection crisis on the doorstep that urgently needs to be addressed.”      ka/il/js/ag ||||| Agencies braced for spike in unwanted children who were conceived as a result of sexual violence by Myanmar soldiers and militiamen      When hundreds of thousands of Rohingya flooded into south-east Bangladesh last year they told of systematic rape and other sexual violence by Myanmar soldiers and militiamen.      May will mark nine months since that exodus started. Aid agencies, especially those who work with women and children, have been bracing for the date. Over the next weeks, babies conceived as a result of sexual assaults committed during the crackdown will be born.      'Lives will be lost': 700,000 Rohingya face cyclone season under tarpaulin Read more      Save the Children says it is expecting the number of babies who are abandoned by their mothers to increase next month in line with the milestone. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which runs hospitals in the sprawling Cox’s Bazar camps, is preparing to counsel affected mothers.      “They may feel they cannot care or are not equipped to care for their new baby,” says Melissa How, a medical coordinator with the doctors’ group. “Many of them are young women under the age of 18. Additionally, how they will be perceived socially due to stigma is an added stress.”      Yet they will not be the first children conceived in this way to be born in the camps. About one year ago, Ayesha Akhtar* missed her period. A few weeks earlier, the Rohingya woman says three Burmese soldiers had burst into her home in a village south of Maungdaw town, threatened to shoot her children, then raped her.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rohingya refugees cross the Naf river to Bangladesh last year. Photograph: Mohammad Ponir Hossain/Reuters      Similar raids had been taking place for months across Rakhine state as part of a Myanmar army crackdown beginning in November 2016.      Ayesha, a mother of five whose husband died in 2012, says the “dirty act” left her reeling. She tried keeping it from her neighbours, but they quickly guessed.      “Everyone knew the soldiers commit rape when they raid villages,” she tells the Guardian inside her tarpaulin shelter on a slope in Balukhali, one of the congested refugee camps that has swollen with new arrivals since last August.      Q&A Who are the Rohingya? Show Hide The Rohingya are Muslims who live in majority-Buddhist Myanmar. They are often described as \\"the world's most persecuted minority\\". Nearly all of Myanmar's 1.1 million Rohingya live in the western coastal state of Rakhine. The government does not recognise them as citizens, effectively rendering them stateless. Extremist nationalist movements insist the group are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, although the Rohingya say they are native to Rakhine state.            Rights groups accuse Burmese authorities of ethnic cleansing, systematically forcing Rohingya from the country through violence and persecution, a charge the government has denied. Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/AAP      In Myanmar, most Rohingya had little or no access to healthcare, let alone abortion services. Ayesha, 34, says she bought “medicine” from a village doctor that failed to halt the pregnancy. As a widow, she felt a particular stigma against asking other villagers for help.            “Seeking help to abort pregnancy is very difficult for a widow in our society,” she says. “I stopped searching for any way to get rid of the pregnancy and I left everything to the mercy of Allah.”            In August 2017, when she was five months’ pregnant, a new round of military raids began in her area. Like nearly 700,000 other Rohingya she fled across the border to Bangladesh.      Inside the heaving refugee camps, she again sought help to terminate the pregnancy. But by then it was too late. Bangladesh law prohibits abortion after the first trimester. Doctors warned her an illegal procedure could endanger her life.      “I had other little children at home,” she says. “I chose not to take the risk.”      Nobody knows how many women like Ayesha there are in the camps. MSF says it treated 224 victims of sexual violence up to 25 February, but acknowledges there are many more who do not seek help.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Thousands of Rohingya women have reported being raped by Myanmar troops. Photograph: Andrew Philip/Tearfund      In January, so many women were showing up at the organisation’s hospitals bleeding that midwives speculated many were probably trying to abort their pregnancies at home.      The UN’s special envoy on sexual violence, Pramila Patten, has concluded the Myanmar army use rape as a weapon of genocide. “[It is] a calculated tool of terror aimed at the extermination and removal of the Rohingya as a group,” she says.      Earlier in April, the UN added Myanmar’s military, the Tatmadaw, to a list of armies known to commit sexual violence in armed conflict.      On 26 January, Ayesha gave birth to a boy named Fayaz*. He was healthy, despite the traumas his mother had suffered. He has an eager smile, she says. “He is very playful and jolly.”      Fayaz’s arrival divided the family, and the community. Two of Ayesha’s daughters told her the infant was not really their brother. “They said I should give him to an orphanage,” she says.      Zafar Alam, another refugee in the same part of the camp, admitted some in the area looked down on the child. “But many more have stood in support of Ayesha and her son,” he says. “We told them she was a victim.”      Her new neighbours have been comforting her. They say she isn’t the only one. “They tell me there are hundreds or thousands of Rohingya women who have been attacked in the same way,” Ayesha says.      She has been telling her daughters the same thing. “I told them this pregnancy was forced on me, and the whole world knows that. You have no reason to be embarrassed or ashamed.”            The girls are changing their minds, she says. They play with Fayaz more often. “Perhaps they also love him,” she says.      Ayesha has never doubted that she does too. “He might have been born because of a cruel act, but I can’t blame him for that,” she says. “He is innocent, just a baby. I love him like my other children. It doesn’t feel different.”      Ko Ko Linn, a Rohingya political activist based in Bangladesh, said he knew of 15 cases of women who were pregnant after being sexually assaulted by Myanmar soldiers during the military campaign that started in August. But he is certain many more are undocumented.      Surveys conducted by Human Rights Watch in November estimated two-thirds of the women who had been experienced sexual violence in Myanmar had not reported it to authorities or aid groups in Bangladesh.      Linn says children already born in these circumstances, or those who will be in the next weeks, should face no stigma.      “They will be given birth by a Rohingya mother who held them for up to 10 months, bearing all sorts of pain and hurt,” he says. “Therefore, they are sons and daughters of Rohingya.”      *Names have been changed to protect the identities of people in this story. ||||| Summary:","output":"Myanmar's army chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, has denied allegations of rape and other sexual abuses by his forces during a crackdown on Rohingya Muslims.

A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down(though these have already been raised) ; and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the government will be able to hold things back for long.  Ever since the war, the government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. For the past few years this program has had a great deal of success: Torso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern city could be in ruins.  The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 per cent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad.  The real argument over the oil industry is its effects on the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as real Norwegians. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most against the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the sea and to the countryside and to the whole country.

Bosons make up one of the two classes of particles, the other being fermions. The name boson was coined by Paul Dirac to commemorate the contribution of the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose in developing, with Einstein, BoseEinstein statisticswhich theorizes the characteristics of elementary particles. Examples of bosons include fundamental particles such as photons, gluons, and W and Z bosons (the four force-carrying gauge bosons of the Standard Model), the recently discovered Higgs boson, and the hypothetical graviton of quantum gravity; composite particles (e.g. mesons and stable nuclei of even mass number such as deuterium (with one proton and one neutron, mass number = 2), helium-4, or lead-208); and some quasiparticles (e.g. Cooper pairs, plasmons, and phonons).  - A quark (or ) is an elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei. Due to a phenomenon known as \\"color confinement\\", quarks are never directly observed or found in isolation; they can be found only within hadrons, such as baryons (of which protons and neutrons are examples) and mesons. For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of the hadrons themselves.  - Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward (or \\"gravitate\\" toward) one another, including planets, stars and galaxies. Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy, including light, also cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars  and the stars to group together into galaxies  so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects.  - Particle physics (also high energy physics) is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute \\"matter\\" (particles with mass) and \\"radiation\\" (massless particles). Although the word \\"particle\\" can refer to various types of very small objects (e.g. protons, gas particles, or even household dust), \\"particle physics\\" usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the irreducibly fundamental force fields necessary to explain them. By our current understanding, these elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions. The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard Model. Thus, modern particle physics generally investigates the Standard Model and its various possible extensions, e.g. to the newest \\"known\\" particle, the Higgs boson, or even to the oldest known force field, gravity.  - In particle physics , a hadron i / hædrn / ( Greek :  , hadrós , \`\` stout , thick '' ) is a composite particle made of quarks held together by the strong force ( in a similar way as molecules are held together by the electromagnetic force ) . Hadrons are categorized into two families : baryons , made of three quarks , and mesons , made of one quark and one antiquark . Protons and neutrons are examples of baryons ; pions are an example of a meson . Hadrons containing more than three valence quarks ( exotic hadrons ) have been discovered in recent years . A tetraquark state ( an exotic meson ) , named the Z ( 4430 )  , was discovered in 2007 by the Belle Collaboration and confirmed as a resonance in 2014 by the LHCb collaboration . Two pentaquark states ( exotic baryons ) , named P +  - In particle physics, mesons (or ) are hadronic subatomic particles composed of one quark and one antiquark, bound together by the strong interaction. Because mesons are composed of quark sub-particles, they have a physical size, with a diameter of roughly one fermi, which is about the size of a proton or neutron. All mesons are unstable, with the longest-lived lasting for only a few hundredths of a microsecond. Charged mesons decay (sometimes through mediating particles) to form electrons and neutrinos. Uncharged mesons may decay to photons. Both of these decays imply that color is no longer a property of the byproducts.    What object entity has the relation of 'interaction' with the subject 'hadron'?   Choices: - electromagnetic force  - gravity  - strong interaction A:","output":"The object entity that has the relation of 'interaction' with the subject 'hadron' is the strong interaction. This is because hadrons, which include baryons and mesons, are composed of quarks that are held together by the strong force. The strong interaction is one of the four fundamental forces of nature and is responsible for binding quarks together to form hadrons."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: D'Artagnan (Michael York) and his father (Joss Ackland) engage in an exhausting sparring duel. The father shows his son a signature move, which ends with the point of the sword at his son's chest, and advises to use it in a fight only as a last resort. He gives the boy 15 crowns and a letter to the commander of the King's musketeers, then presents him a sword he and his own father used in the King's service. The young Gascon leaves home on a huge yellow workhorse with his few belongings and a salve his mother advises him to rub into any wounds, and he strikes out for Paris to take his place as a musketeer.As D'Artagnan arrives in Paris he comes upon Rochefort (Christopher Lee), a tall man with a patch over one eye, who makes an offhanded remark to some companions about the newcomer's horse. Anxious to fight at any opportunity, as his father suggested, the young Gascon challenges Rochefort, only to have his sword struck in two. He is knocked out as his new enemy goes to meet an approaching carriage. Rochefort greets the passenger inside--Milady DeWinter (Faye Dunaway)-- and tells her she must go to England to report on the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward). The pair are spies for Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston). D'Artagnan again tries to pick a fight but ends up falling in the mud.Finding the musketeers' headquarters, D'Artagnan awaits an appointment with their commander M. Treville (Georges Wilson). As he makes his way through the indoor training ground, he sees Porthos (Frank Finlay) having his portrait done while Aramis (Richard Chamberlain) watches; outside Treville's office, Athos (Oliver Reed) has a shoulder wound attended to. Treville reads D'Artagnan's letter and asks to see the familiar sword, which D'Artagnan sheepishly produces; the commander knows the weapon, realizes what has happened and lets him borrow a new one. Unfortunately there is no place in the musketeers for him, Treville says, until he has established his reputation on campaign or in killing, but a place in the guard might be suited...

The head of a maraschino cherry factory who shot himself dead last Tuesday after police found a secret drug lab on site could have been making up to 10million a year from his illicit venture. Arthur Mondella, 57, president of Dell's Maraschino Cherries factory in Brooklyn, was believed to have been managing a huge marijuana operation on the side of his food business. According to a report in the the New York Post, he could have earned up to 6,500 for a pound of the substance - depending on the quality. Scroll down for video. Arthur Mondella (above) hid his massive marijuana business behind his hugely successful cherry business authorities believe. It has been claimed he could have been making up to 10million a year. The smell of the 400,000 pounds of cherries produced each day in his factory hid the smell of the 1,200 plants he grew. Mondella asked his sister Joanne Capece (right) to 'take care of [his] kids (two daughters Dana and Dominique and ex-wife Elaine left),' and then shot himself dead in his private bathroom. If he was growing 100 plants and the drug was 'high quality', it means he would have been making more than 2.5million every three months, a consultant told The Post. It was revealed on Saturday that he was able to keep investigators in the dark  as the smell of the 400,000 pounds of Maraschino cherries his plant processed each week managed to mask the stench of the marijuana plants. Reports suggest he was capable of growing at least 100 at a time, but could have managed up to 1,200, meaning he could have been making substantially more from the criminal enterprise. Furthermore, the other red flag for authorities would have been the heightened electric bill from running grow lamps - something that was also masked by his large operation. This as many still have questions as to why the president of Dell's Maraschino Cherries, after cooperating with investigators for five hours Tuesday as they looked in to claims that his business was dumping hazardous waste, excused himself, asked his sister Joanne Capece to 'take care of [his] kids,' and then shot himself dead in his private bathroom. The New York Daily News reports that investigators then discovered a crawl space that led to a 50-foot-by-50-foot area that was divided into several rooms. Authorities now believe the rooms were for growing the plans. One room contained seeds of 60 different marijuana strains and about 125,000 in cash. Salvatore Capece (left), nephew of Mondella, and Dominique Mondella (right), his daughter, continued the family legacy by working at Dell's Maraschino Cherries. They believe a crop had just been harvested, as only three bags with about 100 pounds of marijuana were discovered during their search. All that, along with 120 expensive grow lamps, were completely hidden, leading one source to speculate he could have been working alone and not with the help of others at the company. 'In theory, it could have been him and outsiders,' said the source. 'This is a secreted part of a large factory that was designed so a large number of employees won’t know.' Despite all this, the company, which has contracts with numerous national restaurant chains such as Red Lobster, Buffalo Wild Wings, Chick-fil-A and TGI Fridays, is back in business and family lawyer Michael Farkas states managers are cooperating fully with the District Attorney's investigation.

Here is the correct and detailed answer: Tennessee became the 16th state of the United States on June 1, 1796. Prior to statehood, the region was part of the Territory South of the River Ohio, more commonly known as the Southwest Territory. The Southwest Territory was created in 1790 from land ceded to the U.S. federal government by the state of North Carolina. The process leading to Tennessee's statehood began with a popular movement within the Southwest Territory advocating for the establishment of a state government. This movement culminated in a constitutional convention that was held in Knoxville in January 1796. At this convention, delegates from across the territory drafted a state constitution and submitted it to the United States Congress for consideration. One of the key figures in Tennessee's statehood was John Sevier, a veteran of the Revolutionary War and a prominent political leader in the territory. He became a strong advocate for statehood and was later elected as Tennessee's first governor. After reviewing the submitted constitution, the U.S. Congress passed an act admitting Tennessee into the Union on June 1, 1796. Tennessee thus became the first territory to gain statehood through a grassroots movement and subsequent constitutional convention, establishing a precedent for how territories would be admitted as states in the future."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question 1: How do I convert my 2 million dollars to a billion dollars in 2 year time? Question 2: How do I convert 30 million dollars into 1 billion dollars? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"I will answer both questions separately and provide an explanation for each. Afterward, I'll compare the answers to determine if they would be the same. Question 1: To convert 2 million dollars to a billion dollars in 2 years, follow these steps: Step 1: Determine the target amount. In this case, the target amount is 1 billion dollars. Step 2: Calculate the required growth rate. To convert 2 million dollars to 1 billion dollars in 2 years, you need to find the growth rate required for that period. 1,000,000,000 (target amount) ÷ 2,000,000 (initial amount) = 500 This means you need a 500-fold increase in your initial investment over two years. Step 3: Calculate the annual growth rate. To achieve this growth rate in 2 years, your annual compound growth rate would need to be: (500)^(1/2) = about 22.36 Step 4: Convert the annual growth rate to a percentage. To convert to a percentage, multiply the result by 100. 22.36 × 100 = approximately 2,236% To achieve this goal, you need an investment that returns approximately 2,236% per year. This level of return is highly unlikely and unrealistic from an investment standpoint. Question 2: To convert 30 million dollars into 1 billion dollars, follow the same steps: Step 1: Determine the target amount (still 1 billion dollars). Step 2: Calculate the required growth rate. 1,000,000,000 ÷ 30,000,000 = 33.33 This means you need a 33.33-fold increase in your initial investment. Step 3: Calculate the annual growth rate. (33.33)^(1/2) = about 5.77 Step 4: Convert the annual growth rate to a percentage. 5.77 × 100 = approximately 577% To achieve this goal, you need an investment that returns approximately 577% per year, which is still highly unlikely and unrealistic. Comparison: The answers to both questions are not the same, as the required growth rates are different. For the first question, you need a return of approximately 2,236% per year, while for the second question, you need a return of approximately 577% per year. Both situations are unrealistic and nearly impossible to achieve through conventional investments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The painting has been imitated a thousand times, satirised, stolen and vandalised with acid, red paint, stones and even a teacup. And now, it seems, there might be a second Mona Lisa — a bigger Mona, with a less enigmatic, slightly jollier smile, and a pair of new classical columns on either side of her mysterious, beguiling face. On Friday in Geneva, the Isleworth Mona Lisa is to be revealed by its owners — a Swiss consortium, who argue that their version is Leonardo’s first stab at the painting; and that the famous version, held in the Louvre in Paris, was his second bite of the cherry. Anatoly Karpov, the chess grandmaster and member of the Mona Lisa Foundation, will unveil the painting. In comparison: The real Mona Lisa, Leonardo's enigmatic masterpiece, is seen (left); while the Isleworth Mona Lisa, a younger likeness between two pillars, is also shown (right) Opinion within the art world is split over whether it is a real Leonardo or a later copy, painted in the late 16th century, long after the original was executed, between 1503 and 1519. Among those backing the theory that it is genuine are Alessandro Vezzosi, director of the Museo Ideale Leonardo da Vinci in Vinci, the artist’s birthplace on the edge of Florence. On Friday, he will present the reasons for his conclusion, alongside Carlo Pedretti, of the University of California. A spokesman for the Mona Lisa Foundation has promised that, on Friday, the foundation will produce ‘historical, comparative and scientific evidence’ that the painting ‘was indeed executed by Leonardo’. Not everyone is so convinced. ‘I would have to be deeply sceptical,’ says Philip Mould, the portrait expert, Antiques Roadshow presenter and host of Fake Or Fortune? ‘It would be an extraordinary find, the ultimate prize. Leonardo did do variants [different versions of the same picture], like his Madonna Of The Rocks in last year’s National Gallery show. So it wouldn’t be unheard of for him to do another Mona Lisa. ‘Still, you must remember that about one new supposed Mona Lisa turns up on the market every year. You’d have to look at the provenance and history of this one very, very carefully.’ The known history of this second Mona goes back to 1914, when it was bought by a critic and artist called Hugh Blaker, from Isleworth, West London — hence the name. World famous: The painting by Leonardo da Vinci, pictured, has been imitated a thousand times, satirised, stolen and vandalised with acid, red paint, stones and even a teacup. Blaker bought the picture from a grand collection in Somerset, where it had apparently hung on the walls for a century. In 1962, an American art collector, Henry F. Pulitzer, bought the painting and devoted much of his life to proving it was an original. He even wrote a book backing his claim, Where Is The Mona Lisa?, published by the Pulitzer Press, his own company. 'I would have to be deeply sceptical. It would be an extraordinary find, the ultimate prize' Philip Mould, portrait expert. Pulitzer — and other defenders of the Isleworth Mona Lisa — depend for their attribution on Leonardo’s 16th-century biographer, Giorgio Vasari, himself a painter. Vasari said that Leonardo started the Mona Lisa in 1503 and ‘left it unfinished’. But then, in 1517, said Vasari, a completed picture of a ‘certain Florentine lady’ popped up in Leonardo’s collection. This picture is the Louvre version, while the unfinished earlier version was the Isleworth Leonardo, or so the theory goes. That order of events would explain why the Isleworth Mona Lisa looks younger than the famous version — because it was, theoretically, painted years before the famous version. Pulitzer also depended for his theory on Raphael, the painter and contemporary of Da Vinci, who sketched a version of the Mona Lisa in 1504. His sketch included the columns that are found in the Isleworth version. The final big piece in the jigsaw, said Pulitzer, was a 1584 art history book, Trattato dell’arte della Pittura  Scultura ed Architettura, by Giovanni Lomazzo, which refers to ‘della Gioconda, e di Mona Lisa’ — ‘the Gioconda, and the Mona Lisa’ — suggesting there were two pictures. Admiration: Art fans look at the Mona Lisa painting by Leonardo da Vinci, left, in the Louvre museum in Paris. The Gioconda is an alternative title for the Mona Lisa; Mona is an abbreviation of ‘Ma donna’, or My Lady, while Gioconda is Italian for the jocund, or happy, one. The sitter’s real name is in fact thought to be Lisa Gherardini, wife of a rich Florence silk merchant, Francesco del Giocondo. On Leonardo’s death in 1519, the picture — the Louvre’s version, that is! — was left to his assistant, Salai, who in turn sold it to King Francis I of France. The painting remained in the royal  collection until the French Revolution in 1789, when it was moved to the Louvre. There it has remained ever since, with a few notable absences. Napoleon kept it in his bedroom in the Tuileries Palace and, during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1, it was transferred for safekeeping to the Arsenal in Brest. During World War II, it migrated all over France to avoid damage. It has also been on tour to New York and Washington, Tokyo and Moscow. But the picture’s biggest excursion was in 1911, when it was stolen by an Italian Louvre worker, called Vincenzo Peruggia, who wanted it returned  to Italy. He pulled off the biggest art theft in history in the simplest way: hiding in a broom cupboard during the day, then slipping out after closing time, the Mona Lisa stuffed under his coat. He kept it in his flat for two years and was only discovered when he brazenly tried to flog the picture to the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. Extraordinary skill: Leonardo's exceptional Lady With An Ermine was painted in around 1490, nearly 15 years before the Louvre's Mona Lisa; and already it displays Leonardo's supreme talent. That wasn’t the end of Mona Lisa’s troubles. In 1956, the poor old girl was first scarred with acid, and then attacked with a rock. Bulletproof glass protected it when, in 1974, a disabled woman, protesting against the Louvre’s policy on handicapped visitors, threw red paint at the picture. The glass again saved the picture only three years ago, when an angry Russian woman, denied French  citizenship, threw a teacup at the painting. Meanwhile, the other supposed Mona Lisa gathered dust in a Swiss bank vault, where it has rested for 40 years. After Pulitzer’s death, he left the picture to his girlfriend and, on her death, the Swiss consortium bought it. 'She might look younger, but this is probably because the copyist — and I believe it is a copy done a few years after the Mona Lisa — just painted it that way' Martin Kemp, Oxford University. This Friday, the art world will examine it in the flesh for the first time since Pulitzer briefly exhibited it in an American show half-a-century ago. Many art historians remain doubtful. ‘So much is wrong,’ says the Leonardo expert and emeritus professor of art at Oxford University, Martin Kemp. ‘The dress, the hair and background landscape. This one is also painted on canvas, which Leonardo rarely did.’ The famous Mona Lisa is painted on wood, as are practically all of his paintings. ‘She might look younger,’ says Professor Kemp, ‘but this is probably because the copyist — and I believe it is a copy done a few years after the Mona Lisa — just painted it that way.’ The theory used to go that, because the Isleworth picture was done earlier in Leonardo’s career, he had not matured in style when he painted it. That theory was blown out of the water last year at the National Gallery exhibition, when his exceptional Lady With An Ermine was shown. That picture was painted in around 1490, nearly 15 years before the Louvre’s Mona Lisa; and already it displays Leonardo’s supreme talent. ‘That show confirmed his extraordinary skill in the way he expressed skin and modelling,’ says Philip Mould. ‘You’d have to have a dispassionate look at the technique in the Isleworth picture, and do lots of forensics. But still, nothing is impossible.’ And so the art world will wait with bated breath until Thursday, when the door of that Swiss bank vault creaks open, to see if lightning really did strike twice for the world’s greatest artist. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The article discusses the Isleworth Mona Lisa, which some believe is a second version of Leonardo da Vinci's most famous painting. A Swiss consortium owns the painting and claims that their version is Leonardo's first attempt, while the famous version held in the Louvre in Paris is his second. The Isleworth Mona Lisa, which features a younger-looking Mona Lisa with a less enigmatic smile and additional columns surrounding her face, has divided opinion within the art world over whether it is an authentic Leonardo or a later copy. Important supporters of the Isleworth Mona Lisa's authenticity include Alessandro Vezzosi, director of the Museo Ideale Leonardo da Vinci in Vinci, and Carlo Pedretti of the University of California in Los Angeles. However, other art experts and historians remain skeptical, pointing to discrepancies in the painting's background, dress, hair, and even the fact it is painted on canvas rather than wood. The history of the Isleworth Mona Lisa dates back to 1914, when it was bought by Hugh Blaker, an art critic and artist from Isleworth, West London. The painting's authenticity is based on the account of Leonardo's 16th-century biographer, Giorgio Vasari, who suggested that Leonardo started the Mona Lisa in 1503 and \\"left it unfinished\\" until a completed version appeared in 1517. This timeline supports the idea that the Isleworth Mona Lisa was painted before the famous Mona Lisa in the Louvre, hence the younger appearance of the subject.

A:","output":"The Blues Brothers movie, directed by John Landis and starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, was released in the United States on June 20, 1980. The film, which was adapted from a popular sketch on the television show \\"Saturday Night Live,\\" follows the comedic and musical misadventures of two brothers, Jake and Elwood Blues, as they attempt to reunite their band and save the Catholic orphanage where they were raised. The film has since become a cult classic, with its memorable characters, quotable lines, and lively musical performances, featuring some of the biggest names in American rhythm and blues, soul, and blues music, such as James Brown, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, and Cab Calloway. The film also includes appearances by musicians Steve Cropper, Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn, and Matt \\"Guitar\\" Murphy, who all contributed to the film's energetic live music scenes and were part of the original Blues Brothers Band. The movie had a budget of around 27 million, which was relatively high for a comedy at the time. Despite mixed critical reception at the time of its release, The Blues Brothers has endured and is now considered a beloved classic. The combination of its slapstick comedy, distinctive characters, and outstanding musical performances have contributed to its lasting popularity. The film grossed more than 115 million at the box office worldwide, and its success led to the creation of a sequel, \\"Blues Brothers 2000,\\" released in 1998, with Dan Aykroyd reprising his role as Elwood Blues and John Goodman joining the cast as Mighty Mack McTeer, replacing the late John Belushi's character. In addition to the two movies, the Blues Brothers story has expanded into other formats, including a video game, an animated TV series, comic books, and numerous live concert tours featuring various musicians from the original film and others who have joined the fold.

Reflecting a tendency among the site’s users to provide positive feedback, about twice as many of these arbitrary initial votes were positive: 4,049 to 1,942.      The first person reading the comment was 32 percent more likely to give it an up vote if it had been already given a fake positive score. There was no change in the likelihood of subsequent negative votes. Over time, the comments with the artificial initial up vote ended with scores 25 percent higher than those in the control group.      “That is a significant change,” Dr. Aral said. “We saw how these very small signals of social influence snowballed into behaviors like herding.”      Meanwhile, comments that received an initial negative vote ended up with scores indistinguishable from those in the control group.      The Web site allows users to say whether they like or dislike other users, and the researchers found that a commenter’s friends were likely to correct the negative score while enemies did not find it worth their time to knock down a fake up vote.      The distortion of ratings through herding is not a novel concern. Reddit, a social news site that said it was not the one that participated in the study, similarly allows readers to vote comments up or down, but it also allows its moderators to hide those ratings for a certain amount of time. “Now a comment will more likely be voted on based on its merit and appeal to each user, rather than having its public perception influence its votes,” it explained when it unveiled the feature in April. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A new study shows how subtle manipulations can influence people's behavior on a news website, exhibiting a herding effect.

Sir Henry Irving (6 February 1838 - 13 October 1905), born John Henry Brodribb, sometimes known as J. H. Irving, was an English stage actor in the Victorian era, known as an actor-manager because he took complete responsibility (supervision of sets, lighting, direction, casting, as well as playing the leading roles) for season after season at the Lyceum Theatre, establishing himself and his company as representative of English classical theatre. In 1895 he became the first actor to be awarded a knighthood, indicating full acceptance into the higher circles of British society. Irving is widely acknowledged to be one of the inspirations for Count Dracula, the title character of the 1897 novel Dracula whose author, Bram Stoker, was business manager of the theatre. After a few years' schooling while living at Halsetown, near St Ives, Cornwall, Irving became a clerk to a firm of East India merchants in London, but he soon gave up a commercial career for acting. On 29 September 1856 he made his first appearance at Sunderland as Gaston, Duke of Orleans, in Bulwer Lytton's play, Richelieu, billed as Henry Irving. This name he eventually assumed by royal licence. When the inexperienced Irving got stage fright and was hissed off the stage the actor Samuel Johnson was among those who supported him with practical advice. Later in life Irving gave them all regular work when he formed his own Company at the Lyceum Theatre.  For 10 years, he went through an arduous training in various stock companies in Scotland and the north of England, taking more than 500 parts.  his delineations of the various characters (...) were admirably graphic, and met with repeated rounds of applause. Possesed of a fine voice, which he modulated with great taste and judgment, he was able to mark the depth or frivolity of the character he was representing with remarkable facility.  He gained recognition by degrees, and in 1866 Ruth Herbert engaged him as her leading man and sometime stage director at the St. James's Theatre, London, where she first played Doricourt in The Belle's Stratagem. One piece that he directed there was W. S. Gilbert's first successful solo play, Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack (1866) The next year he joined the company of the newly opened Queen's Theatre, where he acted with Charles Wyndham, J. L. Toole, Lionel Brough, John Clayton, Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Wigan, Ellen Terry and Nellie Farren. This was followed by short engagements at the Haymarket Theatre, Drury Lane, and the Gaiety Theatre. Finally he made his first conspicuous success as Digby Grant in James Albery's Two Roses, which was produced at the Vaudeville Theatre on 4 June 1870 and ran for a very successful 300 nights.  In 1871, Irving began his association with the Lyceum Theatre by an engagement under Bateman's management. The fortunes of the house were at a low ebb when the tide was turned by Irving's sudden success as Mathias in The Bells, a version of Erckmann-Chatrian's Le Juif polonais by Leopold Lewis, a property which Irving had found for himself. The play ran for 150 nights, established Irving at the forefront of the British drama, and would prove a popular vehicle for Irving for the rest of his professional life. With Bateman, Irving was seen in W. G. Wills' Charles I and Eugene Aram, in Richelieu, and in 1874 in Hamlet. The unconventionality of this last performance, during a run of 200 nights, aroused keen discussion and singled him out as the most interesting English actor of his day. In 1875, again with Bateman, he was seen as the title character in Macbeth; in 1876 as Othello, and as Philip in Alfred Lord Tennyson's Queen Mary; in 1877 in Richard III; and in The Lyons Mail. During this time he became lifelong friends with Bram Stoker, who praised him in his review of Hamlet and thereafter joined Irving as the manager for the company. How did that affect his confidence?","output":"Going through various stages of his career, facing initial challenges, and eventually achieving significant successes would have had a profound impact on Sir Henry Irving's confidence. Here is the step-by-step analysis of how his career advancements likely affected his confidence: 1. Early challenges: Irving faced obstacles early in his career, including stage fright and being hissed off the stage. However, the support and guidance from fellow actors like Samuel Johnson would have helped him gain confidence and learn from his mistakes. 2. Years of training: Going through arduous training in various stock companies in Scotland and the north of England for 10 years, where he took on more than 500 roles, would have significantly developed his acting skills and increased his confidence as a performer. 3. Recognition and opportunities: As he gained recognition and started receiving opportunities to work in prominent theaters like the St. James's Theatre, Queen's Theatre, Haymarket Theatre, Drury Lane, and the Gaiety Theatre, his confidence would have continued to grow. 4. Conspicuous success in Two Roses: Irving's key success as Digby Grant in James Albery's Two Roses, which ran for 300 nights, would have been a major boost to his confidence, marking him as an accomplished and sought-after actor in the industry. 5. Association with the Lyceum Theatre: His association with the Lyceum Theatre and the subsequent successful run of The Bells, which ran for 150 nights and established him at the forefront of the British drama, would have greatly increased his confidence in his ability to lead and star in successful productions. 6. Playing iconic roles and lifelong friendship with Bram Stoker: Irving's unconventional performance as Hamlet, taking on other iconic roles like Macbeth, Othello, and Richard III, and forming a lifelong friendship with Bram Stoker (who joined him as the company's manager) would have enhanced his confidence in his ability to innovate and excel in his craft. Overall, the growth and accomplishments Sir Henry Irving experienced throughout his career would have significantly bolstered his confidence as an actor and theater producer. His determination, resilience, and talent enabled him to overcome initial challenges, earn recognition, and secure his place in British theater history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We purchased a bedroom set on October 18th and were told by our sales associate, Michael H., that the headboard was back-ordered, but that we would have it before Halloween. It is now November 1st and I have called a number of times to see what the status of our delivery was to only be given very vague answers with no real date to look for. So today we called directly to our associate, Michael H., in hopes that he could get things moving for us. Instead, he let us know that our order may not arrive until late December! When I spoke of my irritation on this, he was rude and boasting that he was right and the fault lies on everyone else...  I explained that I would like to cancel my order because we were told that the set would be in our home before Halloween and that date had come and gone. I felt that I had been misled and given false hope of our delivery times by him. He said, no you were not misled...the manufacturer pushed the shipment. I said that I didn't like that he was \\"passing the buck.\\" His response was to tell me he just wanted me to know that I was wrong and to have a nice day.  In my opinion, no matter who was at fault for the shipment delay he should have taken the responsibility and apologized.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Kennedy was born in Inverness, the son of Mary and Ian. He was brought up as a Roman Catholic, and was educated at Lochaber High School in Fort William. He went on to study for a Master of Arts degree in Politics and Philosophy at the University of Glasgow. At university he became politically active, joining the SDP, as well as the Dialectic Society. On 6 January 2006 Kennedy was informed that ITN would be reporting that he had received treatment for a drinking problem. He decided to pre-empt the broadcast, called a sudden news conference, and made a personal statement that over the past eighteen months he had been coming to terms with a drinking problem, but had sought professional help. He told reporters that recent questions among his colleagues about his suitability as leader were partly as a result of the drinking problem but stated that he had been dry for the past two months and would be calling a leadership contest, in which he would stand, to resolve the issues surrounding his authority once and for all. It was later claimed that the source for ITN's story was his former press secretary turned ITV News correspondent, Daisy McAndrew.  The admission of a drinking problem seriously damaged his standing and 25 MPs signed a statement urging him to resign immediately. It was later claimed in a biography of Kennedy by the journalist Greg Hurst that senior Liberal Democrats had known about Kennedy's drinking problem when he was elected as leader in 1999 and had subsequently kept it hidden from the public.  On 7 January 2006, Kennedy called another press conference, at which he announced that while he was buoyed by the supportive messages he had received from grass root members, he felt that he could not continue as leader because of the lack of confidence from the Parliamentary party. He said he would not be a candidate in the leadership election and was standing down as leader \\"with immediate effect\\", with Menzies Campbell to act as interim leader until a new leader was elected.  He also confirmed in his resignation statement that he did not expect to remain on the Liberal Democrat Frontbench Team. He pledged his loyalty to a new leader as a backbencher, and said he wished to remain active in the party and in politics. Campbell went on to win the resulting leadership election, and Kennedy subsequently gave his successor full public support. His leadership had lasted slightly less than six years and five months. Did he continue to stay in politics?","output":"Yes, Kennedy continued to stay in politics. After stepping down as the leader of the Liberal Democrat party, he remained an active member of the party and continued to serve as a backbencher, which means he was still a member of the parliament and participated in political activities, but not as a leader or in a prominent position.

When teenagers go on a trip in a camper van there are many clichés that you can guarantee will follow. 1)The teenagers will be warned not to go where they are going by a crazy local. Dan Van Husen handles that with ridiculous exposition about deadly Sirens. What, who, how and why are handled in one almost unintelligible burst. 2)The van will break down. 3)Whilst looking for help the group will be split up and be picked off one by one by whatever monster they have been warned about.4)They will find a house inhabited by a madman, he will capture them. 5) The house will have a phone but it will not work, it will be disturbingly decorated, there will be flickering neon light, spiders and maggots. 6)The madman will catch them as they try to escape in a vehicle that won't start (here the high speed getaway was to be made on a tractor). 7)The madman will be seemingly killed only to come back from the dead for a cheap, weak scare and will then be killed properly. 8)Only a girl will be left alive from the group. 9)There will be an unnecessary twist at the end.  Add to these elements naked Sirens (who the characters seem to react to in startling different ways despite the fact that everyone that sees them is supposed to fall into lust with them immediately) that seduce and kill the teens, throats being ripped out and bodies being pulled in half and you have something resembling a twelve year old boys dream movie. I think it is only fair to say that my opinion of the director and his previous work is as low as it is possible to be but I am happy to point out that there are a few elements that boarder on pleasurable and are a great improvement on his previous film, Darkhunters, which is one of the worst films I have ever seen. At times the cinematography is very good, the music and editing are a cut above his previous films and some other low budget horror movies. I was impressed to hear that it was achieved with a third of the money spent on the previous monstrosity. However, the worst things about this movie are not to be found in the body of the film, it is ultimately a mildly diverting if pointless movie that has been done time and time again, but amongst the DVD extras. If you do rent this film I implore you to listen to the director's commentary it is beyond belief. There is more to say about this than the film itself. One staggering part of the commentary is the director's claim that the film is cliché leaden because it was a preconceived idea. He says it is a deliberate attempt to use all of the clichés and openly he wonders if \\"people will get it\\".  I'm afraid to say that if this is supposed to be a clever nod and a wink to films of the past and the genre clichés within them then it is not wittily scripted enough, acted in an appropriate tone nor directed with enough style to work. If this film was made to order it leads me to ask one question; \\"What was the point?\\" This is s afilm that just slips right into the canon of bad horror movies, any attempt to do something clever or different haven't worked. The next nugget of brilliance is a conversation about the snobbery towards digital film formats. They rightly point out that digital is often synonymous with cheapness and ease of use. However, the best moment of the conversation comes when they bemoan the fact that when Michael Mann makes a film in the format he is branded as a visionary. There is a simple distinction to be made here; Mann is a talented director who will use the format to fit his story and style, Roberts is a horror hack who uses it to produce bottom shelf genre pictures . I think the differences are obvious and the comparison is not only arrogant but redundant. The best moment is reserved for Robert's comments about people who have taken the time to review his previous film. Those who didn't like it are generalised as 'geeks' and he even goes as far as to single out specific people for having the nerve to voice their opinion in forums that encourage them to do just that. I must admit I was slightly disappointed that my review of his last film wasn't singled out for ridicule. The tirade goes further as the group joke about Norwegian reviewers, complete with 'hilarious' accents to imply that people from Norway wouldn't know a good film simply because of where they are born. As always these sorts of comments say more about those saying them than those they are targeting, they simply make the director and his friends look ignorant. The package in rounded out with a tasteful featurette about how the Sirens were cast. Robert's swears blind in voice over, 'I didn't want to make a film that was like Baywatch' as we see audition tapes of topless and naked girls writhing around on the ground. There is also a simpering, self-indulgent documentary about the making of Darkhunters during which Robert's says that a reviewer has claimed that Forest is \\"The best British film in years\\". I don't know who he is trying to convince. At one point in the commentary track Robert's says jokingly \\"I can see people sitting at home saying \\"this isn't amazing, its sht\\" he isn't wrong. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is decidedly negative and highly critical. The reviewer not only finds the film to be clichéd and poorly executed, but they also take issue with the director's comments and attitudes evidenced in the DVD extras, questioning the director's motives and competence. The reviewer suggests that any attempts to make the film clever or different fail, and they express disappointment in the manner in which the film was created and presented.

Mark picked up a hand basket and went in while I waited and watched in the car. It took Mark over 45 minutes to choose his presents.

Step 3: Create a sentence structure: One possible subject-verb-object structure could be:          \\"[Subject: Juvenile mantis] [verb: pray] [object: what it preys on].\\" Step 4: Finalize the sentence: \\"The juvenile mantis preys on smaller insects.\\" In this sentence, \\"the juvenile mantis\\" incorporates the juvenile and mantis words, while \\"preys on smaller insects\\" connects the idea of praying or hunting for food."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Max and Page Conners (Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt) are a mother-daughter con artist team. When the film opens, the Conners are finishing a con on Dean Cumanno (Ray Liotta), an auto-body shop owner and small-time crook. The con, which the Conners have played many times before on other men, involves Max marrying Dean, passing out on their wedding night to avoid consummating the marriage, and then Page (posing as Dean's secretary) luring Dean into a compromising position to justify Max's immediate divorce and hefty settlement. The con is a success.Page declares that she wants to go solo. Max initially relents, but when they go to the bank to split their earnings, they're confronted by an IRS agent (Anne Bancroft) who declares that they owe the government a considerable sum on top of the rest of their savings, which have already been seized. Page reluctantly agrees to work one last con with Max in Palm Beach, to get enough money to pay off the IRS and set Page up to work on her own. For their target, they choose widower William B. Tensy (Gene Hackman), a tobacco baron who is addicted to his own product.While working the main con with Tensy, Page attempts a side con without her mother's knowledge. Page targets beachfront bartender Jack (Jason Lee), who is worth 3 million, but develops genuine feelings for him. Max learns of the side con and tells Page to break the relationship off, which Page does reluctantly.Tensy proposes to Max ahead of schedule, but before they can get married, he accidentally chokes and dies while trying to initiate sex with Max. While Max and Page are deciding what to do with the body, Dean arrives, having tracked Max down to apologize and propose to her again. Dean figures out that Max and Page conned him, and threatens to call the authorities. Max offers to return Dean's divorce settlement money if he'll help them make Tensy's death look like an accident. Max tells Page that their money wasn't really taken by the IRS; the agent was Max's mentor, Barbara, who agreed to help prevent Page from leaving. However, when Max, Page and Dean go to the bank, the money really has gone, having been liquidated in an act of betrayal by Barbara.In order to help Max, Page returns to Jack and accepts his proposal, planning to work it as a regular con. Page insists that Jack will not cheat on her, but is heartbroken when, on their wedding night, she breaks into her mother's room and finds him in a compromising position with Max. After the divorce settlement is paid, Dean confronts Max about the ethics of their con, pointing out that even a \\"goody-goody\\" like Jack is only human. Max reveals that Jack actually turned her down and that she had to drug him, but she defends her actions by saying that Jack would hurt Page eventually. Dean counters that Max has no right to keep Page from the man she loves because of what \\"might\\" happen.Chastened, Max tells Page the truth, admitting that her efforts to protect her daughter have only hurt her in other ways. Page returns to Jack, giving him back the bar he'd had to sell to pay the settlement, and tells him her real name. Max and Dean also get together, Dean having admitted that he still loves Max despite what she put him through. The final shot of the film is of Dean â using the name 'Stanley' â romancing Barbara, with Max watching them via binoculars, implying that Max and Dean are now working together to get Max's money back from Barbara., Question: Who do Page and Max choose as their target?","output":"Task: Provide the correct answer to the question about the movie plot.

Translate to English","output":"The idea suggested is as follows: why not register a new DNS name that would point to an existing server? Registering a new DNS name that points to an existing server can be a beneficial move for various reasons. Here is a detailed and in-depth explanation of the advantages and the process: 1. Advantages:    a. Simplified access: A new, more intuitive, and easily memorable DNS name can make it easier for users to access the website or services hosted on the server. This can lead to increased traffic and user engagement.    b. Multi-domain setup: It allows for hosting multiple websites or services under different domain names on a single server. This can help businesses maintain diverse brands and cater to varied targeted audiences without the need for additional infrastructure or cost.    c. Search engine optimization: A keyword-rich, well-designed domain name can help improve search engine rankings and enhance organic traffic.    d. Security: By deploying multiple domain names pointing to the same server, it becomes possible to implement SSL certificates for all domains without the need for additional IP addresses, enhancing security across the board. 2. Procedure:    a. Choose and register a domain name: The process begins by selecting a suitable domain name that best represents the purpose and branding of the website or service. Once chosen, it can be registered with a domain registrar. Usually, domain registration comes with an annual fee.    b. Update DNS records: After registering the new domain name, you will need to configure its DNS records, including an A record (for IPv4 address) or an AAAA record (for IPv6 address) that points to the server's IP address. This can be done through the domain registrar's control panel or by contacting their support services.    c. Configuring the server: To host multiple domain names on an existing server, you must configure the server and the underlying software (such as a web server like Apache or Nginx) to recognize and serve content for the new domain name. This is usually achieved by setting up virtual hosts, which instruct the server to serve different content based on the domain name requested.    d. Deploying SSL certificates (optional): If security is a concern, deploying SSL certificates for the newly registered domain is essential. With modern web servers, it is possible to use a single certificate for multiple domain names (SAN or Subject Alternative Name certificates), or use separate SSL certificates for each domain. In conclusion, there are various advantages to registering a new DNS name that points to an existing server, such as simplified access, multi-domain setup, search engine optimization, and enhanced security. To implement this, go through the process of domain registration, updating DNS records, configuring the server, and deploying SSL certificates (if required)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gov. Jerry Brown signed six stringent gun-control measures Friday, July 1, 2016, that will require people to turn in high-capacity... (Associated Press)      SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California's gun laws, already some of the strictest in the nation, will get even more stringent next year.      Gov. Jerry Brown signed onto much of the gun-control agenda advocated by legislative Democrats, who are clamoring to crack down in the wake of high-profile mass shootings including last year's terrorist attack in San Bernardino.      The Democratic governor signed six bills Friday requiring gun owners to give up magazines holding more than 10 rounds and to undergo a background check before they can purchase ammunition, among other measures.      While he vetoed five bills — including a one-gun-per-month purchase limit — he endorsed the most ambitious pieces of the Legislature's gun control push over the roar of gun-rights advocates frustrated by the increasing weight of restrictions.      \\"Independence and freedom and liberty in California has been chopped down at the knees and kicked between the legs,\\" said Sam Paredes, executive director of the advocacy group Gun Owners of California.      Brown's actions are consistent with his mixed record on gun control. Some of the enacted bills duplicate provisions of a November ballot measure by Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. Some of the vetoed measures also appear in Newsom's initiative, giving voters a chance to overturn Brown's veto and protecting the initiative from becoming moot.      \\"My goal in signing these bills is to enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible and focused manner, while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners,\\" Brown wrote in a one-sentence message to lawmakers.      The state's move to tighten laws further comes amid years of gridlock at the federal level, which spawned a tense clash in Washington last week as Democrats camped out on the floor of the U.S. House and shouted down Republicans.      \\"Strong gun laws work. ... What we're doing in California is a better job of keeping guns out of dangerous hands,\\" said Amanda Wilcox, a spokeswoman for the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, whose daughter was killed by a shooter using a high-capacity magazine.      Brown's action will require people who own magazines that hold more than 10 rounds to give them up. It extends a 1999 law that made it illegal to buy a high-capacity magazine or to bring one into the state but allowed people who already owned them to keep them.      In an attempt to slow gun users from rapidly reloading, the governor signed a bill outlawing new weapons that have a device known as a bullet button. Gun makers developed bullet buttons to get around California's assault weapons ban, which prohibited new rifles with magazines that can be detached without the aid of tools. A bullet button allows a shooter to quickly dislodge the magazine using the tip of a bullet or other small tool.      People will be allowed to keep weapons they already own with bullet buttons, which are often referred to as \\"California compliant,\\" but they'll be required to register them.      Brown also endorsed a bill requiring ammunition sellers to be licensed, buyers to undergo background checks and transactions to be recorded. It's the Legislature's second attempt to regulate ammunition sales after a judge struck down a 2009 law as too vague.      He also opted to require a background check before a gun can be loaned to someone who isn't a family member.      The governor vetoed an effort to expand a 6-month-old program that allows courts to temporarily restrict gun ownership rights for people suspected of being dangerous. He decided against restricting all firearm purchases to one per month, a limitation that already applies to handguns.      For the third time since 2012, he vetoed a bill requiring gun owners to report a lost or stolen firearm to authorities within five days.      \\"I continue to believe that responsible people report the loss or theft of a firearm and irresponsible people do not; it is not likely that this bill would change that,\\" he wrote in a veto message.      California is one of six states to get the highest grade from the pro-gun control Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.      ___      Associated Press writer Don Thompson contributed to this report. ||||| Fairfax, Va.— California Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law on Friday a package of gun bills that were rushed through the state legislature with no regard for proper process. The National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action (NRA-ILA) released the following statement in reaction:            “Gov. Jerry Brown today signed a draconian gun control package that turns California’s law-abiding gun owners into second-class citizens. The governor and legislature exploited a terrorist attack to push these measures through even though the state’s already restrictive laws did nothing to stop the attack in San Bernadino,\\" said Amy Hunter, California spokesperson for NRA-ILA. \\"These bills make no one safer, they only add another layer of laws that criminals will continue to break. The National Rifle Association is prepared to pursue all options moving forward – legal, legislative and political.”      Here's a summary of Brown's actions:      SIGNED BOTH- Assembly Bill 1135 and Senate Bill 880 would make changes of monumental scale to California’s firearm laws by reclassifying hundreds of thousands of legally owned semi-automatic rifles as “assault weapons.” This legislation effectively outlaws magazine locking devices, more commonly known as “bullet buttons”.These areconstitutionally protected firearms that have no association with crime. These changes would happen quickly with great individual costs to many gun owners and without public notice. Governor Brown vetoed similar legislation in 2013.      SIGNED Assembly Bill 1511 would effectively end the long-standing practice of temporarily loaning a firearm for lawful purposes. Under this legislation the ability to loan a firearm to anyone other than a family member would now be prohibited unless conducted through a dealer, absent very narrow and limited exceptions. A simple loan to a trusted friend for a few days would take almost a month to complete from loan to return, requiring two background checks, two 10 day waiting periods, two fees and multiple trips to a gun dealer. The result of the misguided legislation would turn otherwise law-abiding citizens into criminals simply for borrowing or storing a firearm with a friend.      VETO - Assembly Bill 1673 would expand the definition of “firearm” to include unfinished frames and/or receivers that are “clearly identifiable as being used exclusively as part of a functional weapon”. Depending on how this vague terminology is interpreted, AB 1673 could essentially treat pieces of metal as firearms, subjecting them to California’s exhaustive regulations and restrictions currently applicable to firearms.      VETO - Assembly Bill 1674 would expand the existing one handgun a month law to include ALL guns, including those acquired through a private party transfer. AB 1674 will have no impact on criminal access to firearms and instead significantly hamper law abiding individuals, causing increased costs, time and paperwork to purchase multiple firearms. Criminals will continue to ignore this law purchasing firearms illegally, ignoring this burdensome and ineffective restriction.      SIGNED - Assembly Bill 1695 would create a 10-year firearm prohibition for someone convicted of falsely reporting a lost or stolen firearm. The NRA does not oppose making it a misdemeanor to knowingly file a false lost or stolen report to law enforcement. Our reason for opposition is related to the restriction of a constitutional right for the conviction of a misdemeanor offense.      VETO - Assembly Bill 2607 would expand the class of individuals who could seek a Gun Violence Restraining Order (GVRO).” The NRA opposes the current GVRO procedures because they provide a mechanism for an individual to lose the right to keep and bear arms with no due process of law. AB 2607 would compound these problems by significantly expanding the classes of individuals who could seek a GVRO. This expansion would now include employers, coworkers, mental health workers and employees of secondary and postsecondary schools.      VETO - Senate Bill 894 would require a victim of a crime to report to local Law Enforcement the theft of a firearm within an arbitrary time requirement of five days and the recovery of the firearm within 48 hours. Governor Brown has twice vetoed similar legislation stating, “I was not convinced that criminalizing the failure to report a lost or stolen firearm would improve identification of gun traffickers or help law enforcement disarm people prohibited from possessing guns. I continue to believe that responsible people report the loss or theft of a firearm and irresponsible people do not.”      SIGNED - Senate Bill 1235 would place unjustified and burdensome restrictions on the purchase of ammunition and would require the attorney general to keep records of purchases. This legislation would further require any online ammunition sales to be conducted through a licensed vendor. First and foremost, the reporting of ammunition sales has already been tried -- and failed -- at the federal level. Throughout the 1980s, Congress considered repeal of a federal ammunition regulation package that required, among other things, reporting of ammunition sales. In 1986, the director of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms supported eliminating the reporting requirement, stating: \\"The Bureau and the [Treasury] Department have recognized that current record keeping requirements for ammunition have no substantial law enforcement value.\\" As a result, the Firearms Owners Protection Act of 1986 repealed the ammunition restrictions, with little opposition to the removal of that requirement. SB 1235 will similarly fail to reduce violent crime, as a law requiring the registration of ammunition purchases by honest citizens will not deter criminals. Governor Brown has twice vetoed similar legislation.      SIGNED - Senate Bill 1446 would ban the simple possession of ammunition feeding devices/magazines that are capable of holding more than 10 cartridges. The federal “large-ammunition feeding device” ban of 1994-2004 was allowed to sunset due in part to its ineffectiveness. Yet, California anti-gun legislators still are persisting with this ban knowing that the congressionally-mandated study concluded that “the banned guns were never used in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders” before the ban and the bans 10-round limit on new magazines was not a factor in multiple-victim or multiple-wound crimes. ||||| Gov.

Jerry Brown signs 6 gun-control bills, vetoes 5 1 / 12 Back to Gallery      SACRAMENTO — It will soon be harder to buy ammunition in California and illegal to own magazine clips that hold more than 10 rounds under a suite of gun-control bills Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law on Friday.      Brown signed six bills and vetoed five, actions that will nonetheless build upon the state’s arsenal of gun control laws aimed at curtailing mass shootings and keeping weapons and ammunition away from the wrong people. California already has the strictest gun laws in the nation.      Many of the 11 gun bills that landed on the governor’s desk this week were crafted in response to the mass shooting in San Bernardino in December, and got a boost of urgency following the mass shooting in an Orlando nightclub last month.      The new laws include SB880 by Sen. Isadore Hall III, D-Compton (Los Angeles County), and Sen. Steve Glazer, D-Orinda, which expands the definition of assault weapon to include specified guns with military-style features capable of accepting any type of detachable magazine. Another bill signed by the governor bans so-called “bullet buttons,” a tool developed by gun manufacturers that allows magazines to easily detach for rapid replacement.      Brown also signed SB1446 by Sen. Loni Hancock, D-Berkeley, which makes it illegal to possess magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. The sale or manufacturing of large-capacity magazines was already illegal in the state.      Among the vetoes was the only bill with bipartisan support, AB1176, which would have authorized a ballot measure asking voters to make it a felony to steal a gun or buy a stolen gun, regardless of its value.      The new restrictions led by California’s Democratic-controlled Legislature come on the heels of gridlock over gun control laws in Congress, where House Democrats staged a sit-in to protest last month.      “My goal in signing these bills is to enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible and focused manner, while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners,” Brown said in a signing message Friday.      All of the bills except AB1176 were opposed by Republicans and gun rights advocates.      “These are constitutionally illegitimate laws passed by a patently illegitimate government that had the audacity to attack and criminalize millions of its own people in Stalin-esque fashion,” said Brandon Combs, president of the Firearms Policy Coalition, a gun rights group.      Whether Californians want the state’s gun-control laws to go further will be left to voters in the fall.      Brown said he vetoed AB1176, the gun-theft felony bill, because it is nearly identical to parts of Proposition 63, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s “Safety for All” ballot initiative, which will appear on the November ballot.      But the governor signed SB1235, the ammunition background check bill, which also overlapped with Newsom’s ballot measure. SB1235 requires background checks for people buying ammunition, a license for people selling bullets and purchasing data submitted to the state Department of Justice. Newsom’s measure also requires background checks, vendor licensing and data sharing on ammunition purchases, although regulated differently.      Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León, D-Los Angeles, urged Newsom to withdraw his measure while the Legislature worked to pass the gun control legislation. Newsom declined before Thursday’s deadline to remove measures from the fall ballot.      De León’s ammunition bill, SB1235, however, was amended recently so that if signed by the governor, as it was Friday, parts of it would supersede Newsom’s ammunition proposal should voters approve it.      Newsom’s ballot measure still contains several gun control provisions that the gun lobby is fighting, including requiring gun owners to report when their firearm is lost or stolen.      “Voters will finally have a chance to take matters into their own hands and keep the momentum going with bold reforms that build on these achievements and go well beyond,” Newsom said in a statement.

Here's how the law works. Photo: Reuters      As the nation is again plunged into a debate about gun violence after the Orlando massacre, authorities in California are using a new law designed to prevent the next mass shooting by temporarily confiscating guns from people considered a danger to themselves or others.      California, which already has some of the toughest gun restrictions in the nation, this week moved forward with a sweeping new package of gun control laws that underscores the power of the Democratically controlled state to carve its own path on the issue.... ||||| “It is really far-reaching and bold, and really has the potential to save a lot of lives,” Ms. Wilcox said. “It can give us a handle on who has illegal guns in the state, as well as limiting access to ammunition by dangerous people who may have illegal guns.”      The new laws would prohibit the possession of high-capacity magazines — those holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition — for assault weapons. “These so-called high-capacity magazines are not for target shooting or hunting,” said Senator Loni Hancock, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Their sole purpose is to kill as many people as possible in the shortest period of time.”      A separate bill banned semiautomatic weapons with “bullet buttons,” which make it easy to quickly remove a magazine and replace it with another.      Among the bills Mr. Brown vetoed was one that would have expanded the definition of a firearm. “While I appreciate the author’s intent, the actual wording of the bill is unduly vague and could have far-reaching and unintended consequences,” Mr. Brown wrote in his veto message.      Shannon Grove, a Republican Assembly member who spoke out against the bills during the debate, said that none of those signed would reduce gun violence or prevent mass shootings. Instead, she said, the restrictions compromised the rights of California families to protect themselves.      “I think it’s death by 1,000 paper cuts for our Second Amendment rights,” she said. “Nowhere in this nation do you give up your rights under any other amendments.”      The signing was not the end of gun control measures that might be enacted here in the wake of a wave of violence that has traumatized the world and the nation, including the shooting in San Bernardino that killed 14 people at a holiday party in December. A separate set of gun control measures will appear before voters in November; some of them have been passed by the Legislature, but Mr. Brown vetoed those, saying they should be left to voters to decide. ||||| The carnage in Orlando on June 12 left Americans feeling helpless. And so it makes sense that many took heart in the Congressional push for gun control legislation that happened in the immediate aftermath. In light of shooter Omar Mateen’s potential ties to terrorism, Democratic politicians quickly jumped on a loophole that allows Americans on terrorist watch lists to buy guns. Connecticut senator Chris Murphy spent 14 hours leading a filibuster calling for an end to this loophole on June 15. When the Senate failed to pass any laws that might address the problem, House Democrats staged an old-school sit-in for 26 more hours. It was all very dramatic.      I appreciate their efforts. But such piecemeal measures offer very little in terms of real policy. The fact is that we need fewer guns in the United States. We need to stop selling assault rifles. And if there no way to do this in a way that satisfies constitutional scholars, we need to change the Second Amendment.      As my colleague Tim Fernholz noted earlier this week, lost in the chaos and rhetoric of the Orlando massacre is the fact that terror watch lists are ineffective, potentially discriminatory and almost certainly unconstitutional. “It may seem easier to let a secret court assess who should have these military weapons than to convince society to ban them entirely,” Fernholz wrote. “But rarely do such measures come without unintended consequences. And these proposed policies leverage the same politics of fear that many in the US came to regret after 9/11.”      What watchlist were these guys on? pic.twitter.com/cOoJI6WRwu — Imraan Siddiqi (@imraansiddiqi) June 23, 2016      It’s also worth asking why we’re pouring so much energy into what is ultimately a minor change. If it is this hard to try and get Congress to vote on a potentially ineffective bill, how will they ever push through meaningful reforms?      The National Rifle Association (NRA) has backed US politicians into a corner, spending millions to keep them in office—and in the pocket of the gun lobby. Meanwhile, the country remains loyal to a flawed, centuries-old piece of parchment written by a bunch of white men who didn’t believe women should have the right to vote and who thought that slavery was an economic necessity. There is nothing sacrosanct about our founding fathers.      In the past decade alone, thousands of American lives have been lost to guns because of the way some legal scholars interpreted a comma. It wasn’t always this way. As reported by Politico, “From 1888, when law review articles first were indexed, through 1959, every single one on the Second Amendment concluded it did not guarantee an individual right to a gun.” Rather, the amendment was interpreted as a rather dated measure meant to protect state militias prevalent during the 18th century. Thousands of American lives have been lost because of the way legal scholars interpreted a comma. What changed? A shift in NRA leadership lead to an aggressive lobbying effort meant to expand Second Amendment protections. Gun control guidelines were targeted and the “well regulated militia” aspect of the amendment was de facto erased.      Now the Constitution, much like the Bible–another flawed text used for centuries as a tool of oppression and tyranny–has become a crutch for lazy leadership and moral ambiguity. It’s an excuse for cowards to masquerade as patriots. Today, the NRA treats personal gun ownership as an inviolable right, regardless of its function or purpose. No matter that, in the case of semiautomatic assault rifles, one person’s cool toy is also the the killing tool of choice for mass murderers.      Which brings me back to Orlando. The past two weeks have not been easy for members of the LGBT community. Heading into the final days of Pride month, the mood remains somber as we remember the members of our queer family who can no longer celebrate with us.      We still do not know what exactly motivated the shooter. We do not know if he was, in fact, tied to any Islamist terror organizations even as he pledged his allegiance to them. We do not know if he was motivated instead by inner demons or mental illness or a tortured relationship with his own sexuality.      What we do know is that a man who was born in the US walked into a gun store near his home in St. Lucie and legally purchased a Sig Sauer .223 caliber assault rifle, a Glock 17, and multiple magazines and rounds of ammunitions. The Constitution, much like the Bible, has become a crutch for lazy leadership and moral ambiguity All told, he made three trips to the store, ultimately coming away with semiautomatic weaponry designed specifically so that special forces personnel could kill the most people in the quickest amount of time. (Bonus: assault-style rifles are super manly.)      Of course, Mateen was no soldier. The blood that covered the floor of the gay club that night was the blood of men and women mowed down by a rifle firing over 40 rounds per minute. His victim never had a chance.      The worst nightmare of gun rights advocates is an apocalyptic scenario in which president Barack Obama personally arrives at their doors and takes away their legally purchased guns. The idea that the government wants to run roughshod over the Second Amendment is repeated over and over in order to drum up conservative hysteria. It’s also a lie—Obama has never expressed any interest in anything remotely resembling gun confiscation.      But maybe he should.      Because if we really wanted to honor the memories of the 49 people murdered in Orlando, we wouldn’t be talking about watch lists and waiting periods. We would be talking about decreasing America’s massive gun surplus. Yes, maybe the government should come for some of our guns. Or at the very least, maybe the government should be finding ways to limit the number of civilians allowed to own highly lethal killing machines.      According to the NRA’s own blog, the assault-style AR-15 is the most popular rifle in the US. We are a nation drunk on our own gun-loving self-righteousness. It’s so popular that an estimated nine million people owned one in 2014, a number that has undoubtedly risen in the past two years as Americans rush to gun stores in the wake of every mass shooting. The cycle of violence is perpetuated by our cycle of gun purchases.      This isn’t a problem that can be solved simply by closing loopholes. We are a nation drunk on our own gun-loving self-righteousness. We are a nation so delusional that the murdering of children seems like an acceptable price to pay for the contents of your neighbor’s gun safe.      To be clear, I know plenty of responsible gun owners. I want hunters to be able to hunt—but not with semiautomatic weapons. And I would like people who enjoy a little target practice to be able to do so at to their local firing range—but not with semiautomatic weapons. If you want to fire 43 bullets a minute, join the military.      The Constitution is supposed to protect Americans’ right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. But right now, the Second Amendment ensures that killers have the right to end the lives of innocents in movie theaters, shopping malls, elementary schools and now gay bars. Orlando was a reminder that LGBT Americans have never really felt safe in America, but honestly, straight Americans shouldn’t really feel safe in America either. Not if we continue to interpret (or misinterpret) the Second Amendment.      Of course, changing the rules would be difficult. A constitutional amendment clarifying the Second Amendment would require a massive plurality in Congress, and it would then need to be ratified by three-quarters of US state legislatures. But seeing as incremental gun control reform hasn’t been working, our options seem increasingly limited. We can choose to resign ourselves to a future of endless and unnecessary bloodshed. Or we can finally accept that our right to bear unlimited arms matters less than our right to live free from the constant fear of gun violence.

The so-called \\"bullet button loophole\\" in the state's assault-weapon ban will close, the state will regulate sales of ammunition and owners of magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition must sell them or turn them into the state.      These gun restrictions are contained in legislation signed Friday by California Gov. Jerry Brown. In all, the Democratic governor signed six of the 11 gun-related bills that landed on his desk the day before following a series of votes in the State Senate and Assembly.      The signings make California's already strict gun laws more so, and follow last year's terrorist attack in San Bernardino.      In a statement, Brown said signing the legislation will \\"enhance public safety by tightening our existing laws in a responsible & focused manner while protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners.\\"      AB 1135 and SB 880 close the \\"bullet button loophole.\\" The loophole refers to the sale of \\"California legal\\" firearms that don't fall under California's ban of guns with detachable magazines. To comply with the law, manufacturers created versions of firearms that feature a button that can be pushed with a small tool — for instance the tip of a bullet — to release an empty magazine and insert a new one.      This isn't the first time Brown has faced a decision to ban firearms with a bullet button. In October 2013 he vetoed similar legislation saying it was too far-reaching.      Under SB 1235 anyone purchasing ammunition would be subject to a driver's license check, which would then be sent to the Department of Justice after the purchase.      Capitol Public Radio's Ben Adler reports this bill would take precedence should a gun control initiative on the November ballot be approved by voters.      Reports Adler:      The bill has also exposed tension between its author, Senate Leader Kevin de León and Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, who are both Democrats. Newsom has qualified a gun control initiative for the November ballot, which would regulate ammunition sales, as well as adopting similar provisions to other bills voted on Thursday. De León had asked Newsom to hold the initiative off the ballot, if the bills pass, while Newsom has refused. The two measures address background checks differently. The Newsom initiative would require buyers to obtain permits, similar to firearms permits, while De León’s bill would require a driver’s license check, which is then sent to the Department of Justice after the purchase.      Legislators established the \\"assault weapon\\" as a new classification of firearm in 1989. Following a court challenge in 2000, the law was upheld. Gun owners could keep their assault weapons provided they registered with the state before Jan. 23, 2001.      Below is an overview of the actions Brown took related to firearms legislation. ||||| \\"By acting within 24 hours after being sent these bills, and not allowing the public to voice their opinions in order to depart for his European vacation, the governor compounded the miscarriage of legislative process and procedure while demonstrating disdain for Californians who now face laws that clearly infringe on their constitutional rights,\\" the group said in a statement. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"California Governor, Jerry Brown, has signed a series of gun control bills that will tighten several gun laws in the state. Some of the new changes include a requirement for gun owners to give up magazines holding more than 10 rounds and to undergo a background check before being allowed to purchase ammunition. The new bills extend a 1999 law which made it illegal to buy a high-capacity magazine or bring one into the state, but allowed people who already owned them to keep them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Empress, the female equivalent, may indicate an emperor's wife (\\"empress consort\\"), mother (\\"empress dowager\\"), or a woman who rules in her own right (\\"empress regnant\\"). Emperors are generally recognized to be of a higher honour and rank than kings.

Sentence: \\"I sent money.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","output":"Yes, a linguist would generally consider the sentence \\"I sent money.\\" to be acceptable linguistically. It is a grammatically correct, concise, and clear sentence that effectively conveys the main action and subject involved. Here's a detailed explanation of why it is an acceptable sentence from a linguistic standpoint, broken down into several linguistic components: 1. Syntax: Syntax refers to the rules governing the arrangement of words in a sentence to form grammatical constructions. \\"I sent money.\\" follows standard English syntax, which follows a Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order. In this sentence, this order is correctly applied with \\"I\\" as the subject, \\"sent\\" as the verb, and \\"money\\" as the object. 2. Grammar: Grammar encompasses the rules dictating how words and phrases interact within a sentence. The sentence \\"I sent money.\\" demonstrates correct grammar, as it uses a subject pronoun \\"I,\\" followed by a correctly conjugated past tense verb \\"sent,\\" and finally a noun, \\"money,\\" to function as the direct object of the sentence. 3. Semantics: Semantics deals with meaning conveyed by a sentence. The sentence \\"I sent money.\\" is semantically appropriate since it presents comprehensible meaning as it indicates that the speaker performed the action of sending money. All the elements in the sentence work together to convey a complete thought. 4. Pragmatics: Pragmatics is concerned with how language is used in context and the impact of context on meaning. Though the context is not provided in the task, the sentence \\"I sent money.\\" in isolation can still be considered pragmatically acceptable from a linguist's perspective. In different contexts, the sentence could provide relevant information about a past action taken or state a reason for the current financial situation. 5. Morphology: Morphology deals with the internal structure of words and the way words are formed. In the sentence \\"I sent money,\\" the words are morphologically correct and appropriately chosen. The verb \\"sent\\" is the past tense form of the verb \\"send,\\" which is correctly used to indicate a completed action in the past. Similarly, \\"money\\" is a singular, non-countable noun that appropriately represents the object in question. In conclusion, from a linguistic standpoint, the sentence \\"I sent money.\\" demonstrates several essential components of language, such as syntax, grammar, semantics, pragmatics, and morphology. Therefore, a linguist would rate this sentence as being linguistically acceptable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A studyhas shown that people tend to believe that organic foods contain fewer calories, so buy and eat more. But people who decide to \\"go organic\\" could soon find themselves piling on the pounds. The warning comes from American researchers who studied whether the sight of an organic label was enough to influence a person's choice. For example, if people believe organic foods, produced without using pesticides   and artificial fertilizers  , have fewer calories, they may end up eating far too much and spending less time on sports activities and put on weight. Cornell University researchers said: \\" Some people mistakenly think that these foods are more nutritious  , just because they carry an organic label.\\" \\"The growing popularity of organic foods has led to some concern, as these foods may not necessarily be healthier than non-organic ones, but still may lead consumers to nutritional mis-judgments.

Dies könnte darauf hindeuten, dass sie entweder nicht über die Komplexität oder die Dauer des Hilfeleistungsprozesses Bescheid wissen oder aber unrealistische Erwartungen hinsichtlich der zeitlichen Abläufe haben. Insgesamt vermittelt dieser Satz einen Eindruck von Hoffnung und Sehnsucht, aber auch von Naivität und einer gewissen Hilflosigkeit. Es ist klar, dass die Sprecher dringend Hilfe benötigen und darauf angewiesen sind, diese aus dem Ausland zu erhalten, aber sie haben möglicherweise nicht die Mittel oder den Willen, selbst proaktiv nach Lösungen zu suchen oder sich auf ihre eigenen Fähigkeiten zu verlassen."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When your city has an unenviable reputation for insulting tourists and fleecing them for every cent, inviting hotel guests to pay what they want could be a risky move. That's the experiment being tested by several hotels in the French capital during the height of the summer season. \\"It's something like a trust contract between the client and the hotel,\\" says Aldric Duval, who came up with the \\"Payez ce que vous voulez\\" (Pay what you want) concept as a gimmick to promote Tour d'Auvergne, his three-star hotel in the city's Opera district. Duval has recruited four other city center hotels, variously rated with three and four stars, to the scheme which runs from July 21 to August 10. If guests decide their stay is barely worth a dollar -- or euro, this being","output":"Paris -- the hotel owners could be left heavily out of pocket. On the other hand, if the scheme successfully builds trust between the hoteliers and their clientele, it could lead to an increase in customer satisfaction and positive word of mouth, resulting in a long-term boost to business. As the trial period came to an end, the participating hotel owners anxiously awaited the result of the daring initiative. To their surprise and relief, the majority of guests had paid fairly, close to, if not higher than the regular room rates. Many visitors, appreciative of flexible pricing and the trust placed in them, left glowing reviews online, praising the hotel staff, the service, and the unique experience. At the same time, it seemed that the \\"Pay what you want\\" model had brought about a sense of accountability among the participating hotels. Knowing that their earnings would be directly linked to guests' satisfaction, the staff became more diligent, paying attention to the tiniest details. Consequently, service standards improved noticeably, further enhancing the visitors' perception of worth. Another unexpected outcome was the increased attention that the hotels received from local and international media. Inquiries flooded in from prospective guests, intrigued by the concept. Moreover, the \\"Pay what you want\\" movement became the talk of the tourists, with many seeking out the hotels to see what the hype was all about. As positive responses and reviews poured in, the hotel owners decided to extend the trial period, with some even contemplating making the pricing model a permanent fixture. Inspired by the success of the pilot program, other establishments in Paris began to consider adopting the concept as well, with restaurants, museums, and more joining the initiative. In an effort to rebrand Paris as a city that values its visitors and trusts their judgment, the local government acknowledged the success of the campaign and encouraged businesses across the hospitality sector to consider implementing similar or complementary strategies. Ultimately, the bold experiment by the five hotels achieved more than its initial goal of promoting a single establishment; it revitalized the city's image and strengthened its bond with the tourists. Gone were the days when visitors dreaded encountering rude staff and overpriced services. By taking a leap of faith, the Parisian hospitality industry managed to turn its reputation around, demonstrating the potential power of trust and transparency in the service sector, leaving a lasting positive impact on the city."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When two strangers from China claim him as a reincarnation of war hero 'Liu Shen' and take him to China, Sidhu, encouraged by trickster Chopstick (Ranvir Shorey), believes he will be feted as a hero, unaware of his own recruitment to assassinate the smuggler Hojo (Gordon Liu). Sidhu travels to China with Chopstick. Along the way he meets Sakhi (Deepika Padukone), the Indian-Chinese spokesmodel known as Ms. Tele Shoppers Media, or Ms. TSM, who also appears in China. Her twin sister Suzy, known as the femme fatale Meow Meow, works for Hojo, not knowing Hojo tried to kill her father, Inspector Chiang (Roger Yuan). Sidhu, through a series of accidents, initially eludes Hojo, but Hojo eventually exposes him as a fraud. Thereupon Hojo kills Dada, and Sidhu is beaten and urinated on by Hojo. Injured and disgraced Sidhu vows revenge. He thereafter encounters an amnesiac vagrant, whom he later identifies to Sakhi as Inspector Chiang. Chiang later recovers his memory and trains Sidhu in kung fu. When Hojo again meets with Sidhu, Suzy injures Chiang; but upon seeing Sakhi, betrays Hojo. Sidhu fights Hojo in single combat, eventually using a modified vegetable-cutting technique to overwhelm him. In the aftermath, Sidhu opens a vegetable stall in China, but is recruited to fight for some African pygmies.

Article: If you are really interested in music festivals, then you have probably heard of the Bestival Music Festival. It takes place every September on the Isle of Wight, the UK. As it is at the end of summer, people think it's their last chance to go to a festival and have fun before going back to boring work. The dream begins as soon as you start traveling to the island. In order to get to the campsite   of the Bestival, you have to take the ferry  . The ferry is full of happy festival lovers who are ready to take part in the fantastic music party. After you arrive at the campsite, you can put your tent up. There people talk with each other openly. They are not that cold like those you meet in your everyday life. The festival lasts for four days. During that time you forget all your worries and problems, just like living in a dream. And it is really hard for you to come back to \\"reality\\" after that.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, these two sentences are paraphrases of each other, despite some minor differences in structure and word choice. Both sentences convey similar information about a character named Barnabas Collins who introduces himself to the modern Collins family as a cousin from England. Additionally, both sentences describe this character as a hard-working businessman who is never seen during the day. The information and overall meaning communicated by the two sentences are, therefore, essentially the same. However, it is worth noting that there are some differences in structure and word choice between the two sentences. In the first sentence, the subject and object positions are 'Barnabas Collins' and 'the modern Collins family,' respectively, which is a slightly more natural phrasing in English. In the second sentence, these positions are inverted so that 'Collins' (presumably referring to Barnabas Collins) and 'the modern Barnabas Collins family' occupy the subject and object positions. This creates some awkwardness in the structure, but it does not change the overall meaning. Moreover, there are minor differences in word selection and order. The first sentence utilizes the phrase \\"a hard-working businessman,\\" whereas the second sentence uses \\"a hard-working businessman who was never seen during the day.\\" Although the second sentence adds the past tense verb \\"was\\" before \\"never seen,\\" the intended meaning remains consistent—that Barnabas Collins never appeared during daytime. In conclusion, the two sentences can be considered paraphrases since they both convey the same information about Barnabas Collins introducing himself to the modern Collins family and describing himself as a hard-working businessman. Although there are minor differences in structure, word choice, and phrasing, the overall meaning remains consistent between the two sentences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

WASHINGTON — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representative plan to hold a vote next week on an immigration bill despite Trump urging them Friday to abandon efforts to pass legislation until after the mid-term elections. Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Solve 17*y + 2*y + 76 = 0 for y.","output":"Sure, let's solve the linear equation 17y + 2y + 76 = 0 for y. To begin, we can combine the terms with y to simplify the equation as follows: (17y + 2y) + 76 = 0 19y + 76 = 0 Now, our goal is to isolate the term with y (in this case, 19y) and find the value of y that satisfies the equation. We can achieve this by performing the following steps: 1. Subtract 76 from both sides of the equation to move the constant term to the right side: 19y = -76 2. To find the value of y, we need to isolate y by dividing both sides of the equation by 19 (since 19 is the coefficient of y): 19y / 19 = -76 / 19 y = -4 Now that we have found the value of y that satisfies the equation, we can conclude that: y = -4 To confirm that our solution is correct, we can substitute the value of y back into the original equation: 17(-4) + 2(-4) + 76 -68 - 8 + 76 8 - 8 0 Since the equation equals zero, our solution of y = -4 is correct."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the French word for natural? Context: A genre that greatly rose in importance was that of scientific literature. Natural history in particular became increasingly popular among the upper classes. Works of natural history include René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur's Histoire naturelle des insectes and Jacques Gautier d'Agoty's La Myologie complète, ou description de tous les muscles du corps humain (1746). Outside ancien régime France, natural history was an important part of medicine and industry, encompassing the fields of botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology and mineralogy. Students in Enlightenment universities and academies were taught these subjects to prepare them for careers as diverse as medicine and theology. As shown by M D Eddy, natural history in this context was a very middle class pursuit and operated as a fertile trading zone for the interdisciplinary exchange of diverse scientific ideas.

Caleb Perkins was among a group of protesters who stood in the middle of 5th Ave. at 57th St. Thursday night, blocking traffic. Cops moved in when Perkins refused to leave the street. During a brief fracas, he elbowed an officer in the forehead, leaving the cop with a gash, according to court papers. The officer was not taken to the hospital. How the slaying of five officers at a Dallas protest unfolded Perkins was arraigned on a felony assault charge and misdemeanor resisting arrest and disorderly conduct charges Friday in Manhattan Criminal Court. Prosecutors consented to his release without bail. His lawyer, Moira Meltzer-Cohen, denied that Perkins attacked the officer. “After speaking to my client and the District Attorney it seems pretty evident to me that no assault occurred,” she said. 5 officers shot dead, at least 9 wounded at Dallas protest She said Perkins was an actor, dancer and church volunteer. Perkins’ boyfriend, 24-year-old Connor Hicks Douglas, wore a T-shirt that said “I didn’t do it” as he was arraigned on charges of resisting arrest and disorderly conduct for his role in the protest. Douglas hobbled to the defense table with an apparent knee injury. He also had a bandage on one elbow.

However, since you requested a detailed and lengthy answer, let us discuss the Finnish language and how negation works in it a bit more. Finnish belongs to the Uralic language family and is mainly spoken in Finland and some parts of Sweden and Norway. It is an agglutinative language, meaning that it often forms words by combining multiple smaller components called morphemes. Unlike English, where the negation is generally formed by adding words like \\"not\\" or \\"no\\" to the sentence, Finnish uses a different negation system. In Finnish, the negation is expressed through the negative verb \\"ei\\" (no), which needs to agree with the subject in person and number. For example: - Minä en (1st person singular). \\"I don't\\" in English. - Sinä et (2nd person singular). \\"You don't\\" in English. - Hän ei (3rd person singular). \\"He/She doesn't\\" in English. - Me emme (1st person plural). \\"We don't\\" in English. - Te ette (2nd person plural). \\"You (plural) don't\\" or \\"You (formal) don't\\" in English. - He eivät (3rd person plural). \\"They don't\\" in English. Furthermore, negation can also be expressed through other means, such as adjectives or adverbs that carry a negative meaning. For example, \\"ei koskaan\\" (never), \\"ei mitään\\" (nothing), and \\"ei kukaan\\" (nobody). In conclusion, the Finnish language uses a negative verb system to express negation, which contrasts with the English method of adding words like \\"not\\" or \\"no.\\" The direct translation of \\"no\\" in Finnish is \\"ei,\\" which is the 3rd person singular negative verb form."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is San Diego is a sanctuary city, however, San Diego County is a participant of the Secure Communities program. a good answer to this question?","output":"The answer you provided does not directly answer the question asked. The question asks about the number of employees in San Diego for every 137 residents, which is unrelated to San Diego being a sanctuary city or the participation in the Secure Communities program. To answer the question, we need data on the city's population and labor force. According to the United States Census Bureau, the population of San Diego in 2019 was estimated to be around 1,423,851. In order to determine the number of employees for every 137 residents, we have to look into the labor force statistics. According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2019, the civilian labor force in San Diego was around 776,157. This figure includes both the employed and unemployed members of the labor force. To calculate the employed portion of the labor force, we need to consider the unemployment rate in 2019. Data from the same source shows that the unemployment rate in 2019 in San Diego was 3.1%. Using this information, we can calculate the number of employed workers in San Diego in 2019: Employed workers = Total labor force × (1 - Unemployment rate) Employed workers = 776,157 × (1 - 0.031) Employed workers ≈ 751,482 Now, we can find the ratio of employed workers to the total population of San Diego: Employment ratio = (Number of employed workers) / (Population) Employment ratio ≈ 751,482 / 1,423,851 Employment ratio ≈ 0.5275 In other words, for every resident of San Diego, about 0.5275 of them were employed in 2019. To find the number of employed workers for every 137 residents, we can multiply this ratio by 137: Number of employed workers for every 137 residents = 0.5275 × 137 Number of employed workers for every 137 residents ≈ 72.27 So, in summary, for every 137 residents in San Diego, there were approximately 72 employees in 2019. To answer the original question, it would be more appropriate to provide this information, as it is more relevant to the context of the question than discussing the city's status as a sanctuary city and its participation in the Secure Communities program."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And as the credits began to roll, the spell of the cartoon ever so slightly released its grip, a chorus of applause burst forth, shaking the theatre walls with the force of their unwavering adoration, and a rising knowledge that they all had witnessed something truly remarkable. The curtain closed, and the theatre-goers left their seats, the animated world they had found solace in becoming a mere memory; but it was a memory that would forever remain ingrained in their souls, an enduring testament to the transformative power of art and storytelling on the human experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, this does not necessarily mean he is openly rude to her. The key difference lies in the words \\"subtly\\" and \\"openly.\\" When someone is subtly menacing, they express an intention to cause harm or discomfort to another, but do so in an indirect, understated manner. This can include using implicit threats, discreet body language, or non-verbal cues that convey hostility towards the other person. This form of communication is not direct, explicit, and can be unclear to anyone observing the interaction without a deep understanding of the context or the individuals involved. On the other hand, being openly rude refers to a more overt form of hostility towards another person. This involves explicitly belittling, insulting, or mocking someone without any attempt to conceal the intent behind the words or actions. Being openly rude leaves little doubt about the hostility and is very clear to anyone witnessing the interaction. Based on the original phrase, it is clear that the man is being subtly menacing in response to her objection. There is no mention or evidence to suggest that he is openly rude to her.

Article: However, asymmetry of causation can be observed in a non-arbitrary way which is not metaphysical in the case of a human hand dropping a cup of water which smashes into fragments on a hard floor, spilling the liquid. In this order, the causes of the resultant pattern of cup fragments and water spill is easily attributable in terms of the trajectory of the cup, irregularities in its structure, angle of its impact on the floor, etc. However, applying the same event in reverse, it is difficult to explain why the various pieces of the cup should fly up into the human hand and reassemble precisely into the shape of a cup, or why the water should position itself entirely within the cup. The causes of the resultant structure and shape of the cup and the encapsulation of the water by the hand within the cup are not easily attributable, as neither hand nor floor can achieve such formations of the cup or water. This asymmetry is perceivable on account of two features: i) the relationship between the agent capacities of the human hand (i.e., what it is and is not capable of and what it is for) and non-animal agency (i.e., what floors are and are not capable of and what they are for) and ii) that the pieces of cup came to possess exactly the nature and number of those of a cup before assembling. In short, such asymmetry is attributable to the relationship between temporal direction on the one hand and the implications of form and functional capacity on the other.

Short movie review: seriousness and quality  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"In this short movie review, the critic expressed their thoughts on the seriousness and quality of the film. It is essential to examine the specific points the critic discussed, as well as the tone of the review, in order to determine whether their opinion was positive or negative. To begin, the focus on seriousness suggests that the film in question is likely a drama or deals with weighty subject matter. If the critic highlights the movie's ability to handle serious topics with care and skill, it's possible that they found the film engaging and thought-provoking. Key aspects the critic may have mentioned include the film's mature themes, character development, strong performances, and the overall emotional impact it had on the audience. Further, discussing quality requires a comprehensive analysis of various aspects of the film, such as its script, direction, cinematography, and editing. A positive review might praise the movie's strong storyline, unique filmmaking techniques, or memorable visuals, along with its capacity to capture the viewer's attention and immerse them into the narrative. Positive remarks about the film's direction would emphasize the filmmaker's intentionality, artistry, and mastery of the medium. On the other hand, should the critic point out flaws in the film's seriousness or approach to its subject matter, it could reflect a negative perception of the movie. For instance, if the critic argues that the film failed to treat important topics with sensitivity, they may feel that the movie was exploitative or shallow. Additionally, the critic may mention issues with the film's pacing, plot inconsistencies, or underdeveloped characters as factors that detracted from the overall viewing experience. Regarding the film's quality, a negative review may touch on its weak storylines, clichéd themes, or lack of innovation in filmmaking. Similarly, criticism directed towards the film's direction, acting performances, or production values might imply that the movie was amateurish or uninspired. Considering the above factors, it is crucial to note the balance between positive and negative remarks within the review. If the critic predominantly focuses on the film's capacity to connect with audiences through its seriousness and high-quality production, it can be inferred that their perspective is primarily positive. However, if the reviewer's comments lean more towards disappointment with how the movie dealt with its subject matter or its subpar quality, it would be safe to assume that they viewed the film negatively. In conclusion, understanding whether the critic thought positively or negatively of the movie depends on a comprehensive analysis of the tone and content of the short review. By delving into their assessment of the movie's seriousness and quality, one can gain insights into their overall opinion and determine whether their review was primarily favorable or unfavorable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Aboard Air Force One, Nov. 22, 2006 President Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki will meet next week in Jordan to discuss the deteriorating security situation in Iraq. Can we infer the following? Jordan will host the meeting between President Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.","output":"Yes, we can indeed infer that Jordan will host the meeting between President Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki based on the information provided. The statement clearly mentions that the meeting is scheduled to occur \\"next week in Jordan,\\" indicating that the chosen location for the meeting is within the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. The decision to hold this crucial meeting in Jordan could be attributed to several factors, some of which are: 1. Neutral ground: By choosing a third-party country like Jordan, both the United States and Iraq are ensured a neutral meeting ground which helps maintain a balance in diplomatic discussions. Jordan, being a neighbouring country to Iraq and a key U.S. ally in the Middle East, further reinforces its suitability as a meeting location. 2. Security concerns: Jordan has a reputation for being a relatively stable and secure nation within the region. Given that the purpose of the meeting is to discuss the deteriorating security situation in Iraq, it is imperative that both leaders and their accompanying delegations are able to meet in a secure environment, without the added concerns of potential threats or disturbances that may arise in either Iraq or the United States. 3. Regional diplomacy: Holding the meeting in Jordan may also be a strategic move to involve regional partners and stakeholders in the discussions and potential solutions for the security crisis in Iraq. Jordan's geographic proximity to Iraq, as well as its diplomatic relations within the region, underscores its role as a potential mediator or facilitator in any collaborative efforts that may arise from the high-level talks between President Bush and Prime Minister al-Maliki. 4. Confidentiality: Meeting in a third-party country allows the leaders of these nations to meet privately and maintain an atmosphere of discretion surrounding their discussions. In such high-stakes diplomatic situations, both President Bush and Prime Minister al-Maliki understand that privacy is essential in order to have candid conversations about the best way to address the security challenges facing Iraq. In conclusion, the information provided indicates that Jordan will host the meeting between President Bush and Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in November 2006. Based on this information, we can infer that the choice to hold this critical discussion in the neutral territory of Jordan is likely motivated by factors such as neutrality, security, regional diplomacy, and confidentiality. From this perspective, the meeting's location in Jordan serves to foster a conducive environment for productive and focused dialogue on the pressing issues of Iraq's security situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"\\"Drill\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is the most contextually appropriate and logical choice among the possible answers provided. A master carpenter is a highly skilled professional who works primarily with wood and other materials to create and repair various structures, furniture, and objects. In this context, the ability to make holes in the materials being worked on is essential. A drill is a power tool commonly used by carpenters and other tradespeople to create holes in materials by applying pressure and rotation. The drill is designed specifically for this purpose, and it is a practical and efficient tool for a master carpenter to use. The other options – learn, require obedience, understand, and spoon – are not relevant or applicable to the question.

However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management.

The two meet for the first time when Bugsy visits his friend, actor George Raft, on a film set. He buys a house in Beverly Hills from opera singer Lawrence Tibbett, planning to stay there while his wife and two daughters remain in Scarsdale. As a representative for his associates Meyer Lansky and Charlie Luciano, Bugsy is in California to wrestle control of betting parlors away from Los Angeles gangster Jack Dragna. Mickey Cohen robs Dragna's operation one day. He is confronted by Bugsy, who decides he should be in business with the guy who committed the robbery, not the guy who got robbed. Cohen is put in charge of the betting casinos; Dragna is forced to admit to a raging Bugsy that he stole 14,000, and is told he now answers to Cohen. After arguments about Virginia's trysts with drummer Gene Krupa and a variety of bullfighters and Siegel's reluctance to get a divorce, Virginia makes a romantic move on Bugsy.

Murray Newton Rothbard (; March 2, 1926 - January 7, 1995) was an American heterodox economist of the Austrian School, a historian, and a political theorist whose writings and personal influence played a seminal role in the development of modern right-libertarianism. Rothbard was the founder and leading theoretician of anarcho-capitalism, a staunch advocate of historical revisionism, and a central figure in the twentieth-century American libertarian movement. In 1953, in New York City, he married JoAnn Schumacher (1928-1999), whom he called Joey. JoAnn was his editor and a close adviser, as well as hostess of his \\"Rothbard Salon\\". They enjoyed a loving marriage, and Rothbard often called her \\"the indispensable framework\\" behind his life and achievements. According to Joey, patronage from the Volker Fund allowed Rothbard to work from home as a freelance theorist and pundit for the first fifteen years of their marriage. The Fund collapsed in 1962, leading Rothbard to seek employment from various New York academic institutions. He was offered a part-time position teaching economics to the engineering students of Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1966, at age 40. This institution had no economics department or economics majors, and Rothbard derided its social science department as \\"Marxist.\\" However, Justin Raimondo writes that Rothbard liked his role with Brooklyn Polytechnic because working only two days a week gave him freedom to contribute to developments in libertarian politics.  Rothbard continued in this role for twenty years, until 1986. Then 60 years old, Rothbard left Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute for the Lee Business School at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he held the title of S.J. Hall Distinguished Professor of Economics, an endowed chair paid for by a libertarian businessman. According to Rothbard's friend, colleague and fellow Misesian economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Rothbard led a \\"fringe existence\\" in academia, but was able to attract a large number of \\"students and disciples\\" through his writings, thereby becoming \\"the creator and one of the principal agents of the contemporary libertarian movement.\\" Rothbard maintained his position at UNLV from 1986 until his death. Rothbard founded the Center for Libertarian Studies in 1976 and the Journal of Libertarian Studies in 1977. In 1982, he co-founded the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama, and was vice president of academic affairs until 1995. The Institute's Review of Austrian Economics, a heterodox economics journal later renamed the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics, was also founded by Rothbard in 1987.  After Rothbard's death, Joey reflected on Rothbard's happiness and bright spirit. \\"...he managed to make a living for 40 years without having to get up before noon. This was important to him.\\" She recalled how Rothbard would begin every day with a phone conversation with his colleague Llewellyn Rockwell. \\"Gales of laughter would shake the house or apartment, as they checked in with each other. Murray thought it was the best possible way to start a day.\\" Rothbard was irreligious and agnostic toward the existence of God, describing himself as a \\"mixture of an agnostic and a Reform Jew.\\" Despite identifying as an agnostic and an atheist, Rothbard was critical of the \\"left-libertarian hostility to religion\\". In Rothbard's later years, many of his friends anticipated that he would convert to Catholicism, but he never did.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Coldrum Stones alongside the other Medway Megaliths. In 1926, the Coldrum Stones were given to The National Trust, which dedicated it as a memorial to the Kentish prehistorian Benjamin Harrison. A plaque was erected to mark this, which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle; in 1953, the archaeologist Leslie Grinsell expressed the view that \\"it is hoped that this error may be rectified in the near future\\". Still owned by the Trust, the site is open to visitors all year round, free of charge. On their website, the Trust advises visitors to look for \\"stunning views from the top of the barrow\\". John H. Evans characterised the site as \\"the most impressive\\" of the Medway Megaliths, while Grinsell described it as \\"the finest and most complete\\" of the group.Among the Pagans who use the Coldrum Stones for their ritual activities, there is general satisfaction with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in the centre of the monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so in the same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up.  answer the following question:  What is the name of the site for which the responsible Trust warden has chosen to leave the patch of scorched earth rather than seeding it over?

Choose from the possible answers, would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? For Jenny, I intended to be present. Choose from:  -- unacceptable.  -- acceptable.","output":"The sentence, \\"For Jenny, I intended to be present,\\" would be deemed acceptable by a linguist.  This sentence is grammatically correct and communicates a clear message. Let's break it down: Firstly, the phrase \\"For Jenny\\" acts as a prepositional phrase that modifies the whole sentence. It means that whatever action the speaker is intending to do benefits or involves Jenny. Prepositional phrases lend more context to sentences and are quite normal in English language structure. The core of the sentence is \\"I intended to be present,\\" which is a simple, past-tense statement. It is made up of the subject \\"I\\", the verb \\"intended\\", and a to-infinitive verb phrase \\"to be present\\". \\"I\\" is the subject of the sentence, the one to whom the action pertains. \\"Intended\\" is the verb, a past tense form of the verb \\"to intend\\". It may be worth noting that a simple past tense verb is absolutely fine to use when referring to past intentions. And finally, \\"to be present\\" adds both detail and depth to the intention communicated, with the pairing of \\"to be\\" (a perfectly correct infinitive form of the verb \\"to be\\") with the adjective \\"present\\".  Just to solidify our analysis, we can compare this sentence to an unquestionably correct sentence: \\"For my birthday, I wanted to have cake\\". \\"For my birthday\\" is the equivalent of \\"For Jenny\\", \\"I wanted\\" is similar to \\"I intended\\", with both statements using the first person past simple, and \\"to have cake\\" is structurally comparable with \\"to be present\\", with both parts being infinitive verb phrases.  In conclusion, there are no grammatical errors or unusual constructs that would make this sentence unacceptable by a linguist. The syntax, semantics, and morphology are all in line with the standard conventions of English language, hence it can be confidently categorized as \\"Acceptable\\". It is grammatically correct, the word choice is appropriate, and the statement clearly conveys a past intention related to 'Jenny'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions.  - Carol Patricia Mas (born October 20, 1955), professionally known as Carolyne Mas, is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, pianist, and producer. She broke out of the Greenwich Village music scene boom of the late 1970s, along with other artists such as Steve Forbert, The Roches, and Willie Nile. Although she remains relatively unknown in the United States, except for a loyal cult of fans, she managed to gain popularity in Europe and Canada, mostly due to the use of television as a promotional tool in these markets. Her records did well in the charts in Canada, but her greatest success was in Germany, where a live album, \\"Mas Hysteria\\", was released by Phonogram. It was originally intended to promote her upcoming appearance on Rockpalast in January 1981, and included her most significant hit, \\"Sittin' in the Dark\\".  - Willie Nile (born Robert Noonan on June 7, 1948) is an American singer-songwriter. In 1980, Nile released his self-titled debut album.

Question: Who insults Mauser in front of the recruits? Title: Police Academy 3: Back in Training Movie plot: The movie begins in a large garage structure, where Captain Proctor (Lance Kinsey) and Commandant Mauser (Art Metrano) (from Police Academy 2) meet up with former Police Academy cadets, (now Sgts.) Chad Copeland (Scott Thomson) and Kyle Blankes (Brant van Hoffman) (from the first Police Academy movie). It seems one of the two Police Academy schools is getting the axe, and Mauser wants Copeland and Blankes to make sure that Lassard's one screws up.The next day, after the governor's speech in which he will appoint a committee to evaluate which of the two schools should remain open, Mauser starts getting an edge by kissing up to the governor (offering the committee an escort, showing governor pages of useful tactics, etc.). Nearby, the elderly and slow-witted Commandant Lassard (George Gaynes) gets an idea on how to win: along with now Sgt. Jones (Michael Winslow) and Lt. Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), he calls back his former class of '84 alumni misfits; Sgt. Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), Sgt. Hightower (Bubba Smith), and Sgt. Tackleberry (David Graf) to the acdemy to help train the new recruits. Among the new recruits are Sgt. Fackler's wife (Debralee Scott), the nerdish store owner Sweetchuck (Tim Kazurinsky) (from Police Academy 2), former street gang leader Zed (Bobcat Goldthwait) (also from Police Academy 2), Karen Adams (Shawn Weatherly), and Tackleberry's brother-in-law Bud Kirkland (Andrew Paris). Tomoko Nogata (Brian Tochi) is a slow-witted Japanese recruit of Mauser's academy, but decides to put him in with Lassard's academy instead.After a few weeks of recruiting, Nogata is lovestruck over Callahan, and Sweetchuck contemplates quitting after his roommate Zed drives him crazy (although Tackleberry talks him out of it). Copeland and Blankes make the recruits do stuff that would make the committee think they were hopeless. Mauser wants them out on the field soon, knowing the committee will be there.

Q: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — During his first year in office, South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s persistent pursuit of diplomacy, often working in parallel with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign, played a significant role in persuading North Korea to engage in talks to end its nuclear program. “Before the extreme measures might have been chosen by the United States, he gave diplomacy another chance to succeed,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University’s Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul. A year ago this week, Moon, a former human rights lawyer and candidate for the progressive Democratic Party, won a special presidential election held after former conservative President Park Geun-hye was impeached for her involvement in a bribery and corruption scandal. This year, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison during criminal trial related to the scandal in which she was charged with abuse of power, coercion and bribery. Moon assumed power at a time of increasing tensions, not just concerning North Korea’s accelerated nuclear and ballistic missile tests, but also China’s imposing of informal economic sanctions against South Korea for deploying the U.S. THAAD missile defense system, and the Trump administration’s talk of possible military action to end the North’s efforts to develop a nuclear armed intercontinental missile that could strike the U.S. mainland. In his inaugural address in May 2017, Moon promised to engage in shuttle diplomacy with Washington, Beijing and Pyongyang to work out a peaceful solution to the growing crisis. In a July speech in Berlin, President Moon laid out his vision for inter-Korean reconciliation that called for peaceful co-existence of the two Korean governments, but also said that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is “the absolute condition for peace.” But unlike past progressive South Korean governments that provided unconditional economic assistance, the Moon administration complied with economic sanctions in place and...

It is a shame that they had to associate this garbage to The Angels 1963 song \\"My Boyfriend's Back.\\" If you have to make a choice between watching this movie and painful dental work, I would suggest the dental work.","output":"The sentiment of the given review is strongly negative. The reviewer expresses profound dissatisfaction and disappointment with the movie they are discussing. There are several points that clearly demonstrate the unfavorable sentiment: 1. The reviewer claims to have seen over 1000 movies, which establishes them as an experienced movie viewer with a broad range of exposure to films. This suggests that their opinion on what constitutes a good or bad movie comes with a certain degree of credibility. 2. They categorize the movie in question as among the worst they have ever seen. This statement indicates that the reviewer found the film to be of exceptionally low quality and it failed to meet their expectations on various levels, finding it difficult to find redeeming qualities. 3. The association of the movie with The Angels' 1963 song \\"My Boyfriend's Back\\" is perceived as a shame, implying that the reviewer holds the song in high regard and feels that its attachment to the film tarnishes its reputation. This reveals a disapproval of the movie's content and a sense of disappointment for negatively impacting the song's legacy. 4. The final statement of the review advises others to choose painful dental work over watching the movie. This comparison not only expresses the reviewer's intense negative sentiment but also serves as a warning to potential viewers to steer clear of the film. Suggesting that the alternative of undergoing dental pain is preferable highlights just how unworthy the movie is perceived to be. In conclusion, the sentiment expressed in the review is decidedly negative. The reviewer articulates their distaste for the film through strong comparisons, expressing disappointment in the film's connection to a cherished song and ultimately warning potential viewers to avoid the movie altogether."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Who in Roman mythology, was the goddess of strife?","output":"In Roman mythology, the goddess associated with strife is known as Discordia. Discordia is the personification of disagreement, conflict, and chaos. She is known to wield the element of discord and could incite battles and quarrels among individuals and groups, leading to a breakdown of social order and harmony. Discordia is derived from the Latin word 'discord', which means 'disagreement' or 'dissension'. Despite being a relatively less significant figure in Roman religion when compared to prominent gods and goddesses, Discordia played a critical role in various Roman myths and legends. Discordia was, however, a parallel figure to the well-known Greek goddess of strife named Eris. While both figures are similar in terms of attributes and purpose, the myths and tales surrounding these goddesses differ slightly according to Roman or Greek perspectives. Eris, in Greek mythology, was the daughter of Nyx, the personification of night, and Erebus, the personification of darkness. Eris has numerous siblings, including Thanatos (death), Hypnos (sleep), and Nemesis (retribution), among others. She was acknowledged as both a mischievous and malevolent entity. In some accounts, Eris was also considered to be the mother of various Spirits of Hardship known collectively as the Kakodaimones, including Ponos (toil), Lethe (forgetfulness), and Horkos (oath), to name a few. The most well-known myth involving Eris is the tale that led to the Trojan War, which stemmed from her absence at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. Eris, who was renowned for sowing discord, was intentionally excluded from this event. In retaliation, she crafted a beautiful golden apple, known as the \\"Apple of Discord,\\" which bore the inscription \\"To the fairest.\\" Eris then threw the apple into the festivities, leading to a disagreement between the goddesses Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite as to who deserved this distinguished title. Eventually, this dispute escalated, and the Trojan prince, Paris, was appointed to judge the matter. After each goddess attempted to bribe Paris, Aphrodite's bribe to grant him Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world, won out. Consequently, Paris awarded Aphrodite the apple, ultimately leading to the abduction of Helen, exacerbating the hostilities between the Greeks and Trojans, and resulting in the outbreak of the Trojan War. In conclusion, Discordia was the goddess of strife in Roman mythology. She was derived from the Greek goddess Eris, who had the same attributes of creating chaos and conflict among individuals or groups. Though seldom worshiped or celebrated, her presence could be felt in many myths and legends, and she played an essential role in weaving some of the most iconic stories in the ancient world, such as the infamous Trojan War. Overall, Discordia stands as a symbol of the destructive potential of jealousy, rivalry, and discord."},{"instruction":"Title: Don't waste your money Review: I am about halfway through this book and have serious doubts about being able to finish it.The writing style is juvenile and irritating.

The most popular resort with holidaymakers is Ubud north of Sanur. When to go? Bali has a tropical climate year round with an average daily temperature of 31degC(87degCF). The wet season is between October and April. The dry season is between May and September, and is the busiest time to visit the island as travelers take advantage of the long hot days and little rain. Beach Bali has a string of beaches, mainly in the south of the island. Head away from Bali's beaches and a totally different world awaits you. Ubud is an easily accessible  jungle resort town with a good range of hotels, shops and restaurants. The active volcano of Mount Batur is a highlight and so are the mountain lakes.

He becomes a taxi driver to cope with his chronic insomnia, driving passengers every night around the boroughs of New York City. He also spends time in seedy porn theaters and keeps a diary. Travis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. After watching her interact with fellow worker Tom through her window, Travis enters to volunteer as a pretext to talk to her, and takes her out for coffee. On a later date, he takes her to see a Swedish sex education film, which offends her, and she goes home alone. His attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers are rebuffed, so he berates her at the campaign office, before being kicked out by Tom. Travis confides in fellow taxi driver Wizard about his thoughts, which are beginning to turn violent, but Wizard assures him that he will be fine, leaving Travis to his own destructive path. Travis is disgusted by the sleaze, dysfunction, and prostitution that he witnesses throughout the city, and attempts to find an outlet for his frustrations by beginning a program of intense physical training.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Article: Every human being has a unique arrangement of the skin on his fingers and this arrangement is unchangeable. Scientists and experts have proved the uniqueness of finger-prints and discovered that no exactly similar pattern is passed on from parents to children, though nobody knows why this is the case. The ridge structure on a person's fingers does not change with growth and is not affected by surface injuries. Burns, cuts and other damage to the outer part of the skin will be replaced in time by new one which bears a reproduction of the original pattern. It is only when the inner skin is injured that the arrangement will be destroyed. Some criminals make use of this fact to remove their own finger-prints but this is a dangerous and rare step to take. Finger-prints can be made very easily with printer's ink. They can be recorded easily. With special methods, identification can be achieved successfully within a short time. Because of the simplicity and economy of this system, finger-prints have often been used as a method of solving criminal case. A suspected man may deny a charge but this may be in vain. His finger-prints can prove who he is even if his appearance has been changed by age or accident. When a suspect leaves finger-prints behind at the scene of a crime, they are difficult to detect with the naked eye. Special techniques are used to \\"develop\\" them. Some of the marks found are incomplete but identification is possible if a print of a quarter of an inch square can be obtained. Question: It is   _  for a criminal to deny his crime when finger-prints are used to identify him. Yes or no, is the answer \\"useless\\"? A:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"useless.\\" It is useless for a criminal to deny his crime when fingerprints are used to identify him, as fingerprints provide strong evidence of a person's presence at a crime scene. Fingerprints are unique to each individual, making them an effective method for accurately identifying someone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Does use mean the same thing in these two sentences?","output":"No, the word \\"use\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences, although it might appear to be the same word. In fact, \\"use\\" functions differently in terms of context and semantics in these two sentences. In Sentence 1: \\"We only use Spanish at home,\\" the word \\"use\\" pertains to the language spoken or employed in communication. In this context, \\"use\\" conveys adopting or utilizing a particular language – Spanish – as the medium of communication at home. The meaning of \\"use\\" here is tied to the functional aspect of language. In Sentence 2: \\"I can't use this tool,\\" the word \\"use\\" relates to the ability or capability to operate or handle a specific tool or device. In this case, \\"use\\" signifies the physical or mental manipulation of an object, presumably to accomplish a particular task or achieve a goal. The meaning of \\"use\\" here is focused on the practical action involving a tool or instrument. To summarize, even though the word \\"use\\" appears in both sentences, it serves different functions and bears distinct meanings in each case. In the first sentence, \\"use\\" concerns the employment of a language as a means of communication, while in the second sentence, \\"use\\" denotes the action of operating a tool or instrument.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he is considering tariffs, quotas, and retaliatory taxes on imports of steel and aluminum from countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea.

The president said U.S. steel and aluminum industries are being \\"decimated\\" by the \\"dumping\\" of cheap imports of those materials into U.S. markets. Trump has long threatened what he calls \\"reciprocal\\" trade action to deal with steel, aluminum, and other imports.  But he has so far avoided taking any major steps, ostensibly out of fear of hurting the country's strong economic performance since he took office.  Several lawmakers on Tuesday urged Trump to be cautious when considering retaliatory trade steps, saying such measures could spark a trade war that leads to higher prices for U.S. producers and consumers.  \\"It's very, very much a double-edged sword,\\" Trump conceded.  \\"I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry,\\" he added.  The Trump administration is currently renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as well as the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement with South Korea.

Hurt feelings and anger can lead to lower employee morale   as well as a loss of productivity and a poor work environment. As a manager. you should find some ways yourself to solve the conflict. The goal is to build a team-centered workforce. You can use role-reversal   methods to help each employee understand how the other feels. This model works best when there are only two parties involved. You can hold a meeting with annoyed workers in your office. You might say. \\"Jane, explain to me how you would feel if Nancy went to lunch with your clients ( ) without telling you?\\" Or. \\"Nancy, how would you respond if Jane came to me with complaints about you, but hadn't tried to talk to you about them first? \\" Workers often respond better to praise than criticism.

The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

It's hard to believe that a place that has had a grand opening and has been open for two full weeks would be assembling tables during lunch time on a Saturday, and lacks any highchairs, but that was the case at Mama Theresa's in Tega Cay. When the owner was questioned about the lack of highchairs, he noted that they were on backorder, and that customers have requested them every day since they have been open. Don't try for delivery yet, either, even though the menu says they offer it. According to the owner, they don't have their Point Of Service program in operation, and until that happens, delivery isn't an option.  Pizza, as a food in general, is usually pretty good even when it isn't the best, and Mama Theresa's is good enough. Veggie Lasagna served in a portion large enough for three is also middle of the road, but for the price, is acceptable.  Located in Graystone Crossing in the former J & S Butcher Shop space (let's pour one out for the dearly departed butcher homeys, please), outdoor signage is banners, and the interior du00e9cor is sparse. Most of the wall art is promotional posters for pasta sauce, which indicates that they don't make their own. If memory serves, though, those posters might be remnants from the butcher shop, which sold fresh pasta and sauce. So, they are either advertising that they don't have house made sauce, or they have pictures of another business's products.

But do you know that a colour has weight? I think you'll say \\"no\\". But I am afraid you are wrong. If you don't believe, you may do a small experiment . First, put two objects with the same weight into two boxes. Then cover the boxes. Wrap  one box with a red piece of paper, the other with a white piece of paper. Now hold the boxes with your hand one by one. It is certain that you will think the red one is a little heavier. Why does it happen? A scientist found that different colours have different weight in a man's mind. So he did many tests and at last he got the result. That is to say, every colour has its own weight in our mind. The heaviest colour is red, then blue, green, orange, yellow and white. The scientists told us that colours also have smell. Can you smell the colour? Of course not. Then why did the scientists say so? That is because every colour represents a kind of light wave ------ a certain wavelength . It reaches our brain  through organs  According to this discovery, scientists say that people accept the colour they like, and _ the colour they hate. So your body and mind will be healthy by using the colours you like. Or you'll be nervous or even get ill.

Two neighboring countries with similar economies, followed different political and economical agendas. Niger developed its infrastructure and communications technology, while Nigeria didn't.  Hint: Distance decay is a geographical term which describes the effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions. The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease.  With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1] A:","output":"Nigeria will be less developed as a consequence of their agendas because it did not focus on developing its infrastructure and communications technology like Niger did."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To give yourself maximum control, imagine that your steering wheel is a clock and keep your hands at the 9-o’clock and 3-o’clock positions. This is particularly important for vans because, if you don’t keep a firm grasp on the wheel, you could lose control of the vehicle and cause a rollover. Vans are heavier and bulkier than normal cars, meaning they take longer to brake. To account for this, leave more space than normal between yourself and other cars. As a general rule, leave at least 4 seconds of distance between you and the car in front of you. To calculate how far behind a car you are, wait until the car passes a clear object or road marker. As soon as it does, count how many seconds it takes until you pass that same object. Depending on the area and the exact size of the vehicle, your van may be subject to special speed restrictions different from the posted speed limit. In most cases, this will be 10 miles (16 km) per hour lower than the max for standard cars. To see if an area you’re traveling in enforces van-specific speed limits, contact the local Department of Motor Vehicles or search online for local driving regulations. Vans are tall and narrow, which means they’re more prone to tipping over. Though not usually a problem on straight paths, this can make turning more precarious. To minimize the risk of tipping, slow down to around 5 to 10 miles (8.0 to 16.1 km) per hour before making sharp turns. To avoid colliding with curbs, road signs, and other vehicles, make sure your van is positioned in the left or right-most lane, depending on which direction you need to turn. Make sure other vehicles are far enough away from the van that you won’t side sweep them when turning. Then, make your turn, waiting until you are far enough into the intersection that your vehicle’s back end won’t hit other cars. Before changing lanes or backing up, put on your blinkers to indicate your intentions. Then, check all your mirrors for other cars and pedestrians. If your cargo van has a clear back window, turn your head and look through it to make sure there are no cars in your blind spot. If necessary, get out of your van to check the surroundings before backing up. Though vans are not as large as semi trucks, they are significantly taller than normal cars, meaning they may not be able to go under bridges and ledges other vehicles can. Before going under a low ledge, check the clearance sign on top to see if your van is short enough to fit underneath. Do not go under ledges that are lower than your vehicle. Most major bridges are tall enough to accomodate semi trucks, so look out primarily for old, small-town bridges and clearance poles at places like gas stations and fast food restaurants. Summary:","output":"When driving a van, keep 2 hands on the wheel in the 9 and 3 o'clock positions for control. Vans are bigger and heavier, so leave more space between you and other cars. Watch for special speed limits and be extra careful when turning. Use your mirrors, blinkers, and check your surroundings before changing lanes or backing up. Remember, vans are taller, so watch out for low bridges or ledges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

We returned to the dusty streets of New Jerusalem, and I had to keep on reminding myself that I was supposed to have been in France, and 'polly-voo' for my chums, and tell whoppers about the Eiffel Tower and the fancy bread and the snails and frogs we'd eaten.

The husband of the 36-year-old Brooklyn teacher charged with having repeated statutory trysts with one of her high school students wants a divorce, it has been revealed. A source told the New York Post that Jimmy Lathrop, 39, is now looking for a lawyer to help him divorce his wife Erin Sayar, who is accused of statutory rape. He was seen yesterday at Brooklyn Criminal Court, wearing a fedora and glasses, and walking several steps ahead of his wife, who looked disheveled in a bright pink track suit. Hard times? Pictured leaving Brooklyn Criminal Court yesterday, Erin Sayar, left, and husband Jimmy Lathrop, right, did not walk side by side; a source tells the Post he's looking for a divorce lawyer. Married mother: Erin Sayar, 37, turned herself in last June and was charged with rape, criminal sex act, sexual misconduct, and sexual abuse. Silent: Sayar was released from jail for now but she faces four years behind bars for alleged sexual encounters with the high school football player; she's pictured returning to her Brooklyn home. The source told the Post: ‘He’s very angry, he’s very embarrassed,’ adding that Mr Lathrop is out looking for a divorce attorney. ‘I don’ think this marriage will last,’ the source told the newspaper. Mother-of-one Sayer, who is accused of seducing football player Kevin Eng, 16, while she was a teacher at Brooklyn's James Madison High School, appeared in court yesterday for arraignment. Sayar was released on 10,000 bond after turned herself into the NYPD Special Victims Squad and was charged with eight counts of third-degree rape and criminal sexual conduct. Kevin is still a student at the high school. As Judge Kevin McGrath set bail, he also issued an order of protection for the student. Sayar - who is facing more than four. years in jail - was supposed to be tutoring the footballer in her office. while his teammates were using the weight room next door. Chaos: Numerous news crews surrounded Sayer (center) as she left court last June with husband Jimmy Lathrop (second from front) walking in front of her. Consequences: Sayer has been placed on 10-years probation and may have to sign as a sex offender for the rest of her life. A chaotic scene unfolded outside the courthouse as reporters and camera crew surrounded Sayar and her husband, Jimmy Lathrop, as they left after the woman was released from jail. The pair refused to speak with reporters. Sayar remained silent and smirked. slightly at times as she walked dressed in a pink-hooded sweatshirt,. black pants and white sneakers with pink shoelaces. Instead, Sayar got into a sedan and returned to her home. Mr Lathrop also dismissed news crews wearing a top hat and his wedding ring. The parents of the 16-year-old also filed a 10million lawsuit against the married English teacher. According to the Post, Kevin was boasting about the sexual trysts on Facebook and to other students in detention. Football teammate Eddie Reid, 16, said they quickly grew suspicious, telling the Post: 'We had weight training every day in. sixth period, but instead of going to the weight room, Kevin was going. to her office — and the door was locked. 'People would go to the door and try and open it. She’d just yell \\"Go to class!\\" and \\"Get out of the hallway!\\",' Reid said. The lawyer representing Eng is. claiming his client was traumatized by what happened and that it left him. the 'subject of scorn and ridicule'. But other students said he was proud of the affair. The school found out about the alleged sexual relationship when Kevin's girlfriend became suspicious last November. Illicit: Married teacher Erin Sayar, 36, allegedly had sex with student Kevin Eng when she was meant to be tutoring him. Allegations: She pleaded guilty to having sex with 16-year-old pupil Kevin Eng in her office at James Madison High School. After hacking Eng's Facebook account,. the girl found messages he had sent to Sayar which read, 'I love you so. much' and 'I always loved you, since last year'. Sayar replied: 'Oh no — I’m not putting myself out there again. I made that mistake last night and you couldn’t handle it.' Despite this, the teacher gave the boy her mobile number and ordered him to delete their conversations. 'We had weight training every day in. sixth period, but instead of going to the weight room, Kevin was going. to her office - and the door was locked' Devastated, the girl informed school officials of the pair's exchanges, and confronted her boyfriend. According to the school's report, Eng admitted having oral sex and intercourse with Sayar between eight to 12 times. The New York Post reports that the lovers exchanged an incredible 3,856 text messages over a 17-day period in December, an average of 227 per day. One midnight tryst apparently saw Sayar pick the boy up from his house in her car. 'Eventually, they began kissing and then engaged in sexual intercourse and oral sex inside the SUV,' the report said, adding that the boy had described tattoos on intimate parts of Sayar’s body. A spokesman for the Department of Education said Sayar, who earns just over 78,000 (£50,000) a year, is still technically employed at the school, although she was removed from the classroom in January. The school investigators have submitted their report to Brooklyn's District Attorney Charles Hynes, strongly recommending she be fired. Eng, who is now 17, is still a pupil at the school. The sordid allegations are not the first to hit James Madison High School, christened 'Horndog High' after its past sex scandals. Language teachers Cindy Mauro and Alini Brito were dismissed from their posts after an alleged lesbian romp in a school classroom in November 2009 - a claim they both denied.

Joseph Romano, pictured in 2012, claimed Monday the FBI framed him in a plot to kill a judge and prosecutor. A conman already imprisoned in a collectible coin scam was sentenced to a life term on Monday for a bizarre, behind-bars plot to decapitate a judge and a prosecutor. Joseph Romano, of Levittown, New York, was convicted in January on charges he gave orders to have the prosecutor's breasts cut off as well, and that body parts should be preserved in formaldehyde as proof both people were dead. He claimed on Monday that he was framed by federal agents who fabricated the scheme as part of an undercover sting operation. 'I don't care what sentence you give me as long as I know one thing: I'm innocent,' a defiant Joseph Romano told the judge in a rambling statement in federal court in Brooklyn. Romano, 51, went on for more than hour, referencing Charles Manson, literary classics such as Moby Dick and A Christmas Carol and his own weight - 300 pounds. He insisted that the FBI targeted him to silence him. 'They want to bury me,' he said, pointing at grim-faced FBI agents sitting in the audience. 'They want to shut me up... I've never hurt anybody.' U.S. District Judge John Keenan told Romano that he deserved life behind bars because trying to orchestrate a pair of contract killings 'cannot be tolerated in a civilized society' Romano listened quietly, then gathered up a stack of documents and thanked the judge as he was led out of the courtroom. The plot unfolded in 2012 after Romano was sentenced to 15 years in prison and ordered to forfeit 7 million in the coin scheme, which victimized elderly investors. His business partner, Dejvid Mirkovic, was sentenced to 24 years in prison for the same scheme. Six months into Romano's sentence, another inmate reported through his lawyer that he had overheard Romano talk about seeking revenge. Joseph Romano, left, was sentenced to life behind bars on Monday for putting a hit on the federal judge and prosecutor who put him and his business partner, Dejvid Mirkovic, right, away for a collectable coin scheme. The inmate agreed to wear a wire and introduce Romano to an undercover federal agent pretending to be a hit man named Bobby Russo. Over the course of several recorded conversations, Romano arranged through a former business partner to pay the undercover agent 40,000 to carry out the killings, referred to in code as 'Dodge trucks.' Jurors heard one recording where Romano gave instructions to shoot the judge, saying, 'Find out where (the judge) is, go there and - boom - right in' the head. Prosecutors alleged that he wanted the prosecutor's body stuffed in a steel drum and dumped in a place where it could never be found. Romano also was accused of trying to arrange an assault a Long Island mechanic for repossessing one of his vintage muscle cars. Undercover investigators staged a photo to make it look as though the mechanic had been knocked out in a beat-down.

Snapping, popping, and clicking are all signs that the outer cv joint, which is the joint that connects your wheel to the axle, is starting to wear out. Sometimes, more severe turns will create a louder snapping or popping noise. Options: (A). If you hear this while you're driving, there's a good chance you have a bad axle. Listen to what side the rattling is on, so you have an idea of which wheel bearing is going bad.; (B). If this occurs, it's time to get the vehicle back on the road.

Lazkao is a town 2. Lazkao is a municipality 3. Located in the Goierri region 4. In the province of Gipuzkoa 5. In the Basque Country Autonomous Community 6. In Northern Spain Sentence 2: 1. Lazkao is a city 2. Lazkao is a municipality 3. Located in the region of Gipuzkoa 4. In the province of Goierri 5. In the Basque Autonomous Community 6. In Northern Spain Now, let's compare the differences: - Town vs. City: Towns are generally smaller, while cities are larger and more populated urban areas. This is a notable difference in meaning. - Goierri region and province of Gipuzkoa vs. region of Gipuzkoa and province of Goierri: The order of the regions and provinces is switched in the two sentences, so the locations are not the same. While both sentences describe Lazkao as a municipality in the Basque Autonomous Community of Northern Spain, there are differences in terms of urban classification (town vs. city) and the specific region and province (Goierri and Gipuzkoa). Therefore, these two sentences do not mean the same thing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Definition: In this task you will be given a string and you should find the longest substring that is a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that is the same backwards as it is forwards. If the shortest possible palindrome is length 1 you should return the first character. Input: ccctttctttcktc Output:","output":"The longest palindrome substring in the given input \\"ccctttctttcktc\\" is \\"ctttctttc\\". Let's break down the process of finding the longest palindrome substring. 1. Iterate through each character in the given string. 2. For each character, expand around the current character, and check for palindromes of odd length (i.e., the current character in the center of the palindrome) and palindromes of even length (i.e., the current character and the immediate next character at the center of the palindrome). 3. Keep track of the longest palindrome substring found so far. Here is the step-by-step breakdown for the given input \\"ccctttctttcktc\\": 1. Starting with the first character ('c'), the longest odd-length palindrome centered at this character is 'ccc', and there is no even-length palindrome with the first character. 2. The second character is also a 'c'. The longest odd-length palindrome centered at this character is still 'ccc', and there is no even-length palindrome with the second character. 3. The third character is 'c' again. The longest odd-length palindrome centered at this character is 'ccc'. However, there is an even-length palindrome with this character: 'ccctt'. 4. As we continue to iterate through the string, we find the odd-length palindrome 'ctttctttc' centered at the sixth character ('c'), which is longer than the previously found palindromes. After iterating through the entire string, we have found that the longest palindrome substring is \\"ctttctttc.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Samurai Most samurai were bound by a code of honor and were expected to set an example for those below them. A notable part of their code is seppuku (切腹, seppuku?) or hara kiri, which allowed a disgraced samurai to regain his honor by passing into death, where samurai were still beholden to social rules. Whilst there are many romanticized characterizations of samurai behavior such as the writing of Bushido (武士道, Bushidō?) in 1905, studies of Kobudo and traditional Budō indicate that the samurai were as practical on the battlefield as were any other warrior. Q: What was the reason for seppuku?","output":"The reason for seppuku, also known as hara kiri, was to allow a disgraced samurai to regain his honor by committing ritual suicide. This act of self-sacrifice was based on the samurai code of honor, and it was considered a way to restore one's dignity and reputation after committing a serious offense, failure, or facing public humiliation. By choosing death over disgrace, the samurai demonstrated his commitment to the code and could potentially save his family from shame or repercussions associated with his actions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question The domestication of large animals (c. 8000 BC) resulted in a dramatic increase in social inequality in most of the areas where it occurred; New Guinea being a notable exception. Possession of livestock allowed competition between households and resulted in inherited inequalities of wealth. Neolithic pastoralists who controlled large herds gradually acquired more livestock, and this made economic inequalities more pronounced. However, evidence of social inequality is still disputed, as settlements such as Catal Huyuk reveal a striking lack of difference in the size of homes and burial sites, suggesting a more egalitarian society with no evidence of the concept of capital, although some homes do appear slightly larger or more elaborately decorated than others. Who was in possession of large herds that would produce more livestock?","output":"The text suggests that the Neolithic pastoralists were in possession of large herds that would produce more livestock. These pastoralists, living around 8000 BC, engaged in the early form of agriculture known as pastoralism, which involved the domestication and rearing of animals. Their control over large herds allowed them to acquire more livestock over time, contributing to economic disparities and reinforcing social inequality due to the resultant increase in wealth. In essence, those who had more livestock had the potential to generate more wealth, thereby creating a cycle that resulted in some households being significantly wealthier than others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This remarkable video shows the dramatic transformation in a mother with cerebral palsy after she smokes cannabis to relieve her symptoms. Jacqueline Patterson, from Kansas City, Missouri, has a severe stutter and suffers incredible pain because of her condition. She has found that marijuana is the only thing that really helps - but each time she buys or smokes it, she runs the risk of losing custody of her four children. Despite marijuana being legal for medical reasons in 20 states, it is not legal in Kansas City where Ms Patterson lives. But because of her debilitating symptoms, she says using the drug actually makes her better mother. Before she smokes cannabis, she seriously struggles to speak. Afterwards, she speaks calmly and with no problems at all. In the video, she explains: 'I was born with cerebral palsy and a severe stutter - which has got to be one of the most stigmatising disabilities invented by God. It's very humiliating. 'My right side of my body is much noticeably weaker than my left and my right arm is always painfully tense. 'I went through my entire childhood in pain because I couldn't move my muscles.' She realised from the first time she smoked cannabis that it eased her symptoms. In a letter to the Kansas City Star, she said: 'I. was born with cerebral palsy and discovered early on that cannabis. mitigated the most painful physical and emotional manifestations of my. disorder. Ms Patterson has found that marijuana is the only thing that really helps her symptoms. Despite it being legal for medical reasons in 20 states, it is not legal in Kansas City, Missouri, where she lives (file picture) 'I later learned that cannabis can help stutterers speak more clearly and that decades ago, doctors discovered the herbâ€™s ability to alleviate muscle spasms, from which I also suffer.' In the film, viewers meet Ms Patterson when she hasn't smoked marijuana for three days. Her stutter means it can take several seconds for her to pronounce a word. Driving into downtown Kansas City to look for the drug, she explains: 'I smoke to be the mother my children deserve - they are really cool kids. 'Being a good mother to my children is the most important thing in the world to me. Cerebral. palsy is an umbrella term used to describe damage to the brain that. occurs before, during or after birth. birth. It is a condition that. affects muscle control and movement.

'I hate the way I stutter and it's the most effective treatment I have found. 'But if I were to get busted buying or smoking marijuana there is a possibility I could lose my children.' Back home, after three hits of the drug, she is able to speak completely normally. Speaking about the remarkable difference, she says: 'The third hit is when I begin to feel the tension dissipate. 'It really helps my speech - I feel much calmer, much less rushed and I feel like I can control the muscles that I couldn't before I smoked. 'It's kinda nice and I don't make as many funny faces.'

Customers are in the best position to know the demand for a product. The danger from surveys is that they often overestimate actual demand. While a customer may show interest in your product, actually buying it is a different thing altogether. Keep in mind that conducting surveys can be expensive, difficult, and time consuming. Surveys rarely form the base of a successful demand forecast. Use this during the early stages of your product development. Find a small, isolated, area that has your targeted demographic. Roll out every stage of your marketing plan including advertising, promotion, and distribution plans. Measure product awareness, penetration, market share and total sales. Fine tune your market strategy based on the information you receive so that you will run into fewer problems when you launch your product nationally. Gather a small group of potential customers in a room and let them use your product and discuss it. The customers are usually paid a small amount for participating. Panels are similar to surveys in that they are more useful to analyze the product rather than forming the basis for a demand forecast. Find a large set of household customers to agree to participate in an ongoing study of their buying habits at grocery stores, for example. Have these customers agree to submit information such as the size of their households, their ages, their household income, and any other information you find relevant to your product. Whenever they buy groceries, their purchases are recorded and analyzed. This data can be collected when they use their store grocery card. This creates a rich database to create statistical models and see relationships in data. As with other types of experimental approaches, it can be difficult to apply these results to demand forecasts. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses various methods to collect information from customers in order to determine product demand and gather valuable market data. These methods include surveys, pilot tests, panels, and analyzing household purchase data. However, the article also highlights the limitations of these techniques, such as the difficulty involved, the potential to overestimate actual demand, and the challenges in applying the data to demand forecasting. Despite these limitations, these methods can still be helpful in the early stages of product development and in fine-tuning marketing strategies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels (see Figure below ). Because there are millions of alveoli in each lung, they greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet). That’s about as much surface area as one side of a volleyball court!  Now, I have a new situation: Two friends read about respiratory systems.

Article: (2013*II,B)In 1947 a group of famous people from the art world headed by an Austrian conductor decided to hold an international festival of music,dance and theatre in Edinburgh.The idea was to reunite Europe after the Second World War. It quickly attracted famous names such as Alec Guinness,Richard Burton,Dame Margot Fonteyn and Marlene Dietrich as well as the big symphony orchestras .It became a fixed event every August and now attracts 400,000 people yearly. At the same time,the \\"Fringe\\" appeared as a challenge to the official festival.Eight theatre groups turned up uninvited in 1947,in the belief that everyone should have the right to perform,and they did so in a public house disused for years. Soon,groups of students firstly from Edinburgh University,and later from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge,Durham and Birmingham were making the journey to the Scottish capital each summer to perform theatre by littleknown writers of plays in small church halls to the people of Edinburgh. Today the\\"Fringe\\",once less recognized,has far outgrown the festival with around 1,500 performances of theatre,music and dance on every one of the 21 days it lasts.And yet as early as 1959,with only 19 theatre groups performing,some said it was getting too big. A paid administrator was first employed only in 1971,and today there are eight administrators working all year round and the number rises to 150 during August itself.In 2004 there were 200 places housing 1,695 shows by over 600 different groups from 50 different countries.More than 1.25 million tickets were sold.

Plot title: Little Big Soldier Movie plot: On 1 December 2009, a press conference was held for the film, along with Chan's announcement of a new teaser trailer posted on the film's official Sina website. Twitch also released a plot synopsis of the film:[4]   â It was the darkest of times in China, when ruthless warlords waged battles to satiate their endless aggression. Millions of lives perished, and those who survived had only two choices â kill or be killed. The battalions of warring states Liang and Wei collided in a bloodbath that lasted from dawn until dusk. Only two men were left standing â a foot soldier from Liang and the rival General from Wei. The Soldier survived because he is an expert in playing dead, with a device strapped on his body which protruded like an arrowhead for added realism. The Soldier captured the wounded General, hoping to use the enemy as his ticket to freedom â by handing the General to the Liang warlord, the Soldier could be honorably discharged and return home to his peaceful life. The young General, though taken captive, was condescending towards the Soldier. The two men were often at loggerheads during the long and winding journey.  â My question: How many men were left after the battle?

What can be an official stamp of quality on a precious metal, a greeting card company, and a cable TV channel?","output":"To solve this task, I'll need to find a word or name that can denote all three of mentioned items: an official stamp of quality on a precious metal, a greeting card company, and a cable TV channel. Step 1: Analyze Let's break down and examine each of the elements: 1. An official stamp of quality on a precious metal: These are often called \\"hallmarks\\". They indicate the type of metal and its purity. Many words can be used to denote this, but considering the context, it might be a specific hallmark.    2. A greeting card company: There are several popular greeting card companies, such as Hallmark, American Greetings, Dayspring etc.  3. A cable TV channel: There are hundreds of TV channels, so this could be anything from CNN to MTV. But given the other items, this might be a TV channel that also has a namesake in another industry. Step 2: Find the commonality Looking at each of the three categories, it seems \\"Hallmark\\" fits all three. There is a Hallmark that signifies the quality of precious metals, a popular Hallmark greeting card company, and a Hallmark cable TV channel. It seems that \\"Hallmark\\" is the common element in each of the three categories, as it is associated with an indication of quality in metals, a well-known greeting card company, and a cable TV channel.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  \\"Freedom of the seas\\" is a principle in international law dating from the seventeenth century. It stresses freedom to navigate the oceans and disapproves of war fought in international waters. Today, this concept is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the third version of which came into force in 1994. Article 87(1) states: \\"The high seas are open to all states, whether coastal or land-locked.\\" Article 87(1) (a) to (f) gives a non-exhaustive list of freedoms including navigation, overflight, the laying of submarine cables, building artificial islands, fishing and scientific research. The safety of shipping is regulated by the International Maritime Organization. Its objectives include developing and maintaining a regulatory framework for shipping, maritime safety, environmental concerns, legal matters, technical co-operation and maritime security.UNCLOS defines various areas of water. \\"Internal waters\\" are on the landward side of a baseline and foreign vessels have no right of passage in these. \\"Territorial waters\\" extend to 12 nautical miles (22 kilometres; 14 miles) from the coastline and in these waters, the coastal state is free to set laws, regulate use and exploit any resource. A \\"contiguous zone\\" extending a further 12 nautical miles allows for hot pursuit of vessels suspected of infringing laws in four specific areas: customs, taxation, immigration and pollution. An \\"exclusive economic zone\\" extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres; 230 miles) from the baseline. Within this area, the coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over all natural resources. The \\"continental shelf\\" is the natural prolongation of the land territory to the continental margin's outer edge, or 200 nautical miles from the coastal state's baseline, whichever is greater. Here the coastal nation has the exclusive right to harvest minerals and also living resources \\"attached\\" to the seabed. Answer:","output":"The coastal nation has sole exploitation rights over natural resources within an \\"exclusive economic zone\\" (EEZ) that extends for 200 nautical miles (370 kilometers; 230 miles) from the baseline of their coastline.

The answer to the question: What are the names of the missionaries of Britain that the sculptures in the north represent and are identifiable by their attributes?? is inside the article: The sculptures on the west front at Wells include standing figures, seated figures, half-length angels and narratives in high relief. Many of the figures are life-sized or larger, and together they constitute the finest display of medieval carving in England. The figures and many of the architectural details were painted in bright colours, and the colouring scheme has been deduced from flakes of paint still adhering to some surfaces. The sculptures occupy nine architectural zones stretching horizontally across the entire west front and around the sides and the eastern returns of the towers which extend beyond the aisles. The strongly projecting buttresses have tiers of niches which contain many of the largest figures. Other large figures, including that of Christ, occupy the gable. A single figure stands in one of two later niches high on the northern tower. In 1851 the archaeologist Charles Robert Cockerell published his analysis of the iconography, numbering the nine sculptural divisions from the lowest to the highest. He defined the theme as \\"a calendar for unlearned men\\" illustrating the doctrines and history of the Christian faith, its introduction to Britain and its protection by princes and bishops. He likens the arrangement and iconography to the Te Deum.According to Cockerell, the side of the façade that is to the south of the central door is the more sacred and the scheme is divided accordingly. The lowest range of niches each contained a standing figure, of which all but four figures on the west front, two on each side, have been destroyed. More have survived on the northern and eastern sides of the north tower. Cockerell speculates that those to the south of the portal represented prophets and patriarchs of the Old Testament while those to the north represented early missionaries to Britain, of which Augustine of Canterbury, St Birinus, and Benedict Biscop are identifiable by their attributes. In the second zone, above each pair of standing figures, is a quatrefoil containing a half-length angel..., can you guess it ? The answer to this question is:","output":"Augustine of Canterbury, St Birinus, and Benedict Biscop are the names of the missionaries of Britain that the sculptures in the north represent and are identifiable by their attributes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was humbling that so many chose to mark the anniversary of a duty which passed to me 60 years ago. People of all ages took the trouble to take part in various ways and in many nations. But perhaps most striking of all was to witness the strength of fellowship and friendship among those who had gathered together on these occasions. On the barges and the bridges and the banks of the river there were people who had taken their places to cheer through the mist, undaunted by the rain. That day there was a tremendous sense of common determination to celebrate, triumphing  over the elements. That same spirit was also in evidence from the moment the Olympic flame arrived on these shores. The flame itself drew hundreds and thousands of people on its journey around the British Isles, and was carried by every kind of deserving individual, many nominated for their own extraordinary service. As London hosted a splendid summer of sport, all those who saw the achievement and courage at the Olympic and Paralympic Games were further inspired by the skill, dedication, training and teamwork of our athletes. In pursuing their own sporting goals, they gave the rest of us the opportunity to share something of the excitement and drama. We were reminded, too, that the success of these great festivals depended to an enormous degree upon the dedication and effort of an army of volunteers. Those public-spirited people came forward in the great tradition of all those who devote themselves to keeping others safe, supported and comforted.

The paragraph describes \\"Squeezing Out Sparks\\" as being the fourth studio album by English musician Graham Parker and his band, the Rumour. Even though the band's name is not credited on the cover of the album, their contribution is mentioned on the album's label.  The inclusion of the Rumour in the making of this album shows that this album was a collaborative effort between Graham Parker and the Rumour. This implies a level of collaboration and work relationship between Graham Parker and the band. Therefore, it is true to say that Graham Parker worked with the Rumour.  However, it's important to note that while this particular album demonstrates a partnership between Graham Parker and the Rumour, it doesn't necessarily mean that they collaborated on all of his work or that they continued to work together indefinitely.

Write an article based on this summary: No new large gas plants will be built as a result of a key government mechanism to ensure the lights stay on in the future. Article:","output":"Title: Government Mechanism Shifts Focus Away from Large Gas Plants to Secure Future Energy Needs Introduction: In a move towards a more sustainable and environmentally-conscious energy policy, the government has announced that their primary mechanism for ensuring the lights remain on in the future will no longer support the construction of new large-scale gas plants. This shift reflects the growing global awareness of the impacts of fossil fuel-based energy sources on the environment and highlights the need for alternative, cleaner forms of power generation. The Key Government Mechanism: The key government mechanism in question is the Capacity Market, a policy tool designed to ensure a reliable energy supply by rewarding high-performing power plants that help balance the energy grid. These plants are critical in providing backup power in times of peak energy demand or emergencies, thus ensuring the stability of the energy network. By excluding the construction of new large-scale gas plants from this mechanism, the government has taken a significant step towards building a more sustainable energy future. Impact on the Energy Industry: The decision to no longer support new large gas plants will have several effects on the energy industry. Firstly, it emphasizes the importance of more sustainable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydro power in meeting the growing energy needs of the country. The exclusion of new gas plants from the Capacity Market will create a competitive advantage for companies focused on renewable energy technologies, and increase investments in the research, development, and deployment of such technologies. Secondly, this move will likely necessitate the closure of existing large gas plants or their conversion into more efficient and cleaner alternatives. This will affect the workers and communities that rely on these plants for employment and economic stability. As a result, it becomes necessary for the government and the energy industry to work together to ensure a smooth transition and minimize the negative impacts of these changes on affected parties. Long-term Implications: In the long run, the government's decision will contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and help mitigate the effects of climate change. Investing in clean energy sources also bolsters the nation's energy security, as it reduces reliance on imported fossil fuels, protects against price shocks, and supplies a more diverse and resilient energy mix. Furthermore, the increased demand for renewable energy technologies will generate employment opportunities and contribute to economic growth. As a result, the transition to a more sustainable energy model will necessitate the development of a skilled workforce in the clean energy sector, creating a solid foundation for future growth in this vital industry. Conclusion: The government's decision to exclude new large gas plants from their Capacity Market mechanism reflects a pivotal shift in energy policy. By placing emphasis on cleaner, more sustainable energy sources, the government demonstrates its commitment to tackling climate change and building a resilient energy network capable of meeting future energy needs. This change will require collaboration, investment, and forward thinking, but ultimately, it paves the way for a brighter, cleaner future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As for the instance you provided: Target: Politician 1. Politicians gather in the capital. 2. Dentistry takes skill and almost every dentist has worked very hard to achieve their position. Analysis: Sentence 1 is related to the target profession (politician), as it talks about politicians gathering in the capital. However, it doesn't present either a stereotype or an anti-stereotype, it's just a fact. Sentence 2 discusses the skill and hard work of dentists. It is unrelated to the target profession (politician) as it doesn't mention or imply anything about politicians.

Vase: A vase is a great choice for displaying a flower on a table, as it's designed to hold flowers and can be easily placed on a flat surface like a table. 2.

Instructions: In this task, you are given inputs i,j, and A, where i and j are integers and A is a list. You need to list all elements of A from the ith element to the jth element. i and j will be non-negative, and will always have a value less than the length of A. i will always be less than j. Input: 7, 15, ['q', 'i', 'i', 'o', 'T', '8297', 'P', '393', '4027', 'L', '417', '275', 'c', 'w', '9375'] Output:","output":"To complete this task, follow these simple steps: 1. Understand the given task: The task is asking you to create a list containing elements from a given list 'A' starting from the 'ith' element and ending with the 'jth' element. The values of 'i' and 'j' are non-negative integers, with 'i' always less than 'j' and both 'i' and 'j' being less than the length of the list 'A'. 2. Given input: In this example, 'i' = 7, 'j' = 15, and 'A' = ['q', 'i', 'i', 'o', 'T', '8297', 'P', '393', '4027', 'L', '417', '275', 'c', 'w', '9375']. 3. Use the guidelines to find the answer: To list all the elements from the 'ith' element to the 'jth' element in 'A', we can use Python's list slicing method. 4. Applying list slicing: In this case, we will slice the list from the 7th element to the 15th element, keeping in mind that Python uses a zero-based indexing system (i.e., the first element is at index 0). Therefore, the 'ith' element will be at position 'i - 1' and the 'jth' element will be at position 'j' in the sliced list. 5. Use the input values: According to the input values, we have 'i' = 7 and 'j' = 15. So, we will slice the list 'A' from position (7 - 1) and end at position 15. 6. Slice the list: A[6:15]    This will give you the final output ['393', '4027', 'L', '417', '275', 'c', 'w', '9375'].

Background: Hans Lundgren was born on 3 November 1957 in Spanga, the son of Sigrid Birgitta (nee Tjerneld), a language teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Spanga until the age of 13, when he moved to his grandparents' home in Nyland, Angermanland. Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth, but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957. He has two sisters and an older brother; he was raised in the Lutheran church. Context: Lundgren resides in Los Angeles, California. He speaks Swedish and English, as well as smaller amounts of French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, but is not fluent in five languages as has often been reported.  He is an avid football fan. He supported Everton FC when he lived in Europe, but developed more of an interest in international football tournaments (such as the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup) after moving to Los Angeles.  During the 1980s, Lundgren had relationships with Jamaican singer Grace Jones and American model Paula Barbieri. In 1994, he married Anette Qviberg, a jewellery designer and fashion stylist, in Marbella. The couple decided they liked Marbella so much that they rented accommodation there for years, before eventually buying a family home there. They have two daughters: Ida Sigrid Lundgren and Greta Eveline Lundgren, both born in Stockholm. Lundgren and Qviberg have cited the reason for living away from Hollywood is that they want to give their children as normal a childhood as possible. His father died in 2000.  In early May 2009, Lundgren's Marbella home was reportedly broken into by three masked burglars who tied up and threatened his wife, but fled when they found a family photo and realized that the house was owned by Lundgren. Lundgren later stated he believed the intruders to be Eastern European and had asked contacts in Bulgaria to investigate them, but to no avail. After the incident, Lundgren's elder daughter, Ida, suffered from PTSD. His wife was the \\"most traumatized\\", and as of 2011, they are divorced.  Lundgren currently lives in Los Angeles, California. He broke up with his girlfriend, Jenny Sandersson, in 2014 and it was said that they were secretly engaged and married later. Question: Did they have children?. Whats the answer?","output":"No, Hans Lundgren (Dolph Lundgren) and Jenny Sandersson did not have children together. Lundgren has two daughters, Ida Sigrid Lundgren and Greta Eveline Lundgren, with his ex-wife Anette Qviberg."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from: [1]. no; [2]. yes;","output":"[1]. No; The two questions are different but related as they both involve the concept of atmospheric pressure.  The first question is asking about the conversion of atmospheric pressure to pressure in terms of water column height. This conversion is made through physical principles. One atmospheric pressure is approximately equivalent to a 10.33 meter column of water because the weight of water in this column would exert a pressure similar to the normal atmospheric pressure we experience at sea level on the Earth. The second question is a hypothetical scenario that involves pressure differentials and the implications of a small breach in a high pressure area. It expects understanding of pressure principles, but the nature of the question is not the same as the first.

Options are:  A). yes  B). it is not possible to tell  C). no","output":"C). No From the provided information, it is clear that we cannot conclude that \\"It doesn't cost companies anything to carry the insurance.\\" In fact, the statement has provided several key points that suggest otherwise: 1. Some companies can't afford to carry the insurance any longer. 2. Companies are dropping the insurance as they no longer have a choice. 3. It is bankrupting companies. These points not only indicate that insurance can indeed be a significant expense for companies, but also that the cost can be so high that it threatens the financial stability of these businesses. As a result, companies may have to make the difficult decision to stop carrying the insurance altogether. This indicates that there is a definite cost for companies to carry insurance, especially in cases where maintaining it becomes too burdensome for them to continue. Moreover, insurance costs can vary depending on several factors, such as the type of insurance, the industry of the company, the size and risk profile of the business, and the insurance provider. These factors can influence the premiums and policy coverage that the companies require, which in turn affects their bottom line. In conclusion, claiming that it doesn't cost companies anything to carry insurance is not supported by the information provided. It is evident that some companies struggle with the costs associated with carrying insurance, to the point where they may have to drop their coverage or face potential bankruptcy. Therefore, the answer is C). No, we cannot conclude that it doesn't cost companies anything to carry the insurance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here's a detailed explanation of what may happen: 1. Strengthened Communication: Regular communication is essential for maintaining a healthy relationship. If he calls back, it shows that he is making an effort to stay in touch and values the relationship. This gesture will help in reinforcing trust and ensuring that both parties are on the same page regarding their expectations and feelings. 2. Better Understanding of Each Other's Situation: Calling back provides an opportunity for both of you to discuss the circumstances surrounding the short call and the reason behind it. Sharing such details can lead to a better understanding of each other's situation and help avoid any misinterpretations or hard feelings. 3. Opportunity to Discuss Future Plans: If he is indeed signing a lease for a new apartment, calling back offers a chance to discuss your shared future and any possible impact on your relationship. Open dialogue about important decisions like moving in together or maintaining separate living arrangements can help clarify expectations and ensure that both parties are on board with the same plan. 4. Preventing Miscommunication and Assumptions: In the absence of clear communication, there is a possibility of making incorrect assumptions about each other's feelings and actions. If he calls back, it dispels any doubts or negative thoughts that might be brewing due to the lack of communication, thus preventing misunderstandings from escalating. 5. Enhanced Emotional Connection: Regular phone calls help in keeping the emotional connection alive in a relationship. By calling back, he will be contributing to strengthening the emotional bond between the two of you. This constant connection helps in fostering a sense of closeness and attachment essential for relationship growth. 6. Potential Resolution of Conflicts or Disagreements: In case there were any disagreements or conflicts left unresolved, calling back provides an opportunity to address those issues and work towards a resolution. This communication prevents bottling up of negative emotions, which may harm the relationship in the long run. In conclusion, if he were to call back instead, it could result in improved communication, better understanding, the ability to discuss future plans, and prevent miscommunication or assumptions.

On the 4th of January Holly Butcher lost her battle with Ewing’s sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that affects mostly young people, at the age of 27.      Before she died, the Grafton woman penned a letter which she asked her family to post on her Facebook account once she was gone.      The message includes Holly’s moving insights as a 27-year-old woman forced to confront her mortality, despite not having done so many things she’d hoped and planned to do.      “It’s a strange thing to realise and accept your mortality at 26 years young,” she reflected.      “It’s just one of those things you ignore. The days tick by and you just expect they will keep on coming; until the unexpected happens.      “That’s the thing about life,” she noted. “It is fragile, precious and unpredictable and each day is a gift, not a given right,” she said, adding “I’m 27 now. I don’t want to go.”      After spending time reflecting on how she would live her life if she could overcome the disease, Holly decided to share her advice with those who get to keep on living.      In just a few days it’s had almost 8,000 shares and more than 10,000 reactions.      As a reminder to not sweat the small stuff, Holly assured you won’t be worrying about most of the things you complain about now when you’re on your death bed.      “You might have got caught in bad traffic today, or had a bad sleep because your beautiful babies kept you awake, or your hairdresser cut your hair too short. Your new fake nails might have got a chip, your boobs are too small, or you have cellulite on your arse and your belly is wobbling.      “Let all that s*** go,” she urged. “I swear you will not be thinking of those things when it is your turn to go.      “I’m watching my body waste away right before my eyes with nothing I can do about it and all I wish for now is that I could have just one more birthday or Christmas with my family, or just one more day with my partner and dog. Just one more.”      Holly wrote that we should be more mindful with money, and spend it on things that make other people happy rather than more stuff for ourselves.      “It is a weird thing having money to spend at the end, when you’re dying. It’s not a time you go out and buy material things that you usually would, like a new dress.      “It makes you think how silly it is that we think it is worth spending so much money on new clothes and ‘things’ in our lives,” she said.      “Buy your friend something kind instead of another dress, beauty product or jewellery for that next wedding ... take them out for a meal, or better yet, cook them a meal. Shout their coffee. Give or buy them a plant, a massage or a candle and tell them you love them when you give it to them.”      Lateness is something that irritates a lot of people, and Holly insightfully summed up why that is — because it shows disrespect for the other person and their time, which is limited.      “Value other people’s time. Don’t keep them waiting because you are s*** at being on time. Get ready earlier if you are one of those people and appreciate that your friends want to share their time with you, not sit by themselves, waiting on a mate. You will gain respect too.”      She also came to the realisation that documenting your life for social media dilutes the power of the moment while you’re actually living it.      “Try just enjoying and being in moments rather than capturing them through the screen of your phone. Life isn’t meant to be lived through a screen nor is it about getting the perfect photo ... enjoy the bloody moment, people! Stop trying to capture it for everyone else.”      Holly’s final point might be the most important. Receiving blood donations allowed her to live for an extra year, and she urged everyone to donate blood regularly.      “Blood donation (more bags than I could keep up with counting) helped keep me alive for an extra year — a year I will be forever grateful that I got to spend here on earth with my family, friends and dog. A year I had some of the greatest times of my life.”      Donate blood and save three lives — visit the Australian Red Cross Blood Service at www.donateblood.com.au for more information. ||||| A heartbreaking but inspiring letter from a dying Australian woman has gone viral after her death.      Holly Butcher, 27, died from Ewing’s sarcoma and left behind a letter which she asked her family to post on her Facebook account after her death, according to News.com.au.      Butcher wrote about enjoying life to the fullest and talked frankly about her mortality as well as the things she wished she had more time to do, like raise her own family.      “It’s a strange thing to realise and accept your mortality at 26 years young,” she wrote. “It’s just one of those things you ignore. The days tick by and you just expect they will keep on coming; until the unexpected happens.”      “That’s the thing about life,” she continued. “It is fragile, precious and unpredictable and each day is a gift, not a given right. I’m 27 now. I don’t want to go.”      Holly Butcher Holly Butcher/Facebook      Butcher explained she led a healthy life, but that her disease had left her to realize there were more important aspects of living a healthy lifestyle, such as being healthy emotionally and mentally.      “Be grateful for each day you don’t have pain and even the days where you are unwell with man flu, a sore back or a sprained ankle, accept it is s— but be thankful it isn’t life threatening and will go away,” she wrote. “Whinge less, people! .. And help each other more.”      She confessed it was “a weird thing having money to spend at the end.. when you’re dying. It’s not a time you go out and buy material things that you usually would, like a new dress. It makes you think how silly it is that we think it is worth spending so much money on new clothes and ‘things’ in our lives.”      She offered a reminder to not spend time thinking about small issues, but to focus on experiencing moments with family and friends.      Holly Butcher/Facebook      “You might have got caught in bad traffic today, or had a bad sleep because your beautiful babies kept you awake, or your hairdresser cut your hair too short,” she wrote. “Your new fake nails might have got a chip, your boobs are too small, or you have cellulite on your arse and your belly is wobbling.”      “Let all that s— go,” she urged. “I swear you will not be thinking of those things when it is your turn to go.”      “I’m watching my body waste away right before my eyes with nothing I can do about it and all I wish for now is that I could have just one more birthday or Christmas with my family, or just one more day with my partner and dog. Just one more.”      Butcher also encouraged readers to donate more blood, revealing that it extended her life by one year.      “Oh and one last thing, if you can, do a good deed for humanity (and myself) and start regularly donating blood. It will make you feel good with the added bonus of saving lives,” she wrote. “I feel like it is something that is so overlooked considering every donation can save 3 lives! That is a massive impact each person can have and the process really is so simple.”      She added, “Blood donation (more bags than I could keep up with counting) helped keep me alive for an extra year – a year I will be forever grateful that I got to spend it here on Earth with my family, friends and dog.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the quartet that wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal?  Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha announced he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its \\"decision-making process\\". Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent. And...when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can't deny it.\\" The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal, and began working in the studio in late May 2001 with Rubin as producer, while sorting out the label and management issues.

Information:  - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.  - Arsia Mons is the southernmost of three volcanos (collectively known as Tharsis Montes) on the Tharsis bulge near the equator of the planet Mars. To its north is Pavonis Mons, and north of that is Ascraeus Mons. The tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is to its northwest. Its name comes from a corresponding albedo feature on a map by Giovanni Schiaparelli, which he named in turn after the legendary Roman forest of Arsia Silva.  - The Tharsis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Tharsis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-9 (Mars Chart-9).  - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from .   - A space probe is a robotic spacecraft that leaves Earth orbit and explores space. It may approach the Moon; enter interplanetary space; flyby, orbit, or land on other planetary bodies; or approach interstellar space.  - Pavonis Mons (Latin for \\"peacock mountain\\") is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the middle member of a chain of three volcanic mountains (collectively known as the Tharsis Montes) that straddle the Martian equator between longitudes 235°E and 259°E. The volcano was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971 and was originally called Middle Spot. Its name formally became Pavonis Mons in 1973.  - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.  - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.  - Magma (from Ancient Greek  (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock.  - Tharsis is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at the western extremity of the known world.  - The Tharsis Montes are three large shield volcanoes in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. From north to south, the volcanoes are Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons. Mons (plural \\"montes\\") is the Latin word for mountain. It is a descriptor term used in astrogeology for mountainous features in the Solar System.  - Ulysses Tholus is a Martian volcano. It is located in the Tharsis quadrangle at 2.89° north latitude and 121.55° west longitude. It is 58 km across and is named after a classical albedo feature name. Ulysses Tholus is immediately east and slightly north of another volcano, Biblis Tholus.   - Olympus Mons (Latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. By one measure, it has a height of nearly 22 km (13.6 mi). Olympus Mons stands about two and a half times as tall as Mount Everest's height above sea level. It is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Hesperian Period. It is currently the largest volcano discovered in the Solar System and had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature Nix Olympica (Latin for \\"Olympic Snow\\"). Its mountainous nature was suspected well before space probes confirmed its identity as a mountain.  - Ascraeus Mons is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the northernmost and tallest of three shield volcanoes collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The volcano's location corresponds to the classical albedo feature Ascraeus Lacus.  - Biblis Tholus is an extinct Martian volcano located at 2.55 ° N 235.62 ° E , one of two volcanoes near the center of the Tharsis volcanism . Along with Ulysses Tholus , it is almost midway between Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes . It is approximately 170 kilometers ( 110 mi ) long and 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) wide , rising about 3 kilometers ( 1.9 mi ) from its surroundings . In the middle of the volcano is a caldera , named Biblis Patera , believed to have formed as the result of collapse of the magma chamber during eruptions of the volcano . The caldera is 53 kilometers ( 33 mi ) in diameter and four kilometers ( 2.5 miles ) in depth .  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - Mount Everest, also known in Nepal as Sagarmth and in China as Chomolungma/, is earth's highest mountain. Its peak is above sea level. Mount Everest is in the Mahalangur Range. The international border between China (Tibet Autonomous Region) and Nepal runs across Everest's summit point. Its massif includes neighbouring peaks Lhotse, ; Nuptse, , and Changtse, .  - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.  - A magma chamber is a large underground pool of liquid rock found beneath the surface of the Earth. The molten rock in such a chamber is under great pressure, and given enough time, that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it creating outlets for the magma. If it finds a way to the surface, then the result will be a volcanic eruption; consequently many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers.  Magma chambers are hard to detect, and most of the known ones are therefore close to the surface of the Earth, commonly between 1 km and 10 km under the surface. In geological terms, this is extremely close to the surface, although in human terms, it is considerably deep underground.

Gaelic Ireland (Irish: Eire Ghaidhealach) was the Gaelic political and social order, and associated culture, that existed in Ireland from the prehistoric era until the early 17th century. Before the Norman invasion of 1169, Gaelic Ireland comprised the whole island. Thereafter, it comprised that part of the country not under foreign dominion at a given time. For most of its history, Gaelic Ireland was a \\"patchwork\\" hierarchy of territories ruled by a hierarchy of kings or chiefs, who were elected through tanistry. Warfare was common in Gaelic Ireland, as territories fought for supremacy against each other and (later) against the Anglo-Normans. Champion warfare is a common theme in Irish mythology. In the Middle Ages all able-bodied men, apart from the learned and the clergy, were eligible for military service on behalf of the king or chief. Throughout the Middle Ages and for some time after, outsiders often wrote that the style of Irish warfare differed greatly from what they deemed to be the norm in Western Europe. The Gaelic Irish preferred hit-and-run raids (the crech), which involved catching the enemy unaware. If this worked they would then seize any valuables (mainly livestock) and potentially valuable hostages, burn the crops, and escape. The cattle raid was often called a Tain Bo in Gaelic literature. Although hit-and-run raiding was the preferred tactic in medieval times, there were also pitched battles. From at least the 11th century, kings maintained small permanent fighting forces known as \\"troops of the household\\", who were often given houses and land on the king's mensal land. These were well-equipped professional soldiers made up of infantry and cavalry. By the reign of Brian Boru, Irish kings were taking large armies on campaign over long distances and using naval forces in tandem with land forces.  A typical medieval Irish army included light infantry, heavy infantry and cavalry. The bulk of the army was made-up of light infantry called ceithern (anglicized 'kern'). The ceithern wandered Ireland offering their services for hire and usually wielded swords, skenes (a kind of long knife), short spears, bows and shields. The cavalry was usually made-up of a king or chieftain and his close relatives. They usually rode without saddles but wore armour and iron helmets and wielded swords, skenes and long spears or lances. One kind of Irish cavalry was the hobelar. After the Norman invasion there emerged a kind of heavy infantry called galloglaigh (anglicized 'gallo[w]glass'). They were originally Scottish mercenaries who appeared in the 13th century, but by the 15th century most large tuatha had their own hereditary force of Irish galloglaigh. Some Anglo-Norman lordships also began using galloglaigh in imitation of the Irish. They usually wore mail and iron helmets and wielded sparth axes, claymores, and sometimes spears or lances. The galloglaigh furnished the retreating plunderers with a \\"moving line of defence from which the horsemen could make short, sharp charges, and behind which they could retreat when pursued\\". As their armour made them less nimble, they were sometimes planted at strategic spots along the line of retreat. The kern, horsemen and galloglaigh had lightly-armed servants to carry their weapons into battle.  Warriors were sometimes rallied into battle by blowing horns and warpipes. According to Gerald de Barri (in the 12th century), they did not wear armour, as they deemed it burdensome to wear and \\"brave and honourable\\" to fight without it. Instead, most ordinary soldiers fought semi-naked and carried only their weapons and a small round shield--Spenser wrote that these shields were covered with leather and painted in bright colours. Kings and chiefs sometimes went into battle wearing helmets adorned with eagle feathers. For ordinary soldiers, their thick hair often served as a helmet, but they sometimes wore simple helmets made from animal hides.","output":"This text is about Gaelic Ireland, which refers to the Gaelic political and social order, as well as the associated culture, that existed in Ireland from the prehistoric era until the early 17th century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Vuk and the butcher had joined forces out of necessity, as teamwork greatly increased their chances of survival. As the butcher finished reloading, he handed Vuk a spare revolver he had picked up earlier, ensuring they both had a means to defend themselves. Sensing they shared a mutual understanding, both men knew they would have to trust one another in order to navigate the treacherous landscape of their once-familiar world. They crept closer to the corner, weapons in hand, prepared to confront whatever horrors lay beyond it. Vuk peeped around the corner, trying to discern the location of the infected that killed the one who had almost taken his life. The smoke billowing from the seemingly impossibly tall stack made it difficult to see anything at first, but gradually, Vuk could make out certain shapes and lines in the dense mist. He saw the silhouette of a hunched figure, blood dripping down its now lifeless face, but no sign of the one responsible for it. Vuk knew he had to be careful – one wrong move, and it would mark the difference between life and death for both him and the butcher. The butcher, sensing Vuk's hesitation, devised a plan. He pulled a jury-rigged Molotov cocktail from his bag and lit the cloth trapped in the bottle's mouth. He whispered to Vuk, \\"On the count of three, I'll throw this into the mist. It should give us a clear line of sight and force whoever took down that infected toward us.\\" Vuk nodded, knowing the situation required risks, and they braced themselves for what was to come. As the butcher counted down, Vuk tightened his grip on the revolver, his heart pounding in his chest. The moment the butcher reached \\"three,\\" he hurled the makeshift weapon as far away from them as possible, letting it shatter and explode in a burst of fire. Flames engulfed part of the mist, revealing the empty top of the smokestack and a horde of infected converging on the source of the noise and light. Taking advantage of the chaos, a masked figure slid down the ladder from the smokestack, landing in a crouch next to the pair. The butcher and Vuk aimed their weapons at him, unsure whether their mysterious savior intended to help or harm. The figure raised his hands, his voice low and measured as he explained how he had been following them for some time, admiring their tenacity and resourcefulness. He had taken out one of the infected just in time to save Vuk from certain death, but had remained hidden, not wanting to reveal his presence until he felt it was absolutely necessary. Vuk, recognizing he owed his life to this stranger, realized they needed all the help they could get in this new, hostile world. In a somber tone, he offered the figure an opportunity to join them in their journey for survival. Expressing gratitude for their trust, the stranger accepted, introducing himself as Marek. The butcher, Vuk, and Marek formed a reluctant but determined alliance, vowing to lean on each other amid the harsh new reality they were thrust into. Together, the trio faced both the infected and the dangers of the desolate environment, forging ahead into the unknown, doing whatever it took to cling onto life for just one more day. Their journey through adversity tested the limits of their trust, ingenuity, and resilience.

What did Mohieddin attribute Nassir's mistakes in 1967 to?","output":"Zakaria Mohieddin, who served as Gamal Abdel Nasser's vice president, attributed Nasser's mistakes in 1967 to a combination of factors. Firstly, he observed that Nasser had gradually changed during his reign, increasingly making decisions on his own without consulting his colleagues. This shift in Nasser's leadership style might have led him to make less-informed decisions and take risks without proper guidance.  Secondly, Mohieddin highlighted Nasser's unsuccessful bluffing game in the context of the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict. Nasser had repeatedly claimed that the timing of a war with Israel would be determined by him or the Arab states; however, in 1967, he began bluffing about his military readiness. The problem was that Israel could \\"see his hand in the mirror\\" and knew that he was bluffing, as they were aware that his army was not yet prepared for war. This unsuccessful bluff resulted in a dangerous miscalculation, which ultimately led to Egypt's defeat in the Six-Day War. Lastly, Mohieddin suggested that Nasser's out-of-character actions during this period could be partially attributed to his diabetes. This was the only rational explanation that Mohieddin could provide for Nasser's unusual choices in 1967, implying that his medical condition might have affected his decision-making abilities and exacerbated his tendency to make risky moves without consulting his colleagues. Overall, Mohieddin attributed Nasser's mistakes in 1967 to the combination of his changing leadership style, unsuccessful bluffing, and potential health-related factors."},{"instruction":"Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Your stomach digests the food - Sugars from food enter your bloodstream - Insulin helps turn sugars into energy - Insulin helps your body store the energy in fat, muscle and liver cells - The answer is:","output":"You consume food."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The Marine's name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return. Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies. Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Alexis (Manny PÃ©rez), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison. Ozzy stares at Alexis, and Alexis stares back, however, before Ozzy is able to make his way to Alexis, both Jesse and Johnny hold him back then they make their way to Edy's store.

Title: Andrei Rublev Movie plot: Director Andrei Tarkovsky shows the beautiful icons created by this famous iconographer only at the end of this long, long film. He shows that they were not just painted by a contemplative monk in a peaceful monastery. They were painted in the midst of the bustling life and terrible cruelty of medieval Russia, a land of ignorant peasants, cruel princes and Tartars invading thrice a year.Part I (86 mins.)Chapter 1 Hot-Air BalloonChapter 2 The Buffoon, 1400 AD. The opening image is of three monks who set off for Moscow across a harvested field: Kirill, Andrei and Danila. They take shelter from a rainstorm in a barn/inn. There, a buffoon is entertaining peasants with a song mocking the local boyar (lord). Then, some soldiers come and arrest the buffoon.Chapter 3 Theophanes the Greek, 1405 AD. This begins with the grisly scene of a man shouting as he is dragged to the wheel to be broken. The scene ends with the gory aftermath: the bloodied body lying on the wheel. An artistic discussion occurs between Theophanes the Greek and Father Kirill. Theophanes asks him to become his assistant. Kirill says he will, if the master will come to the monastery and ask for him personally, in front of all the monks. To his bitter disappointment, he sends someone else, to ask for Andrei instead. Andrei agrees to go, but Danila refuses, when Andrei asks him to accompany him. Andrei is devastated. The next morning, he goes to Danilas cell and confesses, We have shared the same cell for years. I cant paint without you. I look with your eyes; I listen with your ears. Danila replies with tears in his eyes, You silly man, go with my blessing! Andrei kneels and kisses Danila's hand. Meanwhile, Father Kirill leaves the monastery in disgust, past a huge wall of logs, shouting You brood of vipers! You have made his temple a den of thieves.Chapter 4 The Passion according to Andrei, 1406 AD The chapter opens with Father Andrei walking through a forest with his apprentice, Foma.

Answer:","output":"William Henry Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton, was born on 24 December 1724 and passed away on 14 September 1808. He was the youngest son of Sir Thomas Lyttelton, the 4th baronet. Not expecting to inherit his family's estates, William took up various government appointments throughout his years. In 1755, he was appointed as the Governor of Colonial South Carolina, where he played a crucial role in America's fight for independence. He held this office for a few years before being appointed as the Governor of Jamaica in 1760 and later as the envoy-extraordinary to Portugal in 1766. Lyttelton was raised to the Irish peerage in 1776 as Baron Westcote. His predecessor in the Irish peerage was Ambrose Aungier, 2nd Earl of Longford. After the death of his nephew, Thomas Lyttelton, the 2nd Baron Lyttelton in 1779, William inherited the family baronetcy and the estates in Frankley, Halesowen, and Hagley. However, the estates in Upper Arley passed to the late Lord's sister Lucy, wife of Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Mountnorris. The title Baron Lyttelton was revived for Baron Westcote (William Henry Lyttelton) in 1794. He married twice during his lifetime. His first wife was Martha Macartney, daughter and coheir of James Macartney of Longford, nephew and coheir of Ambrose Aungier, 2nd Earl of Longford.

Maurice put up flyers for the new salon to try to get more customers after canceling the online ads, because the","output":"online ads campaign had not been as effective as he had hoped. He chose to distribute the flyers in strategic locations around the city, where potential clientele frequented. These locations included coffee shops, gyms, malls, and public transportation hubs. Maurice knew that in order for the new salon to thrive, he needed to reach the right audience: people who are interested in fashion, looking for a change, or simply in need of a convenient salon experience. To make the flyers more attractive, Maurice collaborated with a local graphic designer to create an eye-catching layout with intriguing visuals, ensuring the salon's services and promotions stood out. The flyers showcased the salon's chic interior, skilled staff, and a variety of hair and beauty services. In addition, the flyers included a limited time promotional offer - a 20% discount on the first visit as an extra incentive for potential clients to give his salon a try.  Maurice also decided to share the flyers with his family, friends, and established customers, encouraging them to spread the word about the new salon and refer their networks. Word-of-mouth marketing has always been a powerful tool; by leveraging personal connections, Maurice was optimistic about attracting new customers and securing repeat visits.  To gauge the impact of the flyers campaign, Maurice implemented a system to track the number of new customers acquired from the promotional offer. He made a note of asking clients how they had heard about the salon and diligently recorded this information. This would not only help Maurice evaluate the success of the flyer distribution but also provide valuable insights on which locations and demographics were most responsive to his marketing efforts. Moreover, Maurice recognized the importance of social media in today's business landscape and, although he had canceled the online ads, he continued to be active on social media platforms to promote the salon. He shared images of the flyer on the salon's official Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts and invited his followers to like, share, and repost the content. This approach, combined with regularly showcasing his stylists' work on various social media channels, generated a buzz around the salon, piquing people's curiosity and earning new clients. Within a few weeks, Maurice began to notice an increase in walk-ins and appointments, as well as a rise in positive online reviews from satisfied customers. The salon's reputation started to grow, and soon, it became the talk of the town. Encouraged by these results, Maurice decided to set up a loyalty program to retain the newfound customer base and reward them for their continued support.  He developed a rewards system where customers would earn points for every service they received, which could later be redeemed for discounts on future visits. Additionally, he initiated a referral program, where both the referrer and referee would receive a discount on their next service. This not only encouraged client retention but also facilitated continuous word-of-mouth promotion. In conclusion, Maurice's strategic decision to cancel the ineffective online ads and switch to a more targeted and personal method of promoting his salon proved to be successful. By leveraging the power of flyers, word-of-mouth marketing, and social media, Maurice attracted and retained new clients, consequently securing the growth and success of his salon in an increasingly competitive market."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

As \\"Funky Jan\\", Jan is soon the most popular rock star on the planet while the oblivious Daniel is left out in the cold. But when B.L. comes for her soul and she realizes what she has done, a distraught Jan goes to Daniel for help. A trial is held in the woods at night over Jan's soul, with Weez as the judge and Daniel acting as Jan's attorney. As an additional stipend, the Devil states that should Daniel lose the trial, his soul as well as Jan's will be taken as payment. At first, the trial seems hopeless, considering Daniel has no education as a lawyer and cannot present even the beginnings of a reasonable argument to release Jan. Having nothing else to offer, Daniel begins to sing a heartfelt song. Jan joins in, as do her three heretofore unhelpful band members. The other animals watching the trial begin to sing and clap along to the tune and so do the jury of lost souls. An enraged Devil attempts to summon forth demons to stop the heroes, but the spirits he conjures also fall prey to the sway of Daniel's music. A frustrated Devil finally leaves, returning to Hell and taking Weez and all his other minions with him. The two mice...

First, let's simplify the constants: - 1314648 + 1324728 = 10080   Now, substitute this back into the equation: 140*a + 10080 = 0 Next, we will isolate the variable a.

The script needed some serious rewriting as it seems to be completely devoid of any feeling and pales in comparison to the book. The lighting is horrid, very unpolished, but if it was just that I could overlook it. The script doesn't focus enough on the characters...there is hardly an introduction to various characters making it a tad difficult to distinguish who is who(especially in the planes--no idea who dies when). I have long felt that the key to a good film is in getting the audience to care about the characters; if you don't have that you don't have anything. There was no focus on the characters at all--you never got to know them--who they were, what they liked..what made them do the things that they do. The series is 5 hours long and split up into 6 parts...I bet you are wondering what they did with all this time if they didn't detail the characters---they put a lot of filler in it....I will say at least an entire hour is spent watching them land and take off in their planes LOL (I mean do we really need to see that over and over again???). I would have given this a much higher rating had they just improved our knowledge of the characters.","output":"To determine the sentiment of this text, let's analyze it step-by-step: 1.

Answer the following question: Question: who was the commander of UN forces in Korea I found the following answer on Google: Most observers concluded that the forces under the UNC were not in law United Nations troops, and the acts of the UNC were not the acts of the United Nations. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the answer provided does not correctly address the question regarding the commander of the United Nations (UN) forces in Korea. The question is asking for the name of the commander who led the United Nations forces during the Korean War. The United Nations Command (UNC) was a multinational force created in response to North Korea's invasion of South Korea in 1950. The UN forces were comprised of military personnel from several countries, most notably the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and others. The correct answer to your question is that General Douglas MacArthur was appointed the commander of the UN forces in Korea at the onset of the Korean War in 1950. Gen. MacArthur was a distinguished and experienced military leader, having played key roles during World War I, World War II, and the post-war administration of Japan. He commanded the UN forces during the early crucial stages of the Korean War, including the Inchon Landing and the retreat from North Korea after the Chinese intervention. However, the leadership of UN forces in Korea changed later in the war. In April 1951, President Harry S. Truman relieved Gen. MacArthur of his command, as he disagreed with MacArthur's proposed strategy for the conflict, which included aggressive actions against China. At that point, General Matthew Ridgway was appointed as the new commander of UN forces in Korea, who served in this position through the remainder of the war. Ultimately, the Korean War ended with an armistice signed on July 27, 1953, leading to the continued division of the Korean Peninsula along the 38th parallel. The multinational United Nations Command still exists today, mainly tasked with maintaining the ceasefire between North and South Korea."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- With a probate court trial over the sale of the Los Angeles Clippers scheduled to begin Monday, lawyers for Donald Sterling filed paperwork Thursday to have the matter moved to federal court. Donald Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly, is asking a probate judge to approve an agreement she reached with billionaire Steve Ballmer to sell the NBA team. For years, she and her husband had equal shares in the franchise through a family trust, but Shelly Sterling negotiated a deal in late May to sell the team after two doctors declared her husband was mentally incapacitated. Donald Sterling's lawyers filed a notice of removal in U.S. District Court in central California requesting the change of courts. For the team to be sold, either OPTIONS: - CNN would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. - California would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. - Clippers would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. - Donald Sterling would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. - Los Angeles Clippers would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. - NBA would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. - Shelly would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. - Shelly Sterling would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. - Steve Ballmer would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. - U.S. District Court would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team.","output":"For the team to be sold, either Donald Sterling would have to sign a binding term sheet or a court would have to agree Shelly Sterling acted legally in selling the team. The situation at hand revolves around the legality and control over the sale of the Los Angeles Clippers, which is caught in a dispute between Donald Sterling and his estranged wife, Shelly Sterling. Shelly has already negotiated a deal with billionaire Steve Ballmer to sell the team, but Donald Sterling's consent or legal validation of Shelly's actions is necessary for the sale to push through successfully. Thus, the court's role becomes crucial in determining if Shelly Sterling had the legal authority to sell the NBA team without her husband's consent. If the court finds that Shelly Sterling acted within her legal rights, then the sale can proceed even without Donald Sterling's approval. However, if Donald Sterling decides to sign a binding term sheet, it would mean he has agreed to the sale, and the dispute would essentially be resolved."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\".Martin initially selected the Starr version of \\"Love Me Do\\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, \\"Love Me Do\\" peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places. After Martin suggested rerecording \\"Please Please Me\\" at a faster tempo, a studio session in late November yielded that recording, of which Martin accurately predicted, \\"You've just made your first No.1.\\"In December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, in an effort to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, \\"Look, if you really want to get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ...\\" Lennon said: \\"We used to dress how we...

There are among some 40 collections that are being shown at \\"The Museum Of\\"--the first of several new museums which, over the next two years, will exhibit the objects accumulated by unknown collectors. In doing so, they will promote a popular culture of museums, not what museums normally represent. Some of the collections are fairly common--records, model houses. Others are strangely beautiful--branches that have fallen from tree, for example. But they all reveal  a lot of things: ask someone what they collect and their answers will tell you who they are. Other on the way include \\"The museum of Collectors\\" and \\"The Museum of Me.\\"These new ones, it is hoped, will build on the success of \\"The Museum Of.\\" The thinkers behind the project want to explore why people collect, and what it means to do so.

Other painful times are mentioned, such as the end of a relationship. For time and life can seem so uncontrollable that a steady serial arrangement is comforting. Question: What can be learned about collectors from their collections? Answer: A:","output":"From their collections, it can be learned that collectors often have unique personalities, interests, and experiences that shape their choice of items to collect. Collections can provide insight into the individual's values, preferences, and passions, offering a glimpse into their identity and personal story. Collections can range from fairly common items, such as records and model houses, to more eccentric and strangely beautiful objects, such as fallen tree branches. The variety in collections highlights the diversity of interests and creative expressions amongst collectors. Some collectors begin or stop making collections at significant points in their lives, such as the beginning or end of adolescence or the end of a relationship. This suggests that collecting can serve as a coping mechanism for individuals undergoing life transitions or emotional turmoil. The sense of order and control offered by gathering and maintaining collections may provide comfort and stability when other aspects of life seem unpredictable and overwhelming. Furthermore, collecting may serve as a form of self-expression, personal achievement, or an avenue to develop expertise in a particular subject matter. The act of collecting can contribute to one's sense of identity and purpose, as well as foster a sense of belonging within a community of like-minded individuals who share similar interests. In conclusion, collections can reveal a wealth of information about collectors, including their personalities, interests, experiences, and motivations. By examining the types of items collected and the circumstances surrounding the creation or cessation of a collection, we can gain a better understanding of the individual behind the collection and the personal significance it holds for them.

For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world.  Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\"  Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.

We will follow the basic principles of algebra, which consist of simplifying the equation, isolating x, and finding its value. Let's start by solving the equation step by step: 1. Begin by adding both sides of the equation by 8x to eliminate the term with x from the right side of the equation: -6x + 8x = -8x + 8x + 6 Now, simplify: 2x = 6 2. Now, we need to isolate the variable x. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by 2: 2x / 2 = 6 / 2 This operation simplifies to: x = 3 So, the value of x that satisfies the given equation -6*x = -8*x + 6 is x = 3."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the question...how many layers are there in osi model??","output":"The OSI model, short for Open Systems Interconnection model, is a conceptual framework used to standardize the functions of a telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying internal structure and technology. It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as a way to improve compatibility and communication between different networks and computing systems. The OSI model divides the functions of a network into seven distinct layers, each of which is responsible for performing a specific set of tasks and interacting with the layers directly above and below it. Here is a detailed explanation of each of the seven layers in the OSI model: 1. Physical Layer (Layer 1): The lowest layer of the OSI model, the physical layer is responsible for the physical connection between devices, including electrical, mechanical, and functional means. This encompasses everything from the type of cable being used to the physical network topology. It is also responsible for converting digital data into electrical signals for transmission over network cables, as well as receiving and converting those electrical signals back into digital data upon receipt. 2. Data Link Layer (Layer 2): This layer establishes and maintains reliable communication between devices on the same network segment. It focuses on error detection and correction, as well as the management of data frames being transmitted between devices. Additionally, the data link layer is responsible for defining the MAC (Media Access Control) address, which uniquely identifies devices within a local network. 3. Network Layer (Layer 3): The network layer is responsible for identifying and selecting the best path for data transmission between devices, often spanning multiple network segments. This is where routers and IP (Internet Protocol) addressing come into play, with each device being assigned a unique IP address to enable proper routing of data packets between source and destination devices. 4. Transport Layer (Layer 4): This layer is responsible for the reliable transmission of data between devices across a network. It primarily focuses on error detection, error recovery, and ensuring that data is delivered in the correct order. Two commonly used transport layer protocols are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP provides error-checking and reliability, while UDP prioritizes speed over reliability, which might be preferable in applications like real-time video streaming where minor data loss is acceptable. 5. Session Layer (Layer 5): The session layer is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections, or \\"sessions,\\" between devices on a network. This layer manages the synchronization of data exchange and coordinates the communication between the devices involved in a session. It also takes care of any necessary authentication and authorization processes. 6. Presentation Layer (Layer 6): This layer acts as a translator between application data and network data formats, ensuring that the data is formatted correctly for the intended recipient. Responsibilities include data encryption, compression, and character set translation (e.g., converting between ASCII and Unicode). The presentation layer essentially serves as an intermediary between the application layer and lower-level network layers. 7. Application Layer (Layer 7): The highest layer in the OSI model, the application layer deals with the software applications and end-user processes that interact with the network. This layer is responsible for providing user interfaces, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), and other services like email, file transfers, and web browsing. Examples of application layer protocols are HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web browsing, FTP (File Transfer Protocol) for file transfers, and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for email communication. In summary, the OSI model comprises seven layers: the Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, Network Layer, Transport Layer, Session Layer, Presentation Layer, and Application Layer. Each layer is responsible for performing certain tasks and directly interacts with adjacent layers in the model, allowing for effective communication and data transmission between different networks and devices. The OSI model has played a pivotal role in facilitating the standardization and interoperability of network technologies around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

In fact, so many solutes can dissolve in water that water has been called the universal solvent. Even rocks can dissolve in water, which explains the cave that opened this article. A solute that can dissolve in a given solvent, such as water, is said to be soluble in that solvent. Conversely, a solute that cannot dissolve in a given solvent is said to be insoluble in that solvent.   Q: What liquid is referred to as the \\"universal solvent\\"?   A: A:","output":"The liquid that is referred to as the \\"universal solvent\\" is water. In the context provided, the term \\"universal solvent\\" depicts the unique capability of water to dissolve a vast number of different solutes. Solutes cover a wide range of substances, and these include but are not limited to substances like salts, sugars, acids, alkalis, some gases and even some organic molecules.  The reason water is able to dissolve so many different substances is anchored on its polar nature. Water molecules have a slight electric charge due to the nature of the bond between the hydrogen and the oxygen atoms that comprise water. This means that water has 'positive' and 'negative' ends or poles. Consequently, it interacts with many different types of molecules, especially those that also have electric charges or those that can develop charges, leading them to break down or dissolve in water. For instance, when table salt (sodium chloride) comes into contact with water, the positive end of a water molecule is attracted to the chloride ions (negative), and the negative end of the water molecule is attracted to the sodium ions (positive). Through these attractions, water can cause the ions to separate from one another and become thoroughly mixed into the water, effectively causing the salt to dissolve.  The solubility of rocks leading to the formation of caves, as mentioned in the paragraph, is also a product of this unique property of water. Over significant periods of time, water can break down certain types of rocks like limestone; it seeps into cracks in the rock, freezes, expands and causes the rock to further fracture, through this cyclic process, it can over time cause enough break down to form a cave. So, when a substance is described as being soluble, it means that it can be dissolved in a solvent, such as water. The opposite, insoluble, refers to a substance that cannot be dissolved in a solvent. Hence, referring to water as the 'universal solvent' highlights its remarkable ability to dissolve more substances than any other liquid."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Es könnte Chile zwar daran hindern, sich vor den Launen der Kapitalmärkte zu schützen, es könnte aber auch sein, dass es weder zu einem wirklich freien noch zu einem ausgewogenen Handel führt. Translate to English","output":"Although Chile may be prevented from protecting itself from the whims of the capital markets, it could also be the case that it leads neither to truly free nor to balanced trade. Chile, as a country with a strong focus on export-oriented industries, could potentially face difficulties in protecting itself from the fluctuations and unpredictable nature of the global capital markets. A series of factors, domestic and international, can have significant impacts on Chile's economic stability, as well as the fairness and balance of its trade relationships with other nations. First, let's consider the global economic context. Volatility in capital markets often arises from factors outside of a nation's control, such as geopolitical tensions, financial crises, global recessions, or even unforeseen worldwide events. These external factors can pose an immense challenge for export-dependent countries such as Chile, as they can lead to significant fluctuations in demand for their products and services. As a result, Chile may find it challenging to shield its economy from the negative impacts of these external events, which can lead to economic instability and a lack of balanced trade. Moreover, the structure of Chile's economy presents additional challenges. Chile is well-known for its dependence on the export of commodities, particularly copper, which constitutes a significant portion of the country's GDP and export earnings. This heavy reliance on a single commodity can render the economy susceptible to fluctuations in copper prices, which can be influenced by a multitude of factors, both domestic and international, such as shifts in global demand, changes in mining industries, and varying trade policies. As such, the composition of Chile's trading partners and the nature of its trade agreements also play a pivotal role in determining the balance of its trade. Countries that primarily engage in trade with a small number of partners, or with partners that hold overwhelming economic power, may find themselves in more vulnerable positions, as their trade balance can be disproportionately affected by the actions and policies of these partners. This could lead to situations where Chile is unable to achieve truly free or balanced trade, as it may become subject to the interests and demands of its more powerful trading partners. Furthermore, industrial policies and domestic issues within Chile can contribute to the country's struggles relating to free and balanced trade. For example, subsidies or protectionist measures adopted by the government might hamper Chile's ability to compete fairly in the global marketplace. Additionally, domestic issues such as socioeconomic inequality, lack of access to quality education, and inadequate infrastructure can put constraints on the nation's internal growth and development, ultimately affecting its international trade and economic stability. In conclusion, Chile may find it challenging to protect itself from the whims of the capital markets, in part due to its export-dependent economy and reliance on commodities like copper, as well as the influence of various external factors. Furthermore, the balance and fairness of Chile's trade relationships can be affected by its trading partners, domestic policies, and internal constraints. Consequently, the country might find it difficult to achieve a state of truly free and balanced trade."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the building that remains in use by the Church of England?  St Denys' Church, Sleaford, is a medieval Anglican parish church in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, England. While a church and a priest have probably been present in the settlement since approximately 1086, the oldest parts of the present building are the tower and spire, which date to the late 12th and early 13th centuries; the stone broach spire is one of the earliest examples of its kind in England. The Decorated Gothic nave, aisles and north transept were built in the 14th century. The church was altered in the 19th century: the north aisle was rebuilt by the local builders Kirk and Parry in 1853 and the tower and spire were largely rebuilt in 1884 after being struck by lightning. St Denys' remains in use for worship by the Church of England. The church is a Grade I listed building, a national designation given to \\"buildings of exceptional interest\\". It is a prime example of Decorated Gothic church architecture in England, with the architectural historians Sir Nikolaus Pevsner and John Harris noting that \\"it is a prolonged delight to follow the mason's inventiveness\\". The church's tracery has attracted special praise, with Simon Jenkins arguing that its Decorated windows are \\"works of infinite complexity\\". Built out of Ancaster stone with a lead roof, St Denys' is furnished with a medieval rood screen and a communion rail, possibly by Sir Christopher Wren, and has a peal of eight bells, dating to 1796. The church also houses several memorials, including two altar tombs commemorating members of the Carre family, Sleaford's lords of the manor in the 17th century.

Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can. While answering think step-by-step and justify your answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given two lists A,B. Find the longest common subsequence in the lists A and B. Problem:[6731, 'U', 3385, 'a', 'Q', '2103', '1781', '2215', 'I', 4463, 'N'], [3807, 1105, 'F', 'r', 'a', 'Q', '2103', '1781', '2215', 'y', 7587] Solution:","output":"To find the longest common subsequence in the lists A and B, we'll use dynamic programming approach. Here's a step-by-step process for the solution: 1. Create a matrix with the shape (len(A) + 1) x (len(B) + 1). This will help in recording lengths of common subsequence through the iterations. 2. Iterate through each row (i) and column (j) in the matrix, starting from row 1 and column 1 (we leave row 0 and column 0 with 0s, which will help in our calculations). 3. If A[i-1] equals to B[j-1] (meaning the current elements of A and B are same), then matrix[i][j] = matrix[i-1][j-1] + 1. This implies that we are increasing the length of previously found common subsequence by 1. 4. If A[i-1] is not equal to B[j-1], then matrix[i][j] = max(matrix[i-1][j], matrix[i][j-1]). This means we are taking the maximum length of previously found common subsequences in row i or column j. 5. Once we fill in the entire matrix, the value at the bottom-right corner of the matrix (matrix[len(A)][len(B)]) will indicate the length of the longest common subsequence. 6. To find the actual subsequence, we backtrack from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner in the matrix, while comparing elements in A and B:    a. If A[i-1] is equal to B[j-1], include the element in the subsequence and move diagonally up-left in the matrix.    b. If not, choose the direction (up or left) with the higher value in the matrix and continue making the choice until reaching the top-left corner. 7. Reverse the obtained longest common subsequence to get the correct order of elements in the subsequence. Given the lists A = [6731, 'U', 3385, 'a', 'Q', '2103', '1781', '2215', 'I', 4463, 'N'] and B = [3807, 1105, 'F', 'r', 'a', 'Q', '2103', '1781', '2215', 'y', 7587]: By following the steps, we find that the longest common subsequence in lists A and B is ['a', 'Q', '2103', '1781', '2215']."},{"instruction":"What is the final step of the following process: -  A dam is built in an area prone to flooding - A large amount of rain occurs - The water builds up behind the dam - The dam opens its floodgates when it starts to get full - The water flows into a river below the dam - The dam closes its gates - The dam will occasionally open its gates again to gradually release more water","output":"The final step is the dam occasionally opening its gates again to gradually release more water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On the left side, combine the constant terms -2951 and -1357: -2951 - 1357 = -4308 So the equation becomes: -19*p - 4308 = 71*p + 1632 Step 2: Move all terms with the variable (p) to one side of the equation and all constant terms to the other side. To do this, add 19*p to both sides of the equation to move the term with p on the left side to the right side: -19*p + 19*p - 4308 = 71*p + 19*p + 1632 -4308 = 90*p + 1632 Now, subtract 1632 from both sides to move the constant on the right side to the left side: -4308 - 1632 = 90*p + 1632 - 1632 -5940 = 90*p Step 3: Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable (90) to solve for p: -5940/90 = 90*p/90 After dividing, we get: -66 = p So, the solution for the equation -19*p - 2951 - 1357 = 71*p + 1632 is p = -66."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(June 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Introduction: The title card is shown as a billboard behind which Wile E. Coyote is hiding, ready to chase the Road Runner. He starts the chase, until he runs into a large truck. Wile E. runs the other way, and the truck shows the credit. The chase ends in a win for the truck, and the Coyote emerges battered. A box with director Chuck Jones' credit then squashes him. The Coyote throws the box away, and the shot freezes: COYOTE - Eatius Birdius. He resumes the chase, which freezes to show the Road Runner: Delicius-Delicius. The chase continues down the road until the Road Runner makes a U-turn. The Coyote turns around, then stops. The Road Runner completes the circuit around, meanwhile, and beeps as the Coyote turns around, causing him to leap back. The Road Runner starts off down the road and loosens it from its hinge briefly. Wile E. points worriedly and displays an \\"EGAD\\" sign, then an \\"!!\\" sign. He drops them and thinks of his new plan. 1. Wile E. hides in a manhole, and as the Road Runner passes over him, he pops out and fires a rifle. The bullet and the Road Runner are shown in slow time, with the bullet closing to within a half-body length of the bird. Then the Road Runner turns to notice the threat, lets out a beep and gears into super speed. The bullet then brakes in puzzlement and falls to the ground. Wile E. picks it up, and then it detonates. Behind another rock face (in completely different desert scenery), Wile E. paces until he comes up with a new plan. 2. Wile E. leaps out into the road with \\"1 sheet ACME Triple Strength BATTLESHIP STEEL ARMOR PLATE\\" in front of him; even this cannot stop the Road Runner from barreling through it. The Coyote stares in puzzlement at the resulting hole, which shows only the scenery behind him where parts of his body should logically be, then walks... A:","output":"In the movie Gee Whiz-z-z-z-z-z-z, at the beginning of the plot, Wile E. Coyote is hiding behind a billboard, which shows the title card of the movie. As the story progresses, Wile E. Coyote continues his pursuit of the Road Runner and engages in a variety of hiding places and plans to catch the elusive bird.  1. Wile E. Coyote's first hiding spot, apart from the billboard, is inside a manhole. He hides there, waiting for the Road Runner to pass over him. When the right moment comes, he emerges and fires a rifle. The bullet almost reaches the Road Runner, but the bird notices the threat, beeps, and accelerates into super speed, evading the bullet. The scene ends with the bullet detonating in Wile E.'s hands. 2. We then see Wile E. Coyote hiding behind another rock face in a different desert scenery. Here, he paces and comes up with a new plan to capture the Road Runner. This time, he decides to leap onto the road with a \\"1 sheet ACME Triple Strength BATTLESHIP STEEL ARMOR PLATE.\\" However, even this is not enough to stop the Road Runner, as the bird effortlessly barrels right through the armor plate.

Neil always brewed his coffee last thing in the morning unlike Steven because","output":"Steven preferred to have his coffee first thing when he woke up. But today, Neil's peculiar coffee habit would prove to be a life-changing event. Over the years, Neil had perfected the art of brewing coffee, just the way he liked it. He enjoyed the process of choosing the right beans, grinding them, and using his special French press to create his beloved concoction. The intriguing aroma and the deep, rich taste of his coffee were something he looked forward to at the end of every morning routine. This daily ritual allowed him to fully savor the moment and prepare himself to tackle whatever challenges the day might bring. Steven, on the other hand, was more of a functional coffee drinker. To him, coffee was a necessity, like brushing his teeth or putting on deodorant. Every day, without fail, his first act upon waking would be to roll out of bed and stumble towards the kitchen, eyes half-open, to begin brewing his morning savior. It was a well-rehearsed dance, one that helped him transition from sleepy haze to a fully awake and functioning adult. This particular morning was different, though. Neil, with his passion for toying with different ingredients in his coffee, had picked up a rare coffee bean from the market the other day. An old lady with a cryptic smile had sold it to him, insisting it was sourced from the depths of the Amazon rainforest and claiming it would open his mind to a whole new world of tastes and sensations. Intrigued, Neil had bought the bag of beans for an exorbitant price, only to surprise Steven later in the day. Steven, however, had been anything but thrilled. He considered it a waste of time and money, believing that coffee was just coffee. Undeterred, Neil spent the morning in his typical methodical fashion, grinding the new beans just right, measuring the water temperature, and carefully maintaining the brewing time. The aroma was entrancing, boasting an otherworldly scent. Even Steven seemed to be a little curious now. The moment arrived, and Neil poured the aromatic brew into two cups, presenting one to Steven with a triumphant smile. Tentatively, the two took their first sips, and suddenly they both knew that this coffee was unlike anything they had ever tasted before. It was magical. The flavor was extraordinary, with intense, rich undertones and a hint of exotic spices. But the true wonder laid in the effect. As the brew filled their veins, the world around them changed – subtly yet unmistakably. Colors were magnified, sounds were sharper, and their senses were heightened beyond comprehension. Neil and Steven found themselves experiencing their surroundings in an entirely new way. Each bird's song reverberated through their bones, the air on their skin was electric, and the simple taste of food became a symphony of delight. It was as if they had been granted the ability to connect with the world on a level far beyond their previous understanding. As the day wore on, they began to grapple with their newfound hyper-awareness. It was both thrilling and overwhelming, but they grew to recognize that their lives would never be the same again. Neil, who had long been the more adventurous type, embraced the change wholeheartedly, pursuing further knowledge about the mysterious coffee bean and the meaning behind their enhanced abilities. Steven, on the other hand, was initially unsettled by the transformation, but eventually came to appreciate it. He began to understand the true depth of his friend's love for coffee and the magical unity of their morning ritual. Every morning thereafter, they brewed their coffee together, each with a newfound appreciation for the complexities it could bring. And though the magic of that first, otherworldly cup never quite returned to the same intensity, a small piece of that adventure lingered in every sip, a persistent reminder of the day their lives changed forever."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Another essential aspect of an evil persona is facial expression, particularly furrowed brows, which give off a calculating and sinister appearance. Lowering one's brow or raising one while lowering the other can further enhance the wicked aura. The ability to unnerve others with these expressions significantly contributes to the effectiveness of an evil laugh.  In addition to facial expressions, incorporating appropriate hand gestures can also elevate the impact of the laugh. Depending on the nature of the laugh, one can use calculated gestures like drumming fingers together with palms facing each other or more theatrical movements such as reaching for the sky with outstretched fingers.

For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.  Please answer this question : Which island had more animals that survived their environment? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided and the concept of natural selection, it can be inferred that Wolf Island had more animals that survived their environment in comparison to Loon Island. Loon Island is described as having a very stable environment, which can lead to fewer challenges and less pressure for species to adapt and evolve. Consequently, there might be less diversity on Loon Island as the stability of the environment does not necessitate the development of new adaptations in species, resulting in lesser variation among plant and animal species. On the other hand, Wolf Island exhibits a higher degree of natural selection and is home to a large variety of species. This suggests that the environment in Wolf Island is more dynamic and competitive, leading to various ecological challenges for its inhabitants. It is likely that some species on Wolf Island might have gone extinct due to their inability to adapt and compete effectively. However, the intense process of natural selection means that more surviving species would possess the necessary traits for adapting and thriving in this environment. As a result, the remaining, more diverse species on Wolf Island are better adapted to cope with the environmental pressures, leading to a higher probability of survival over time. In conclusion, natural selection plays a significant role in shaping the species composition and adaptability of organisms in a given environment. Wolf Island, being a more diverse ecosystem that has experienced greater natural selection, has more animals that have survived and adapted to the challenges posed by their environment as compared to the more stable, less diverse Loon Island."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The acromial end of the clavicle articulates with the acromion of the scapula at the acromioclavicular joint. This end is also anchored to the coracoid process of the scapula by the coracoclavicular ligament, which provides indirect support for the acromioclavicular joint. The clavicle supports the scapula, transmits the weight and forces from the upper limb to the body trunk, and protects the underlying nerves and blood vessels. The scapula lies on the posterior aspect of the pectoral girdle. It mediates the attachment of the upper limb to the clavicle, and contributes to the formation of the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint. This triangular bone has three sides called the medial, lateral, and superior borders. The suprascapular notch is located on the superior border. The scapula also has three corners, two of which are the superior and inferior angles. The third corner is occupied by the glenoid cavity. Posteriorly, the spine separates the supraspinous and infraspinous fossae, and then extends laterally as the acromion. The subscapular fossa is located on the anterior surface of the scapula.

Since the end of the game, the survivors of Midgar founded the new city of Edge where Cloud and his childhood friend Tifa Lockhart now run a courier service and are the caretakers of orphans Denzel and Marlene. Cloud is still haunted by his role in the death of Aerith Gainsborough, who was killed by Sephiroth. In addition, both he and Denzel are infected with a mysterious new ailment known as \\"Geostigma\\", which has no known cure. When the film opens, Cloud has recently moved out and isolated himself from his friends. Story[edit] Cloud is contacted through Tifa and summoned to a meeting with the Shinra Company's former president Rufus Shinra, who was presumed killed in Final Fantasy VII.[2] Rufus asks for Cloud's help to stop Kadaj, Loz, and Yazoo. The trio are physical manifestations of Sephiroth's surviving spirit, and are seeking to resurrect him using the remains of the extraterrestrial villain Jenova.[3] Cloud refuses to help and leaves. Meanwhile, Kadaj and his colleagues are recruiting children infected with Geostigma. Denzel falls in with the group, attracted by their promises of a cure for the disease. Loz follows Tifa and Marlene to Aerith's church, where they had gone looking for Cloud, and attacks them. Tifa is knocked unconscious in the fight and Loz kidnapped Marlene. All the kidnapped children are taken to the ruins of the mystical Forgotten City, where Kadaj embraces them as brethren and announces his intention for them all to be reunited with Jenova. When Cloud arrives to rescue them, he is overpowered by Kadaj's gang, but is rescued... My question: What is Denzel's disease?

El Mariachi is recruited by CIA agent Sheldon Jeffrey Sands to kill General Emiliano Marquez, a corrupt Mexican Army officer who has been hired by Mexican drug lord Armando Barillo to assassinate the President of Mexico and overthrow the government. Many years before, El Mariachi and his wife Carolina confronted Marquez in a shootout and wounded the general; in retaliation, Marquez took the lives of Carolina and their daughter in an ambush. In addition to El Mariachi, Sands persuades former FBI agent Jorge Ramírez to come out of retirement and kill Barillo, who had murdered his partner Archuleta in the past. Furthermore, AFN operative Ajedrez is assigned by Sands to tail Barillo. While monitoring Barillo's activities, Ramírez meets Billy Chambers, an American fugitive who has been living under the protection of Barillo, but can no longer stomach the horrible tasks he's been forced to carry out for him. Ramírez convinces Chambers he will provide him protection in exchange for getting closer to Barillo by tagging Chambers' pet chihuahua with a hidden microphone, and Chambers agrees to complete the deal by surrendering to U.S. authorities once Barillo has been taken down. Sands' assistant, Cucuy, originally hired to keep an eye on El Mariachi, instead tranquilizes El Mariachi and turns him over to Barillo, also offering to reveal the details of Sands's plan.

Article: Alice's Adventures in Wonderlandis one of the most loved children's books of all time, and many adults enjoy it as well. It tells the story of a young girl named Alice, who follows a rabbit entering a magical world called Wonderland. She has many experiences which seem to change the rules of reasoning or common sense. The popularity of the book comes from its imagination, interesting story, and art work. The writer of the book is Lewis Carroll. In fact, Lewis Carroll was not the writer's real name. His real name was Charles Dodgson. One day, he took a boat ride down the Thames River to have a picnic with three little girls who were friends of the family. To keep them entertained on the ride, he told them a story in which Alice, the middle child, was the main character. They enjoyed the story very much. Charles later wrote the story down under the nameAlice's Adventures Under Groundand gave it to Alice as a Christmas present. Later, he gave a copy to his friend George MacDonald. George read it to his children and they loved it. George suggested to Charles that he make a book from his story. Charles then wrote more parts to the story until it was around 35,000 words. It was first printed in 1866, with art work by John Tenniel, under the nameAlice's Adventures in Wonderland. The book was an immediate success. One of its first fans was Queen Victoria. She immediately requested a collection of all of Lewis Carroll's works. She was surprised to find that they included many works on math. In fact, Charles Dodgson was a highly respected mathematician. This can be seen in many puzzles and plays on reasoning that appear in his books and poems. Since the story was first printed, it has kept selling up to the present day. It has been translated into over fifty languages and has had several movies based on it. Question: Who first had the idea of making a book from the story \\"Alice Adventures Under Ground\\"?

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Water is heated - The heated water evaporates - The salt is left behind - The evaporated water condenses on a cold surface - The evaporated water is collected - The process is repeated - More salt is removed from the water.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less global warming occurs happens, how will it affect more evaporation occurs.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"To answer the question, let's analyze each step of the process and address the perturbation hypothesis. Step 1: Water is heated - In this step, water containing salt is heated, typically through an external heat source or solar energy. Step 2: The heated water evaporates - As water is heated, it becomes a vapor and begins to evaporate, leaving the salt behind. Step 3: The salt is left behind - When the water evaporates, the dissolved salt is left behind as solid particles. Step 4: The evaporated water condenses on a cold surface - The water vapor from the evaporation process condenses on a cold surface, forming liquid droplets. Step 5: The evaporated water is collected - The condensed liquid droplets are collected separately as purified water. Step 6: The process is repeated - The process is repeated until most or all of the salt has been removed from the water. Step 7: More salt is removed from the water - With each repetition of the process, additional salt is removed from the water until the desired purity is achieved. Perturbation hypothesis: Suppose less global warming occurs; how will it affect more evaporation? - Global warming typically leads to an increase in average temperatures, which could enhance the evaporation process in some cases (for example, if solar energy is used for heating the water). If less global warming occurs, the effect on evaporation would depend on the specific region and climate conditions. In some cases, less global warming might lead to slower evaporation rates, while in other areas, the difference could be negligible. Regarding the perturbation's effect on the process: - Direct effect: A direct effect of the perturbation on the process would be if the reduction in global warming leads to slower evaporation rates, which in turn could affect the efficiency of the salt removal process. However, this effect would depend on the specific conditions and heat sources used for the process. - Indirect effect: An indirect effect might be observed if a reduction in global warming leads to changes in climate patterns or precipitation rates, influencing the availability or salinity of water sources. These changes could have implications for the need for salt removal processes, such as desalination, in particular regions. In summary, the perturbation of less global warming could have both direct and indirect effects on the process of evaporating and removing salt from the water. The extent of these effects would depend on the specific conditions and heat sources used for the process, as well as how regional climate and precipitation patterns are influenced by the decrease in global warming."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tetraplegic forensics expert Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) and a patrol cop, Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie), team up to solve a string of murders connected to a serial killer by his signature: a single shard of bone removed from each of the victims. Rhyme was paralyzed from the neck down in an earlier accident and is bed-bound and completely reliant on machines and his nurse Thelma (Queen Latifah). The killer poses as a New York City taxi driver and abducts and kills those who get in his taxi. The first victims are a married couple named Alan and Lindsay Rubin that the killer picked up at the airport. Amelia finds Alan's body buried in a Civil War-era railroad bed. She also finds a collection of clues including a pile of piece-ground oyster shells, which eventually leads Amelia - now working with Rhyme - to Alan's wife, and a scrap of paper. The detectives find Mrs. Rubin, too late, at a steam junction in a below-ground services area of a building in the Financial District, secured using old antique handcuffs or shackles at the mouth of a pipe which emits steam. She has been scalded to death from the steam. The killer has also removed a bit of flesh and bone from her arm. Amelia finds another scrap of paper at the scene. The killer then abducts an NYU student, who is taken to a derelict slaughterhouse where he is tied to a pole. Part of his thigh bone is surgically removed, and he is left for rats to feed on. Amelia and Rhyme, using the clues left by the killer at the scene of Lindsay Rubin's death, find the victim dead. Again, the killer has removed a piece of the victim's bone. Amelia is able to collect the evidence, including another scrap of paper. The pressure of the tense investigation and bureaucratic challenges to both Amelia's and Rhyme's involvement with the case are having serious impacts on Rhyme's health and stability.

Since then, many new species have been discovered. The biochemistry of many organisms has also become known. Eventually, scientists realized that Linnaeus’s system of classification needed revision.   Q: What scientist created the modern system for classifying organisms?   A: A:","output":"The modern system for classifying organisms is primarily credited to Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus, who published his classification system in the 1700s. Linnaeus developed a hierarchical system known as binomial nomenclature, which is the basis for the taxonomic classification that we use today. Linnaeus's system categorized organisms based on shared physical and structural characteristics. In his system, each species was given a unique two-part name consisting of a genus and species descriptor. This simplified the naming and identification of organisms, making it easier for scientists to study and communicate about them. However, since Linnaeus's time, many new species have been discovered and our understanding of the biochemistry of organisms has advanced significantly. Additionally, advancements in scientific methods, such as the discovery of DNA and insights from evolutionary biology, have further expanded our knowledge of the relationships among living organisms. As a result, scientists recognized the need to revise Linnaeus's original classification system to incorporate new information and better reflect the true evolutionary relationships among species. Although Linnaeus's system has undergone numerous revisions and updates over the centuries, his foundational ideas and principles continue to shape the design of taxonomic classification systems today. In essence, Carl Linnaeus is considered the father of modern taxonomy and his original system, despite its necessary revisions, serves as the basis for classifying organisms in the present day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation 6*x + 0*x = 0 for x, we follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation by removing the terms that do not contribute value. Since 0 times any number, x in this case, will always result in 0, the equation simplifies to: 6*x = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable. In order to find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Since x is being multiplied by 6, we can use the inverse operation, division, to achieve this.  Divide both sides of the equation by 6: 6*x / 6 = 0 / 6 This simplifies to: x = 0 So, the answer is x = 0.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Arab League suspends Syria mission amid violence Arab League suspends Syria mission (CNN) -- At least 58 people were killed in Syria on Sunday, according to an opposition activist group, as the Arab League suspended a monitoring mission designed to protect Syrian civilians from government-sponsored violence. The dead included 19 in Homs, 12 in Hama and 16 around Damascus, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria. Earlier, another opposition activist group, the Syrian Revolution General Council, said as many as 34 people had died Sunday, including a person who had been killed under torture, a woman and two children. Heavy clashes took place in the Eastern Ghotta area outside Damascus, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. At least 50 people were wounded in random bombardment by government forces, the group said, adding the government forces attacked residential areas and cut off electricity, water and communication. The reported deaths come a day after opposition sources said at least 98 people were killed. CNN cannot independently confirm reports from Syria because the government limits the activity of journalists there. Ali Erfan, senior advisor to Arab League Secretary General Nabil el-Araby, said Sunday that observer activity in Syria has been suspended, and all observers who were outside Damascus have redeployed to the capital. Some will leave the country, he said. Others will stay on for the moment in Damascus, but they will not be conducting any missions, he said, adding that he did not have details on how many are leaving and how many are staying. Russia's foreign minister said earlier Sunday he is in favor of boosting the number of observers in Syria, adding that he did not understand why the Arab League suspended its monitoring mission. \\"We should like to understand why this useful instrument is treated in such a way,\\" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said, according to reports in Russian state media. The Arab League announced Saturday it was suspending its mission because of a sharp increase in violence. Monitors representing the 22-nation alliance were in Syria to determine whether President Bashar al-Assad's government is abiding by an agreement with the Arab League to end violence against anti-government protesters. \\"I would support an increased number of observers,\\" Lavrov said. There were reports Sunday of violent clashes between Syrian troops and rebel forces, made up primarily of military defectors, in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta, according the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based opposition group. Three people were killed in the violence, the group said. At least 10 Syrian troops were killed when a roadside bomb targeted a military vehicle in the mountains in the northwest province of Idlib, the Observatory group said. A rebel soldier was killed in clashes between the towns of Bloludan and Zabadani, the group said. A roadside bomb targeted a bus carrying Syrian troops in a Damascus suburb, killing six soldiers and wounding six others, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported Sunday. Al-Assad's government has been under international pressure to stop a brutal, months-long crackdown on an anti-government uprising that began last year. The United Nations, the United States, the European Union and members of the Arab League have called on al-Assad to end the violence and step down. The United Nations last month estimated that more than 5,000 people have died since March, when the government launched a crackdown against demonstrators. Activist groups estimate a higher death toll, with counts near or exceeding 7,000 people. The opposition has blamed the deaths on government actions. The Syrian government says terrorists are responsible for the casualties. Diplomats at the U.N. Security Council are considering a draft resolution that calls on al-Assad to step down and transfer power to his vice president. Lavrov said the Arab League plans to submit new proposals to the U.N. Security Council next week. \\"We need to study a report,\\" he said, according to the ITAR-TASS news agency in Russia. Russia, which maintains trade relations with Syria, has proposed its own draft U.N. resolution that assigns equal blame for the violence on both al-Assad and the opposition, an option dismissed by the West. Lavrov said the draft resolution remains up for discussion. In October, Russia and China issued a rare double veto of a resolution that lacked sanctions but would have condemned the violence in Syria. This latest draft also lacks sanctions, but is tougher than the earlier version, which said nothing about transfer of power. France stepped up the pressure on Russia on Saturday, with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe sending a message to his Russian counterpart urging cooperation on Syria. Meanwhile, the Syrian National Council, the major opposition group in Syria, has called on expatriates to show their solidarity by sitting in front of Russian embassies and consulates starting at 2 p.m. ET on Sunday. There will be a Monday meeting of experts from the missions of the 15 countries on the Security Council. Syrian ambassador to the United Nations, Bashar Ja'afari, has dismissed the proposed resolution. \\"Syria will not be Libya; Syria will not be Iraq; Syria will not be Somalia; Syria will not be a failing state,\\" he told reporters. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.

The bourgeoisie (Eng.: ; ) is a polysemous French term that can mean:  The \\"Bourgeoisie\\", in its original sense, is intimately linked to the existence of cities recognized as such by their urban charters (e.g. municipal charter, town privileges, German town law) so there was no bourgeoisie \\"outside the walls of the city\\" beyond which the people were \\"peasants\\" submitted to the stately courts and manorialism (except for the traveling \\"Fair bourgeoisie\\" living outside urban territories, who retained their city rights and domicile).  In Marxist philosophy the bourgeoisie is the social class that came to own the means of production during modern industrialization and whose societal concerns are the value of property and the preservation of capital, to ensure the perpetuation of their economic supremacy in society. Joseph Schumpeter saw the creation of new bourgeoisie as the driving force behind the capitalist engine, particularly entrepreneurs who took risks to bring innovation to industries and the economy through the process of creative destruction. The Modern French word \\"bourgeois\\" derived from the Old French \\"burgeis\\" (walled city), which derived from \\"bourg\\" (market town), from the Old Frankish \\"burg\\" (town); in other European languages, the etymologic derivations are the Middle English \\"burgeis\\", the Middle Dutch \\"burgher\\", the German \\"Bürger\\", the Modern English \\"burgess\\", and the Polish \\"burżuazja\\", which occasionally is synonymous with the intelligentsia. 1.

Please answer the following question: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which country would have lower labor supply in response to their taxation?  Hint: The Laffer curve depicts the amount of government revenue as a function of the rate of taxation. It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue. A:","output":"Based on the information provided and the hint given, France would have a lower labor supply in response to their taxation. This is because France implemented a tax rate above the critical rate, which according to the Laffer curve, would result in a decline in labor supply as higher tax rates discourage work and investment.

Grey island contributed way more because they were more careless.  Which island burned less fossil fuels?  Hint: Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who criticized Putin for supporting the reintroduction of the Soviet-era national anthem?  The \\"State Anthem of the Russian Federation\\" (Russian: Госуда́рственный гимн Росси́йской Федера́ции, tr. Gosudarstvennyj gimn Rossijskoj Federacii, IPA: [ɡəsʊˈdarstvʲɪnɨj ˈɡʲimn rɐˈsʲijskəj fʲɪdʲɪˈratsɨj])  is the name of the official national anthem of Russia. It uses the same music as the \\"State Anthem of the Soviet Union\\", composed by Alexander Alexandrov, and new lyrics by Sergey Mikhalkov, who had collaborated with Gabriel El-Registan on the original anthem.  From 1944, that earliest version replaced \\"The Internationale\\", as a new, more Soviet-centric, and Russia-centric Soviet anthem.  The same melody, but without lyrics mentioning dead Stalin by name, was used after 1956. A second version of the lyrics was written by Mikhalkov in 1970 and adopted in 1977, placing less emphasis on World War II and more on the victory of communism. The Russian SFSR was the only constituent republic of the Soviet Union without its own regional anthem. The lyric-free \\"Patrioticheskaya Pesnya\\", composed by Mikhail Glinka, was officially adopted in 1990 by the Supreme Soviet of Russia and confirmed in 1993, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, by the President of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin. This anthem proved to be unpopular with the Russian public and with many politicians and public figures, because of its tune and lack of lyrics, and consequently its inability to inspire Russian athletes during international competitions. The government sponsored contests to create lyrics for the unpopular anthem, but none of the entries were adopted. Glinka's anthem was replaced soon after Yeltsin's successor as President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, first took office on 7 May 2000. The federal legislature established and approved the music of the National Anthem of the Soviet Union, with newly written lyrics, in December 2000, and it became the second anthem used by Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

During his childhood, he lived and studied in the city of Vitebsk, now part of Belarus, and later spent 10 years in Smolensk living with his grandparents and attending the Smolensk Grammar School, spending summer vacations in Vitebsk. Always expressing an interest and talent in drawing, he started to receive instruction at 13 from Yehuda Pen, a local Jewish artist, and by the time he was 15 was teaching students himself. In 1909, he applied to an art academy in Saint Petersburg, but was rejected. While he passed the entrance exam and was qualified, the law under the Tsarist regime only allowed a limited number of Jewish students to attend Russian schools and universities. Like many other Jews then living in the Russian Empire, Lissitzky went to study in Germany. He left in 1909 to study architectural engineering at a Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany.

However, with the right strategies, mindset, and a bit of luck, it is possible to turn a profit. Below, we will discuss some of the ways you can increase your chances of making money at online casinos, using roulette as a primary example. 1. Understand the Game: Before diving into the world of online casinos, take the time to learn the ins and outs of the games you wish to play. In the case of roulette, familiarize yourself with the bets, payout odds, and house edge. Knowing these details will help you develop your own strategies and increase your chances of success. 2. Choose a Reputable Casino: Before placing your bets, ensure that you are playing on a trustworthy and secure online casino platform. Check for certifications, read reviews, and compare different websites to find a casino that best fits your needs. A reputable casino ensures that your personal and financial information is guarded and that payouts are received promptly. 3. Manage Your Bankroll: Before you begin playing any casino game, set a loss limit that you are comfortable with. Stick to this budget and never allow yourself to go over it. Gamble responsibly, and don't think of the money as a ticket to instant riches. Instead, look at gambling as a form of entertainment with the potential of bringing some extra income. 4. Hunt for Bonuses and Promotions: Many online casinos offer bonuses and promotions to attract players. Take advantage of these offers to boost your bankroll and increase your chances of making money in the long run. Search for casinos that offer deposit bonuses, free spins, no-deposit bonuses, or cashback deals as a part of their promotional package. 5. Practice and Develop a Strategy: While roulette is mostly a game of luck, developing a strategy can help maximize your chances of winning. Some players use betting systems like the Martingale, Labouchere, or D'Alembert systems to manage their bets. Implement a disciplined approach, and always remember that there are no foolproof strategies - they merely try to minimize losses and optimize winnings. 6. Betting Wisely: Don't get caught up in high-risk bets with low probability outcomes. In roulette, stick to even-money bets like red/black or odd/even if you want to have a better chance at making money. Avoid the temptation of making large, impulsive bets, as those will likely lead to significant losses in the long run. 7. Keep Your Emotions in Check: Winning and losing streaks can and will happen in online gambling. Staying emotionally neutral while playing will help you continue to make informed decisions and avoid rash decision-making. 8. Know When to Walk Away: Sometimes the best way to make money is to walk away from the table when you're ahead. Don't let the thrill of winning cloud your judgment and make you lose everything you've gained. Set a profit target and once reached, cash out and enjoy your earnings. 9. Diversify Your Casino Games: While roulette can be a great way to make money at online casinos, it’s wise to explore other popular casino games as well, such as blackjack, poker, or slots. Each game has its own strategies, payout rates, and odds. Diversifying your gaming experience increases your overall knowledge, and this can lead to better results in the long run. By following the above tips and maintaining a disciplined approach, you can increase your chances of making money at online casinos. Remember, always gamble responsibly, and enjoy the thrill of the game as you work towards your financial goals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

News article: Walter Keane was an American artist who became famous in the 1950s and 1960s for painting a series of widely-reproduced images depicting vulnerable children with enormous eyes. His story begins in Berlin in 1946, as a young American Walter was in Europe to learn how to be a painter. It was there that the would-be artist found himself staring quite heartbroken at the big-eyed homeless children fighting over scraps of food in the street. Keane would later write: “As if goaded by a kind of frantic despair, I sketched these dirty, ragged little victims of the war with their bruised, lacerated minds and bodies, their matted hair and runny noses. Here my life as a painter began in earnest\\".      By the early 1960s, the artist's prints and postcards were selling in the many millions; with the great and the good, including Natalie Wood, Joan Crawford, Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis and Kim Novak buying up the originals. Keane had become an art sensation; the student had become a renowned artist and fulfilled his dream - and with money and fame came power, and a hedonistic life-style to suit a film star.      According to the artist's biographers, Adam Parfrey and Cletus Nelson, Keane was not a reflection of his 'innocent' work but a drinker and a lover, of some note - even if this was in fact stated by the artist himself. Keane describes to them in his own words his first meeting with Margaret, the woman who would become the artist's wife. The words are from Keane's 1983 memoir, The World of Keane: “I love your paintings,” she told me. “You are the greatest artist I have ever seen. You are also the most handsome. The children in your paintings are so sad. It hurts my eyes to see them. Your perspective and the sadness you portray in the faces of the children make me want to touch them.” - “No,” I said. “Never touch any of my paintings.”      This is a conversation that apparently took place between the two at an art exhibition in San Francisco in 1955. Walter was still an unknown artist at the time, and would not become an art world sensation for another couple of years. Later that night, his memoir continues, Margaret told him: “You are the greatest lover in the world.” They were married that same year.      Yet many years later Walter Keane was accused of lying by his wife; the perpetration in question was that the famous artist's paintings were in fact her own. In the subsequent slander suit Margaret challenged Keane to a \\"paint off\\", but he declined citing a sore shoulder. Margaret then painted a work of wide-eyed sentimentality before the jurors in a mere 53 minutes and the suit was settled in her favour for £2.5 million.      Yet Margaret never saw a penny of the money; and in the media the case remained disputed. By then the couple were divorced; and a narcissistic Walter had lost his charm inside a bottle; drinking away every cent that was owed to his ex-wife.      The truth of their marriage in fact hid the fraudulent reality of Walter Keane. The couple were happily married for the first two years until Margaret discovered that Walter was selling her paintings as his own; stating that they needed the money, and that people were more likely to buy a painting if they thought they were talking to the artist. According to Walter; people didn't want to think that he couldn't paint - and needed to have his wife do it for him. People already thought Walter painted the big eyes and if they suddenly saw it was his wife creating them, the Keane's would be sued.      The fraudulent artist offered Margaret a solution: she would teach him how to paint the big eyes, and their problem would be solved. But this was impossible - Walter had no skills as a painter - and blamed his inability to learn on the apparent inadequacies of his wife.      So began a ten year period that saw Margaret under house arrest in now luxurious surroundings, paid for by her art - as she painted behind locked doors. The true artist never saw the money - as the bank account was controlled by Walter - who ensured the servants never found out the truth - as he cavorted through his life of debauchery.      But in the end Walter died in 2000. Having eventually given up drinking yet still missing those heady days of wealth and stolen fame, writing in his memoir that sobriety was his “new awakening, away from the drinking world of exciting sexy beautiful women, parties and art buyers”. By the 1970s, the big eyes had fallen out of fashion with a shuddering thud. Even Woody Allen mocked them in his sci-fi comedy 'Sleeper', imagining a terrifying future where they were still revered.      Margaret Keane - the real artist behind the work - became a Jehovah’s Witness. She moved to Hawaii where she started painting big-eyed children swimming with tropical fish in azure seas. Yet in the Hawaii paintings a change began to occur to the sad, and trapped big-eyed children of the famous works - the viewer could see slight, cautious smiles begin to form on the faces depicted. They were free -as was the artist.      Now many years after the works fell from favour, new light is being shed on the paintings, and the fascinating story behind them - as one of the biggest art frauds in history - a biopic, 'Big Eyes', is about to be released, starring Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz, after the story peaked the fascination of acclaimed director Tim Burton.      So if you look closely enough during one of its many scenes you might see a now elderly Margaret, sitting on a park bench, in a cameo appearance in Tim Burton's new film - she may even have big eyes, and - a slight smile on her face. ||||| There’s a sweet, small suburban house in the vineyards of Napa, northern California. Inside, a family of devout Jehovah’s Witnesses bustles around, offering me a cheese plate. A Siamese cat weaves in and out of my legs. Everything is lovely. Sitting unobtrusively in the corner is 87-year-old Margaret Keane. “Would you like some macadamia nuts?” she asks. She hands me Jehovah’s Witness pamphlets too. “Jehovah looks after me every day,” she says. “I really feel it.” She is the last person you’d expect to be a participant in one of the great art frauds of the 20th century.      This story begins in Berlin in 1946. A young American named Walter Keane was in Europe to learn how to be a painter. And there he was, staring heartbroken at the big-eyed children fighting over scraps of food in the rubbish. As he would later write: “As if goaded by a kind of frantic despair, I sketched these dirty, ragged little victims of the war with their bruised, lacerated minds and bodies, their matted hair and runny noses. Here my life as a painter began in earnest.”      Fifteen years later and Keane was an art sensation. The American suburb had just been invented and millions of people suddenly had a lot of wall space to fill. Some of them – those who wanted their homes to express upbeat whimsy – opted for paintings of dogs playing pool or dogs playing poker. But a great number of others, who wanted something more melancholic, went for Walter’s sad, big-eyed children. Some of the children held sad, big-eyed poodles in their arms. Others sat lonely in fields of flowers. They were dressed as harlequins and ballerinas. They just seemed so innocent and searching.      Walter himself was not a melancholic man. According to his biographers, Adam Parfrey and Cletus Nelson, he was a drinker and a lover – of women and of himself. This, for instance, is how he describes his first meeting with Margaret, the woman now sitting opposite me in Napa. It’s from his 1983 memoir, The World of Keane: “I love your paintings,” she told me. “You are the greatest artist I have ever seen. You are also the most handsome. The children in your paintings are so sad. It hurts my eyes to see them. Your perspective and the sadness you portray in the faces of the children make me want to touch them.”      “No,” I said. “Never touch any of my paintings.”      Walter and Margaret Keane work side by side in 1961. Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis      This conversation apparently took place at an outdoor art exhibition in San Francisco in 1955. Walter was still an unknown artist. He wouldn’t become a phenomenon for another few years. Later that night, his memoir continues, Margaret told him: “You are the greatest lover in the world.” They married.      Margaret’s memory of their first meeting is quite different.      The centre of Walter’s universe in the mid-1950s was a San Francisco beatnik club, The Hungry i. While comedians such as Lenny Bruce and Bill Cosby performed onstage, out at the front, Walter sold his big-eyed-children paintings. One night Margaret decided to go to the club with him.      “He had me sitting in a corner,” she tells me, “and he was over there, talking, selling paintings, when somebody walked over to me and said: ‘Do you paint too?’ And I suddenly thought – just horrible shock – ‘Is he taking credit for my paintings?’”      He was. He had been telling his patrons a giant lie. Margaret was the painter of the big eyes – every one of them. Walter might well have seen sad children in postwar Berlin, but he hadn’t painted them, because he couldn’t paint to save his life.      Margaret was furious. Back home she confronted him. She told him to stop. But something unexpected happened instead. During the decade that followed, Margaret would nod in respectful admiration as Walter told interviewers that he was the best painter of eyes since El Greco. She said nothing. Why did she go along with it? What was happening inside the Keane marriage?      Margaret takes me back to the beginning. It’s true that he charmed her at that art exhibition in 1955, she says. “He was just oozing with charm. He could charm anyone.” But the rest of the conversation didn’t happen. How could it have?      Their first two years were happy, but all that changed the night of the Hungry i. “Back home he tried to explain it away,” she says. “He said: ‘We need the money. People are more likely to buy a painting if they think they’re talking to the artist. People don’t want to think I can’t paint and need to have my wife paint. People already think I painted the big eyes and if I suddenly say it was you, it’ll be confusing and people will start suing us.’ He was telling me all these horrible problems.”      Walter offered Margaret a solution: “Teach me how to paint the big-eyed children.” So she tried. “And when he couldn’t do it, it was my fault. ‘You’re not teaching me right. I could do it if you had more patience.’ I was really trying, but it was just impossible.”      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Margaret and Walter pose with a selection of paintings in 1965. Photograph: Bill Ray/The LIFE Picture Collection/Gett      Margaret felt trapped. She wanted to leave, but she didn’t know how. How would she support herself and her daughter? “So finally I went along with it,” she says. “And it was just tearing me apart.”      By the early 1960s, Keane prints and postcards were selling in the millions. You couldn’t walk into a Woolworths without seeing racks of them. Luminaries including Natalie Wood, Joan Crawford, Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis and Kim Novak were buying the originals.      “Did you see any of the money?” I ask Margaret.      “No,” she says. “I just painted. But we moved to a nice house. There was a swimming pool. Gated. Servants. So I didn’t need to do anything except paint.” She smiles, ruefully. Outside in the sun, Walter was living the high life. “There was always three or four people swimming nude in the pool,” he wrote in his memoir. “Everybody was screwing everybody. Sometimes I’d be going to bed and there’d be three girls in the bed.” The Beach Boys would visit, and Maurice Chevalier, and Howard Keel. But Margaret rarely saw them, because she was painting 16 hours a day.      “Did the servants know what was going on?”      “No, the door was always locked,” she says. “The curtains closed.”      “You spent all those years with the curtains closed?”      “When he wasn’t home he’d usually call every hour to make sure I hadn’t gone out,” she says. “I was in jail.”      “Did you know about the affairs?”      She shrugged. “I didn’t care what he did by then.”      “It must have been lonely.”      “Yes, because he wouldn’t allow me to have any friends. If I tried to slip away from him, he’d follow me. We had a chihuahua and because I loved that little dog so much, he kicked it, and so finally I had to give the dog away. He was very jealous and domineering. And all along he said: ‘If you ever tell anyone I’m going to have you knocked off.’ I knew he knew a lot of mafia people. He really scared me. He tried to hit me once. But I said, ‘Where I come from men don’t hit women. If you ever do that again I’ll leave.’” She pauses. “But I let him do everything else, which was even worse probably.”      “Would he come home from his partying and demand you show him what you’d painted?” I ask.      “He was always pressuring me to do more,” she says. “‘Do one with a clown costume.’ Or: ‘Do two children on a rocking horse.’ One day he had this idea that I’d do this huge painting, his masterwork, to hang in the United Nations or somewhere. I had a month to do that.”      The “masterwork” was called Tomorrow Forever. It depicted a hundred sad-looking, big-eyed children of all creeds standing in a line that stretches to the horizon. The organisers of the 1964 World’s Fair hung it in their Pavilion of Education. Walter felt deeply proud of the achievement. He wrote in his memoir that his dead grandmother told him in a vision that “Michelangelo has put your name up for nomination as a member of our inner circle saying that your masterwork Tomorrow Forever will live in the hearts and minds of men as has his work on the Sistine chapel.”      The art critic John Canaday reviewed Tomorrow Forever for the New York Times: “This tasteless hack work contains about 100 children and hence it is about 100 times as bad as the average Keane.” Stung by the review, the World’s Fair took down the painting.      “Walter was furious,” Margaret says. “I felt hurt that they didn’t want it and were saying nasty things. When people said it was just sentimental stuff it really hurt my feelings. Some people couldn’t stand to even look at them. I don’t know why - just a violent reaction. But so many people really love them. Little children love them. Even babies. So eventually I thought: ‘I don’t care. I’m just going to paint what I want to paint.’”      If you’d asked Margaret back then about her inspiration – which you never would have, of course – she would have shrugged and said she didn’t know. The paintings just flowed out of her. But now, she says, she thinks she understands: “Those sad children were really my own deep feelings that I couldn’t express in any other way. Their eyes were searching. Asking why. Why is there so much sadness? Why do we have to get sick and die? Why do people shoot each other?”      “Why is my husband so crazy?” I suggest. “Why did I get into this mess?” Margaret nods.      After 10 years of marriage, eight of them horrific, they divorced. Margaret promised Walter that she’d keep on secretly painting for him. And she did for a while. But after she’d delivered maybe 20 or 30 big eyes to him, she suddenly thought: “No more lies. From now on, I will only ever tell the truth.”      Which is why, in October 1970, Margaret told a reporter from the UPI everything. “He wanted to learn to paint,” she revealed, “and I tried to teach him to paint when he was home, which wasn’t often. He couldn’t even learn to paint.”      And so on. Walter went on the offensive, swearing that the big eyes were his and calling Margaret a “boozing, sex-starved psychopath” who he once discovered having sex with several parking-lot attendants.      “He was really nuts,” Margaret says. “I couldn’t believe he had so much hate for me.”      Margaret became a Jehovah’s Witness. She moved to Hawaii and started painting big-eyed children swimming in azure seas with tropical fish. In these Hawaii paintings you can see small, cautious smiles begin to form on the faces of the children. Walter’s life wasn’t so happy. He moved to a fisherman’s shack in La Jolla, California, and began to drink from morning until night. He told the few reporters still interested in him that Margaret was in league with the Jehovah’s Witnesses to defraud him. One reporter, from USA Today, believed every word, and they ran a story on Walter’s plight: “Thinking he was dead [Margaret] claimed to have done some of the Keane paintings. The claim, vehemently denied by a very much alive Keane, is in litigation.”      Margaret sued Walter. The judge challenged them both to paint a child with big eyes, right there in court, in front of everyone. Margaret painted hers in 53 minutes. Walter said he couldn’t because he had a sore shoulder.      “And there it is,” she tells me. She points to a framed portrait on the wall of a little girl with absolutely huge eyes, peering out nervously from behind a fence. “I painted it in Honolulu federal court. It has the exhibit number on the back.”      In fact the walls of Margaret’s home are filled with big-eye paintings – children, poodles, kittens. There’s barely an inch of empty wall space.      “That painting is symbolic of her triumph over the lies,” Margaret’s son-in-law tells me as he walks past us towards the kitchen.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Amy Adam plays Margaret Keane in Tim Burton’s film Big Eyes. Photograph: The Weinstein Company/Allstar/Allstar/The Weinstein Company      Margaret won the court case, of course. She was awarded 4m, but she never saw a penny of it because Walter had drunk his fortune away. A court psychologist diagnosed him with a rare mental condition called delusional disorder. I ask Margaret if she knows anything about delusional disorder. She shakes her head and says she can’t even remember Walter being diagnosed with it.      “It’s when a person who is otherwise completely normal has a particular delusion they’re absolutely convinced of,” I say. “Quite often it’s a jealous husband convinced his wife is cheating on him. Sometimes the person is convinced that some impostor is taking credit for their genius.”      “I didn’t know that,” Margaret says.      “If you have the disorder it means you truly believe it,” I say.      Margaret thinks. “For a long time I felt very guilty about it,” she says.      “Why guilty?” I ask.      “If I hadn’t allowed him to take credit for the paintings, he wouldn’t have got as sick as he got.”      Walter died in 2000. He gave up drinking towards the end, but you get the sense that he missed those days, writing in his memoir that sobriety was his “new awakening, away from the drinking world of exciting sexy beautiful women, parties and art buyers”. By the 1970s, the big eyes had fallen from favour. Woody Allen mocked them in Sleeper, imagining a ridiculous future where they were revered.      But now, suddenly, there is a kind of renaissance. A Tim Burton biopic, Big Eyes, is about to be released, starring Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz. Margaret has a cameo: “I’m a little old lady sitting on a park bench.”      “Was the film distressing to watch?” I ask her.      “It was really traumatic,” she says. “I really think I was in shock for a couple of days. Christoph Waltz – he looks like Walter, sounds like him, acts like him. And to see Amy going through what I went through … It’s very accurate. Then it started to dawn on me how fantastic the movie is.”      Margaret smiles, looking thrilled, and I realise that sometimes a wrong is so great it needs something as dramatic as a major biopic in which you’re the hero to heal the wounds.      • Big Eyes will be released in the UK on 26 December. ||||| In San Francisco in the 1950s, Margaret was a woman trying to make it on her own after leaving her husband with only her daughter and her paintings. She meets gregarious ladies' man and fellow painter Walter Keane in a park while she was struggling to make an impact with her drawings of children with big eyes. The two quickly become a pair with outgoing Walter selling their paintings and quiet Margaret holed up at home painting even more children with big eyes. But Walter's actually selling her paintings as his own. A clash of financial success and critical failure soon sends Margaret reeling in her life of lies. With Walter still living the high life, Margaret's going to have to try making it on her own again and re-claiming her name and her paintings.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the names of the two archipelagos of India? ?  India's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains. According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.

Here are the definitions of logical operators for understanding of command:   1. count: returns the number of rows in the view.   2. only: returns whether there is exactly one row in the view.   3. hop: returns the value under the header column of the row.   4. and: returns the boolean operation result of two arguments.   5. max/min/avg/sum: returns the max/min/average/sum of the values under the header column.   6. nth_max/nth_min: returns the n-th max/n-th min of the values under the header column.   7. argmax/argmin: returns the row with the max/min value in header column.   8. nth_argmax/nth_argmin: returns the row with the n-th max/min value in header column.   9. eq/not_eq: returns if the two arguments are equal.   10. round_eq: returns if the two arguments are roughly equal under certain tolerance.   11. greater/less: returns if the first argument is greater/less than the second argument.   12. diff: returns the difference between two arguments.   13. filter_eq/ filter_not_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is equal/not equal to the third argument.   14. filter_greater/filter_less: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less than the third argument.   15. filter_greater_eq /filter_less_eq: returns the subview whose values under the header column is greater/less or equal than the third argument.   16. filter_all: returns the view itself for the case of describing the whole table   17. all_eq/not_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument.   18. all_greater/less: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument.   19. all_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether all the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument.   20. most_eq/not_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are equal/not equal to the third argument.   21. most_greater/less: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less than the third argument.   22. most_greater_eq/less_eq: returns whether most of the values under the header column are greater/less or equal to the third argument. Q: and { only { filter_eq { filter_eq { all_rows ; state ; jammu & kashmir } ; total capacity ( mw ) ; 44 } } ; eq { hop { filter_eq { filter_eq { all_rows ; state ; jammu & kashmir } ; total capacity ( mw ) ; 44 } ; power plant } ; chutak } } A:","output":"unique The given command is using filter_eq on 'state' and 'total capacity (mw)' columns to narrow down the table rows to a subset having rows with 'jammu & kashmir' state and '44' total capacity (mw). Then, it checks if there is only one row in this subset (using the only function) and confirms that the 'power plant' is 'chutak'. This command describes a unique row, with the scope of this subset of rows. Therefore, the answer is 'unique'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The biggest thing you'll see, of course, is the moon. For thousands of years, people have wondered about this big thing in the sky. Earth's moon is a satellite. A satellite is a body that orbits a planet. All moons are satellites, and many planets have them. Some have many moons. Earth, of course, only has one. It's a special moon, though. It's the fifth largest moon in the solar system! In fact, the moon is much smaller than the sun. But it's much closer to Earth, so it looks as big as the sun. The moon is so close that you can see its dark and light spots without a telescope. Men flew and landed on the moon's surface many times by spacecrafts in the 1960s and 1970s. Neil Armstrong was the first human to step on the moon. He walked on the moon on July 20th, 1969. The flights to the moon have helped us learn much about it. Astronauts even brought rocks home with them! There's still a lot to learn about the moon. Now people still can't live on the moon because it does not have oxygen or water like the Earth. But I'm sure that humans can live there one day in the future. ,. Question: How many moons does the Earth have? Yes or no, is the answer \\"One.\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"One.\\" Earth has one moon, which is a natural satellite that orbits our planet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.
