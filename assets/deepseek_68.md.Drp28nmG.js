Coming to your question, it won't be as pleasant as you have documented above if 1 USD becomes equal to 1 INR. If the currency of a country is cheap relatively then its exports become more competitive in international market. For example, currently a shoe manufactured in India might seem cheap to a person in US as compared to a shoe manufactured in his home country. But if our currency appreciates so much then that same shoe won't be cheap any more and hence Indian goods will loose their competitive advantage.

Exiled from his native Epirus he fought in the Wars of the Diadochi, was captured by king Ptolemy but won the eye of the king, who supported his return to Epirus. Pinned to the wall, fighting for his life against his former master Demetrius, Pyrrhus won a battle by personally dueling and killing the enemy general. He then joined the alliance of Hellenistic kings against Demetrius and invaded and conquered Macedonia itself. Things went south: his ally Lysinachus turned against him and defeated him Pyrrhus was insatiable though; he promptly turned to Italy to save the Greek cities from Rome….And take then for his own. Like Hannibal himself he won battle after battle but couldn't overcome the superior numbers of Rome. Eventually one devastating defeat forced him to retreat He then tried to do the same in Sicily against Carthage: he was so successful the Sicilians and Carthaginians joined forces to defeat him. He returned to Greece and conquered Macedonia again, only stopped by a Spartan alliance with Macedon. His last battle was in Argos which he attacked as a fighting retreat.

We gave them planes, tanks, ships, intelligence support, supplies, convoys of material and other equipment. They did not fight beside us and the other Allies, why did this happen?","output":"We did not appease the USSR. There were two reasons why we assisted the USSR. (1) We correctly saw Nazi Germany as a serious threat, while the USSR was not a threat. (2) From 1941 on, most of the German army was committed to the Eastern Front. The Red Army eviscerated the the Wehrmacht, inflicting about 80% of Germany’s losses. The scope of the Russo-German war dwarfed the war in Western Europe and the Mediterranean both in numbers involved and the land area covered. The USSR suffered 24–26 million dead, about 13–14% of the total population, with military losses of about 9 to 12 million. The U.S. had 416,800 military deaths (418,500 total deaths—less than one percent of the population) meaning about 24 Red Army soldiers died for each American. A Red Army soldier might well have said they didn’t fight beside the U.S. and British, they fought instead of them. Neither the U.S. or the Soviet Union fought the war for altruistic reasons—both did their best to avoid war until they were attacked. The only major allied combatants that chose to go to war with Germany were Great Britain and France, who declared war in 1939 to meet their commitment to assist Poland if Germany attacked the latter. In addition, geography and population determined the size of the Eastern Front. More German soldiers were deployed there because the area involved was much larger than Western Europe. In 1941, the Germans conquered an area several times the size of France, but still didn’t take Moscow or destroy the Red Army."},{"instruction":"f the Von Karman line is 62 miles above, then the center of the Earth should be at minimum 62 miles below, right?","output":"the radius of the earth is far far greater than 62 miles it has little directly to do with the karman line though which is a bit vaguely defined anyways, more of a blurry boundary"},{"instruction":"What is the best way to get discounts on hotel rooms?","output":"In less than a minute, Cheap hotels will check prices according to your preferences for 70 agencies and official booking sites.

We need 2 Fe on the left, so let’s fix that [math]2FeS + O_2 to Fe_2O_3 + SO_2[/math] Now we have 2S left but one on the right. Fix please [math]2FeS + O_2 to Fe_2O_3 + 2SO_2[/math] But now we have 2 O’s left and seven on the right. We can multiply with 3.5 on the left. If you think in moles that is fine. (In individual molecules not so much, then you just do 7 on the left and 2 for the other three compounds, but we don’t need that here.) [math]2FeS + 3.5 O_2 to Fe_2O_3 + 2SO_2[/math] Now you can just look at the ratios: [math]2 : 3.5 :: 1 : 2[/math] Ratios are wonderful.

So you will first have to make moles out of that. For oxygen that would become 71.5 / 32 [g / g/mol] = 71.5/32 [mole] So we could now easily multiply everything by that number and find that way that we could produce 71.5/(32*3.5) moles of iron oxide. But wait, we do need twice as many moles (2*71.5)/(32*3.5) of FeS for that! Do we have that? Otherwise we would have to do the same trick for FeS rather than O2.

When stars stop converting hydrogen into helium, they begin to produce heavier fused elements and expand and eventually go nova. A long-standing theory concluded that stars, four to eight times more massive than the sun, that go supernova became the progenitors of the heavy elements. This was modified recently. The aftermath of a supernova event produces a neutron star. Neutron stars are very dense and compacted into a small body roughly 20km in diameter. It is the collision of these neutron stars that astrophysicists believe produce the heavy elements, one of which is gold. As the atomic weights of the elements increase, so does their scarcity. The ejected gases and particles coalesce with nebular gases to form a new star. The ensuing accretion disc includes hydrogen, helium, and heavier elements that form a solar system.

[LINKED_TEXT: Lead Generation] [URL: https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/beginner-inbound-lead-generation-guide-ht] is the process where a potential customer is asked to fill in contact details to get more information about a product. It gives companies direct access to potential customers so that they can persuade them to buy what they are offering. It is the bridge between marketing and sales. Below are some of the largest lead generation niches out there, along with examples of each: 1. Insurance Insurance is probably the largest lead generation vertical. The products (e.g., an auto insurance policy) are largely commoditized, there are a number of interested buyers of leads, and there is minimal qualification that is required since just about everyone online is able to purchase insurance. Here’s a screenshot of [LINKED_TEXT: Insurance Quotes and Comparison - Car, Life, Home & Health] [URL: http://insurance.com/], one of thousands of insurance lead generation sites out there. It’s a pretty straightforward lead gen operation, with a basic sign-up widget and a clear call-to-action. The site also contains a blog and a database of useful information to make it more visible to search engine traffic: 2. Home Services / Remodeling A robust lead gen market has developed for more local service providers as well. This category is quite broad, but generally includes any professional who would be hired to do work within a home. While many people will ask friends for recommendations, there is a lot of search traffic for home services as well. Many of these sites also offer some sort of rating or review system as well in order to provide value to visitors and add some depth to their site. Here’s an example from [LINKED_TEXT: HomeAdvisor.com | Get Matched to Top-Rated Remodelers, Plumbers and More] [URL: http://homeadvisor.com/]that comes up in a search for “flooring repair Chicago”: 3. Legal The right leads can be worth a significant amount of money to lawyers; they can translate into hefty legal bills or even a percentage of any awarded damages in some cases. Legal lead gen spans a number of niches, from divorce and family law to medical malpractice. Below is an example of a DUI lead gen site, [LINKED_TEXT: The Law Office of Dennis F. Dwyer] [URL: http://duirespond.com/]. It’s a classic lead gen “gauntlet,” asking gradually for detailed information about a specific case that allows the site to match inputs with a relevant lawyer. After this page, you’ll be prompted for answers to additional questions, including: Previous convictionsWhether or not you already have a lawyerDesire to fight license suspensionAbility to pay for a lawyer Obviously, the answers to all of these will help to determine the attractiveness of the lead. Someone with no previous convictions, no desire to fight the suspension, and no ability to pay for a lawyer isn’t all that interesting to a lawyer. Conversely, someone charged with DUI who wants to fight a suspension, does not yet have a lawyer, and can pay for a lawyer with their personal savings could be a dream client for a DUI lawyer. 4. Education As the online education industry has grown in recent years, so too has the lead gen business in this vertical. Online universities compete for potential new students, and there are a number of institutions who are willing to pay for contact information of individuals who have expressed an interest in pursuing an education online. Because this product is primarily delivered online, it should be no surprise that many potential students search for information about potential programs online. And although online colleges and universities are generally much cheaper than traditional institutions, a new enrolled student is still very valuable. With [LINKED_TEXT: hundreds of online colleges now operating] [URL: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_online_colleges_in_the_United_States], there is no shortage of buyers for qualified leads. Below is an example of a site that comes up in a search for “online nursing programs”. 5. Credit Cards The credit card lead gen vertical is in many ways similar to the insurance vertical. The products, while numerous, are basically commoditized in that many companies offer similar cards. Moreover, the qualification hurdles are pretty low; a significant portion of the online demographic can qualify for some form of credit card. Unlike insurance, there is minimal upfront cost to the consumer, which means that every lead could relatively easily become a client. And a new client is relatively valuable to the credit card company, especially if they are able to gradually work them up to more expensive products. Credit card lead gen sites may be more appropriately classified under the affiliate marketing vertical, in the sense that they link out to third party sites where the application is actually completed. If a referred visitor completes an application and is approved, then the referring domain earns its lead gen fee. But we still consider this to be a lead gen vertical, in part because from the perspective of the credit card company a completed application is still just a “lead” that is yet to generate any revenue for them. ([LINKED_TEXT: Here’s a good read] [URL: http://www.dmconfidential.com/affiliate-marketing-versus-lead-gen/] on the differences between affiliate marketing and lead generation.) Credit card lead gen sites generally add value by ranking or reviewing the countless card options out there. For example, [LINKED_TEXT: Credit Cards | Compare The Best Credit Card Offers | CompareCards.com] [URL: http://comparecards.com/] features cards identified as the “top bad credit credit card” and “top reward credit card.” Here’s that lead gen site in action: 6. Mortgage & Real Estate The mortgage and real estate vertical is another extremely active lead gen opportunity. While many will rely on personal recommendations to find a realtor or mortgage broker, there is also a significant amount of search traffic around this term as well. Moreover, because each new client in this vertical is worth a considerable amount of money to a realtor or mortgage broker, they can afford to pay quite a bit for a well-qualified lead. Mortgage and real estate lead gen also exhibits characteristics of affiliate marketing, in the sense that these sites will generally link out to third party partners for a form to be completed. Again, we consider this to be lead gen because the action in the Cost-per-Action (CPA) pricing model doesn’t generate any revenue for the purchaser of that lead. In fact, a relatively small percentage of visitors who complete a mortgage approval form ever end up acquiring a mortgage through the company that buys that lead. Those that do convert, however, can generate meaningful revenue. Zillow, which is best known as a resource for finding information about real estate, generates revenue through lead generation for mortgage companies. Here’s an example of the interface that appears after entering in some basic information (including ZIP code and credit score): 7. Matchmaking The value add of matchmaking (or, dating) lead generation sites is generally some rating or review database, which should give interested visitors an idea of which sites will give them the best chance of success (though the actual usefulness of this review information is questionable in many cases). Here’s an example: 8. Senior Care / Assisted Living So almost all industries I’d say, from Internet, like digital agencies, web designers, SEO and PPC businesses, software houses, marketplaces, R&D companies, etc. to companies looking for new distribution channels for their products.

Shotgun pros Pump shotguns are fairly cheap (e.g.; Mossberg Maverick 88 can be purchased for around 200 new at Academy Sports)Decreased risk of over-penetration (e.g.; going through several walls and injuring unintended bystanders)Shot \\"spread\\" requires slightly less precision (but be aware, at close distances, the spread is much smaller than if you were shooting skeet) Shotgun cons Semi-automatic shotguns are much more expensive than their pump-action siblings...the \\"cheap\\" ones start at around 500Reduced ammo capacity compared to a handgunEven short-barreled shotguns make it much harder to clear a house than with a handgun. For me personally, the cons outweigh the pros for shotguns, so I've personally opted to use a handgun (as I assume you have, since that's how you've phrased your question). The best caliber for home defense is going to be the one that you can shoot consistently accurately, and feel comfortable while doing so. The best handgun model for you is going to be chosen in pretty much the same way. It's different for everyone, and I strongly recommend against buying any firearm from a store if you haven't tried out the same model at the range. But if you want some quick personal recommendations, I'll give a short list below, categorized by MSRP, and indicating caliber and magazine capacity). This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it's a good place to start. 300-400: S&W SD9VE (9mm, 16 rounds), Taurus PT809 (9mm, 18 rounds) 400-600: Glock 17 (9mm, 17 rounds), SIG-Sauer 2022 Pro (9mm, 10 rounds), S&W M&P 9mm (9mm, 17 rounds) 600-800: Beretta 92A1 (9mm, 17 rounds), SIG-Sauer P226 (9mm, 15 rounds)."},{"instruction":"Why was Michael Jordan not drafted #1 overall when he was clearly the best college player at the time? Who's to blame?","output":"He wasn’t clearly the best college player in that draft. That would have been Hakeem Olajuwon, who went #1. In his final year with the Houston Cougars, Olajuwon averaged a stunning 16.8 ppg, 13.5 rpg, and 5.6 bpg (!!) on 67.5% shooting from the field. Even though Mike turned out to have a better NBA career, most still don’t fault the Rockets for this pick as Olajuwon was just so damn good. In fact, I think that this is just another example to show just how good Hakeem was in the NBA. He was picked over the GOAT, Michael Jordan, and no one faulted the Rockets for it. If you don’t have him top-10 all-time, I think that you should strongly reconsider your list. Now, as for the Blazers picking Sam Bowie over Jordan, that was an idotic decision if I’ve ever seen one. Everyone knew that Mike was the better player, but the Blazers chose Bowie because they already had a dynamic young SG in Clyde Drexler. This is yet another example of NBA GMs commiting a cardinal drafting sin in my eyes. Never draft based on fit in the lottery - always go for the most talent. This is a rule that most people are aware of, but violate anyway. Recently, the Warriors front office drafted James Wiseman over LaMelo Ball with the 2nd pick in the 2020 NBA Draft. As a fan of the franchise, I already knew that we made a bad mistake. Wiseman was a high potential player, but Ball was a proven star. 3 seasons later, LaMelo is one of the young stars of the league and James got traded for salary filler + second-round picks. Anyway, that was just my rant as a frustrated Warriors fan."},{"instruction":"What is served as breakfast in your country?","output":"In the United States, the foods most commonly eaten for breakfast vary greatly depending on the region and culture of the individual.

Question: #What are some reasons dogs get bad breath. Let me share best bad breath tips as below, I hope you enjoy it. 1. Pineapple juice Many people believe that pineapple juice is the quickest and most effective treatment for bad breath. While there is no scientific evidence to back up this theory, anecdotal reports suggest that it works. Drink a glass of organic pineapple juice after every meal, or chew on a pineapple slice for one to two minutes. It’s also important to remember to rinse your mouth of the sugars in fruit and fruit juice afterward. 2. Diet: Avoid onions, garlic, and spicy food. Sugary foods are also linked to bad breath. Reduce coffee and alcohol consumption. Eating a breakfast that includes rough foods can help clean the back of the tongue. 3. Try using baking soda. Brushing your teeth with baking soda once a week will help neutralize the bacteria that cause bad breath. Using your regular toothbrush, simply sprinkle a pinch of baking soda on the bristles, then brush as usual. • Baking soda can also be used as a mouthwash. Dissolve a half-teaspoon of baking soda into a small glass of water. Fill your mouth with the liquid, without swallowing, and swish it around your gums and teeth. • Baking soda neutralizes the acids that build up on the backs of your teeth, and beneath your tongue. 4. Try mouthwash. Mouthwash is another way to deal with the immediate effects of bad breath. This will only provide you with a temporary mask for the bad breath, but that can be enough to avoid offending other people. • However, an antiseptic mouthwash will kill the bad bacteria, so it will help do more than just mask the bad odor. Look for mouthwashes with hlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, chlorine dioxide, zinc chloride and triclosan, as these kill bacteria. • Avoid using a chlorhexidine-containing mouthwash long-term as this can stain your teeth (although this is reversible). • Try not to use mouthwashes containing alcohol. Alcoholic-based mouthwashes may be a factor in developing certain mouth cancers. • Make sure you rinse and deep-gargle with mouthwash.

Yogurt Yogurt contains healthy bacteria called lactobacillus. These healthy bacteria can help combat bad bacteria in various parts of your body, like your gut. Research shows that yogurt may also help reduce bad breath. A study found after six weeks of eating yogurt, 80 percent of participants had a reduction in bad breath. Probiotics in yogurt are effective in reducing the severity of bad breath. To use yogurt to fight bad breath, eat at least one serving per day of plain, nonfat yogurt. 6. Milk Milk is a well-known cure for bad breath. Research shows that drinking milk after eating garlic can significantly improve “garlicky” breath. To use this method, drink a glass of low- or full-fat milk during or after a meal containing strong-smelling foods like garlic and onions. 7. Fennel or anise seeds Since ancient times, fennel and anise seeds have been used to freshen breath. In parts of India, roasted fennel seeds are still used as “mukhwas,” or mouth fresheners, to cleanse after-dinner breath. They taste sweet and contain aromatic essential oils that give the breath a fresh scent. Fennel and anise seeds can be eaten plain, roasted, or coated with sugar. 8. Orange Oranges not only make for a healthy dessert, but they also promote dental hygiene. Many people have bad breath because they don’t produce enough saliva to wash away foul-smelling bacteria. Research shows that vitamin C helps increase saliva production, which can help eliminate bad breath. Oranges are rich in this vitamin. 9. Zinc Zinc salts, an ingredient in certain mouthwashesTrusted Source and chewing gumTrusted Source, can counteract bad breath. Zinc works to decrease the number of sulfurous compounds in your breath. Research has shown that regular rinsing with a solution containing zinc can be effective in reducing bad breath for at least 6 months. Try a zinc chewing gum designed for people with dry mouth. You can also find zinc dietary supplements at your local drug store or purchase them online here. 10. Green tea Green tea is an effective home remedy for bad breath. ResearchTrusted Source shows that green tea has disinfectant and deodorizing properties that can temporarily freshen the breath. Mint has similar effects, so a cup of green mint tea may be an ideal breath freshener. Brew two cups of tea before going to bed and refrigerate it overnight. Pour your cool tea into a water bottle and bring it to work. Slowly sip on it throughout the day. Purchase green mint tea here. 11. Apples One studyTrusted Source found that raw apples have a powerful effect against garlic breath. Certain natural compounds in apples neutralize the foul-smelling compounds in garlic. This is particularly useful for people whose garlic breath lingers, because it neutralizes the compounds in the bloodstream, rather than just deodorizing the mouth. 12. Brush and floss more often. Plaque, the sticky buildup on your teeth, collects bacteria that cause bad breath. Trapped food also adds to the problem. Brush your teeth at least two times each day, and floss at least once. If you're concerned about your breath, do both a little more often. Don't overdo things, though. If you brush too hard you can wear down your teeth, making them vulnerable to decay. 13. Rinse your mouth out. Besides freshening your breath, a mouthwash adds extra protection by getting rid of bacteria. A fresh minty taste can make you feel good. But be sure the mouthwash you choose kills the germs that cause bad breath. Don't just cover up the smell. Rinse daily with a good mouthwash and stop bad breath at its source. You can also help your breath if you swish your mouth with plain water after you eat. It can get rid of food particles that get stuck in your teeth. 14. Scrape your tongue. The coating that normally forms on your tongue can be a host for smelly bacteria. To get rid of them, gently brush your tongue with your toothbrush. If your brush is too big to comfortably reach the back of your tongue, try a scraper. \\"They're designed specifically to apply even pressure across the surface of the tongue area. This removes bacteria, food debris, and dead cells that brushing alone can't take care of,\\" says hygienist Pamela L. Quinones, past president of the American Dental Hygienists' Association. 15. Avoid foods that sour your breath. Onions and garlic are big offenders. But brushing after you eat them doesn't help. The substances that cause their bad smells make their way into your bloodstream and travel to your lungs, where you breathe them out, says dentist Richard Price, DMD, a spokesperson for the American Dental Association. The best way to stop the problem? Don't eat them, or at least avoid them before you go to work or see friends. 16. Kick the tobacco habit. Besides causing cancer, smoking can damage your gums, stain your teeth, and give you bad breath. Over-the-counter nicotine patches can help tame the urge. If you need a little help, make an appointment with your doctor to talk about quit-smoking programs or prescription medications that can help you give up tobacco for good. 17. Skip after-dinner mints and chew gum instead. The bacteria in your mouth love sugar. They use it to make acid. This wears down your teeth and causes bad breath. Chew sugarless gum instead. 18. Keep your gums healthy. Gum disease causes bad breath. Bacteria gather in pockets at the base of teeth, which creates an odor. If you have gum disease, your dentist may suggest you see a periodontist, who specializes in treating it. 19. Try a 30-second mouthwash rinse that is alcohol-free (unike many off-the-shelf products). Mix a cup of water with a teaspoon of baking soda (which changes the pH level and fights odor in the mouth) and a few drops of antimicrobial peppermint essential oil. Don’t swallow it! (Yields several rinses.) 20. Warm Salt Water Rinse A salt water (saline solution) rinse can prevent the buildup of infectious bacteria in the mouth or throat. The effect is probably due to salt water’s slight acidity. This prevents the ‘alkalizing’ environment that encourages the growth of microbes that cause bad breath. Salt water is a great, simple home remedy for bad breath."},{"instruction":"What are some examples of live orchestral performances of classical music gone terribly wrong?","output":"I’m not sure how terrible it was, but I recall when I was an undergraduate, I attended a performance which included Mozart’s 20th piano concerto.

It upsets me still. I have MS and trigeminal neuralgia (TN) and was at home when suddenly I got quite dizzy. I am accustomed to this and have to be careful not to faint so I get down to the ground as soon as possible. Suddenly, it wasn’t just dizziness. It looked like the world was coming to attack me. I know that sounds extreme but my vision was so distorted that it felt like I had drunk a bottle of vodka, been forced on a non-stop carnival ride and something more pervasive that I cannot quite explain. I had been reading something on my IPad and it was unintelligible. I called to my mother and explained what was happening. As time went on, it worsened and I started to grow very scared. I had trouble explaining what was happening and the word finding difficult I get from the anticonvulsants quadrupled. I tried to get up a little and move how I was positioned it see if it would help, the world swayed and my body didn’t respond correctly. I suddenly had to vomit and I never throw up. Because of my medical issues, I am accustomed to my body being difficult but I don’t think I’ve ever been so frightened because I had no idea what was happening. We decided to call an ambulance because there was no way for me to get to the car. My seven-year-old daughter was in the next room and she is so scared right now about my MS because I’ve been in the hospital four times this year. So, I knew I had to say something to her before I left. I scooted on my butt slowly and carefully, trying to pretend I was looking intently at my IPad so she wouldn’t notice that I was physically impaired. I told her I needed to go to the hospital and that I was going to be ok, I just wanted to let her know they needed to look at my blood. She was upset and cried. But, I comforted her (all fifteen heads that I saw) and let her know her dad was coming. And then there was the ambulance and the tests to see if I had a stroke. I was hoping for a brain tumor and said this out loud and I think it was misconstrued. I have trigeminal neuralgia (type 1 and type 2) and have constant pain 24/7. It permeates everything I do. It took me from being an active mom to one that has been basically bedbound. I cannot drive because I do not feel comfortable because of the medications I am taking. So I can no longer take my daughter to ballet or the library or the park or even drop her off at school. Talking triggers my pain and I have had to use sign language, which I learned growing up having a younger sister who is Deaf, with my family when it is really bad. The isolation is difficult. The pain has caused me to think the worst thoughts ever. I’m no stranger to chronic pain. I had endometriosis for 29 years but trigeminal neuralgia is a new animal. It is the worst pain I have ever had and it’s biggest difficulty is it’s endurance. When it is at its worst, it never stops and it’s the kind of pain you would go to the ER for like an acute situation but you can’t because it is daily and it is your life. I said I was hoping for a brain tumor because trigeminal neuralgia has no cure, I am 44 and will have it for the rest of my life. But if my symptoms meant a brain tumor, they posssibly could cut it out and it could go away! Who wishes for a brain tumor? Me and I hope you can see why. When I look back, I think that was a seed planted in the ER docs and nurses that I was being factitious, malingering, a hypnochondriac? But no, I just saw a possible way out of this life sentence of pain and that’s all. Well, no brain tumor, no stroke and no new MS lesions. The doctor said I could go home if I wanted. She gave no explanation. (Here would have been a wonderful chance for her to alleviate my concerns. If she could say I think you might have had a stroke, she could have suggested what had actually happened. But no.) So, I did what I never do. I asked to stay, When my sodium was so low I could have seizures I begged ways out of being sent to the hospital, when my foot dropped I begged to do outpatient IV and when my stomach was enormously bloated I asked to go home to take care of it but my GI insisted and insisted until finally she said, I have a surgeon on call because I am afraid you will rupture and it is life-threatening. So, when I asked to stay I did it out of character and because I wanted to know what was wrong. No one was giving me any answers. As I waited for transport, I begun to get a little less overtaken by the whirling sensation and I really really had to pee. I asked the nurse if I could try to walk with her to the bathroom. I hated being dependent on all these apparatus and my body not functioning correctly. We did it carefully and I was swaying a lot but able to get in early foot in front of the other. The nurse told me to slow down. So I reluctantly did and we plugged slowly along. Then all of a sudden, I got dizzy and I knew I was going to faint. My mom was next to me and could see it in my face and yelled something like she’s about to pass out. The nurse kept holding me up and I was thinking get me down, get me down I’m going to faint. I ended up passing out briefly and came to feeling my arms shaking. This has happened once before. It was late at night. I had to go to the bathroom. I fainted. I passed out so hard that my head went through the wall. Well not entirely though the wall. I will be precise. My head went far enough in that it left a fairly large and deep indentation and we had to fix it. I still had to pee and my head hurt, but at that time I had no idea what I had done to the poor wall. My mom heard it and came running. She helped me up to the bathroom and I began to faint again. Because she was still holding me up, it looked to her like I was having a seizure. She was terrified. Later, a doctor explained to me that will happen if you are fainting and still being held up and you need to make sure you get to the ground. But, back to the ER. I could hear people around me yelling get a cart. There were like twenty people running towards me except I could see the one nurse who had kept sticking my IV in where there was a nerve and wouldn’t stop. He wasn’t moving at all. Earlier when they had been trying to set up an IV, they were on the fourth or fifth try. It was difficult because I’m restricted to 40 ounces of water a day because the tegretol causes low sodium. I felt bad for them and was trying my best to do what I could to make it easier. But, I got a really sharp shocking pain and told the nurse. It’s fine, he said firmly. I said, laughing, it’s fine for you maybe but not for me. I was trying not to be a “difficult” patient but I should have been firmer. Later because of him sticking it in the nerve, I had a numb area and shocks whenever my wrist moved. I wore a wrist brace for three weeks after that that I got at the store for 10 and it luckily really helped. But never again will I let that happen. But that’s who I saw distinctly, when I came out of my brief faint. He was smirking at me. I waved my arms and said, “I’m fine, I’m fine.” They got me back to my room, checked things and dispersed. I didn’t think I had passed out for very long. But I asked my mom just to make sure. She said oh maybe 20 seconds. The ER doctor who had touched my face even though I asked her not to came in. With trigeminal neuralgia, it can set off an attack when someone touches your face. When it provoked an attack and I winced, my face making probably an ugly looking grimace I remember her looking at me with a scowl and thinking wow, she doesn’t believe me. She came to the side of my bed and said, “You just had a pseudo seizure.” I didn’t know the terminology but I know that pseudo means false. I have no history of seizures and have never presented with one, I asked her, “Are you saying you think I just faked a seizure?” To her credit, she said she was not saying that but just that they knew it wasn’t an actual seizure. And then she said sometimes people have them when they are in great distress. I was just stunned and sickened. After that, no nurse or doctor came back in to check on me. A patient facilitator who called me “Ma’am” with a curt voice made me walk through all my medications even though I see doctors at that hospital often and they are up to date and I had just done it at intake. But, ok. He asked me to say “yes, if I was still taking it and “need” if I needed to take it. Well, I did it wrong the first time around, I have about 21 medications, it was midnight. I hadn’t eaten since noon. They wouldn’t let me drink anything and even my tongue felt dry. I was exhausted and was suddenly adding up everything that had happened in my head and feeling very vulnerable in my gown, weighted down by IVs and equipment and so sick of the swaying and motion and nausea. He treated me like an imbecile. We did it again and finally, I got it right. He said the medications would be in my room when I got upstairs. It was 2am by the time I got to my bed and I was started to feel even less dizzy then. It was such a relief . The medications weren’t there. I have bipolar and need to take those medications at night and I need sleep to treat my illness. I knew I wasn’t going to get much but I needed the few hours. The nurse said she would call my doctor. By 4am, I fell asleep. I woke up just after six. I was worn out but I felt back to normal. I could walk, I could read, I could see. It was all gone. I was so relieved. But, I was in horrid pain at this point. It was time to take my medications for the day. I always take them at 6. Pain medication, urinary, muscle relaxants, anti convulsants like : ie Tegretol, Gabapentin, Topamax, Baclofen. I called the nurse. She said the only thing on file for you is Tylenol and Ativan. What in the everliving world? Apparently the Tylenol was for my pain and the Ativan was for my seizures. So we were now treating trigeminal neuralgia with drugs you can get in a gas station and medicating pseudo seizures? I asked to speak to the doctor. She came in with her “Ma’am” which I never knew could sound so derogatory. I asked her why I wasn’t being given my medication and that I had missed my bipolar meds and I was upset about that, She explained they were testing the level of the anticonvulsants in my system to make sure they were ok. Well, that made sense I thought. But, what about the rest of my medication, She told me she wouldn’t give me my Prozac because it could cause a manic reaction. I had been taking the same dose for nine years, I explained and if you are worried about me having a mania why didn’t you give me my medications last night? I got another sneaking suspicion and it finally hit home. They were tying all my psychiatric issues into this medical situation. I have bipolar and PTSD. I also treat both and have for years faithfully, I could have explained to her what my mania looks like if she had asked. I’m intimately familiar with them after all. She then told me the Ativan was there in case I had a seizure from them withdrawing the medications from me. She told me she would give me my gabapentin, mybretriq (for urinary issues) and plaquenil for my autoimmune issues. I sat there stunned and in a lot of pain. I had no pain medication and had been trying to soldier on but I was exhausted and had no faith or understanding in what they were doing. I was terrified of having a seizure and could see no reason why they would subject me to that possibility. There was no on watching me, no explanations of how it would be handled or what it would feel like. I knew my body didn’t need to go through that. The nurse came in with only one pill and said that was all the doctor ordered, it was 9:30. I asked her when my neurologist would be in. She said, I wasn’t seeing her I was seeing a hospitalist that was all. That was the final straw, I called someone to pick me up and I left AMA. I sent a message to my neurologist on the hospital system and went home to sleep and take my medication. Her nurse called me that evening and got me in the next day. I also received a kind note back from my neurologist as I had explained briefly that it has been the worst medical experience of my life and I had never felt so belittled, discounted and misunderstood. When I saw her the next day, I had my mother come in with me in case she wanted a further explanation of what happened from someone who saw it. My purpose was to find out what happened but my mom was still very upset and wanted to discuss how awful the experience had been. My neurologist negotiated it the best way she could. She explained she knew me very well after working with me for almost two years and they didn’t have that same background. This read to me exactly what I thought, they didn’t believe me! Diagnosis: The neurologist called it the perfect storm. I was dehydrated from being restricted to 40 ounces a day on the tegretol and a recent infection. We were switching from tegretol to lamictal and I had to take Dilantin short term to get through a dental flare after having six crowns down in one day. It’s a lot of medication at once in addition to my other pills. I also had benign baroxysmal position vertigo (BPPV) likely from that same dentist visit. (Okay for anyone who is wondering why someone with trigeminal neuralgia would have that much work done in one sitting, I will explain. I had to have it done. It would finally, finally be the last work needed on my right side. I was going to go through a flare after the dental work anyway so I decided to do it all at once. Why go through two or three flares? Was it too much to do it at once? Sitting for over six hours without food and barely any water with my mouth open and still having to take my medications on an empty stomach was hard. I was beat after. Because life is what it is, I had a tiny virus that turned into a 103.5 fever the next day. It was a Saturday so I waited until Monday and by then it was gone. But, it didn’t help the situation. The dental work produced a flare of epic proportions. It was hell. It lasted a little over two weeks. I just got through it by saying, this is different because it will end. You can get through something that will end. I was in bed most of the time. I remember my mom coming into my room on several occasions and begging me to go to the ER and because I couldn’t talk, I just shook my head. Why go and sit in the hard chairs under the lights waiting for hours? ER doesn’t want to treat pain. Although, the two times I have gone to the ER for trigeminal neuralgia I have been very lucky to have very kind doctors. They read my notes knowing I could not talk. They gave my an anticonvulsant IV Dilantin. I thank god I don’t have to ask for opiates. The lights were dimmed. The first doctor, who suggested that drug and it brought my pain from a 10 to a 2 if I could have found him on my way out, I seriously would have kissed him. But, why wait for hours and then get a bed and an IV and be put in a gown and strung up to stuff and pay that godawful amount of money for maybe a half a day respite? I’d rather be at home in my bed, with my pillows and my iPad if I can watch something sucking on ice. And considering the ER visit, I’m detailing I think I made a damn good choice. But, lastly anyone with trigeminal neuralgia should not undergo crowns, root canals or getting teeth pulled without making sure there is a dental issue. Trigeminal neuralgia will trick you and I lost two teeth that way and had two root canals and need to wear something for my gap. I’m also out a wonderful trip to Europe because of it-7500.) But back to what my neurologist told me, the finally diagnosis was: VERTIGO! No one had said vertigo when I was there. I had no idea vertigo could be so terrifying. All the ER doctor had to do is say your symptoms sound like or could be vertigo. This is what vertigo can feel like and so on. If she could tell me I might be having a stroke, she could say I could be having vertigo. I could understand that. I could wrap my brain around that. I could have gone home. And saved myself a lot of money. *Update: After having vertigo on a few more occasions after this but with a migraine which I didn’t have the first time, my diagnosis was switched to vestibular migraines. (You can have a vestibular migraine attack without the headache. Who knew?) I also saw an Ear, Nose & Throat Doctor who ruled out the BPPV. One huge positive has come out of this new diagnosis. I was told to take the OTC, Meclizine for the vertigo attacks. I realized they got rid of the dizziness that plagued me every evening. No longer did I have to say to my daughter one second I need to sit down and then I will finish your dinner. It has been so freeing! Here I go, I’m going to be one of those people and say it: there’s always a silver lining in every health condition you have! Now it finally comes to the end of my tale. I know one last vital mistake I made. I was getting an EKG done in the ER. There were two female nurses and they had my gown open leaving me bare chested while placing the EKGS. I had just gotten out of an ambulance where five men had to strap me to a chair and carry me down to a stretcher. As I said, I have PTSD, I was already triggered but I was handling it. The nurse left my gown open and went and opened my curtain wide for the whole ER. I said, please don’t do that. I have PTSD. I breathed heavily and closed my eyes. The one nurse said yes, just breathe in, you’re ok. It took about twenty seconds and I was fine. My mistake obviously. Never admit psychiatric issues. I assume we are in 2018 and medical professionals can distinguish. I didn’t freak out, I didn’t request medication, I didn’t yell, I breathed in for twenty seconds deeply to self soothe and then explained my condition and asked for respect. I thought I was doing the right thing at the time. I was hoping they would know to handle any issues like that more gently from then on. I thought I was being responsible. But, being a bipolar patient with PTSD seems to nix out MS and trigeminal neuralgia. Add being a woman to that and you’ve got quite a mix. Now, I’m not going to even go into the can of worms about pain management today but I hear so many people suffering and I see the reactions toward pain getting worse and worse. It scares me because trigeminal neuralgia is a pain condition. My pulse and blood pressure goes up when I am in pain but other than that, I need people to believe me. I am doing my part as a patient. I take my medications. I follow my pain contract faithfully, I research all the time. I have had nerve block after nerve block. I’ve changed my diet. I am back to my normal, healthy weight even though I’m on multiple medications that make you gain weight and I can’t do as much activity as I would like. I see a therapist. I reach out to the pain community for support. I write. I’ve tried acupuncture. I do massage or reflexology every two weeks. I see an integrative medicine doctor. I’ve just recently started meditation which I like. It takes me more to get through a day than many people will ever understand. And I hope they never have to. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone, except maybe Jeff Sessions. But just for a week. (Then he can ”take some aspirin and tough it out” as he suggested for chronic pain patients.) I will just say, think of the worst pain you’ve had in your life and imagine having that round the clock for months at a time with no end in sight. I made it through that by thinking of my beautiful daughter and looking at the clock and saying ok, you just have to do two more minutes. It was the only way I could do it. In pieces. And now thankfully my pain has lessened, but when I wake up the dentist is still there just now he uses a little more novacaine than before. And I say gratefully: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I am learning how to be happy and functional in a different way than I was before. I won’t give up. So, in my chart does it now say pseudo seizure? Does it say faker? Attention seeker? It makes me sick to my stomach. I’ve only given 10 three times in my life for my pain. I want it to mean something when I say it. I thank god I don’t have to ask for opiates to relieve my pain in emergencies. But now I’m back to my old maxim that I told my GI doctor back in February when she wanted me to go to the ER: I will not go unless a limb is falling off and I can’t find a stapler."},{"instruction":"Can you write something that will make me feel the true size of infinity?","output":"Lol, infinity is an interesting number.

Chihuahua because he is so small that he can be easily handled. English bulldog because he is extremely calm and pain tolerant. If you have young kids/toddlers around, small dogs can be injured. English bulldogs are amazingly resilient - they were bred to hang on to a bull while the bull trashes around to get rid of them. They are have also a low energy level, which helps if you are restricted in movement. If you need a service dog the immediate choice is a lab. They absolute love pleasing their owners.

A: No, for a number of reasons: Bluetooth speakers have a delay, so when recording things and what not, you will no hear what is being recorded in real time, it will lag behind, and that is a problem. You want a low latency setup, ideally something with a 5ms or lower delay. And only wired speakers can offer you thatThe Bluetooth protocol degrades audio quality. In a studio you want the best, clearest, least distorted sound possible, and Bluetooth can’t offer that. So again, you need wired speakers.The components in a HomePod are, contrary to what Apple wants you to believe, not of high quality. The result is that the sound is… less then stellar. Think of it like this: my studio speakers cost US3000 for a pair. If you think your US375 speaker sounds anywhere near as good, you are delusional. But even then, entry level studio monitors like the Focal Alpha 65 Evo, which are much closer to your speaker in cost, will sound better then that HomePod. The reason is simple: the HomePod was not designed to give you the least distorted sound, and entry level studio monitors are. Even if they don’t use the same high quality components as high end studio monitors, they will have been designed to give the best sound possible for their (relatively) low price."},{"instruction":"According to a conservative relative of mine, if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency she will make the U.S. into a socialist country.

They are. But, it’s probably more helpful to think of them as the “realist” branch of the Democratic party. They understand (as do their colleagues on the progressive branch) that the Trump, McConnell, Barr, and associates are actively destroying the norms that keep the U.S. functioning as a democracy, republic, or rule-of-law nation (take your pick, and let’s skip the silly discussion about whether the U.S. is a “democracy” or a “republic”). The other thing that makes them realists is that they understand that even if the Democrats get a majority in the senate, they will only be able to pass what the most conservative Democratic senator will vote for. In other words, there is no practical difference between the platforms of *any* of the democratic contenders — Biden and Sanders are identical —the only meaningful difference is who can win against Trump, and then who can work with their counterparts in the House and Senate. South Carolina answered the “Is Biden’s campaign viable?” question, and the answer was a strong yes. The realists looked at this and saw it doesn’t matter if Biden, Buttigieg, or Klobuchar wins the nomination, what matters is who can beat Trump. Buttigieg and Klobuchar were providing “insurace” for the nation if Biden crumbled. Part of that was an untested hypothesis that the could draw votes from more than just well-educated, white voters. They failed this test miserably in South Carolina. The understood that the best choice for the nation was to consolidate the realist vote on a single candidate. The realists were getting more votes than the purists (Sanders and Warren) in Iowa and New Hampshire, but were getting fewer delegates due to the 15% rule. Buttigieg, Klobuchar, and Steyers did the math, and did the right thing and withdrew from the race so the realists could avoid self-sabbatoge by vote-splitting. Putting the needs of the nation above personal ambition isn’t a conspiracy by the DNC. It’s doing the right thing."},{"instruction":"As an INFJ, were your enneagram results surprising to you?","output":"I was surprised.

They’re similar in many ways, but there are a few important differences you should know about if you’re working with either of them. Both AngularJS and Angular can be used to create amazing hybrid apps. However, they have some key differences that could steer your project in a different direction. This article takes a deeper look at the differences between these two libraries so you can make an informed decision on which framework is right for your project. AngularJS Overview AngularJS is an open-source JavaScript framework that powers Single-page applications (SPAs). It’s also a front-end library that’s used to build more complex applications. Like other frameworks, Angular excels at creating certain types of applications that are very common in the industry. For example, you’ll find lots of e-commerce applications built with AngularJS. AngularJS is also great for creating RESTful backend services. It can be used to power Web Services, and also for mobile apps. A SPA is a web application that loads only once—much like a native app—and generates dynamic content on the fly. With AngularJS, you can create a SPA that gives users an app that feels like a native app on their device. What is the recommended approach to using Angular? Angular is a versatile tool that’s a natural fit for many different types of projects. For example, many e-commerce applications use Angular to create a seamless, one-click shopping experience. If your goal is to [LINKED_TEXT: build an app] [URL: https://jumpgrowth.com/how-to-create-an-app-from-scratch/] that works across a range of devices, as well as one that works offline, then using Angular is a great choice. It’s highly scalable and configurable, so you can choose the best options for your app. Because Angular is a complete JavaScript framework, it has the potential to be used in a wide variety of contexts. However, it’s important to remember that it’s a framework. It doesn’t have all the flexibility of a language like Ruby. For example, you can’t add a new feature or fix a bug with a single line of code. When should you use AngularJS? There are lots of benefits to using AngularJS for your project, such as: AngularJS has a large community of developers who are more than willing to help you out as you learn.It has a large ecosystem of third-party tools and services, making it easier to create an application.It’s a great choice for non-technical business people who are looking to jump into SPA development. However, it does require a knowledge of front-end frameworks, which can make it a challenge for beginners.A key benefit of using AngularJS is that you can easily build an app that works across a range of devices, particularly if your design is flexible enough to work on different screen sizes. When is it better to use Angular? Here are a few reasons to think about using Angular for your next project: If you have a back-end team who is familiar with Angular, and you have existing applications that you can use as a guide, then it’s a great choice.If you have existing code that you can use as a guide, then it’s a great choice.It’s very easy to add new features to Angular. It’s also easy to make changes to the core framework, so you never have to worry about breaking things.It’s relatively easy to make your app available on mobile devices, and it’s very easy to make it available on the web.Your app should work well, especially if the front-end features rely heavily on data from the backend.Key differences between Angular and AngularJS Here are the key differences between Angular and AngularJS: Angular is a complete product, whereas AngularJS is more of a library.Angular is backed by Google, whereas AngularJS is open source.Angular is a framework, whereas AngularJS is a library.Angular is designed for developing robust Single-page applications, whereas AngularJS is designed for use in hybrid applications.Angular is backed by Google, whereas AngularJS is open source.Angular is designed for developing robust Single-page applications, whereas AngularJS is designed for use in hybrid applications.Angular has many more features and a lot more flexibility, whereas AngularJS is easier to get up and running.Angular is used for building both SPAs and hybrid apps, whereas AngularJS is used for building SPAs.Angular is a complete product, whereas AngularJS is more of a library.

Currently the GOP is very fragmented. I’mnot Sure under Trump, the GOP knows what it stands for anymore. Today’s GOP does not want to be perceived as being weak on defense.

So as far as defense spending goes, BOTH parties are all in. And defense spending, including counter terrorism programs, is a good chunk of the yearly expedature for the US budget. The fiscal conservatives in the GOP ( the Tea party members) have been silenced by those Republicans in Congress who have hitched their wagon to Trump and have caved into his tantrums and demands on budget matters. Don’t fool yourself that the GOP is the party of fiscal conservancy.

Beginning preparation without analysis A lot of students start their GATE preparation without analyzing the [LINKED_TEXT: syllabus] [URL: https://www.madeeasy.in/course.aspx?mpgid=42&pgidtrail=42]themselves. A comprehensive study of the exam pattern and trend of questions asked from various topics is very important before you start the preparation. GATE preparation does not need a very inclusive preparation in terms of coverage of syllabus. One needs to track and analyze the previous paper trends properly. In depth study of concepts is required to stand the cut throat competition; earlier cut off were less but in today’s scenario toppers are scoring somewhere around 95-98 marks and relatively the cut off has also increased. Also, one must identify their weak and strong areas and approach each subject accordingly. Same time and attention to each subject may not be a helpful idea. 2. Improper prioritizing Without a mind map of the course of action to follow, loss of efficiency and effort may occur. Topics can be classified into two different types which are; conventional (traditional) areas of the syllabus and rarely asked topics. Conventional areas are those which must be prioritized since they are sure to carry the highest percentage of marks. Rarely asked topics can be taken care of at the end of the subject as they can provide an extra edge, in case a question from those topics comes up. Similarly, out of numerical and theoretical topics, depending on one’s own comfort and strengths, one must identify and prioritize topics accordingly. 3. Research-oriented study Often students waste a lot of time by trying to follow a plethora of sources to study. Time is a very crucial aspect while preparing and it should be saved by avoiding unnecessary research on any topic. GATE preparation must be highly exam oriented. Reading complete textbooks for each subject takes up a lot of time and effort. It is a very good practice for enhancing knowledge but not so much when one tries to prepare for GATE in a stipulated amount of time. The focus must always be on clearing the exam and thus, the preparation strategy must be highly goal-oriented at all times. Textbooks or any such sources must only be referred for topics that one finds tough to understand from their primary source of study. It is here where Coaching comes into the role play, as experienced faculties give you the right direction regarding how to study, what to study and how much to study. This actually saves your unnecessary efforts and saves time. 4. A generic approach for the preparation Following a generic approach or someone else’s approach for preparation is another common mistake being observed. Preparation plan should be unique for every aspirant and for each subject. This practice is not good because every individual has his/her own limitations and strengths. So, one may take help from other’s strategy and plans to develop their own but not follow them completely. Similarly, each subject cannot be prepared in a similar manner and some subjects require more practice. Whereas subjects that involve more theory must not be taken one after another. Proper short notes and repeated revisions for such subjects is helpful, whereas practicing more questions for numerical or concept-based subjects proves more helpful. 5. Poor revision plan This is the most common mistake seen in GATE exam. A well-organized revision plan is even more important than a proper preparation plan because retaining is more important for the judgment day than understanding. Planning your preparation strategy in such a way that there’s no room for revision in the end would be a blunder. Also, keeping revision only for the end is also equally harmful. The revision must be done at regular intervals through practicing questions, re-reading notes or appearing for test series. Time dedicated for revision must be increased with each progressing month of preparation. 6. Lack of discipline Lack of discipline does harm to everybody’s life, in general. And then if you decide to devote a crucial phase of your life to preparation for GATE, this is one mistake you would certainly want to avoid. A well-disciplined and scheduled routine is very important while preparing for entrance exams. Continuity is another important aspect. A consistency in study hours and a set pattern must be maintained. It is suggested that one studies in stretches of two to three hours at once. The number of such sessions can be increased gradually and according to one’s caliber and stamina. Studying for twelve hours in a day, three days a week and two hours a day for the rest of the week does not let the mind train itself for the exam day. Furthermore, one’s study timing and schedule must be fixed and stuffed with small breaks in between. Proper food habits, sleep habits and exercise are a few more things that can add to one’s efficiency while studying. 7. Demotivation from others’ results Everybody has their own battle and their own way to fight it. At the same instance when its 2 pm in India, it would be 4:30 am in New York but that does not make India faster than New York. Same applies to people. Everybody has their own time zone and achieve what he or she deserves accordingly. What is important is that they should keep moving forward. One should not get demotivated by others’ success only because they achieved it earlier. It’s better to learn from their mistakes and get inspired by their hard work and then keep moving according to your plan.Students generally go into solitude while preparation which is not good in the extreme. Rather, small support groups of two-three students with like minds and similar goals can be helpful. Discussion and doubt resolution can be done very easily with help of such groups. 8. Unverified study sources Lack of trust in the faculty or oneself often leads students to go for some additional sources of study. These sources which may include some web portals, YouTube channels or local textbooks may be unverified. Reading from these sources sometimes may land you to gain incorrect information or concepts. This practice may be very harmful therefore it is very important to maintain trust in your primary source of study. If, in any case, it’s very important to refer any secondary sources, they must be verified first. Also, before referring to any book for model questions or previous year GATE solutions, one must check the credibility of the publication to ensure correct learning. 9. Lack of evaluation Students tend to appear for less online tests or take offline tests for GATE to save some money. This leads to insufficient practice for the actual exam in its true mode. Regular evaluation and proper analysis are very crucial for proper GATE preparation. It helps one to understand where they stand among all the aspirants. Also, by analyzing mistakes and obtained marks, further course of action can be decided easily. Tests must be taken in online mode with virtual calculator only so as one can properly analyze their speed, accuracy, and concepts.Only appearing for the test is not enough though. After a test is completed, one must examine the questions which you failed to attempt, look for a plausible reason why you could not answer them and update your strategy accordingly. As for wrong attempts, it is important to know if the mistakes are being repeated. If the mistakes are conceptual or related to memory, referring to the notes again may help. If more calculation related or silly mistakes are made, more practice is needed. 10. Insufficient tuning for the exam day This mistake is generally seen thirty to forty days before the exam, or after the admit card has been released. Students tend to follow the same schedule until the end which is not a healthy practice. The human body needs to tune with their daily schedule to work at its maximum efficiency. After one receives her or his admit card, he/she must tune or plan their schedule according to their final exam slot. This helps the body to be the most productive and efficient in that time slot. For example, if one is habitual of studying at night and get afternoon session for the exam, one may not be at their most efficient self at that time. Also, one must also try to give actual computer-based tests conducted for a real-time experience of GATE exam. This helps one to get acquainted with the exam environment and avoid panic on the exam day.During the exam, it is important to remain hydrated, energetic and stress-free as they say, ” prepare hard, test easy.” These GATE exam study tips put together with strong determination and motivation can help students avoid common mistakes in GATE exam and achieve success without any delay. “Mistakes are only harmful when you’re not learning from them, else they are just advancing steps towards success.” Success is easy for no one. Only those who can identify, accept and rectify their mistakes and learn from others’ can make it through easily.

What is the most exhaustive list of steps you can suggest for people to avoid car accidents?","output":"Profound and sincere condolences on the loss, Tanya ! To begin with, the following basic steps should help prevent car accidents : Keep the car well maintained and checked at all times at least every 5000 kms. That means simply, regularly serviced !Drive only when you are fresh and confident of not falling drowsy or sleepy ! Ideal way to drive is to start journeys early around 5.30 am and take breaks every 3 to 4 hours. Keep the music or talking on but NEVER EVER take off your eyes off the road even for a single second!I, for one, have installed a large and broad Central anti-glare rear view mirror and keep my eyes always on the rear traffic too!Maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead especially if it is a heavy vehicle! At least a 10 to 15 feet distance and gap is ideal at driving speeds over 60 kmph.Don’t turn without giving indications in advance and do that only after checking well in all the mirrors , including the blind spot areas.Make sure you drive at speeds that allow you total control of your car. Ideally any speed above 80 kmph to be avoided since there could always be some sudden surprises on the roads (Bicycles/Bullock carts/ pedestrians walking across casually).Make sure your driving is idiot proof —assume the guy ahead is going to make mistakes!Never jump signals even if those behind you horn badly ! Most accidents happen just when the signals are changing because the other person is trying to beat it!Last, but not the least, small reflective /fluorescent car stickers on all bumper corners are a great way to make sure others can see your car at all times in the dark. Use them !If learning do use the L stickers and sign boards freely all over the rear sidecar glasses and make sure a good driver is with you at all times."},{"instruction":"What are some unique facts about Telugu?","output":"Statistically : The most spoken Dravidian language.

Another sort of backlink is no-follow, which allows webmasters to instruct search engines not to follow a specific link. It does not, however, guarantee that Google will not follow the links. Businesses employ nofollow links when they want to avoid passing link juice to social media sites or other third-party websites."},{"instruction":"Why Assembly language outperform other language? I understand in some cases Assembly beats even compiled code in c and c++, what happen under the hood that makes Assembly code run faster in certain situations?","output":"Because Assembly is not a \\"language\\". Or at least, not in the sense that all other languages are. Assembly is just a direct translation, into a human-readable format, of machine instructions (which are binary). There is a direct one-to-one equivalence between a machine instruction and an Assembly instruction. This means that if you know, for a given processor/instruction set, how to perform optimally some given task, then this optimal algorithm can be expressed exactly into Assembly. No other language can possibly perform better. So now I’ve explained why Assembly can’t be beaten. I now need to explain why other languages perform (usually) worse than Assembly. For that, we need to understand one of the prime motivations behind why other languages we invented to begin with. As I mentionned earlier, there is a one-to-one equivalence between a machine instruction and an assembly instruction. That’s nice, but the problem is that every processor model in the world have a different instruction set. So a program written in Assembly for one processor, that works for that processor, will not work on other processors. That is a problem. And that is why higher-level programming languages were invented: they allow programers to represent a program’s logic in a procesor-independent language, and the compiler translates that code into machine instructions appropriate for the target machine. But this process is not free. Even low-level languages like C have introduced some abstractions. The way loops, conditionnal statements, function calls, etc… are translated may use more instructions than necessary, because the compiler does not know, a priori, what is going to be the body of these structures. The compiler must produce code that is generic enough to ensure everything is cleaned up, for all possible bodies; otherwise some bug or memory leaks might happen. These extra instructions will degrade the performance. If you were writing in Assembly directly, you would know that some of the cleanup required, in the general case, is not needed in your case, and you wouldn’t put it in your code, and it would be more performant. Fortunately for us, nowadays, compilers have gotten very good at optimization, and they will be able to optimize away almost all of the unnecessary instructions, such than, very often, the performance of compiled C or C++ is as good as you would have gotten by writing in Assembly. But no matter how smart the compiler get, there will always be some code that the optimizer will be unable to fully optimize, and that’s why, in some circumstances, for time-critical blocks, some programmers still use Assembly."},{"instruction":"w do you wake yourself up in the morning?","output":"My goal motivates me much to wake up every day in the morning."},{"instruction":"w come the AAP got massive public support in Punjab politics so quickly?","output":"The answer is simple - Punjab has tested other parties & found them lacking for various reasons, & AAP is yet to rule there & reveal its shortcomings.

I was put in section C of the facility for the meantime I would be found a bed in section B. I cried horribly while being in that place since section C is where the less… stable people are put, gladly I only had to spend 10 minutes in there and got guided to my room (also some random girl gave me a paper flower to cheer up so that was nice) When I got to my room it was … so nice? Like a hotel room with a TV and a shower with running hot water. The next two weeks wouldn’t be so bad; since I was a teen I was assigned a nurse to accompany me at all times, every nurse I got was incredibly nice and made everything more bearable. Also I only spent time with the group of teens since we were not allowed to spend time with the adults for security or whatever. Many of them had it worse than me, others were in the same situation; I generally got to know a little about their lives. I guess the only bad things were that I was expecting to be let out in a week but my parents decided to leave me two weeks, order of my therapist in the place. Also a guy escaped through the roof of section C and it was insane, also one of the girls in our teen group started scratching her arms so bad my last night there they had to tie her down and take her to section C. I had made a friend in her and got a nurse to deliver her a little letter for me. I do have many other stuff to tell but even though nothing “bad” happened you would understand I don’t like thinking about it a lot. Generally, in my case, I know a lot of people get put in horrible places, it’s not bad but you don’t want to be there either of course. I can only hope and try my best to not hurt my family or myself like that again. I’m rooting for me!"},{"instruction":"What are the musthave iPhone apps?

No one starts out as a bestselling author, and many times, there is a road of failure before you get to where you want to be. However, I have found four things that have helped me on the way, and I feel that doing these things has greatly improved my writing. Be Consistent. I never really thought of consistency as a rule of thumb when it came to writing. I always felt like writing came from the heart, and therefore, it shouldn’t be something that was pressured by time constraints. However, one day, I had a conversation with my spouse, who used to be a manager, and we talked about productivity. I realized after this conversation that in order to make more money in my career, I was going to have to work more hours and set a steady schedule. We sat down together and figured out how I could work a forty-hour work week and still take care of my responsibilities at home, and we tried it out. To my surprise, I found myself more productive. Instead of pressuring myself to get everything done in two or three hours, I had time to think about what I was writing and put everything together. This helped relieve a lot of stress, and it increased the amount of work that I could get accomplished in one day. 2. Don’t limit your social media posts. I always thought that advertising on social media every so often and selling through Amazon would get my books into the hands of the people that wanted to read them. However, I was wrong. My first mistake was that I didn’t have social media accounts on all of the social media websites. Not everyone uses Facebook. Some people prefer Tumblr, Reddit, Instagram, Pinterest, Wordpress, or even LinkedIn. I decided to set-up accounts on these platforms, and I saw an increase in interactions with my posts. I also made sure that I was more consistent with my posting. If I didn’t have time to post at certain times, I would queue my posts, so that they came out on their own. This helped, because it showed my readers that I was still actively writing, and it kept me fresh in their minds. 3. Expand your distribution. Like I said before, I had only published on Amazon, so I thought that I was reaching all of my readers. However, after reading a couple of blogs from other authors, I found out that Amazon wasn’t the only distributor. Authors were putting their work on Draft2Digital and Smashwords as well, and this was helping their sales. I decided to see if this would help me, so I set-up an account for both of these distributors and pulled my books out of the Kindle Select program, so that I was free to expand my distribution. After the first couple of months, I began to see sales numbers that I had never seen. 4. Network and interact with authors and readers. Just because you post on social media, doesn’t mean someone is going to read it. Sometimes, you have to go out of your way to add new readers to your site or reach out to people on posts that are looking for new reading recommendations. By doing this, you may bring your writing to a group of readers that had never heard of your publication, and if they like your writing, they may tell their friends. Also, while you are interacting with readers online, you should also try to reach out to some fellow authors. Other authors can help keep you motivated on your journey as they are probably dealing with some of the same issues that you are. These authors may also be able to help promote your work through #writerslift posts, newsletter swaps, or a sale that they are hosting. Conclusion Keep in mind that writing will always take work. You have to work on it consistently in order to get better, and you have to make sure that you are distributing your work to the proper places and advertising it in order to reach new readers."},{"instruction":"ving at 62, I have no pension. I haven’t payed enough in for old age pension and I am alone. What will I do? I work a few hours, have no savings, and live week to week. I live in Britain.","output":"At 62 you are not at pensionable age in the UK. That is tough if you are a woman and all your life you expected to claim a pension at 60. Predictable if you are a man and pension age has only moved a couple of years. The state pension is not enough to live on unless you already completed your mortgage and have some extra resources, but it is a start and better than nothing . You need to find out what extra payments you have to make or how many more years you have to work to get the full pension. You need to get back in to full time work to pay pension contributions for the next 3–5 years and earn enough money to buy some more pension contributions. It’s too late to get much of a private pension but you might still be able to get your state pension. The trouble is that unless you are just staying in an established role for which you already have lots of experience and expertise, employers don’t really want to take on fading sixty somethings. They want young motivated aspiring people and people who are fit and strong and full of energy if they can get them and will choose them first. We are in a time of relatively high employment, but even the young people are being forced into zero hours contracts or multiple part time jobs to get a living wage. Those who are not in established secure jobs as they go into their sixties are probably going to have to take low paid undesirable low skilled work that the young people don’t want if they are going to carry on working until 67. In short, get in touch with the pensions office and find out what you need to do to secure your state pension because I think you still have time. Get any full time job with a proper employment contract and continue to live cheaply so you can make up years on your pension entitlement and pay for years you haven’t worked full time. Be careful though because many basic jobs, in retail particularly, will interview you on the assumption there is a full time job available but only offer you a short hours flexible contract which prevents you getting full time employment elsewhere."},{"instruction":"Who are the best Canadian immigration consultants in Chennai?","output":"When you start researching about about the better or best Immigration consultant, check with these Make sure the consultant has in depth process knowledgeMake sure they are transparent with the processMake sure you get an agreement with the Terms and ConditionsMake sure they inform you about the Entire process and Fee structureThey should give you a Process flow or a timeline electronicallyAsk them for a alternate plan if your profile is not picked in the normal express entry pool With all these questions posted on a consultant make sure he gives you a clear picture of the process without any hesitation There are many consultant in the market, but I can assure on the above mentioned terms you cannot find a single consultant apart from a consultant in chennai Egmore (Green Tree imm) These guys are an icon for professionalism and Acting as per commitment, with my whole heart I would suggest them for your PR process if you need exact realistic and practical information regards your profile…"},{"instruction":"What are some of the most expensive houses in the world?","output":"Buckingham Palace – 2.9 Billion Buckingham is the Most Expensive House in the world.

If you have none, that is a problem, that means you've never paid National Insurance, or received NI credit due to work, benefits or being in receipt of Child Benefit if you had a child, as you will get 16 years NI credit for that alone.

You might find you have some complete or incomplete years. If you don't have 10 full years you can top up, back to 2006 at a cost of approximately £800 for each year, but each year is worth £250 a year in pension, so you'll recoup each year in just over three years, and from then on you'll be better off.

True Punk doesn't have much variation in tempo, chords, instruments or song structures. Punk rock tends to be based on a simple chord progression played at speed on bass, drums and guitars with no variation or soloing. There's not a huge amount that you can do within those confining parameters and what you can do has been done before by Punk pioneers. Arguably the finest punk rock album is the Clash's debut which was released in 1977. In the four decades since then, people have taken that formula and tried to replicate it and to be honest it's all been done now. The Clash, the Ramones and others did it early, did it well and did it comprehensively. All attempts to be punk since sound like cheaper imitations. Punk is just too limiting a genre, it took the Clash two years to realise it and everyone else caught on pretty quickly too."},{"instruction":"What is it like to be morbidly obese (BMI > 40)?","output":"Most likely, misunderstood. Hypothyroidism is usually why people are obese. Endocrine dysfunction is why people deviate from the norm. All those smug thin people thinking it's their gym memberships, their diets, their genetics, their good common sense, and their lack of greed is why they're thin, are IMO, incorrect. I used to be one of those thin people. I ate pizzas and sugary foods. I rarely exercised, it never interested me and I found it tiring. I never gained weight regardless of what I ate. Well, about 3 years ago that little fantasy ended. I began to literally swell up like a tick drinking blood. It was myxedema, a sign of long long untreated hypothyroidism. How do you fancy 27kg of fluid and mucin, along with severe endocrine dysfunction? How would you like a body that resembles a melted choc ice? Lol, take your health for granted, and you can achieve this too. I was a long term vegetarian. In the second decade of this idiotic diet, I ate really well. Endless lentils, nuts, grains, seeds, veg and fruit. Oh heck, a diagnosis of anemia! Ok fine I'll eat more spinach, more lentils. Oh damn, I'm getting skin issues. Ok just eat more veggies. Eat more eggs. Eat more plant oils. Damn, where's my energy going? Nevermind, eat more vegetables, fruit, nuts, grains, seeds, plant oils, avocado etc. Aww my hair's turning into steel wool. Wtf!! Yeah, I was becoming severely hypothyroid. I was severely deficient. So the thing I've always noticed is that although obese people lose weight, they almost always gain it back. Or, they diet till the cows come home, but never lose the weight. Go to gastric surgery groups and see if these pathetically nasty, arrogant, ignorant and completely erroneous theories are correct. See whether people who barely eat, who've damaged their bodies for society, their families and themselves, are all skinny minnies? No. They're ill. They have complications, they vomit blood, they can't eat, they can't keep food down, they can't swallow saliva, they get the bands redone several times, they become extremely ill and require hospitalisation, they grow weary, and worst of all they mostly regain all the weight but also have damaged digestion and metabolisms. Why is this? Surely if you just eat less, do more, you'll look like a twig? Had these and other obese people been PROPERLY checked for hypothyroidism, it would have saved them all that pain, misery and loss. When you look at people who were obese and who lost weight, take note of their bodies. Are they worth? Sinewy? Toned? Muscled? Almost always, not. Instead, they're puffy, pneumatic. Even after losing masses of weight, they're not toned or defined. They appear to own seamless limbs and torsos. They don't appear to possess definition. Believe it or not you don't need to be an avid exerciser to have definition. Healthy thyroid hormone metabolism and endocrine function will give you a defined body, naturally. You'd have to work hard to ruin that. I was always thin, but never toned or muscled. My body lost some fluid after I got proper treatment, but a lot of it remains. I look like I've eaten a lot of pies to the thick, judgemental lunatics who believe that all large people are fat, greedy, lazy pigs. They're so safe in their fantasy that you just have to eat less and exercise more. Except that time and time again, people prove this wrong. What you eat is important. The aim is to balance your blood sugar levels throughout the day. Avoid hunger, or sugar highs. Eat meats and some veg, some carbs. EAT FAT. The morons who demonise fat are dangerous. Fat is a very very rich food. You can't eat more than a tablespoon of butter in one go. You can't eat half a kilogram of meat fat in one for. But every single cell in pure bodies requires fats. Vitamin A, D, E and K require fats for absorption. Fats are extremely nourishing. Morbidly obese people rarely get help for their broken metabolisms. They get judged and attacked by morons who are blissfully ignorant about hypothyroidism, endocrine dysfunction, metabolism and diet."},{"instruction":"What are the best freelancing sites?","output":"The best freelancing sites are fiverr and Upwork"},{"instruction":"What school major has the biggest buzzkill when it comes time to practice it in the workforce?","output":"Social Work. I come from a large family, and almost all of my family members worked for the child welfare (foster care and adoption) agency my parents founded. So naturally when I went to college and couldn’t think of what to major in, I gravitated towards the family business. All throughout school, you are fed the idea that you’re going to change the world and help people. You hear phrases like “bringing about positive change,” “serving others,” and you think “this is going to be GREAT.” When you tell people what you’re studying, they say “that’s noble” or “admirable.” You feel so good about yourself and your life plan. Then you do your first internship. Because you don’t have experience or practical knowledge, you’re kept on the sidelines of the profession. But you can see kids who are in tragic life circumstances coming and going. You can’t wait to graduate and make a difference! You finally graduate. It doesn’t take long to realize that you have been lied to at worst, or given a rosy version of the career at best. The pay is abysmal. The hours are interminable. You take work home with you almost every night. You’re on call overnight, on weekends, on holidays. You have to use your personal car to visit your clients. Your car breaks down from overuse. You can’t afford to fix it. You need a vacation from all the stress, but you can’t afford that either. So you take a “staycation” and end up doing paperwork while watching TV. You have to enter the worst environments in the city, sometimes in the middle of the night. Shady guys on the corner stare you down because you look like a cop with your shirt and tie. You have to wash your clothes as soon as you get home because there might be bedbugs, lice, or cockroaches crawling on you. You are routinely confronted with horrific stories of abuse, neglect, murder, death, rape. And most of these horrors are happening to innocent children. It’s like watching horror films and the local news 24/7/365, except it’s all real, and it’s all happening to people you know and care about. It puts you in a dark, dark place. Birth parents hate you because they see you as the person who took away their kids. Foster parents hate you because you enforce stringent rules about how they care for foster kids. Many foster kids hate you because you enforce rules or tell them they can’t see their birth parents because they’re on drugs again or are back in prison. You are cursed out, insulted, and threatened on a daily basis. Birth parents tell you they’re going to follow you home and hurt you or your loved ones. Judges, lawyers, and other case managers threaten you with severe consequences if you don’t finish the paperwork that you have no time to work on. Getting yelled at by a boss is unpleasant. Getting yelled at by a judge is ten times worse. Every day you unintentionally do any number of things that could get you sued or fired or worse. Day in and day out, you see people at their worst, and in a short time, you realize that you’re not who you used to be. Friends and family come to you for counseling, even though you aren’t trained in that field. Your temper is on a hair trigger. You drink and/or smoke more than you should. You start to have nightmares about some of the shit you’ve seen. You’re depressed and feel like the world has become an evil place devoid of hope and happiness. If you stick it out long enough, you may find a real and meaningful connection with a birth parent, foster parent, or child. But those are few and far between. More often than not, you are the bad guy to everyone you meet. All this takes a heavy toll. The turnover at my agency was on average about 40–50% a year, meaning most of the people you work with will be gone by the time they start to finally get a handle on the job. After a while you stop trying to connect with co-workers because you know they aren’t going to last. Did I have some positive experiences in my Social Work career? Sure. But not enough to keep me working there for peanuts. Not enough to make me suffer through the physical, mental, and emotional burden it places on you. Whenever I meet someone who’s interested in the field, I try my best to talk them out of it. If they decide to bail out, then I’ve saved them a lot of time, money, and personal problems. If they decide to stick it out, then I’ve only strengthened their resolve. But I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone.

Trump wants to make use of this action for his re-election and shift eye balls of Americans to his “achievements”. It seems to me that Trump is using the faith of America for his own interests, to be re-elected.

While it may seem like a complex process, understanding the steps involved can make it much easier. In this post, we will walk you through the process of transferring a domain name, ensuring a smooth and seamless transition. Step 1: Check Transfer Eligibility Before initiating a domain transfer, ensure that your domain is eligible for transfer. The domain must meet certain criteria, including being at least 60 days old and not within 15 days of expiration or in a locked status. Additionally, certain domain extensions may have specific transfer requirements, so it's important to research any unique conditions that may apply. Step 2: Prepare for Transfer To initiate the transfer process, you need to gather some essential information. Here's what you'll need: Authorization Code (EPP Code): Obtain an authorization code from your current domain registrar. This code is a unique identifier that confirms your ownership and grants permission for the transfer.Contact Information: Ensure that the contact details associated with your domain are up to date. This includes your administrative contact, technical contact, and registrant contact. Having accurate information will facilitate the transfer process and ensure you receive any necessary notifications.Unlock the Domain: Remove any domain locks or transfer restrictions that might be in place with your current registrar. This step is crucial to allow the transfer to proceed smoothly. Step 3: Choose a New Registrar Research and select a new domain registrar that suits your needs. Look for a reputable registrar that offers competitive pricing, excellent customer support, and the necessary features and services you require. Compare transfer fees, renewal prices, and any additional services provided by the registrar. Step 4: Initiate the Transfer Once you've selected a new registrar, it's time to initiate the transfer process. Here's what typically happens: Place a Transfer Order: Purchase the domain transfer service from your new registrar. Some registrars offer domain transfers for free as part of their service package.Provide Authorization Code: During the transfer process, you'll be asked to provide the authorization code (EPP code) obtained from your current registrar. This code verifies your ownership of the domain and authorizes the transfer.Confirm Transfer Request: Your new registrar will send a transfer request to the current registrar, who will verify the authorization code and confirm the transfer request.Domain Transfer Approval: As the domain owner, you will receive an email notification from your current registrar asking for your approval to transfer the domain. Confirm the transfer by following the provided instructions within the specified timeframe. Step 5: Wait for Transfer Completion Once you've approved the transfer, the actual transfer process begins. The duration of the transfer varies depending on the domain extension and registrars involved. It typically takes anywhere from a few hours to several days for the transfer to complete. During this time, it's important to keep the domain unlocked and avoid making any changes to its settings. Step 6: Verify Successful Transfer After the transfer is complete, verify the successful transfer by checking the WHOIS database or contacting your new registrar. Ensure that all domain settings, DNS records, and associated services are correctly configured to avoid any disruptions. Transferring a domain name involves a series of steps, from checking eligibility and preparing the necessary information to initiating the transfer and confirming its completion. By understanding this process, you can confidently navigate the transfer of your domain name, ensuring a smooth transition to a new registrar or owner. Remember to choose a reputable registrar, maintain accurate contact information, and follow the necessary steps for a successful transfer."},{"instruction":"Why are lovemarriages unstable in comparision to arrangedmarriages?","output":"How sure are you that arranged marriages are more stable and successful when compared to love marriages?

If you are the owner of the mobile phone number in question, you may be able to find call history by checking your phone's call logs or by accessing your service provider's online account management tools. You can also contact your service provider's customer support team for assistance. If you are trying to obtain the call history of someone else's mobile phone number, you will generally need to have legal authority to do so, such as a court order or a subpoena.

They are often made of tiny atoms that can diffuse through containers, but that’s not specific to superfluids. Hydrogen is very hard to contain — it’s part of why they’re having so much trouble launching a hydrogen-fuelled rocket right now. That applies to every side of the container. There’s nothing special about the bottom. What is remarkable is the way they escape through the open top of a container. That’s only indirectly related to being superfluid. Ordinary water can climb out of a jar using capillary action. The fluid is attracted to the material, and can use that to climb up against gravity. Superfluids to that particularly well, since they don’t lose energy to the viscosity of the fluid. There’s nothing about capillary action that violates thermodynamics. It comes from the energy within the fluid itself. You don’t expect it because energy is usually lost as heat, due to viscosity, so superfluids sometimes contradict the expectations you have of ordinary fluids. But they’re not violating any actual laws, just your intuitive versions of those laws."},{"instruction":"What is the best way to get your private pilots license?","output":"The most cost effective way is to take several lessons each week and to take the reading and studying seriously. So, when you are given an homework assignment by your instructor, do the assignment. The more time you have to spend with the instructor, the more it will cost. Recency of exposure plays a very important role in learning. A person who takes lessons every single day, and studies every day will likely be able to become a Certificated Private Pilot in the USA in a month, or possibly less. I did it, many years ago, and I have had students also accomplish that. One of the benefits of taking multiple lessons each week is that it will cost you a lot less than someone who takes only one or two lessons each week. When I was a CFI, the national average (USA) for a person to be able to pass the written, oral and practical tests to become a Private Pilot was about 75 hours dual and solo combined. The reason for that is because most people only take one lesson a week, and some only take one lesson a month. Averages, as we know mean that half the people took longer than 75 hours, while half were able to accomplish the feat in less time. The problem with learning is that people do not retain 100% of each lesson’s experience. AND, we continue to forget even more as time elapses between lessons. For purposes of example only: A person who takes lessons every day will forget about 10% of what they learned lesson to lesson, however the skills/knowledge will quickly be recalled during lesson revue so that the student will be able to move on to the next skill quickly. However, a person who takes lessons only once each week will forget about 10% of the knowledge/skill they learned each day that they are not taking lessons. This means that the review portion of each lesson will take longer because the student has to re-learn what was forgotten over the span of time that the student was inactive between lessons. If you are in the USA, I give this to you as your first lesson: FAA does not issue pilot licenses. FAA issues Pilot Certificates. Remember, the DMV issues licenses, and anybody can learn how to drive—even without lessons. Good luck, and good flying to you! In the United States, it is not a license, it is a Pilot Certificate."},{"instruction":"Are microchip implants safe for dogs?","output":"Yes"},{"instruction":"Social Science","output":"Yes the social sciences are a natural science as humans the subject of study is a natural phenomenon. social science research have faaaar more obstacles than the biological and physical sciences research therefore what they achieve is very little compare to the natural sciences."},{"instruction":"English is an almost grammarless language. — Richard Grant White.

In 2014, my husband, ten-year-old granddaughter and I were invited to a Muslim engagement celebration. We arrived at our destination almost an hour before our hosts, as Iqbal (the groom-to-be) had locked his keys in his car. They were unable to even break a window to get to them and left his car at home, arriving with his dad and the rest of the family. Our destination was in fact a family home. They had erected a tent in the front garden to house the approximate 100 guests, although the tent was used mainly by the ladies. Only 3 men ventured in to enjoy the meal. I am not sure if the bride-to-be's name is Shaida or Shaidra (not sure of the spelling, so spelled it phonetically). What a lovely girl! She was resplendent in a pure white abaya and hijab, while Iqbal looked very dapper in his dark maroon thobe. The rest of the ladies from Iqbal's family all wore black abayas with inserts of different colours in front. Most of the ladies there wore a black decorated abaya, only one was wearing a niqab. The bride and groom to be. Before the ceremony, and before the tent filled up, I asked permission to take a few photos. Only the lady wearing the niqab refused. I accepted her refusal gracefully. There was one older lady there, I would dearly have loved to take a photo of her. She had such a perfect Arab profile. She was resplendent in an all black abaya and hijab, both decorated with beautiful beaded designs. She disappeared while I was on my photographic mission of the opposite side of the tent. Darn! A few of the guests. The ceremony was held in the main house, led by four Immah. It was extremely educational to see how much more seriously an engagement is taken by Islamic people, and all the etiquette involved. I was also surprised to see that an Imam presented the ring to the bride-to-be, and not Iqbal. After the blessings, all the women with children left the house, leaving the rest to sing. There was one white lady there, who is married to a Muslim man, she is a Russian. Luckily I have known her for a few years; she helped me put on my boots after the ceremony indoors. I don't know if she is Muslim as she wore a long dress and not an abaya, though her two little girls were dressed in shalwar kameez. Our granddaughter watched all the goings on with interest. She was surprised to learn that no cutlery was provided to eat the meal, but it took her two minutes flat to get the knack of eating her curried chicken and rice with her hands, though she refused to try any of the three salads or atchar provided. After the meal, we were each given a small cake box containing homemade biscuits and sweets to take home. (The singing that I heard was, I believe, either Nasheeds or someone singing in Arabic. This is actually songs without music in praise of the Almighty and the prophets.)"},{"instruction":"w did you find out about essay writing services?","output":"I found out about essay writing services, such as HelpInHomework, through a combination of online research and recommendations from fellow students.

The few who would probably don’t need it and the 14 year old’s who thought that asking me would be a lark and a laugh, because what could some old guy know about what they are facing right now and what’s ahead in the near future. Nevertheless, I’m guessing the person who posted this question is 14 or soon to be and so I’ll answer it anyway. Here’s the thing. I’m assuming you are a 14 year old in a stable home and education situation because if you weren’t you’d be asking a question about handling one or both of those problems, and you are relatively healthy. Since I was a 14 year old boy once during ancient and turbulent times my advice is directed at 14 year old boys and not girls. Here’s the thing. Whatever issues you are experiencing now, you are not popular enough, you are overweight, you are a victim of genuine bullying, not the current look at someone cross-eyed its bullying kind, you are not good looking enough, the girls who are your age have no attraction to you, you have facial blemishes that border on the disfiguring, you don’t like your school, your teacher(s) the dean, the gym teachers the coach, your father, your mother is a problem because she’s too strict, he drinks, they don’t make enough money, your younger brother / sister is annoying, problematic gets all the attention, your older brother / sister is mean, picks on you, victimizes you, you can’t afford the same type of things that other kids in your school have, you can’t get the grades you’re parents, teachers everyone else expect you to get, you can’t afford the car you are hoping for at 15, 16, 17 in fact you can’t even afford the fee for driver’s education, and so on. If I’ve left a problem out, you add it because what I’ll say will cover that too. Here’s the overall thing. It will get better, I can virtually guarantee that. And that will be in a comparatively short time. Tomorrow you will be 24 and the following day you will be 30, so now is your time to do the one overall thing that will ensure it gets better. That one thing is learn. First learn to control your temper, urges and compulsions. Sometimes its hard but you can do it if you practice. Start with making an effort to forgive the people who offend you, especially your teachers. If they’re rude, unfair, foolish or just plain unreasonable - forgive them, chalk it up and do your best in that class anyway. Don’t argue, don’t talk back unless its really really necessary and there’s a rule of thumb about that. Its only necessary 1 out of every 7 times you think its necessary. Had I done that at your age I would have done much much better. I missed many many opportunties because I would not conform. I was wrong because it wasn’t my time to refuse to cooperate against unreasonable authority figures or to be a non-conformist and it isn’t your time either. That comes later. The girls don’t like you. So what? Girls your age usually have relatively poor judgment anyway. I have a rule about this and that rule is optional. I include it here because eventually it saved me from a wasted unsuccessful, unhappy and probably very short life. At about your age, maybe a little later but not much I decided that I would only be interested in girls who were smarter than me or better than me or both. Now, as you can imagine while there were lots of girls smarter than me and quite a few who were better, there weren’t many of those who were interested in me so that rule narrowed the field down considerably, very considerably. Every time that I made exceptions to that rule I shortly ended up being sorry I had. The girl who eventually had the misfortune to end up with me, saved me and helped me make the decisions necessary to weather more than one life and death crisis, time and again. Pick up a hobby and get really really good at it, without showing anyone or bragging about it. Personally I like and used card manipulation (I was never very good at coin magic). Never ever show off. Don’t be the guy who has to show all the girls or the guys his latest trick. But once in awhile, when no one knows what you can do, and there’s a deck of cards around, deal the girl you the have a crush on a hand. Here’s a routine I used . You may like it (or you may not) Deal the girl you have a crush on (or the girl you have your eye on) 4 sevens, the guy she has a crush on (there’s always someone and its never you) 4 deuces and deal yourself a royal flush. Show his cards first and say anyone who got that hand would think themselves lucky but sometimes fate is different. Tell her and him, you don’t know how these things happen but the cards are mysterious and they never lie, but sometimes they take a hand. Then turn over her cards, showing her hand beats him and then slowly turn over your cards one by one, saying but when they do you can never be sure who wins and who loses it all depends upon who fate wants to look good and show her (and him) the royal flush, laugh and say to the guy, You know, if I saw that hand you hand I would have dropped, but out but it just shows you, you can’t tell who wins in the end. . Then say to the girl - You know they show the people who have some kind of connection that they usually think alike. Then ask her to pick out four cards without showing them to you, take them back, shuffle them and deal out the four she picked in front of her. Tell her that was fate and put the cards away. There’s a reverse caveat to this routine that I sort of like better and that’s the one I used when it was important. It avoids looking like you are showing off against the guy she seems to like over you. The best hand goes to the girl, the worst hand to the guy and the second best hand ( the four 7’s) to you. Same beginning patter to him, but you then turn over your cards second, altering that part to to say - You can never be sure who fate will choose to win when fate decides to take a hand, no matter what cards are dealt, the one thing to depend upon is that fate usually favors the pure of heart (don’t complement her appearance but her character) and slowly turn over the cards revealing her royal flush. This makes it look like you weren’t really talking about yourself when you turned over your cards - you were really talking about her and that you think she’s pure of heart and perfect in character. For some reason a lot of girls like this kind of thing. If you are overweight, resolve to stop eating sugar, bread, pasta, rice, vegetables (yes initially and for several months vegetables too - you wont get scurvy). Eliminate all carbohydrates and starch, and go high high high on protein and fat. Believe me it works. In three or four days, you stop craving for ice cream, cake, mashed potatoes. You’ll lose the weight. If you’re weaker than the other boys, resolve to build some muscle, now is the time. It doesn’t matter how short (or tall you are). I hated weight training. If you can tolerate it do so, its best. But if you can’t or for some reason have no access to even dumbbells - here’s the thing- do pushups. That’s really all you need. Start with 5, 10, 15, 20 - whatever you can do with just a little stress, 1 set twice a day every day but Sunday for a week than add 2 more or 5 more. Do that again for a week - twice a day and then add another 2 or 5. Keep going until you reach 130 or 150 (1 hundred is a milestone). Then you do 1 set of one hundred every day, day in day out and branch out with other exercises little by little as you feel the motivation to ( and you will be motivated). At that point you will be strong and you will look different. If you can train a martial art. I would like to recommend Karate but I can’t. Its almost all garbage today. Train judo or brazilian ju jitsu if you have a chance or join the school wrestling team if you can. Again, training the martial art is private. Dont be the jerk who is always showing off, or the guy everyone call ju jitsu joe. Just train (hard) and plan to achieve black belt by 19 or 20. Do the best you can to keep your grades up. Some kids are very bright and even though everyone thinks they really could be the valedictorian if they applied themselves, but they’re too lazy. That’s usually completely wrong. The real probem isn’t that they’re lazy. They can’t concentrate, or they can’t force themselves to do the work even when they think they ought to, and they want to. If that’s you start fixing it now. How? You fix this problem like every other tough problem, slowly and incrementally. Start with small kind of boring intellectual tasks and work through them. Do one assignment or one page of the assignment. Read the first half or the first quarter of the math chapter text book until you get it, or just do that with one formula you don’t understand. If you do that over and over, your ability to perform will invariably increase. Do the best you can in school. Get as much education as you can. Go to the best school you can afford. Do not be discouraged or influenced by the crazy political beliefs of your teachers or professors. Keep most of your political beliefs to yourself. You are a student not a politician. Don’t be a student activist, be a student. If you want to be an activist, or you want to save the porpoises, or teach the pygmies in the Belgian Congo how to do something or other, do that stuff after you complete your education. Don’t be influenced by politically activist professors to join social activist groups. The professor’s job is to teach you a subject not to indoctrinate you. None of them are gurus even if they act like they are or think they are. Teachers and professors can have a positive influence on you but they can have a negative one too. Don’t let that happen. In line with that idea - Always always always think for yourself. Do not go along with a crowd. The difference between a crowd and mob is the following - there is no difference. You may not always be able to stand up for what you think is right. You certainly wont at 14 and you shouldn’t. But don’t let yourself think wrong is right because your friends claim its right when you know its wrong. Unfortunately, at some point along, after you have stopped being a kid and become an adult (or even before you fully become an adult) there will probably come a day when its up to you to make a life and death decision for people you are responsible for and if you make a mistake, if you listen to the wrong expert or even if there’s only expert when you shouldn’t, everyone’s life changes, someone everyone depends upon will not longer be there and utter catastrophe is going to follow. It will be up to you and no one but you to stand up and make the right decision. Believe me that isn’t easy. When that happens you really really really will want to be as prepared and ready to make those decisions as its possible to make, because I can assure you with absolute certainty, if you make the wrong choice, you will never forget and you will never forgive yourself - not even decades later. So here’s what you do about that. You do the best you can now to ensure that if and when that time comes, you are as prepared as you can be. You are knowlegeable, strong and quietly firm, and willing to either ask questions or if all else fails, step in. You don’t let yourself become the kind of guy who says - well I don’t understand that stuff Doc, my sister, my brother who’s flying in, my cousin the nurse, my good friend Guiseppe will make it for me. How do you do that? You do as well as you can now, not later in school, you soak up knowledge in history, science, math. You complete your education. If you go into a trade, master that trade. You make yourself physically strong even if you are weak and kind of sickly now. You start now to develop good habits, not weak habits and you begin now to break the bad habits you have. You start now to associate and make friends with people who have good character traits and good habits and slowly distance yourself from friends who make poor choices, who are dishonest, self centered, use intoxicants to the point they intentionally get drunk, high, impaired. Who think a good time is getting drunk, who look to party, get in fights, get over on the weak, the unsuspecting. You make yourself intellectually strong by beginning now to learn how listen and analyze no matter what the subject and no matter how complex it seems, so that later on you can listen and analyze properly when everything (and I do mean everything) depends on you. Believe me the ability to know when you have to stand up when every one else is going another way isn’t easy. There’s a world of difference from knowing when you have to make the decision and being the iconoclastic argumentative moron who by habit never goes along with anything especially when its important. Its just as important to not fall into the much much easier trap of going along with everyone else especially when everyone’s frightened when the whole group or the family is in a real crisis, and no one’s sure what to do so everyone’s grasping at straws, and no one’s asking the experts the questions that really really really need to asked. To be able to do that you must start now. Unfortunately, when I was much older than you I had to make those kinds of choices on several occasions. Fortunately I was able make the right choices and things worked out even though at each time they looked pretty pretty bad . If a self-centered jerk like me can learn to do that, you certainly can and you should. And lastly here’s the thing. No dope. No drugs. No beer / no booze parties (a glass of beer isn’t what I’m talking about), No marijuana. Yes yes I know it ubiquous, which means its everywhere. Doesn’t matter. Nothing absolutely nothing good comes from that stuff. I’m an old guy. I’ve heard lots of stuff, confirmed and unconfirmed. I’ve never ever heard anyone claim that something good came from using that stuff. But I’ve heard the opposite over and over and over and over. There are community outreach centers for recovering people to hang out in just about every community today. They’re not there for no reason. That’s my advice to a 14 year old. You are free to disregard it."},{"instruction":"w simple is bricklaying compared to other building trades?","output":"It all really depends on a specific person. All trades are easy for a person with an above average intelligence. Once you have the basic level muscle memory skills down, then the body of knowledge for any of the building trades is not all that wide. At the same time, most people are not above average and learn by repetition. They struggle to understand theory or synthesize new knowledge based on existing.

Errr. Simply, this is not true. While the majority of watches and clocks use the Arabic numerals (and you might ask yourself why they are called “Arabic” and not “English”), we have plenty of examples of timepieces using Roman numerals. Cartier for example, is quite famous for its use of this distinctive kind of numeration on the dials, but it is not the only one. Other civilizations, apart from the Westerners, have used their alphabet to write numbers onto the dials. For example, this is a Japanese pocket watch. This instead is a beautiful Breguet-made quarter repeater watch with Turkish numerals: And this one instead has Hebrew numerals. This watch is also significant, as it has been recovered from the wreck of the Titanic: This one instead is much more recent. It is an HMT with Farsi numerals: Not only this: some dials have mixed systems, featuring Cyrillic inscriptions: And to close, many Western watches have been made for the Chinese market. So, as you can readily see, people around the world have used every kind of numerals to mark the hours on dials. However, as I explain in more detail in my book, The Watch Manual (direct link in my bio, you can download an 8-chapter sample for free), watchmaking has historically developed around the Western markets from the 1500s onwards. This is why watches have traditionally been exported to other countries which used different alphabets and numeric notations than what we use in the West. These nations came to use watches much later than what we did. Precisely, the first watches were introduced in the East (that is, the Chinese and Japanese markets) by commercial expeditions in the beginning of the 1700s - 200 years after watches had been invented. Some of these watches were personalized, as you can see above, but many were not, as almost every nation on Earth has started using numbers in the more practical Arabic format to facilitate interchange of data between each other, especially for commerce. We should remember that Arabic numbers are not used in watches only to mark the hours: they have much more practical uses which are shared by every country, and this is the real reason why we see Arabic numerals used everywhere in the world.

Students can create their own work, which they can then present to the class. They can also interact with each other in a way that allows them to learn how to communicate and share ideas with one another. The main disadvantage of teaching with technology is that it requires a lot of effort on the part of both the teacher and student, who are both responsible for maintaining their device or computer while they are in class. This can become tiring after an hour or two, so it's important for teachers to set aside time every day where students can recharge their devices before class begins again. Overall, I think teaching with technologies is a great way for teachers to reach out to students who might otherwise not have access to traditional educational opportunities.\\""},{"instruction":"NFL continues to drop in Nielsen ratings for playoffs 2023, down 9.46% almost double digits.

Assuming you have no previous experience, it’s a good idea in the beginning to also decide if your interest lies in back end or front end development. Let me briefly explain the difference. Frontend — this is what the end user see’s and interacts with on the page. Its all the design, fancy effects, layout and imagery that creates the user experience. Generally front end developers will be visual creatives with excellent design skills and a passion for accessibility and user experience. Technologies often associated with front end web development are HTML, CSS, jQuery and JavaScript. Backend — this is the part that typically processes, stores, and manipulates data. It’s how the website or application works. Back-end developers are generally good problem solvers, logical thinkers who are interested in the functionality of a website or application.

This is only if you meet the following criteria: You're not in a hurry to lease a carYou don't intend to buy the car after the lease endsWhen the lease is up you don't need to lease another vehicle right awayYou want to lease a luxury car (BMW, MB, Audi, etc).You're ok with a short term lease (my opinion is one year or less)You're ok with a 1 or 2 year old model Assuming a lease could be a win-win situation. On one hand you have someone desperate to get rid of the lease. It could be due to financial reasons or it could be that they screwed the car up and don't want to pay extra fees at lease end. I don't think lessees of luxury vehicles are that nefarious - they usually take good care of their cars. However review the Carfax and if there is any damage that the dealer would charge for then steer clear. They likely made a large down payment and have good credit to get the lease payment lower - you can use this to your advantage. The lessee may also offer additional incentives to get rid of the lease - for example if they owe 6,000 on the lease they might pay you 1000 to sweeten the deal. You might be able to negotiate more. For example I assumed a lease of a 2013 BMW 535i xDrive for 600/month. It had 10 out of the 36 months remaining. 18K out of the 30K miles left on the lease. The MSRP was 65K and the guy put down 8,500 to get the payment to 600 per month. I was able to get the guy to pay the lease transfer fee (600) and the disposal fee (350). I paid 100 for the credit check fee. I did not have to pay a down payment, the guy wasn't looking for me to pay him the down payment and no need to spend hours at the dealership. The assumption process took about a month so in reality I leased the car for 9 months. I didn't even have to bring the car in for maintenance as the next scheduled was for 30,000 miles and I turned it in with about 29,900 miles. So for 9 months I got to experience driving a BMW - and I drove the hell out of it. While it was a great car it was just too big. Thank goodness I did not sign a 3 year lease! At the end of the lease I pretty much parked the car at the local BMW dealer and handed the keys to the salesman. He looked at the car for 2 minutes said there was no additional cost for damage, I said cool and signed the inspection form. Then I took the bus to work. Since I did not need a replacement car right away - I also own a 2002 Mazda Protege5 - this deal worked out for me. If and when I have some disposable income and I want to spend said money on a car I'll hunt for a good lease assumption deal."},{"instruction":"What do teenagers wish adults understood?","output":"Pubg is not a dangerous gameWe can’t play a game for just 1 hrStop asking us not to talk to opposite genderDon’t get involved too much in our personal lives we need some privacy tooLet us buy our own clothesstop saying your generation is best.We don’t want to be doctors or engineers.we are not immatureIf we prove a point stop saying we are arrogant"},{"instruction":"it true that Lord Shiva is not mentioned in the Vedas?","output":"Which other lord is mentioned in Vedas…??

These genes which lead to interpersonal violence, human sacrifice, inherited nobility, slavery, warfare, and genocide were spread from Northwest Europe throughout the world by Maritime Cultures. The violent behavior of these Early European Farmers is represented in the Book of Genesis by Biblical Cain. The meaning of the word “cain” is “spear” or “spear bearer”, which is the same meaning as the word “german”, and it is possible to recognize the behavior of warfare using spears which European Canaanites engaged in as a trait inherited from Neanderthals who hunted using spears in Northern Europe over 400,000 years ago. The spread of paganism was accompanied by the symbol of the swastika (the “Mark of Cain”), dolmen construction, pyramid construction, an obsession with lethal weapons, a preference for the color of fresh blood, inherited nobility, social stratification, slavery, human sacrifice, warfare, and elite burials which contain weapons, rich grave goods, and red ocher. This culture originated among mammoth hunters of Sunghir Russia who carried Neanderthal genes over 34,000 years ago, and spread into Scandinavia and Northern Europe after the extinction of the mammoth. 4,750 years ago, the descendants of the builders of the first civilizations in Eastern Anatolia had migrated into Southern and Western Europe. These people built Stonehenge in Britain. But when construction of Stonehenge was completed, these people vanished from Britain and Europe. These people were replaced by Bell Beaker people, Maritime Culture from Northern Europe that used the symbol of the swastika. This occurred at the time that the Egyptians began to construct the Pyramids of Giza. It is reasonable to assume that the Bell Beaker people of Northern Europe carried the builders of Stonehenge across the Mediterranean to become the slaves of Egypt. 3,600 years ago, the volcano Thera erupted in the Mediterranean. This eruption created the plagues of Egypt mentioned in the Book of Exodus. Volcanic activity has been known to create all of the conditions associated with the plagues of Egypt, turning water blood red, blocking out the sun for three days, spreading ash over the land, raining down fire from the sky, creating a pillar of smoke by day and a pillar of fire by night, and creating powerful tsunamis that would have parted the seas before delivering a destructive wave of water and widespread flooding. Biblical text would suggest that this volcanic eruption was the event which led to the Exodus of the slaves of Egypt. After this volcanic eruption, a civilization called Terramare came to be inherited in Northern Italy. The design and construction of these villages in Terramare, which were aligned with the cardinal directions, were contained inside walls built in the shape of a square, contained homes that were the same size and design, and had a central communal building in the center of the village, would suggest that Terramare was inhabited by the former slaves of Egypt, the descendants of the people who constructed Stonehenge and Gobekli Tepe. The return of these former slaves of Egypt to Europe changed Europe from a land of savage pagans to a land of cultured civilizations."},{"instruction":"What high protein Indian vegetarian food sources are available for people that go to the gym and want to bulk up while also losing fat?","output":"Are you going on a diet along with your gym routine?

As a frequent visitor to Toronto, Ontario, I’ve noticed that in the parking-challenged metro area, many fire hydrants are set well back from the curb, some by over 20 feet! A couple of times, I’ve scored a great parking place only to be dismayed upon noticing the hydrant hiding back among protruding porches, planters, and benches. Someone easily could have missed it. In these cases it is my opinion that if the hydrant is not easily visible from the street, and its use in case of fire is not obstructed by the person parking “in front” of it, then there should be no infraction for parking in that spot. Longtime residents, however, inform me that this argument has been made before, and gotten nowhere with the Justice of the Peace."},{"instruction":"Why is aloe poisonous to cats?","output":"There are several house plants that can be harmful to cats if ingested.

While it's important to note that cryptocurrency investments come with their own set of risks and challenges, they also present a unique chance to generate substantial returns on your investment. First and foremost, it's crucial to clarify that investing in cryptocurrencies is legal in most countries. Despite some concerns and misconceptions surrounding the industry, many governments have recognized the legitimacy and potential of cryptocurrencies. In fact, numerous countries have even introduced regulations and frameworks to ensure a safer environment for investors. Now, let's dive into the benefits of investing in cryptocurrencies. One of the most enticing aspects is the potential for significant profits. The crypto market has witnessed remarkable growth over the past decade, with some cryptocurrencies experiencing exponential price increases. This has resulted in life-changing returns for early adopters and investors who recognized the potential of this digital asset class. Moreover, the cryptocurrency market operates 24/7, allowing investors to trade at any time convenient for them. Unlike traditional stock markets that have specific trading hours, cryptocurrencies can be bought or sold at any moment, providing greater flexibility and accessibility. Additionally, investing in cryptocurrencies offers a level of diversification for your investment portfolio. By allocating a portion of your funds to cryptocurrencies, you can potentially mitigate risks associated with traditional investments such as stocks or real estate. This diversification can help protect your overall wealth and potentially enhance your returns. Furthermore, the crypto community is constantly evolving and innovating. New projects and technologies are emerging regularly, presenting new investment opportunities. If you keep yourself informed and stay up-to-date with market trends and developments, you can identify promising projects that align with your investment goals. However, it's important to acknowledge that investing in cryptocurrencies also comes with its fair share of risks. The volatility of the crypto market can lead to sudden price fluctuations, and there have been instances of scams and fraudulent activities within the industry. Therefore, it's crucial to exercise caution, conduct thorough research, and invest only what you can afford to lose. In conclusion, investing in cryptocurrencies can be a worthwhile endeavor for those willing to take on the associated risks. It's a legal and legitimate way to potentially make substantial profits. However, it's essential to approach this investment avenue with a well-informed and cautious mindset. By staying informed, diversifying your portfolio, and understanding the risks involved, you can navigate the crypto market and potentially reap the benefits it has to offer.

How would they be governed, what would the life look like in each, and what would be their culture?","output":"An alternate reality where the earth is composed of countries from the internet? I’m going to assume that each of them is a superpower in their own right. So I’ll leave that out for the most part. Quora wouldn’t exactly be a technocratic country, but would generally fall within that category due to the lack of a better fitting word. The country would be ruled by intelligence. These “technical experts” aren’t chosen by their own educational qualifications, but rather by the people. The more votes you have, the more notoriety and freedom you have to state your own opinions. Reddit is a dictatorship (- ish), though not in the way you’d expect. The leader, Snoo, happens to be the face of this country. He encourages opinion from everyone within the borders, whether they be foreign or not. Giving the people a chance to express their opinions on the current Reddit legislation openly, and elicit friendly discussion about particular political topics. 4chan would be an autonomous and anarchistic country. Their capital, /4/, is a place where the most unsolicited activity is found. 4chan encourages anonymity— to the point where it is almost impossible to register yourself for things such as driving licenses and even birth/death certificates. YouTube, like 4chan, YouTube would also be an autonomous and anarchistic country, having no real restraint on what they can and cannot do. Of course there are peace keepers, but most of them can be bought if the bribe is high enough. If they were to take the time to sit down and intimately review criminal acts, then maybe the country would be cleaner— smaller infractions are given harsher punishments if the person themselves is someone of low status, if they’re of high status then most can get away with higher tier criminal activity. Steam would govern under a communistic political and economic system, but differ as Steam doesn’t own most of their countries assets.

His impact on German World War I generals was as a model. Frederick moved decisively and rapidly to defeat enemy forces. He also planned his campaigns well. A good example of Frederick-like German generals in World War I is Generals Hindenburg and Ludendorf and their masterful 1914 Tannenburg campaign against the Russians. First, they concentrated against and annihilated Russian General Samsonov’s army. Then, they did the same to Russian General Rennenkampf’s army. They kept the two Russian armies apart and destroyed each in turn. The Russian strategic campaign orders did not help. The two Russian armies did not coordinate their actions. But the Germans did not know these conditions. So, King Frederick the Great’s impact on that battle was dramatic.

Beyond mere chance, sports betting requires a strategic approach that maximizes your chances of success over the long term. First and foremost, research is paramount. A thorough understanding of the sports, teams, players, and historical data is essential to making informed predictions. Analyze statistics, injury reports, team dynamics, and other relevant factors to guide your bets. Developing a clear strategy, whether focusing on a specific sport, type of bet, or particular markets, can provide a structured approach to your betting endeavors. Additionally, responsible bankroll management is crucial. Establish a budget for your betting activities and avoid chasing losses. Successful sports bettors do not wager more than they can afford to lose and carefully divide their bankroll among different bets to minimize risk. Patience is another virtue; avoid impulsive bets and instead wait for favorable opportunities based on your analysis. In the realm of online sports betting, platforms like Fun888 offer a range of sports and betting options, enhancing the excitement of the experience. With a user-friendly interface and a variety of markets, Fun888 can be a suitable choice for enthusiasts. However, always remember that responsible gambling is key. Promote a balanced approach, focusing on enjoying the process of betting while keeping the potential for profit in perspective. In conclusion, successful sports betting requires a blend of strategic thinking, data analysis, and responsible bankroll management. Platforms like [LINKED_TEXT: Fun888] [URL: https://theweddingbrigade.com/] can provide an engaging platform for your betting activities, but it's vital to approach sports betting with knowledge, discipline, and a realistic perspective on both the risks and rewards."},{"instruction":"Why are Democrats afraid of Christians?","output":"Christians are the ones who are afraid.

Monthly payments are usually lower because you’re not paying back any principal. Instead, you’re just borrowing and repaying the difference between the car’s value when new and the car’s residual, its expected value when the lease ends plus finance charges. In the end, leasing usually costs you more than an equivalent loan because you’re paying for the car during the time when it is most rapidly depreciating. If you lease one car after another, monthly payments go on forever. By contrast, the longer you keep a vehicle after the loan is paid off, the more value you get out of it. Over the long term, the cheapest way to drive is to buy a car and keep it until it’s uneconomical to repair. Lease contracts specify a limited number of miles. If you go over that limit, you’ll have to pay an excess mileage penalty. That can range from 10 cents to as much as 50 cents for every additional mile. So be sure to calculate how much you plan to drive. You don’t get a credit for unused miles. If you don’t maintain the vehicle in good condition, you’ll have to pay excess wear-and-tear charges when you turn it in. So if your kids are apt to go wild with Magic Markers or you’re a magnet for parking lot dents and dings, be prepared to pay extra. If you decide that you don’t like the car or if you can’t afford the payments, it might cost you. You will probably be stuck with thousands of dollars in early termination [LINKED_TEXT: car accessories] [URL: https://lushfully.store/] fees and penalties if you get out of a lease early and they’ll all be due at once.

Cold-blooded, calm and evil, but still charming. No-nonsense. Real-life: INTJ: Hangs out with good friends. Speaks a lot on things they are interested in. Probably has a messy bedroom. DOES NOT, I repeat, DOES NOT ALWAYS PLAN FOR WORLD DOMINION. ENTJ: Isn’t the leader of a terrorist group. Nice people in general, not evil, charming and is practically made of jokes. Unless they are the CEO. The difference is that the ENTJ has a lot of energy around with people, especially extroverts. INTJ doesn’t have as much energy, but has a aura of quiet calm energy. ENTJ has friends all the time and can handle small talk with ease, INTJ has few but true friends and barely survives small talk. ENTJ likes being the leader, while INTJ is voted the leader. ENTJ makes everyone laugh, INTJ makes everyone think. ENTJs are usually living in the present, while INTJs live in their own world due to Ni dom. Still can’t decide?

It is within the vast tapestry of Eastern philosophies that we find the exploration of the immanence and transcendence of the Divine. Eastern traditions, such as Hinduism and Buddhism, often depict the divine in both personal and impersonal forms. Recognizing the inherent diversity of human spiritual experiences, these philosophies allow for a range of paths, acknowledging that individuals may seek solace in a personal connection with a deity while simultaneously perceiving the divine as transcendent and ineffable. They suggest that this personal relationship can act as a stepping stone for the realization of the ultimate truth of the ineffable nature of God. Similarly, Theosophical ideas of God encompass a multifaceted understanding of the Divine. Theosophy posits the concept of a universal consciousness, from which all phenomena emanate. Within this framework, the personal relationship with a deity can be seen as a means to access the divine essence, the ultimate reality that transcends human comprehension. Such a relationship may serve as a bridge, fostering a deeper understanding of the ineffable Nature of God. Ultimately, these philosophies invite individuals to engage in a synergistic exploration of the personal and impersonal aspects of the divine. They propose that while a personal relationship with a deity can provide solace and insight, it is imperative to hold space for the recognition that the Divine surpasses human conceptualization. It is through maintaining this delicate balance that one can embark upon a profound spiritual journey, anchoring both the personal and the transcendent aspects of the divine in their quest for truth and enlightenment."},{"instruction":"f a job is still being advertised 4 months after you were rejected, and you think you are qualified for it, would you reapply?","output":"Depending on your industry, some job postings are for jobs that don’t actually exist.

Why are people not watching NFL? Is it rigged?","output":"Your question is all over the place so lets break it down. You are right that viewership for the playoff games on Saturday & Sunday was down almost 10% from last year. However, the Cowboys vs 49ers game in 2022 had about 40 million viewers. This year Dallas played on Monday night and wasn’t included in those numbers but the MNF game had the largest audience for an ESPN/Disney playoff game with 31.6 million. You asked why are people not watching? They are. The average viewership for each game was over 28 million with three of them over 30 million. By contrast, the college football playoff championship had 22 million viewers. The top non-football primetime show was 60 Minutes which had 11.29 million. The number one primetime show was the Chiefs/Steelers game with 28.94 million. The NFL is still by far the most popular sport in viewership. The last part of your question was “Is it rigged?” Not sure how it relates to tv viewership. I think it is an absurd question. Exactly how could you rig the sport and how many people would have to be involved in rigging it. There would have to be a lot of people involved and could they really keep that secret? Most of all, what would be the reason for rigging the game and who would benefit. The NFL already makes billions of dollars and the athletes are signing bigger and bigger contracts. There is no need to rig the games but there is a big reason not to. If the games were rigged and the proof was exposed, those billions of dollars would no longer be there.

Swing trading is a trading strategy where investors buy a [LINKED_TEXT: stock] [URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-stock] or some other asset and hold it — known as holding a position — for a short period (usually between a few days and up to several weeks) in the hopes of turning a profit. The goal of the swing trader is to capture a portion of any potential price movement or \\"swing\\" in the market. Individual [LINKED_TEXT: gains] [URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/what-are-capital-gains] may be smaller as the trader focuses on short-term trends and seeks to cut losses quickly. However, small gains achieved consistently over time can add up to an attractive annual return. How does swing trading work? The swing trader analyzes patterns in trading activity to buy or sell a stock to capitalize on price movements and momentum trends of stocks, typically, focusing on large-cap stocks since they are the most heavily traded. Because these stocks have high trading volumes, they offer investors insight into how the market perceives the company and their security's price movements. This active trading offers the information necessary for what's called [LINKED_TEXT: technical analysis] [URL: https://www.unififorex.com/calculator.php], which we'll cover in the next section. As with any style of trading, swing trading carries plenty of risks. Swing traders are exposed to several types of risk, the most common being gap risk, where a security's price rises or falls significantly based on news or events that occur while the market is closed, whether overnight or during a weekend. The opening price will reflect the shock of any unexpected news. The longer the market is closed, the greater the risk. Abrupt changes in the market's direction also pose a risk, and swing traders may miss out on longer-term trends by focusing on shorter holding periods. Example of swing trading Let's take a look at a real-world example of how a swing trader may analyze Amazon's stock and determine when to buy or sell. The candlestick chart above illustrates the \\"cup and handle\\" consolidation pattern, where the cup is u-shaped and the handle points slightly downward. This pattern is considered a bullish signal. If a swing trader wants to make a profitable trade in Amazon, they would likely purchase the stock at the top of the \\"cup,\\" at or above the most recent high of 3,555. They should place a stop-loss order at the most recent low in the cup handle (3,395). Therefore, the risk — the maximum loss on the trade — is 160 (3,555 - 3,395 = 160). At the recommended reward/risk ratio of 3:1, which is considered good, you'd need to sell at 480 (3 x 160 = 480) above the entry price, or 4,035 (3,555 + 480). Why risk management is critical in swing trading Risk management is the most essential component in a successful swing trading strategy. Traders should choose only [LINKED_TEXT: liquid stocks] [URL: https://www.unififorex.com/liquidity.php] and diversify positions among different sectors and capitalizations. Mike Dombrowski, head of capital markets at Inter Prime Technologies, emphasizes the importance of risk management, saying that \\"each position should be roughly 2%-5% of total trading account capital. The most aggressive and professional traders may go up to 10% per position. That means a portfolio of five concentrated swing trades would represent 10%-25% of total trading account capital on average. Having cash in reserve allows you to add to the best-performing trades to help generate larger winners. As always, the key to swing trading is to minimize losses.\\" He also notes that a desirable reward/risk ratio is 3:1, or 3 times the amount at risk. Stop-loss orders are a vital tool in managing risk. When a stock falls below the stop price (or rises above the stop price for a short position), the stop-loss order converts to a market order, which is executed at the market price. With stop losses in place, the trader knows exactly how much capital is at risk because the risk of each position is limited to the difference between the [LINKED_TEXT: current price] [URL: https://www.unififorex.com/calender.php] and the stop price. A stop loss is an effective way to manage risk per trade Swing trading strategies Traders can deploy many strategies to determine when to buy and sell based on technical analysis, including: Moving averages look for bullish or bearish crossover pointsSupport and resistance triggersMoving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) crossoversUsing the Fibonacci retracement pattern, which identifies support and resistance levels and potential reversals Traders also use moving averages to determine the support (lower) and resistance (upper) levels of a price range. While some use a simple moving average (SMA), an exponential moving average (EMA) places more emphasis on recent data points. For example, a trader may use 9-, 13- and 50-day EMAs to look for crossover points. When the stock price moves above, or \\"crosses\\" the moving averages, this signals an upward trend in price. When a stock price falls below the EMAs, it's a bearish signal and the trader should exit long positions and potentially put on shorts. Market extremes make swing trading more challenging. In a bull or bear market, actively traded stocks do not exhibit the same up-and-down movements within a range as they do in more stable market conditions. Momentum will propel the market up or down for an extended period. \\"[Traders should] always trade in the direction of the trend, taking long positions in bull markets and shorts when the markets trend downward,\\" says Dombrowski. Swing trading vs. day trading Swing trading and day trading have many similarities, but the most marked difference is the frequency of trades. Swing traders focus on short-to-medium term positions while day traders close out their positions at the end of each [LINKED_TEXT: trading] [URL: https://www.unififorex.com/platform.php] day. Day trading is a full-time job, requiring the trader to monitor market movements throughout the day and trade frequently. A swing trader can manage and trade on the side while still maintaining a full-time job."},{"instruction":"Why is the microwave oven harmful to food?","output":"When you cook food in a microwave oven, it uses microwaves to generate heat. These microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation, similar to radio waves but with higher frequency. The microwaves cause water molecules in the food to vibrate rapidly, creating heat that cooks the food. One concern people have is whether microwaves can harm our bodies or make food less nutritious. The good news is that microwave ovens are designed to contain microwaves, so they don't leak out and expose us to harmful levels of radiation. As long as the microwave is in good working condition and not damaged, it should be safe to use. In terms of nutrition, any cooking method, including microwave cooking, can cause some loss of nutrients in food. However, the actual amount of nutrient loss depends on factors like cooking time, temperature, and the type of food being cooked. Generally, shorter cooking times and minimal use of water can help preserve more nutrients. But it's important to remember that all cooking methods, including traditional ones like boiling or frying, can affect the nutritional content of food to some extent. To minimize any potential health risks and nutrient loss when using a microwave, here are a few tips: Use microwave-safe containers: Make sure the containers you use in the microwave are labeled as microwave-safe to avoid any harmful chemicals leaching into your food.Follow cooking instructions: Pay attention to recommended cooking times and power levels mentioned in the recipe or on food packaging. Overcooking in the microwave can lead to nutrient loss.Stir or rotate the food: Microwaves heat food unevenly, so stirring or rotating the food during cooking helps distribute the heat more evenly and prevents hot spots.Use minimal water: When steaming vegetables or reheating leftovers with liquid, use as little water as possible. This helps retain more nutrients compared to using excess water.Let it stand: After microwaving, let the food stand for a short period. This allows for additional heat distribution and helps ensure the food is cooked thoroughly. In conclusion, when used correctly, microwave ovens are generally safe and convenient for cooking or reheating food. By following proper guidelines and using microwave-safe containers, you can enjoy the benefits of quick and efficient cooking while minimizing any potential health risks. Hope this helps"},{"instruction":"Why has Labour lost its fourth general election in a row?","output":"Ultimately, because the free market works better than socialism. The first election of the four is just an election to start counting from; the question has to start from an initial Labour loss. The last two elections of the four were all about Brexit, and Labour was sort of neutral on Brexit, so they couldn’t win those. The second of the four elections was the only one that Labour could have won. So why did Labour lose that second election? It’s because Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats was in the coalition and prevented the Conservatives from diving off the austerity cliff with the rest of the EU in the aftermath of the financial crisis, instead managing what passes in Europe for a free market friendly small government approach. As a result, the UK managed to avoid the continued economic disaster of the rest of the EU, and the Conservatives, as the senior member of the coalition, were able to claim credit for it and win an outright majority in the next election. If socialism actually worked, the UK would have done worse than the rest of Europe, and Labour would have been swept into office.

As advertised, the pact between the Liberals and NDP will grant Canadian federal politics a degree of stability contrasting favourably with the present situation concerning Alberta provincial politics. Indeed, governance in Wild Rose Country has been overshadowed by Premier Kenney’s impending political execution for some time already. Viewing this more cynically, however, the pact suggests something else in my estimation: that neither Singh or Trudeau will be party leaders by autumn 2025. Reality is that the Liberals will never again obtain majority government status with Justin as party leader, and the pact is an acknowledgement of this. Similarly, Jagmeet may appear a king maker in the eyes of some, but the NDP’s current political status compares poorly with what it was a decade ago. The ultimate aim of any political party, after all, is forming the government, not propping up one of another party. That the NDP remains constantly broke speaks volumes as well. The oher consequence of the pact between the Liberals and NDP is that it basically renders the CPC party membership race a moot point at this juncture. Once more stressing the positive, this may also provide conservatives with a chance at better defining themselves before October 2025.

They have a deep sense of self-awareness and are unafraid to embrace their true selves, flaws and all. They do not pretend to be someone they are not or put on a facade to please others. Instead, they show up as their genuine selves, allowing others to see and connect with the real person behind the mask. Genuine people also possess a strong moral compass and consistently act in alignment with their values. They treat others with kindness, empathy, and respect, and they genuinely care about the well-being of others. Their words and actions are consistent, and they always strive to be honest and transparent in their interactions. Ultimately, genuine people inspire those around them to be authentic as well, creating an environment of trust, acceptance, and genuine connection.

Deficits almost always have gone down when Republicans control the branch of government responsible for making the budget. True when Republicans gained control of congress for the very first time from 1861–1875 the deficits exploded for those first five years. We had a little thing called the Civil War. But it went back down after that, and was slightly smaller in 1875, than when they first came into power: The next time they controlled both houses of Congress from 1889–1891, they ran a surplus for the entire period: The next time they controlled both houses of congress was from 1895–1911. Deficits did increase for the first three years or so, but then plummeted for the rest of the period. This time deficits were lower at the end of their tenure then the beginning: The next time they controlled both houses 1919–31 saw an immediate sharp drop in the deficit and and a solid decade+ of balanced budgets: Next time they controlled both houses in 1947–1949, the deficit again drops. Next time with both houses was ‘53–55, again the deficit drops steadily : Democrats would control the House for the next 40 years. The next time Republicans got both house and Senate was 1995–2007. The first first five years deficits dropped, then rose for 4 years, and finally dropped for the last 3 years. Again they left power with a lower deficit then what they came into power with: The final time Republicans had control of the House and Senate was 2015–2019. This was the only time in the history of the party that they had control of both houses and ended with a larger deficit than they began with: Oh, you didn’t mean when Republicans controlled the branch that controls the purse? You meant why has the deficit gone up with the last 6 Republican presidents. Quite possibly for the same reason the Redskins pre-election home-game predicted the presidential winner for 15 straight elections. Six examples of correlation is not that many. Anyone who tries to make some partisan point with such a small data-set is just illustrating they don’t understand, statistics, coincidences, or the relation between causation and correlation. There are countless variables besides the president that affect deficits. This would be true even if the President was the sole person in the government determining the budget.

First from a collection called Kurunthokai from early Tamil writing. A legend on seeing the champion fell head over heels for her. Unexplainable adoration. She likewise felt something very similar. The legend tells to the courageous woman, subsequently: \\"Goodness! What could be my mom and father be to yours? How did you and I meet of all time? The hearts loaded up with affection blended together like the drops of downpour that blend with the red sand on the earth and becomes one and won't be quickly isolated. The second the water blend with the sand no one can isolate the red tone or the sand from the water\\". Like this two hearts blended together and become one. There might be two bodies yet both have just a single broadness. They can not bear the division. Such is the idea of genuine love. Another Scene from a Sanskrit sonnet. This sonnet was a lot of drawn in the incomparable Lord Bhoja who is an exceptionally extraordinary researcher. He cites this sonnet in his well known work named \\"Sarawsathi kandabaranam\\" A companion of the hopeless spouse to the enquiring darling answers his inquiries like this: \\"Could it be said that she is well and happy?\\" \\"She lives\\". \\"I ask you, \\"Is she well?\\".' \\"I have answered, \\"she lives\\".' \\"You are saying exactly the same thing once more\\". \\"Am I to say she is dead when she actually relaxes?\\" Such is the state of his darling spouse. Make Your Relationship: [LINKED_TEXT: Make Your Relationship] [URL: https://makeyourrelationshipwajebul.blogspot.com/2022/09/make-your-relationship.html] The darlings contemplate their association. They embraced each other in the bed room which is their games ground. In the warm hug her bosoms were squeezed, her skin excited. And afterward what was the deal? Between her beautiful thighs, the night dress slipped as the oil-smooth sap of adoration has spilled over. She began murmuring, to her sweetheart, 'Let me rest please,my dear, this wouldn't be the first time. Try not to make me\\". She argues delicately. Once more, she murmurs. The legend began thinking,\\"is she sleeping? Or on the other hand passing on? Or, in all likelihood totally dissolved into my heart? Or on the other hand, am I seeing everything in my fantasy? Is it safe to say that she is a fantasy?\\" The legend is mourning reasoning her cherished sweetheart in this manner: \\"Such are her thighs, her flanks and gut, Such are her bosoms and such her grin, Such her sweet words, her waterlily eyes, the chignon of her hair, Furthermore, such her face, refining drops of magnificence's nectar. Numerous' the time I sit in the contemplation in this way Of a solitary element of my grovel looked at adoration.\\" How might we represent a wonderful lady? Here is a Sanskrit sonnet: \\"Her body is a lake, Her face thereof a lotus and her arms the lotus stems, Her beauty the water and her triple crease the wave.

It is not willing to make the big shifts needed to address the learning needs of 21st century students, which will be the future generation. I have two major problems with the current education system, and two solutions to these problems. The first problem, it is based on the factory model of the industrial era of the USThe second problem, standardized testing doesn’t work for everyone The first major problem that we need to address is the current model of education. It is based off the factory model, which was created in the industrial era. As edX CEO Anant Agarwal says, “It is pathetic that the education system has not changed in hundreds of years.” You may be wondering, what is the factory model? Well, the factory model of education is, according to The Atlantic, “More than 150 years ago, Massachusetts became the first state to provide all of its citizens access to a free public education. Over the next 66 years, every other state made the same guarantee. The result was a publicly funded system where, in every American classroom, groups of about 28 students of roughly the same age are taught by one teacher, usually in an 800 square-foot room. This model has been the dominant archetype ever since.” There are two things wrong with this model. The first: something David Nurenberg from [LINKED_TEXT: Education Week - K-12 education news and information] [URL: http://edweek.org/] dubs “the penguin problem”. There is a teacher, teaching about penguins. He asks, “what is the point of this lesson?” The teacher responds, “to teach the kids about penguins.” Penguins are obviously interesting, yet several minutes on online encyclopedias, you can learn pretty much anything you want to know about penguins. He goes to the teacher, and says “since you can pretty much get all of this information online nowadays, what larger topics or themes could we plug into the project? Animal life cycles? Food webs? Humanity’s impact on other species?” The teacher maintains, “They need to know about penguins,” pointing to the relevant learning standard. Now, students need to learn critical thinking and learning skills, with facts involved. But if those facts aren’t put into context, they are meaningless. According to [LINKED_TEXT: Education Week - K-12 education news and information] [URL: http://edweek.org/], “Yet, too many traditional education models seem built specifically to prevent connections to other topics, subjects, and students’ own lived experiences. Even a simple field trip like a walk around the neighborhood (to teach cartography by mapping familiar places, for instance) requires overcoming tremendous scheduling and permission hurdles.” Students are taught about one subject, but the current model of education doesn’t tie in that subject to any of the other ones taught. You are taught about one subject, then immediately move on to the next, without learning what ties those two subjects together. I recommend changing the way we teach subjects to tie in the other subjects. When we’re learning about penguins for example, teach about how the ecosystem works, the human impact on their life cycles, and how penguins work with other animals in the major biological spectrum. My second problem is standardized testing. Like Einstein said “Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” Standardized tests only determine which students are good at taking tests, they don’t measure progress, and, historically, have not improved student performance. According to [LINKED_TEXT: Homepage - ProCon.org] [URL: http://procon.org/], “Standardized test scores are easily influenced by outside factors: stress, hunger, tiredness, and prior teacher or parent comments about the difficulty of the test, among other factors. In short, the tests only show which students are best at preparing for and taking the tests, not what knowledge students might exhibit if their stomachs weren’t empty.” This is extremely problematic, as tests are supposed to show knowledge. They can’t show knowledge if there are so many things that are influencing the results of the test. Plus, most curriculum is influenced by the school district, not the federal government. There are so many school districts around the country that it would be impossible to judge scores equally. According to [LINKED_TEXT: Welcome to Signet Education | Signet Education] [URL: http://signeteducation.com/], “The stated purpose of standardized testing is to level the playing field for students. Not every school is the same, and while the government dictates grade-level curriculum to some extent, programs still vary widely from school to school. Some schools are generally more rigorous than others, some may offer a broad range of classes, including honors, AP, or IB courses (note that often, the rigorous schools are also the ones that offer students a lot of options).” The federal government needs to take charge on the education system, and make a more state-level curriculum, then make colleges judge based off their state scores, not their SAT or ACT scores. We need to remove the SAT and ACT, then have state tests. In conclusion, there needs to be major reforms on the education system of the US. Based off these two reasons and solutions, I think it’s possible. The people in charge just need to take the steps necessary to change it.

Colonial era [ edit ] New England [ edit ] The first American schools in the thirteen original colonies opened in the 17th century. Boston Latin School was founded in 1635 and is both the first public school and oldest existing school in the United States. [1] The first free taxpayer-supported public school in North America, the Mather School, was opened in Dorchester, Massachusetts, in 1639. [2] [3] \\"Cremin (1970) stresses that colonists tried at first to educate by the traditional English methods of family, church, community, and apprenticeship , with schools later becoming the key agent in \\"socialization.\\" [4] At first, the rudiments of literacy and arithmetic were taught inside the family, assuming the parents had those skills. Literacy rates were much higher in New England because much of the population had been deeply involved in the Protestant Reformation and learned to read in order to read the Scriptures. Literacy was much lower in the South, where the Anglican Church was the established church. Single working-class people formed a large part of the population in the early years, arriving as indentured servants. The planter class did not support public education but arranged for private tutors for their children, and sent some to England at appropriate ages for further education. By the mid-19th century, the role of the schools in New England had expanded to such an extent that they took over many of the educational tasks traditionally handled by parents. [5] [6] First Boston Latin School House All the New England colonies required towns to set up schools, and many did so. In 1642 the Massachusetts Bay Colony made \\"proper\\" education compulsory; other New England colonies followed this example. Similar statutes were adopted in other colonies in the 1640s and 1650s. [7] In the 18th century, \\"common schools\\" were established; students of all ages were under the control of one teacher in one room. Although they were publicly supplied at the local (town) level, they were not free. Students' families were charged tuition or \\"rate bills.\\" Literacy rates are disputed, but one estimate is that at the end of the Colonial era about 80% of males and 50% of females were \\"fully literate,\\" i.e., able to both read and sign their names. [8] The larger towns in New England opened grammar schools, the forerunner of the modern high school. [9] The most famous was the Boston Latin School , which is still in operation as a public high school. As its name implies, the purpose of Boston Latin, and similar later schools, was to teach Latin and the classics, which were required for admission to Harvard College and other Colonial colleges. [10] Hopkins School in New Haven, Connecticut , was another.

At that time, their primary business was mailing DVDs to customers, and the market for physical rentals was gradually declining due to the rise of online streaming and digital content consumption. Anticipating the shift in consumer behavior, Netflix decided to transition from a DVD rental service to a digital streaming platform. This decision was a game-changer that revolutionized the entertainment industry. They started investing heavily in building a vast library of streaming content and expanding their reach to multiple devices, including smartphones, smart TVs, and gaming consoles. The smartest part of their maneuver was that they didn't abandon their DVD rental business immediately, which still had a loyal customer base. Instead, they strategically managed the transition, offering a hybrid model of DVD rentals and streaming services. This allowed them to continue generating revenue from their existing customer base while gradually attracting new users to their streaming platform. As a result, Netflix became a dominant force in the streaming industry, revolutionizing the way people consume entertainment globally. Today, it is one of the world's leading entertainment companies, with millions of subscribers worldwide. This maneuver showcases the shrewdness and strategic thinking of Netflix's leadership, as they recognized an opportunity and executed a successful transition, disrupting the traditional entertainment industry and shaping the future of media consumption."},{"instruction":"Why are Isaac Asimov's books so hard to get in book stores?","output":"Have you tried the public library?"},{"instruction":"w much is a 17971801 John Adams one dollar coin not in mint condition worth?","output":"It’s worth a dollar (USD) and not a penny more.

Academic fraud and extortion—manipulating funding and student/employees in order to produce results and funding is a really sh*tty thing to do. Especially when you are the one being manipulated and are fully aware of the scam but have your hands tied. I worked in a PhD program (Wright State University) that I suspect was a charter school. It was a complete diploma mill scam school that was not accredited by any other org, and the content/management was so haphazard and discriminatory that no “real” school would have promoted such crap. “Lean” and agile were buzz words misused by my shady PhD advisor Kevin Bennett to justify not paying me and refusing to have any sort of structure—like lab mtgs or even some program of study. “Lean” was used in the sense that he refused to pay me the same amount as other grad students were paid. It was funded by a number of sources, including funding agencies for for mentally and physically disabled individuals, which is why the school was staffed and enrolled by a majority of those who were mentally and physically disabled. The difficult thing is when things would get f*cked up and no one was held accountable or anything changed due to the disability in the first place. The major disadvantage of a charter school is the greater risk for blatant funding manipulation. There was no oversight or other governing bodies, and I saw how funding was mismanaged or stolen. I was told “not to appear so competent” by other cohort (Rebecca Riffle) bc I “was supposed to be disabled.” During the school yr, when I inquired with faculty in the hallways about why the grades I submitted kept changing after the fact, I was told to “keep my voice down” and asked if if I “wanted to get everybody in trouble.” Later in the summer, when I spoke with a coworker (Danyell Lewis) who was friends with some of the students I had TA’ed during the school yr, I was told that my former advisor had instructed folks to ignore any of the comments I had made bc I was supposedly disabled and had just naturally f*cked up. When I informed a former Head of TAs (Steve Khazon) that I was leaving the program early, he snapped at me to not say anything about what had happened as I was supppsedly “crazy and that no one would believe me.” What was insane other than blatant grabs for shady “funny money,” by throwing random pseudo-medical terms at students/employees to justify legal wrongful treatment was the extent that the program would go to to keep it afloat. Cannibalizing and pissing off the student-faculty that keep your glass house standing is an idiotic idea.The faculty coudn’t do basic tasks that you would think profs who had worked for decades would know, like printing diff excel formats or use other communications channels, like video chat. When I was told that there would be no funding provided for my stay inthe program, I mentioned that i could work from home but my advisor Bennett said the program wasn’t set up for that (come on, like not being able to use FaceTime??? the guy never had mtgs so I couldn’t understand this sudden insistence to meet in person.

This moron was one of the group who stalked me online prior to my enrollment, derived the idiotic FALSE conclusion that I was a promiscuous polygamist due to a terrible FB hack, and then proceeded to dish his anger out on me as a student in his class by using random grading, and generally making my life as difficult as possible. In my case, as a crowning piece on a sh*t-show, one of my profs (Valerie Shalin - Psy 700s class - ANOVA) had the nerve to fail me for incorrect work I supposedly provided, make me take summer school (where I had to work in a crappy job at extremely low pay), and then fail me again for the ‘fake work’ I supposedly provided. What a complete scam. What a true waste of my time and money. I expressed concerns about the ‘Run Macros’ commands that popped up when I opened the Excel workbooks Valerie Shalin used for her finals as this was a legit spyware/malware concern. Shalin insisted that I run the files and I later found out that Shalin didn’t ask the other students to do this—instead having them perform the work not on their own PCs. Her course consisted of using Excel to calculate ANOVAs (bc the charter school couldn’t afford the licensing for SPSS/SAS). She claimed that I had a ‘learning disability’ to then program director (Scott Wantamniuk) bc I insisted that the product of 2 negative integers were negative on my final Excel workbook—another lie. I asked SWantamniuk to look at the workbook, but he literally turned a blind eye and said the grading was up to the discretion of the prof. The programs were scams bc the programs didn’t provide what they claimed, had arbitrary, always changing requirements, and the content that was being taught was complete bs. If it wasn’t useless crap (writing discussion questions for Ethics in Psych articles?! Why would I need to pay several hundred dollars for this?!) then it was stuff that you could find out how to DIY for free online (ex. Set up a Google Survey). The sh*tty professor attitudes also didn’t help. The software was outdated (ex. LISREL) and the grading was faked so that the student was always in a position where their funding was threatened.

Picking the mentor/class means that you are in control of your learning 100% control of your futureDon’t rely purely on university courses, or on the job training to learn and update your skills. In other words don’t rely on the wealth of skills to come to you, instead go out and attain it yourself.More importantly than taking the courses/coaching itself, learn how the instructor is running their business. How did you find them, how are they profitable, what tools do they use to communicate/instruct, how are they themselves leveling up. Reading between the lines and how the courses/coaching are structured and emulating your mentor will teach you often times more than the course itself when it comes to business strategy.Learn skill first and then over time you can learn how to give back grow a business by teaching these skills to others. Think about the long term, the big picture, most people only think with limited vision, try to think about what skills and coaching will take you the furthest in not only your career but your life.With the pandemic there are so many resources to learn online and on your own time, take advantage of these opportunities, and seek out the up and comers who may be hungrier to instruct and give their time than those who might be established simply trying to make a quick easy buck by being a “fake guru”By taking courses and coaching, you will also learn how to better ask more meaningful questions when you meet others allowing you to constantly learn from anyone who may possess more skills than yourself.

My husband , 2 small children and I were at the local movie theater in the mall and decided seeing a movie would be a nice way to pass one of the hottest afternoons of the summer. We chose a movie I thought we could all enjoy, went to the concession stand, got our popcorn and sodas, no easy feat with 2 kids in tow, and then went in and took our seats. I noticed a musty smell when we walked in. We were a little early, and after we had sat there a while, we realized the air conditioning wasn’t working. No way was I going to sit there and sweat. We went back out to the lobby and asked for our money back which had to be approved by the manager who wasn’t there yet. I was really po’d because they knew before we went in that the air wasn’t working and that they should have informed us. Anyway, the manager showed up and begrudgingly refunded our money. Then my husband said “ You know, we wouldn’t have bought the popcorn and sodas had we known we weren’t going to get to see the movie. So we traipsed up to the concessions and returned all our stuff and got that money back. As we were walking out, the manager yelled at us to come back. He told us to back and get our refreshments as he wouldn’t be able to resell them anyway. So we traipsed back up there and retrieved our stuff. We were not rude about any of this, but people were watching us, and I felt terribly embarrassed.

With that understood, there are two questions here: “Do Westerners find it strange that Eastern countries that are modernized in technology still have concepts of obedience to elders, family honor, social conformity and ancient tradition?” Not at all. Westerners often don’t understand Eastern cultures, but we do assume, without fail, that they value obedience, family honor, social conformity, and ancient tradition. This is not to say that we respect them for doing so, mind you, only that we understand that they value those. This is because most negative Western stereotypes about Asian cultures are built on the statement that Asian cultures value obedience, etc. What we don’t understand is this claim that India and Pakistan are “countries that are modernized in technology”. That claim is one many Westerners would reject automatically with disbelief, as neither country has the widespread technological infrastructure which is common in the US, Europe, Japan, Australia, China, etc. India and Pakistan, to Western perception, are rural and undeveloped, and in no way comparable, technologically, to either the West, or China, Japan, South Korea, or Singapore. It would be very difficult to find people in the West that consider India and Pakistan to be our technological equals. So, yes, we know that India and Pakistan value family honor, and that these values are different from our values.

Private Benjamin, 1981–1983 This sitcom was based upon the 1980 film of the same name. It is about the misadventures of Judy Benjamin, a pampered Jewish Princess who joins the Army after deciding that her life needs direction. Judy was played by Goldie Hawn in the film and Lorna Patterson in the series. She was under the command of Captain Doreen Lewis. Played by Eileen Brennan, in both the movie and the series, Brennan received an Academy Award nomination for her performance in the film and won an Emmy for the series. Unfortunately she was seriously injured in 1982 when she was struck by a car. Brennan was unable to return to work. The producers hired Polly Holliday (Alice, and it’s spinoff Flo) as Captain Amanda Allen. Holliday was only hired temporarily as the show had every intention of bringing back Brennan. Unfortunately it was cancelled before Brennan recovered. An interesting gaffe, Holliday’s character was referred to as Captain, although her uniform had the oak leaf of a Major. CHiPs 1977–1984 This kid friendly action series focused on the adventures and lives of two motorcycle cops and best friends who were with the California Highway Patrol. Lead and heartthrob Erik Estrada had a serious motorcycle accident while filming an episode, he missed some episodes and the accident was written into the show allowing Estrada to be filmed in a hospital bed. The Brady Bunch, 1969–1974 This popular family sitcom had a story arc where the family went to Hawaii. The story called for the oldest son Greg, played by Barry Williams to enter a surfing contest. Williams who was too busy filming to enjoy Hawaii really wanted a break so he lobbied to film the scene which included a wipe out. The producers were leery because of the nature of the stunt. They intended to hire a stunt double. Williams exaggerated his surfing ability and was allowed to film it. Unfortunately he wiped out for real. He said later that he wasn’t injured but “my feet got turned into hamburger.” The producers liked the shot and used it onscreen. Williams recalled in his 1992 autobiography that he couldn’t watch the scene without getting chills. Capitol, 1982–1987 This daytime soap opera followed a typical soap opera format, including hiring an older well known actress as the matriarch. In 1982 for the first year, Carolyn Jones filled this role. Forever known as Morticia Addams, Jones played Myrna Clegg on Capital. In 1981 Jones was diagnosed with colon cancer. She kept her condition a secret from her costars telling them that she was suffering from severe ulcers. Jones found the filming difficult and asked if her character could be filmed in a wheelchair. While the producers did accommodate her on a few occasions, the TV Guide noted after her death that the cast and crew felt awful that they denied her request to be in a wheelchair in all episodes.

The hold is broken when the end of the shank is lifted from the sea bed and the flukes break out of the sea bottom. The hold of a ship at anchor is best when the shank is kept to the sea bed by the weight of the anchor chain. A lighter rope tied to the anchor would allow the ship under wind or current lift the rope off the bottom and break the shank free. A chain ensures that a length of heavy weight preceeds the shank. Proper anchoring requires an anchor chain of 5 to 7 times the depth - this makes sure the anchor end of the chain lies on the seabed from its own weight holding the anchor shank there, also. Raising the chain with a winch will pull the anchor shank off the bottom, releasing the anchor. A rope would be so light that a strong wind or current tug on the vessel would straighten the rope so that it pulled upwards on the anchor. The weight of the catenary of a heavy anchor ensures the pull on the anchor will be horizontal. In the picture above, the third boat has too light an anchor rope, or too great a wind force, so it is likely to pull up the anchor. The 1st and second boats have a heavy enough anchor chain (Rode) to keep the pull on the anchor horizontal even with wind. Thus the weight of the anchor chain is essential for keeping the anchor secured."},{"instruction":"w did a plane crash on the upper floors of the World Trade Center result in the entire building collapsing?","output":"When I was young, my dad worked in the steel mills of Cleveland, and one day, they had an open house.

We started at one end with the blast furnace and how they mixed in all of the chemicals and elements and raw materials in these huge blast furnaces to create red/yellow/orange even molten lava. Then these huge buckets would come along and just take this stuff and put it on these rollers which went on more miles. We walked the whole entire thing, and the rollers would smooth out the liquid into this long and narrow piece of magma and then it would go through the pools of water to hardened it. It would keep cooling this magma until at the end of the rollers formed, you guessed it, steel. To understand how the towers fell just reverse the process. If water cools magma turning it into steel, wouldn't heating the steel reverse the process? Of course it would. And that's how the towers fell. Thick of it as an ice cube.

It’s just their personal opinions. For something to be infallible it has to come from the Chair of Peter. Likewise a Parish Priest or Bishop also has the right to voice his opinion on whatever subject comes to mind.

Unfortunately like in every church, Catholic or Protestant there are not only conservative views but now liberal ones.

I absolutely LOVE questions like these and I can think of eight artists without having to strain my brain. I may ad more. And I’m not thinking of some BS ones like KISS as obviously KISS rebounded. I am talking about genuine WTF moments where their fanbase took a hike and nothing they could would recover what they had. Nothing like Rod Stewart’s ‘Do Ya Think I’m Sexy’ as that clearly didn’t finish off his career. Here they are in no particular order: If You Leave by OMD (1986)Orchestral Maneouverers in the Dark (or OMD) had a handful of hits in the US thanks to underground radio and placements in movies. 'If You Leave' was OMD's biggest hit in the US hitting #4 on Billboard's Hot 100 Singles Chart in May 1986, spawned off the Pretty in Pink soundtrack. The band had submitted the track 'Goddess of Love' from their soon-to-be-released album Pacific Age but it received a poor reception from test audiences and director John Hughes rejected the song giving the band orders any song should be at a tempo of 120 BPM. The band had two days before they were due to leave for a tour and wound up writing and recording 'If You Leave' in 24 hours. And while the song was a sales success it has received equal parts critical praise and derision. Longtime fans had been disappointed by the trajectory the band had been on with their Junk Culture (1984) and Crush (1985) albums, going in a slicker, glossier, more pop direction. For a band that was once a musical innovator it was now seemingly following the herd. The singles from Pacific Age were far less successful in the US and elsewhere with only the first single 'Forever Live And Die' charting in the US. From that point on OMD's only success in the US was on the Dance Charts. In concert lead singer/bassist/songwriter Andy McCluskey has often admitted this song was the end of their career in the US and sadly, that seems to be true. Domino Dancing by the Pet Shop Boys (1988)The Pet Shop Boys got their start with dance-friendly singles that weren't quite in the Freestyle genre, but very close to it. With their arch lyrics and ironic band name they were gay-friendly if not exactly explicitly gay. They racked up an impressive number of Billboard Hot 100 singles in the USA from their start with the 'West End Girls' single in 1984 and were early MTV darlings with their visually arresting videos. And that's where the band finally ran into trouble with this single from their third studio album Introspective. The song was produced by Lewis A. Martinée, the Miami-based producer behind such 1980s Freestyle groups such as Exposé. And the the song had a definite Freestyle sound to it, which fitted well with the times. What didn't fit however was the video, shot in Puerto Rico, and which featured two young men often fighting with each other over a girl. In many scenes the two were shirtless and the footage truly bordered on the homoerotic, especially one scene where they were wrestling in the surf while the object of their affection looks on. Needless to say it was a huge hit in gay clubs which loved to show the video, but it became their sixth and final US hit, reaching #18 on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart. It did reach #5 on the dance charts where the band has continued to have decades long success. But it was the end of mainstream culture's embrace of the Pet Shop Boys and as singer/lyricist Neil Tenant has remarked it was truly the end of their career in the US even though the band continues to regularly tour the US. You and Me by Alice Cooper (1977)Alice Cooper was the undisputed king of Shock Rock with his macabre stage shows, but there's nothing scarier than reality as he found out when he released his ballad 'You and Me'. The ablum it came from, Lace and Whiskey, was a deliberate effort by Cooper to try something new, and for it he donned the persona of a heavy drinking comic Private Investigator named Maurice Escargot. And while 'You and Me' would hit #9 on Billboard's Hot 100 Singles chart it would be his last hit for a dozen years. Casual fans liked it but were stunned in the sudden change of Cooper's personna. Even hard core fans were confused and didn't like it. Cooper still plays the song live but admits to it being polarizing and perhaps a mistake. Rapture by Blondie (1981)Blondie never shied away from recording and performing songs in a variety of genres including reggae and calypso and on their Autoamerican (1980) album decided to try out rap. At the time in their native New York City the emergent rap scene was incredibly vibrant with a number of early stars. Blondie figured why not give it a try, not considering how potentially inauthentic a 30-something white woman might sound as a rapper. But somehow Blondie made it work in a very quirky and unusual way. And the song was a solid #1 hit on Billboard's Hot 100 Singles Chart, paving the way for rap to be more accepted by mainstream listeners and record buyers. But not everyone was so enamored. Some critics likened it to Pat Boone covering Little Richard in the 1950s, or what we would now call cultural appropriation. Blondie's take was pretty tame compared to what the Beastie Boys would soon be doing, but nowhere near as crass as Vanilla Ice. Blondie would have one final single crack the top 40 the following year after which the band took a very lengthy hiatus. While the song is fondly remembered by many fans it turned out to be an effective swan song for the band as their next album The Hunter (1982) was a critical and commercial flop. Guitarist Chris Stein soon fell ill with an autoimmune disease and the band went on a lengthy hiatus for him to recover. Personal Jesus by Depeche Mode (1989)Depeche Mode had been underground darlings in the US, primarily with alternative radio and dance clubs but outside of the Dance Charts had rarely troubled the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart until the time of Violator, their seventh studio album. 'Personal Jesus' was the debut single off the album and honestly a bit jarring compared to their previous output owing to the twangy country guitar. A friend likened it to a mashup between 'Doctoring the Tardis' by the Timelords and 'Island Girl' by Elton John, and indeed, those twangy guitars make it sound like Elton should start singing at any moment. For me it was a genuine \\"what were they thinking\\" moment as the other tracks released as singles were more in keeping with Depeche Mode's prior output. 'Personal Jesus' got to #28 on the charts and was bested by the next two singles, 'Enjoy The Silence' (#8), and ‘Policy of Truth’(#15). But after that brush with success Depeche Mode would scarcely trouble the Top 40 again. As for me I can't stand 'Personal Jesus' and fans either love it or hate it. But for long time fans like myself it was a breaking point. I never bought another Depeche Mode album after that point. Friday I'm In Love by The Cure (1992)It has always mystified me how the band that could create one of the most amazing albums in alternative rock history with Disintigration (1989) could wind up releasing such crap a mere three years later. The Cure had been on a hot streak for much of the 1980s with truly wild, inventive, and catchy songs covering a wide array of emotions. And yes, they were mostly relegated to alternative radio and the dance charts for much of the era but they did garner rotation on early MTV. But Disintigration launched them into the stratosphere and the Billboard Hot 100. One can only guess that the lengthy tour accompanying that album exhausted the band phsyically and creatively. Singer/guitarist/songwriter Robert Smith described the song in 1992 as both \\"a throw your hands in the air, let's get happy kind of record\\" and \\"a very naïve, happy type of pop song.\\" Problem was that it was completely out of character for what fans expected of the Cure. There was nothing naïve or happy about the band, let along pop. And while the song was a hit, reaching #18 it would be the last song by the band to trouble the Top 40 in the US. And while they still did well touring, interest in the band in the US evaporated. The band likewise seemed to lose energy, only sporadically recording and touring since that time. This was the silliest and most ridiculous they were. I haven’t bought anything by them since. Rubber Band Girl by Kate Bush (1993)Long a darling of the alternative rock scene, Bush was notorious for taking three years off between albums and something of a perfectionist at her craft. There was a great deal of anticipation for her seventh studio album, The Red Shoes, which was released in 1993, especially after the critical and commercial successs of her last album, The Sensual World (1989). But the debut single left longtime fans scratching their heads with its strange lyrics and bizarre vocals punctuated by rock guitar. Overall it seemed flimsy and dopey, almost as if it were a novelty song. Bush had never really troubled the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Chart, but had considerable following in the alternative rock scene, but this single and the album that produced it landed with a thud. Bush started struggling in her native UK and fans began wistfully looking back to previous releases for comfort. That was the end of the line for me and for a lot of other fans as well. Bush has recorded even more sporadically and with longer gaps between projects. Recent interest in her single 'Running Up That Hill' has revived interest in her and her music but only after 20 years of being largely forgotten. Mr Roboto by Styx (1983)Styx had been something of a critical darling of the 1970s, melding theatricism to rock, and they scored quite a few hits throughout the 1970s into the early 1980s with their breakout Paradise Theatre album (1981). By this point the band had broken through to arena rock status and needed an album to continue that. And what came next was the concept album Kilroy Was Here (1983). Paradise Theater had been a concept album as well and the concept for Kilroy Was Here was to poke fun at anti-rock activists who felt groups like Styx used backmasking with subliminal messaging. 'Mr Roboto' is the opening track and sets the tone and tenor for the album. And in the process of melding treatricism to rock it tends to go too over the top with singer Dennis De Young's vocals getting far too shrill and shouty at times. Synthesizers feature prominently as do vocoders and the whole thing is very removed from anything Styx had done before. By the end DeYoung is frantically repeatedly shouting \\"I'm Kilroy\\" while stunned and confused listeners try and make sense of what it is all about. I remember being completely befuddled the first time I saw it. I wasn't interested in learning more or intrigued, I was confused as hell. And I get the sense many fans and casual listeners were as well. I remember a friend of mine who knew my affinity for the offbeat remarking \\"seems like your kind of thing\\". And I had to quickly retort that no, it wasn't. It struck me as weird for weirdness's sake and I didn't get it. And I still don't. And while the band did have some big hits after 'Mr Roboto' it was clearly the end of the line for the band after this album. Styx was sidelined for seven years until they came out with a new album and by them people had largely relegated them to being an oldies act and no longer culturally relevant. Worse still, it now is regarded as Yellow Face, cultural appropriation, Xenophobia, and worse"},{"instruction":"Can a Jew become a nonJew?","output":"No, that’s physically impossible.

For example, a change in government or a trade war could disrupt a company's supply chain or make it more difficult to do business in the country. Cultural differences: Cultural differences can also pose a risk to a company's operations. For example, a company that does not understand the local culture may offend customers or business partners. Legal and regulatory challenges: The legal and regulatory environment in a foreign country can be very different from the company's home country. This can make it difficult to comply with all of the applicable laws and regulations, which could lead to fines or other penalties. Competition: The level of competition in a foreign market can be much higher than in the company's home market. This can make it difficult for the company to gain a foothold in the market. Costs: Expanding into international markets can be expensive. The company will need to invest in marketing, sales, and distribution in the new market. Benefits such as New markets: Expanding into international markets gives a company access to new markets and customers. This can help the company to grow its business and increase its profits. Economies of scale: By expanding into international markets, a company can achieve economies of scale. This means that the company can produce its products or services more efficiently, which can lead to lower costs. New ideas: Expanding into international markets can help a company to learn about new technologies and business practices. This can help the company to improve its own operations. Brand recognition: Expanding into international markets can help a company to increase its brand recognition. This can make it easier for the company to attract new customers and partners. Expanding into international markets can be a risky but potentially rewarding proposition. Companies that carefully consider the risks and benefits involved can increase their chances of success.

Not knowing how they operate that plane on this questioner’s planet, or even what planet he/she/it is from, I cant be of much help for questions about that planet. Down there on Planet Earth, we have many different types of airplanes used in many different ways. For example, my own airplane is not pressurized.

There are very big planes which we generally refer to as “commerical airliners”. Most of them are pessurized. Here on our Earth planes, the pressurization can take many different forms; for example, if the airliner is not going too high, there may be little or no pressure differential between the cabin and the outside ambiant air. Generally speaking…and this is VERY general, at high altitudes pressurization may be limited to approx 8 lbs psi, or roughly half of sea level ambient air pressure.

Everything You Need to Know About ItLast week I bought a terrific smartwatch, i.e., an Apple Watch Series 3 GPS + Cellular. The experience was astounding, but I conquered this dilemma of eSIM technology . An odd hidden twist resides within the latest Apple Watch: a built-in SIM card that isn't a SIM card. It's an eSIM or embedded subscriber identity module. It took me an hour to get through this 'thoroughly' as it was my first experience. Based on it, I thought of writing an insightful eSIM three-part blog. Fret not. It's easy to configure it. So without further ado, let's get into this! What is an eSIM? The buzzword \\"eSIM\\" merely means a SIM card that is integrated or embedded. No physical SIM cards are involved, and there is no physical swapping over is needed by you. The network or carrier must support eSIM and enable it, and eSIM is not yet supported by all networks. An eSIM is a small chip within your phone and appears to work in a way similar to the NFC chip used in payment techniques such as Apple Pay and Google Pay. eSIM is supported by GSMA, the Mobile Networks Association, and the eSIM standard has been defined worldwide by that organization. The information on an eSIM is rewritable, meaning that you can decide to change your operator with a simple phone call. They're effortless to extend to a data plan. Connecting devices with eSIMs to a mobile account can be done in minutes. What devices does eSIM support? The most notable ones are: iPad Pro Apple Watch Series 3 Apple Watch Series 4 and 5 iPhone X.S., XS Max, 11 and 12 series Google's Pixel 2 (initially used for Google Fi in the U.S.) Google Pixel 3, 3 XL, 4, 4XL, 4a Moto Razr flip phone Windows 10 Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered PCs FYI: Every year, more eSIM-capable devices are produced, and not all are mobile phones. We have been used to connecting other devices such as laptops or tablets to Wi-Fi, but with the increasing adoption of eSIM technology, it is only a matter of time before they can all connect independently to the internet. eSIM vs SIM When traveling, many travelers fail to locate a reliable mobile network, and even if they find one, they do not need the service for more than a month. The similarity between the two [eSIM & conventional sim] There is a SIM vs eSIM stigma because they are entirely different systems and can not be fairly compared. Most individuals, however, would be shocked to understand that they have quite a few similarities, such as: They both connect your phone to the network of your mobile provider. Both of these can be found in several different devices (not just phones) Both remember your phone and the plan used. Here are the eSIM positive aspects: eSIM can not be physically harmed or lost: because it's installed inside phones, you run far less harmful cards at the least opportune moments and weaken your signal quality. The eSIM can be used with a SIM: phones with dual-SIM technology can switch between a SIM data line and an eSIM to get the best possible signal worldwide. eSIM is tiny: behttps://www.efani.com/blog/an-introductory-guide-to-esim/] [URL: https://www.efani.com/blog/an-introductory-guide-to-esim/]Some copied points from the link: ESIM can not be physically harmed or lost: because it’s installed inside phones, at the least suitable moments, you run far less harmful cards and weaken your signal quality.The eSIM can be used with a SIM: phones with dual-SIM technology can switch between a SIM data line and an eSIM to get the best possible signal worldwide.ESIM is tiny: because an eSIM is small, it can fit into modern wearable technologies, such as watches or other devices, which over time can become smaller.Multiple cellular profiles can be stored by eSIM: There is no limit to storing single cell phone plan information; it can therefore be used anywhere around the globe.ESIM is not easy to hack: when in a roaming situation, hackers must pivot through a billing-process protection feature and the cloud to intrude into your phone data.It’s easy to track eSIM: Network operators can monitor eSIM over the air, making it easier to pinpoint your location in case your phone got lost or stolen."},{"instruction":"What did the US Government do that was so heinous that it caused Americans to decide they needed an unchecked right to bear arms?","output":"Nothing. It was the US Government who enumerated the right to bear arms. Now the British government is another story all together. The King thought he could bleed the colonists dry while treating them like second, or third, class citizens because they didn't truly consider them Englishmen. After years of unfair taxes and no representation in how the colonies were to be governed, the colonists had had enough. The fact that nearly every colonist had their own rifle, very much unlike in England, is how a ragtag group of farmers, masons, ranchers, and merchants were able to defeat the most powerful army in the world at that time. Naturally after we won our independence the founders saw to it that no American would ever be left helpless to their government in the face of tyranny."},{"instruction":"Can an F15 fighter jet sink a ship with a smart bomb?","output":"Yes, an F-15 can surely sink a ship with a smart bomb. In fact, it has already been done although not in the way most would imagine. On April 28, 2022, an F-15E Strike Eagle dropped a smart bomb successfully destroying a full-scale surface ship in the Gulf of Mexico. It only took a single bomb to sink the ship. During World War II, torpedoes relied on a direct hit to damage a ship. The goal was to create a hole in the ship that caused flooding. As the ship began to list to the side and sink, the crew would have to divert their attention to flood control. The ship would lose speed, become less maneuverable, and could eventually capsize. It usually took many direct hits on a warship with watertight compartments to sink it although a lucky shot in the right place at the right time could do the job. The Japanese battleship Musashi took over 20 hits from air-dropped torpedoes before it sank. The bomb that the F-15E used to sink a ship was pretty smart. It was guided alongside and underneath where it exploded without touching the ship. The explosion broke the back and sank the ship the same way a modern torpedo works. Today, the two most common anti-ship weapons are torpedoes and cruise missiles. Both weapons are precise and deadly, but incredibly expensive. The U.S. Air Force and Navy got together in the QUICKSINK program to develop inexpensive solutions to sinking surface ships. The Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) is a bolt-on guidance kit that converts standard gravity bombs or \\"dumb bombs\\" into all-weather precision-guided munitions. JDAM bombs range from 500 to 2,000 pounds. Although the JDAM can be used to sink large civilian ships, it is not that easy to sink a warship packing air defense missiles. To sink a warship, all surface-to-air missiles in the area must be disabled before deploying JDAM bombs. Once disabled, the JDAM can make short work of enemy surface ships. Not an easy task, but with the technology that is emerging, air defense will be faced with new challenges. Below is a video of the QUICKSINK test."},{"instruction":"What rules are to be followed in order to do intraday trading?","output":"Day trading can be extraordinarily difficult, especially if you lack the experience. It is very fast and there are a lot of variable factors. Intraday trading is buying a stock and selling it on the same day. This is a gamble, so there are a few necessary steps or suggestions needed to be considered to ensure maximum profitability. Outlined here are only a few general points about advice when day trading: Watch the media and be on top of hot topics and news because the market changes so much. This includes social media in addition to the news.An example of this would be if Warren Buffet said he liked a particular stock in an interview, no matter what the stock is, it will go up because of that media coverage. Finding that coverage first and early in the day of trading will help increase profits before it goes up.If Elon Musk wrote a controversial tweet or had a picture taken of something he was not supposed to do that went viral on social media, the Tesla stock would most likely plummet.Be smart, think and keep an eye out for social media news that impact the market. Decisions be guided by logic, not emotionThis is a great simple and general mantra to go by. If you see something on social media or news that the public likes that will increase the value of a particular stock but you yourself do not understand the excitement, guide your decision by the massive amount of numbers supporting the stock. For example, Facebook was one of these companies when it was first traded on the market. Understand and watch the tax ramifications of day trading.Keep in mind the taxes included with your profits on a day-to-day trade. If you hold a stock for less than a year your taxes are going to be significantly higher, so take into consideration that your profits need to match those taxes being taken out."},{"instruction":"What is your opinion of Adam Schiff presenting indisputable evidence that the Trump campaign did in fact collude with Russia and criticising the GOP?","output":"I am still waiting for Schiff to present some clear documented proof.

What will I do? I work a few hours, have no savings, and live week to week. I live in Britain.","output":"I'm sorry to hear about your situation. Living in the UK, you have several options for financial support. As you rightly identified, Universal Credit is one avenue you can explore. Universal Credit is a payment to help with your living costs and is available to those who are on a low income or out of work. It can help to cover your essential expenses, like your rent, council tax, bills, and groceries. Universal Credit is a means-tested benefit, meaning it takes into account your income and savings, and the amount you get can be reduced if you're earning from work or have other sources of income. Here's a more detailed breakdown of what you might consider: Universal Credit: This benefit is designed to help with living costs and can be claimed if you're on a low income, out of work, or you cannot work.Housing Benefit: This could help with your rent, though most people now need to claim Universal Credit instead.Council Tax Reduction: Depending on your income, savings and whether you live alone, you could be eligible for a reduction on your council tax. Each local council runs its own scheme, so you would need to get in touch with your local council to find out about your eligibility.Energy Grants: There are several schemes to help people who are struggling to pay their energy bills. You could apply for the Warm Home Discount Scheme or the Winter Fuel Payment.Pension Credit: This is an income-related benefit to give you extra money in retirement. It is means-tested, so it depends on your income, savings, and whether you're single or have a partner. You will be able to get this when you reach retirement age (67) and it will be an amount more than the UK State pension. It's important that you speak to an advisor about your situation. You could contact Citizens Advice Bureau or Age UK for help - they offer free, confidential advice and can assist with applications and explain your rights and options. Remember, there is help available, and you don't have to face this situation alone."},{"instruction":"w much money can you make online?","output":"There is no one answer to this question because there are so many factors that can affect how much money a blog makes.

Generally speaking, most blogs make somewhere between 1 and 10 per 1,000 visitors. However, some blogs make much more than that, and others make far less. In addition, the amount of money a blog makes from advertising will vary depending on what type of advertising is used and how effective it is.

Like the others I’ll ignore King Arthur, etc. Nine Worthies of London is a book by Richard Johnson, the English romance writer, written in 1592. Borrowing the theme from the Nine Worthies of Antiquity, the book, subtitled Explaining the Honourable Excise of Armes, the Vertues of the Valiant, and the Memorable Attempts of Magnanimous Minds; Pleasaunt for Gentlemen, not unseemely for Magistrates, and most profitable for Prentises, celebrated the rise of nine famous Londoners through society from the ranks of apprentices or ordinary citizens. The nine were: Sir William Walworth, who killed Wat Tyler, the leader of Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Sir William was originally a fishmonger, and later twice became Lord Mayor of London (in 1374 and 1380). Picture below the nine worthies of London. Sir Henry Pritchard, a vintner, who in 1356 provided a feast for Edward III and 5,000 men returning from France, including Edward the Black Prince; John, King of Austria; the King of Cyprus; and David, King of Scotland. Sir William Sevenoke, who fought against the Dauphin in France, and later, having made money as a grocer, became a philanthropist and built twenty almshouses and a school. He was Lord Mayor in 1418 and in 1420 became a Member of Parliament. Sir Thomas White, who, in 1554, helped keep the citizens loyal to Mary Tudor during Wyatt's rebellion. A merchant tailor and son of a poor clothier, he founded St John's College, Oxford. He became both Sheriff and later Lord Mayor of London. Sir John Bonham, a mercer, who was entrusted with a valuable cargo bound for Denmark and found favour at the Danish court. While there he was made commander of the army raised to stop the progress of the \\"great Solyman\\". He made peace with the Turkish leader and returned to England a rich man. Christopher Croker, originally a vintner, who with the Black Prince assisted Pedro of Castile in maintaining his claim to the throne of Castile. Sir John Hawkwood, who served under Edward III in France and later became a mercenary commander in Italy, where he was known as Giovanni Acuto. He was the son of an Essex tanner or a London tailor. Sir Hugh Calverley, a silk weaver, who was a renowned hunter and famed for killing a huge boar (or bear) for the Poles. Sir Henry Maleverer, generally called Henry of Cornhill, a grocer who lived in the reign of Henry IV. He was a knight in the Crusades, and highly regarded by the King of Jerusalem. He eventually fell out of favour and became the guardian of Jacob's Well in the Holy Land. The term \\"Nine Worthies\\" was later used to refer to nine of the privy councillors of William III: the Whigs Devonshire, Dorset, Monmouth, and Edward Russell; and the Tories Caermarthen, Pembroke, Nottingham, Marlborough, and Lowther.

However, if we were to assume the hypothetical scenario where humans could use 100% of their brains, it's uncertain what would happen. The brain is an incredibly complex and still largely unknown organ. It's possible that we would gain superhuman abilities such as perfect recall, extraordinary cognitive processing speed or heightened intuition.

An instinctiveness for a man to harm another man who insults his partner’. In fact, this particular theory has been investigated in psychological research, for example, a study entitled, ‘The proof is in the punch: Gender differences in perceptions of action and aggression as components of manhood’. The authors of the study argue that physical action, toughness, and aggression are central features of the masculine stereotype in the US, (perhaps ironically enough, reinforced by Hollywood). They contend that men often experience anxiety stemming from the need to prove their manhood. Given this anxiety, acts of physical aggression become an opportunity for men to prove their masculine status. Yet, perhaps there are other ways to convey to others that a man is strong, fearless, and willing to act, despite risks to personal safety. Dangerous activities, such as motorcycle riding without a helmet, and mountain climbing without a partner, represent another class of masculinity-confirming events because their performance, like overt acts of aggression, also confirms a man’s toughness and courage. This idea is investigated in a study entitled ‘Living Dangerously: Culture of Honor, Risk-Taking, and the Nonrandomness of ‘‘Accidental’’ Deaths’. This investigation has shown it is even possible to predict which parts of the US have higher rates of deaths from excessively manliness.

Does science not matter anymore?","output":"When businesses open, employees are forced to go to work. They don't have a choice. The protesters at least have choice and can try to keep their distance. And outdoors is apparently safer than indoors. It does seem inconsistent. My take is that people are so enraged and so fed up with police brutality and police getting away with murder, especially of black people that concerns about the public health took a back seat. These protests represent a spontaneous boiling over of rage at murdering police, at 400 years of racial injustice and cruelties, at Trump and his cruelties and all the needless deaths and economic losses from the pandemic. And the ongoing brutality of the police against peaceful protesters is causing continuing protest. Not only in the US but even in other countries that have stricter lockdowns and better compliance people seem to have cast those concerns aside and are protesting in solidarity. At least most of the protesters are wearing masks and are outdoors.

Its last eruption lasted from 1913 to 1944 and it’s the only active volcano on the European mainland. 600,000 people live close enough to be killed instantly by a sudden pyroclastic flow event, and another 2.4 million live close enough to be in danger during a major eruption, including the entire city of Naples, which is only 9km away from the center of the mountain. Currently, it erupts about three times a century. But don’t worry about Vatican, it’s over 240 km away from the mountain. That’s close enough to get ashfall, but not lava or anything else dangerous. For the most part, when Vesuvius has erupted recently, it’s only emitted sulfur rich steam and little else. Mind you, when it does erupt, the eruption generally lasts an average of five years.

Some of the frequently observed mistakes are Beginning preparation without analysis A comprehensive study of the exam pattern and trend of questions asked from various topics is very important before you start the preparation. One needs to track and analyze the previous paper trends properly. In depth study of concepts is required to stand the cut throat competition; earlier cut off were less but in today’s scenario toppers are scoring somewhere around 95-98 marks and relatively the cut off has also increased. 2. Improper prioritizing Without a mind map of the course of action to follow, loss of efficiency and effort may occur. Topics can be classified into two different types which are; conventional (traditional) areas of the syllabus and rarely asked topics. Conventional areas are those which must be prioritized since they are sure to carry the highest percentage of marks. Rarely asked topics can be taken care of at the end of the subject as they can provide an extra edge, in case a question from those topics comes up. Similarly, out of numerical and theoretical topics, depending on one’s own comfort and strengths, one must identify and prioritize topics accordingly. 3. Research-oriented study Time is a very crucial aspect while preparing and it should be saved by avoiding unnecessary research on any topic. The focus must always be on clearing the exam and thus, the preparation strategy must be highly goal-oriented at all times. Textbooks or any such sources must only be referred for topics that one finds tough to understand from their primary source of study. It is here where Coaching comes into the role play, as experienced faculties give you the right direction regarding how to study, what to study and how much to study. This actually saves your unnecessary efforts and saves time. 4. A generic approach for the preparation Following a generic approach or someone else’s approach for preparation is another common mistake being observed. Preparation plan should be unique for every aspirant and for each subject. This practice is not good because every individual has his/her own limitations and strengths. So, one may take help from other’s strategy and plans to develop their own but not follow them completely. Proper short notes and repeated revisions for such subjects is helpful, whereas practicing more questions for numerical or concept-based subjects proves more helpful. 5. Poor revision plan This is the most common mistake seen in GATE exam. A well-organized revision plan is even more important than a proper preparation plan because retaining is more important for the judgment day than understanding. The revision must be done at regular intervals through practicing questions, re-reading notes or appearing for test series. Time dedicated for revision must be increased with each progressing month of preparation. 6. Unverified study sources Lack of trust in the faculty or oneself often leads students to go for some additional sources of study. These sources which may include some web portals, YouTube channels or local textbooks may be unverified. Reading from these sources sometimes may land you to gain incorrect information or concepts. This practice may be very harmful therefore it is very important to maintain trust in your primary source of study. 7. Insufficient tuning for the exam day This mistake is generally seen thirty to forty days before the exam, or after the admit card has been released. Students tend to follow the same schedule until the end which is not a healthy practice. The human body needs to tune with their daily schedule to work at its maximum efficiency. After one receives her or his admit card, he/she must tune or plan their schedule according to their final exam slot. This helps the body to be the most productive and efficient in that time slot. For example, if one is habitual of studying at night and get afternoon session for the exam, one may not be at their most efficient self at that time. Also, one must also try to give actual computer-based tests conducted for a real-time experience of GATE exam. This helps one to get acquainted with the exam environment and avoid panic on the exam day. Make sure you don’t follow these mistakes and keep your preparation constant.

Just going to comment that passing along costs so it doesn’t matter, actually does. A lot. I own everything, house, car(s), no debt. Have more money frankly than the government can tax from me, and have enough left over to have enough left over. Price rises (even gasoline) do not affect me. But… I have stopped going out because restaurants are just not worth the prices charged. I know they are not making any money, but as a consumer it is my choice how I spend mine, and going out (unless for special occasions) is not something I bother to spend on any more, these days. Same with vacations (airlines want to quadruple tickets, well then I cannot be bothered), and all sorts of other discretionary stuff. My freezer is always full, groceries cost more but whatever, and so forth. I guess what I am saying (badly, I know), is as a relatively well off person, I am choosing not to spend. So as prices rise, and consumers like me, or like those who really need to cut back, do cut back, stuff will start sitting on shelves as people do not buy at the high prices. Already starting to see it here in Canada. Passing along prices will lower demand, so fewer products sold and delivered. Dunno about construction and housing, as that is a different world. But… I could use a new deck even as the old one still works, and I will not be buying one while wood is unreasonable. Same thing with labour/contracts (sprinkler system is waiting too). Everything is fine, everything works, but I am sitting on my spending until it makes more sense. If many people are like me, consumption will drop, a lot. Already happening, IMHO. As I said at the beginning, here… I can totally afford it. I just choose not to. Hate to think about the spending cutbacks for those who can afford it less."},{"instruction":"w do I know which kinematic equation to use?","output":"Each of the equations (remember that acceleration has to be constant) features four of the variables - so if you know three of them then you can work out the fourth - and hence the fifth. Using Standard Nomenclature V = U + AT: No SS = UT+ 1/2 AT^2 : No VS = VT - 1/2 AT^2: No UV^2 = U^2 + 2AS: No TS/T = (U+V)/2 : No A. Equation 1 is just a way of saying that acceleration is the change of velocity / time for change A = (V-U)/T Equations 2 and 3 can be derived from drawing a velocity-time graph (straight line) and working out the area under the line (which is the distance travelled), noting that the difference between the start and final velocities is equal to AT (from equation 1). (or you could integrate the function). Equation 4: can actually be derived most easily from using the ideas of work done on a unit mass: the work done = Force X Distance = Mass X Acceleration X Distance and that equals change in kinetic energy i.e. 1/2MV^2 - 1/2MU^2: remove the mass as it is constant (for the purposes of these equations) Equation 5 is merely a statement that the average velocity (S/T) = the mean of the initial and final velocity."},{"instruction":"Why do people vape?","output":"There are multiple reasons for using vape based products.

Focus on eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats, and limit your intake of processed foods, sugary drinks, and saturated and trans fats. 2. Get regular exercise: Regular physical activity can help to improve insulin sensitivity and manage blood sugar levels. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity most days of the week. 3. Monitor your blood sugar levels: Regular monitoring of blood sugar levels can help you to identify patterns and make adjustments to your treatment plan as needed. Your healthcare provider can help you determine how often you should test your blood sugar and what your target ranges should be. 4. Take medication as prescribed: If you have been prescribed medication to manage blood sugar levels, it's important to take it as directed by your healthcare provider. This may include insulin, oral medications, or other medications to manage blood sugar levels. 5. Manage stress: Stress can have a negative impact on blood sugar levels.

Get enough sleep: Lack of sleep can also have a negative impact on blood sugar levels. Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night to help regulate blood sugar levels. It's important to work closely with your healthcare provider to develop an individualized treatment plan for managing blood sugar levels. Your healthcare provider can help you determine what lifestyle changes and medications may be appropriate for your specific needs."},{"instruction":"w has being raised by extremely strict parents affected you as an adult?","output":"My siblings got that treatment to a higher degree compared to me because I was the youngest. No, it was not because I was most loved. Fact is, most of the time, my presence didn't seem noticable being born in a huge family of eighteen, nine boys, nine girls. Father had three wives. I watched every one being either spanked or caned regardless of gender. One of my brothers once had a machete threatened by my father for whatever reason we children don't seem to remember but we remember the picture in our head. It scared the hell out of me, the sound of the stainless steel machette hitting on the chopping board. It still clang in my ear clearly each time this is mentioned. He grew up abusing his own sons, unfortunately. I've witnessed him use the belt. He womenised and gambled extensively. He even caned my sisters when they started courting which I now think he had no right because he himself did not show a good example. The eldest brother was entirely different. He became a very caring father. He was warm and soft hearted. My sisters, each got caned horribly when they had boyfriends. I watched one die. Another bruised and yet another miscarried because of the beating. Why did they still get themselves into trouble despite the strict parenting? It's how like when you tell a child 'No, don't do that’ and they will retaliate and do exactly what you say not to. In this case, it's all sexual restriction. How else can they relief themselves whenthey burn with desire during their youth? It's most unfortunate that the next generation is doing the same thing again. How am I myself affected watching the downfall of each of my siblings? I ran away from home."},{"instruction":"What is your review of 'Dil Bechara' (2020 movie)?","output":"In an argument by James P carse in his book Finite and Infinite Games, He summarizes his argument as There are at least two kinds of games: finite and infinite. A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play The finite game is about losing or winning the game. It is about reviewing his performance in his last movie. It is about impeding his legacy. There would be black and white and it would be immensely boring. We can give a plethora of contexts or words to measure his performance but I believe it would not be a justice to his genius. It would limit him as an artist. Now, He is beyond entropy. He is beyond death. He is playing the infinite game. Yesterday I was not watching the movie to judge screenplay or dialogue or pace of the character development but I was enjoying the liveliness of the genius. His smile was transcending the lens of the camera. And one of the particular thing that moved me was that In the movie, Sushant's character died before watching his own movie. Isn’t it a heart-wrenching incidence? In the movie, without building his character Manny’s demise was all of a sudden and in real life we all know what happened. So, I think his brilliance doesn’t need to be reviewed and sometimes an old archaic beautiful painting needs us to get lost in it."},{"instruction":"Before legalization, what did people think zig zags were used for?","output":"Rolling cigarettes or rolling joints.

Yes! and Yes! I can, without any past recollection, write a book on this but it won’t sell. *winks* For the time being, the following examples would do- 1. Whenever I secured top rank in college or performed academically well anywhere else, my peers often assumed that the faculty gave me extra credits based on my looks and looks alone. *Facepalm* 2. Just because I am not traditional, people have a hard time believing that I happen to be a religious person who prays regularly. *Eye-rolls* 3. I am thin (not anorexic kind of thin) for my country’s standards. Every time I tell someone that I ran 5 kilometers in 22 minutes, they get skeptical and start rolling their eyes as if some malnourished kid just falsely bragged that he gets chicken wings for dinner, everyday. *Oh! Come on! Catch up with me on the track some day, you mass of prejudices!* 4. Also, I am taller than most of the girls around me. So, it goes without saying that I’ve been suggested to play basketball or try my luck in modelling just because the GIFT that I am blessed with, my HEIGHT, would not go WASTE regardless of my intellectual interests. *Speak of the stereotypes* 5. I don’t speak with EVERYBODY. I am actually shy and reserved around those I barely know whereas, I am ridiculously gregarious and extroverted when I am surrounded by my folks. Apparently, judgmental sort of humans who have not the slightest insight about my heart and mind assume that I’m snobbish, egoistic, vain and god forbid narcissistic, to say the least. *NOTE to those first rate jury members - Please try and talk before you judge me so bitterly.* I think this quote by my favorite, James Stewart from the movie ‘The Shop Around the Corner’ impeccably fits here. :)That’s what most of the people do- they just look at the surface and ASSUME!"},{"instruction":"it true that Lord Shiva is not mentioned in the Vedas?","output":"The word “Shiva” comes in the 8th Anuvakam of Sri Rudram - Namakam in the Yajur Veda.

So it is important to make a comparison before selecting any one of the two. There are some major differences between both stones which are important to be understood. These are given below: · First of all, the comparison will be made on the basis of the origin of both the stones. Granite is originated form the cooling down of molten magma whereas the marble is formed by the metamorphic rocks. The sedimentary rocks turn into metamorphic rocks when they stay under the earth for a longer period. · Granite has various colors while marble has a fewer color option. Granite has an appearance of flecks particles while marble has swirling designs in it. · Talking about the durability of both the stones, it can be said that granite is more durable and strong as compared to marble. This can be evidenced by the fact that the hardness of granite is 7 Mohs scale and the hardness of marble is 3 Mohs scale. · When it comes to cleaning of both the stones, the cleaning of granite is much easier than the cleaning of marble. Marble is more porous and it absorbs the stains and spills whereas the material of granite is less porous so it does engross the stains and the stain can be easily removed by just wiping out them.

Thank Kyree Randall. Question: What are the differences between muscle tissue and epithelial tissue? TOP 10 TIPS TO BUILD YOUR MUSCLES IN 3 WEEKS. 1. Get Stronger. The best bodybuilders that ever existed were strong. They knew more strength is more muscle. Increase your Squat to 140kg/300lb, Bench Press to 100kg/220lb, and Deadlift to 180kg/400lb. Your overall muscle mass will increase because strength is size. 2. Add Weight. Forget about pump and soreness. Instead focus on adding weight on the bar. Try to lift more than last time. You’ll get stronger which will increase your overall muscle mass. If you don’t lift more today than last month or year, you’re not building muscle. Useful frree ebook: [LINKED_TEXT: 101 muscle building sercrets] [URL: https://musclebuilder888.blogspot.com/2019/09/101-muscle-building-sercrets.html] 3. Do Compounds. Do exercises that work several muscles at the same time. You’ll be able to lift heavier weights which will trigger more muscle growth. The bulk of your routine should consist of heavy Squats, Bench, Deadlifts, Overhead Presses and Barbell Rows. 4. Use Barbells. You can lift heavier weights with barbells than any other tools. You also have to balance the weight yourself. Barbells involve more muscles and trigger more growth. Use free weights not attached to machines. Start light and use proper form to avoid injury. 5. Increase Frequency. The more often you train a muscle, the more you trigger it to grow. The more you do an exercise, the quicker your technique improves, and the heavier you can lift. Start Squatting, pressing and pulling three times a week instead of only once. 6. Recover. Your muscles need to recover from your workouts to grow stronger and bigger. They can’t recover if you work them hard every day. Even your mind needs a break. Take three to four rest days a week. Help your muscles recover by getting plenty of food, water and sleep. 7. Eat More. Your body uses food to fuel workouts, and recover muscles. Your muscles can’t recover and grow if there’s a shortage of food. Most guys need at least 3000kcal/day to build muscle. Skinny guys with high metabolisms need even more to gain weight. 8. Eat Protein. Your body uses protein to build new muscle, and recover damaged muscle tissue post-workout. You need about 1.8g protein per kilogram of body-weight (0.82g/lb) to maximize muscle recovery and build muscle. For an 80kg/175lb guy, that’s about 135g of protein per day. 9. Get Real. You can’t get steroid-like results without using steroids. You can’t turn into Arnold in three months because building muscle takes time. Celebrities set unrealistic expectations. Stop trying to look like them. Focus on improving yourself. It will save you frustration. 10. Be Consistent. Most guys gain 0.25kg/0.5lb of lean muscle per week if they do an effective training program and eat well. You can’t gain muscle faster than this. It takes a year to gain 12kg/24lb of lean muscle and see dramatic change. Consistency is therefore key."},{"instruction":"Can we bake a cake in a glass bowl?","output":"Baking a cake in a glass bowl is an interesting idea.

While traditional SIM cards have long been the norm, eSIM technology is quickly gaining ground as the new standard. In this answer, we will delve into the advantages of eSIM technology and explore why it is better than a standard SIM card. What is an eSIM? An eSIM, or embedded SIM, is a tiny chip that is embedded within your mobile device, acting as a SIM card. Unlike a traditional SIM card that you can remove from your phone, eSIMs are built into the device and cannot be removed. The information stored on an eSIM is rewritable, allowing for easy switching between different mobile operators with just a quick phone call. Advantages of eSIM technology Convenience Using eSIM technology allows you to have multiple mobile subscriptions on a single device, eliminating the need for carrying multiple physical SIM cards. With eSIM technology, you can easily switch between different mobile operators and plans without having to physically swap SIM cards. This convenience is especially beneficial for frequent travelers or those who use multiple mobile networks for different purposes. Security eSIM technology offers enhanced security over traditional SIM cards, as it is tamper-proof and cannot be physically removed from the device. This makes it more difficult for hackers to steal your SIM card and obtain sensitive information, such as your personal identification number (PIN) and passwords. Increased Storage Space As eSIMs are built into the device, they free up space that would otherwise be occupied by a physical SIM card. This allows for the inclusion of larger batteries, more memory, and other components in the device, without having to increase the size of the phone. Environmentally Friendly eSIM technology eliminates the need for physical SIM cards, reducing plastic waste and e-waste. This makes it a more environmentally friendly option for mobile communication. eSIM vs. Standard SIM: Which is Better? When it comes to comparing eSIMs and standard SIMs, the choice ultimately depends on your personal needs and preferences. However, it's clear that eSIM technology offers several advantages over traditional SIM cards. In conclusion, eSIM technology is the way of the future, offering enhanced security, convenience, increased storage space, and eco-friendliness. While standard SIM cards may still be the norm for now, it's only a matter of time before eSIMs become the new standard in mobile communications."},{"instruction":"w do I translate Hindi sentences in Sanskrit?","output":"यह आं है"},{"instruction":"What is the most advanced invention in the world?","output":"The most advanced technology man has ever invented is artificial intelligence (AI).

Usability is a qualitative indicator of the simplicity and convenience of working with the site. A site can be considered successful if the user quickly finds the information he needs, does not get confused in the functionality, and easily performs targeted actions. Of course, the company's employees additionally need to take care of quality customer service - competent advice, fast delivery, and respectful service. A satisfied customer, the user will return to the site, recommend the seller or service provider to his friends and leave positive feedback. The essence of usability lies not so much in the perception of the site design, but in building an effective dialogue with users and providing an opportunity to intuitively, without obstacles and difficulties, find the right offer and perform the targeted action. Why do we need usability optimization? If a person, having entered the site, does not find the necessary information, product, or service, does not understand the scope of the company or does not see action buttons or online forms, he will most likely leave for a competitor. It makes no sense to deal with the intricacies of work if you can simply find a similar, but more thoughtful and convenient site.In addition to traffic and conversions, usability affects SEO promotion. Behavioral factors, high page loading speed, and the absence of “broken” links and duplicates have a positive effect on ranking. In turn, a user-friendly website and effective promotion increase audience confidence and increase sales. Key components of website usability 1. Structured content. For the user to easily find the product or service he needs on the site, it is necessary to correctly distribute the offers into categories and sections. Before opening a particular page, the visitor must have an idea about its content. 2. Design. The design style does not directly affect the usability of the web resource, but the perception of the site by users still depends on it. The emphasis should be on a minimalistic, \\"non-flashy\\" design that does not distract from the perception of important information. The design must necessarily correspond to the text content, the theme of the site, and corporate principles. It is important to follow current trends. 3. Navigation. Having opened the site, the user should immediately understand where to find the information or product he needs. The navigation system is part of the site structure and is represented by hyperlinks that are responsible for transitions between sections, providing information about goods and services, and filtering offers by parameters. 4. Displaying the site on various devices and in different browsers. The correct operation of the resource on stationary and mobile devices ensures maximum audience coverage, reduces the bounce rate, and has a positive effect on conversion. A responsive and cross-browser website is a powerful business tool. 5. The quality of the information provided. The text content of the resource should be not only structured but also useful for the user. From this point of view, it is necessary to take care that on the pages of the resource a potential buyer can find out comprehensive information about the product or service, about the methods of payment and delivery. 6. The minimum path to the target action. For a person to make a purchase, order a service or leave their contact details, it is necessary to simplify the process as much as possible. The fewer fields to fill out, the better. Navigation should also be made as simple as possible. More than 25% of users refuse to place an order due to an overly complex algorithm of actions. 7. Performance. Even a beautifully designed and well-structured site can turn off the user if the pages load slowly. Modern users are very impatient, and the slow operation of the site annoys them. For which sites is usability important? Analysis and work to improve usability are necessary for all sites, without exception: • online stores. A well-designed structure and functionality of the site make it possible to quickly find the right product or category, purchase without outside help, make a payment, and order delivery. A friendly and convenient site encourages the buyer to repeat purchases; • service sites. Providing complete information about services and terms of cooperation on the pages allows users to quickly decide the order and saves employees time on answering calls and detailed consultations; • information sites. Portals with a beautiful design, fresh and interesting content, and thoughtful and concise structure attract a large number of users and, accordingly, make it possible to make good money on advertising. A clear interface, logical structure, high-quality content, and ease of performing targeted actions increase website conversion, positively affect brand reputation sales, do not distract employees for calls, and save money on technical support."},{"instruction":"Why don't we have nuclear powered trains, aircraft, and cars?","output":"Some are.

They’re not purely ceremonial, they really are on guard duty, the same as they would be at a military base. Guarding the Queen is considered a privilege and they take it quite seriously. Are they actually trained to take down threats? They are all, without exception, serving soldiers. Guard Duty happens on rotation, with one company from a single regiment performing it at any given time. Technically any regiment in the British Armed Forces (any of the three services) can perform it, but this privilege is usually reserved for the five regiments of Foot Guards which pre-date the restoration of the Crown; namely The Grenadier Guards, The Coldstream Guards, The Scots Guards, The Irish Guards, and The Welsh Guards.

I finished at the top of my class in 10th standard with a very good score of 95% at state boards, the top centile! Alas! the ecstasy was short lived only to be replaced by the fear and anxiety of pre med prep and exposure to alien lands and culture 😐 At Vijayawada, the new “lambs” were ushered in a quick yet harsh MCQ test to pack us into sections of students based on scores. There was this haggling about discount of fee based on 10th marks and MCQ test. We had a routine of waking at 5 AM followed by a wake up drink of cheap milk powder based formula. Yuck! Sleepily we attended the morning classes, half hungry most times. A short break for breakfast which was kind of a lottery as most days it was beyond edible to normal people. The saga continued till afternoon then we had mandatory study hours to go through the syllabus with fixed hours for each subject. WTF. I thought we were to spend more time on subjects we didn’t do well. But who cares, everyone was following the “rules”. There was this weird perversion to make things complicated than it already was with useless appeals to how romantic a life in med school was or unnecessary additions to the prescribed syllabus. It continued for 2 years 24*7*365. It was so mind numbing. The outings beyond campus were brief and once a week where most were encouraged not to waste even that little time off. I really don't think human brain works that way. It needs time off for maintenance. Few poor souls took this to a whole new level with studying non stop without sleep. Again, not really a long term optimal solution. Mistakes at weekend, cumulative or grand tests were taken seriously and at one point I got the question paper thrown at my face from an angry lecturer as he thought I made a very silly mistake. 😞 No online test does this to me now, further it provides a very detailed explanation of why other options are wrong. Good old days were not so good after all 😒 Most students were stinking as the water problem was a big issue added to lack of time and close proximity to multiple people in small spaces.

As such, he has a more complex and understandable motivation for why he acts as he does. However, at the end of the day, the attitudes, ideas and actions that he undertakes are essentially driven by the darkest and most savage impulses of human nature and have profoundly negative consequences for most people. Thus, he is definitely a villain. The “complex” part of Magneto’s story is that he is a Holocaust survivor who later lost his first child to an angry mob. These experiences help to explain his rage against humans. However, these experiences have also made him deeply and profoundly racist. This is something that should not be sugar-coated: Magneto is an unrepentant racist. How deep that racism goes depends on the version of the character you are looking at. (So, in the comics, he has had romantic relationships with human women; in the movies, he abandoned Mystique [X-Men: The Last Stand] when she lost her powers saving him - without her powers, she was nothing to him). Even so, it is a consistent part of the character. He cares only for mutants; he is quite willing to harm humans if it means advantaging mutants and he is absolutely convinced of the reality of his (and his group’s) racial superiority - an interesting conviction when one considers his experiences in Nazi concentration camps. In the present Marvel Universe, Magneto’s ethnonationalist worldview has been largely adopted by the X-Men and their founder, Charles Xavier (this is circa 2019–2020), but it does not make his ideas and attitudes any less harmful or destructive. This sense of racial superiority informs all of Magneto’s actions and makes it impossible for him to be other than a “villain,” however complicated his motivations may be."},{"instruction":"Why do you need to use command prompt?","output":"This question should have included “if you are under 50”.

Then Windows first came out, it had very limited usefulness. So I’ve been using the command prompt twice as long as a GUI. How long is that? Look back at the first line."},{"instruction":"Learning programming: When is it appropriate to use UDP instead of TCP?","output":"Short answer: when you want data a little faster, with significantly less variability, but don’t mind dealing with the downsides (data will be in a random order, you have to think more about the sizes of stuff you are sending, and some of the data might be lost). TCP/IP has some great guarantees: after the sender sends a bunch of data, the client will generally get all the data that was sent in order, with no duplicates, and with some good validation for correctness. The alternative is that the receiver will get just some of the data and (eventually) some kind of notification that the data isn’t ever going to arrive. The TCP guarantees make it easy to write lots of different kinds of programs. For example, if you send a big image using TCP/IP, all of the data will arrive in order, making it easier to handle the image. The downside is that when an individual TCP/IP packet is lost, the TCP/IP system will re-request the lost packet and won’t release any of the already-received data until the lost packet’s duplicate is send and received. This can take a while. This is called the “head of line” problem. Some systems are sensitive to latency and variation in latency. Games and Video Chat are two common cases. These kinds of programs are often written to use UDP just to avoid the head of line problem."},{"instruction":"w did a plane crash on the upper floors of the World Trade Center result in the entire building collapsing?","output":"For all you fools who think it was controlled, amazing, try to find the documentary that was on WGBH that has one of the head design engineers, yup the old bastard is still alive and got to see the buildings designed, built and destroyed in his lifetime.

Almost universally non conservatives would like their children to not be murdered at school. Almost universally non conservatives would like terrorists to not kill people. Therefore it makes a good position to unite people who are cool with terrorists terrorizing and their own children being murdered. It's the same reason conservatives are anti Vax. You have to value winning politics more than your life or the lives of your children to be anti Vax. To a conservative ensuring that criminals have access to guns to murder the conservatives children is a good thing. Do you want to win the battle? Or do you want to win the war? Tactic one: “OK, what will you trade for it?” Offer them complete de regulation of guns. And in trade, legalized abortions. You get one we get one. Conservatives don't want guns, they want the fight. Don't fight. Trade. Tactic two: “forget guns, go for the cause”. Suggest that to avoid gun violence we could give health care including mental health care. Suggest funding gun safety classes. Suggest funding social workers to reduce domestic violence. This will put them on their heels. Protesting that we can't hire social workers. Point out that guns must not be very important if you are unwilling to pay a little money to keep them. Tactic three: “don't be anti gun” when they claim you want to regulate guns, tell them you don't. You want to stop gun suicides, domestic violence, terrorism, murders at schools. Push the conversation to that. If they say “you want to ban silencers” say, “no I don't, how would that stop school shootings?” They practice all these quips and comebacks. Never set them up. Tactic four: “mostly not my problem” most people who get killed or injured by guns are gun owners. 99% of the solution is to not own guns, and/or take care of them properly. The number one way to shut down most of their arguments is to own a gun. The number two way is to point out that the problem mostly affects conservatives. Not owning a gun means I'm safe, not having friends with guns is double safe. Bonus round: “conservatives might shoot you” at some point in the exchange they will mention that you need guns to shoot other people with guns. Or make an indirect threat about conservatives shooting you. Ask “so your argument against gun control is that you need guns so you can murder people who disagree with you? And you think this is a good argument for less regulation of guns? Conservatives don't want guns. They want the fight. They also memorized tons of gun facts. Like the difference between a clip and a magazine. (A magazine is a little box that holds the bullets ready to shoot. And a clip holds your tie against your shirt.)

The first thing each did was punch a hole in the curtain wall of the building they hit. Unlike older skyscraper designs, the WTC towers were not filled with a boxwork of steel girders. To allow larger open spaces, each floor was built out of trusses spanning from the building core to the curtain wall, which unlike older skyscraper designs, carried a large part of the building’s structural load. When the curtain wall was punched through, it severed the support for the curtain wall structural members above the strike zone. This created a vulnerability. Inside the building, the aircraft damaged the building core by severing a number of the columns in the building core structure. This weakened the cores of both towers and reduced their ability to carry loads. This created another vulnerability. This damage did not cause the building to have an immediate structural failure because the engineers who designed it left enough redundancy in the load carrying structure of the building to hold itself together. The third thing is it started a prolonged fire, fed by the relatively full fuel tanks on the liners (which had only flown from Boston to New York, a fairly short distance) and all the plastics, wood, paper, and in some cases metals in the impact zone. The initial impact had also dislodged much of the fireproofing on the structural steel in the impact zone, making it more vulnerable to heating. While the fires were not nearly hot enough to melt steel, they were hot enough to severely reduce the strength of steel, to about half the strength it would have at room temperature. To compound matters, the steel members expanded when heated. When the trusses above the fire expanded, they placed additional stresses on the already damaged and weakening structure. With the curtain wall members severed at the fire zone, the curtain wall on the strike side of each tower were less able to withstand the outward force of the trusses just above the strike zone. After several hours, there was a structural failure in each tower, at different times relating to the load involved. The second tower struck fell first, because it was struck lower and so the load was greater and the structure reached failure point sooner. In both towers, the element that failed transferred it’s load to the adjacent members, causing them to fail, and the whole structure to fail on pretty much a floor-wide basis. With a whole floor essentially severed, the whole building above that point fell down onto the floor below. That floor could not withstand the shock load of the whole building above landing on it, and failed as well. The process continued all the way down. It also caused the part of the building above the failure to collapse. Each time the upper part of the building landed on the highest uncollapsed floor, the uncollapsed upper part of the building was landing on the lowest uncollapsed floor in it as well, and they failed similarly. By the time the whole mass of rubble reached the ground, the upper portion of the building was as smashed up as the rest. This left the vast majority of the towers as remarkably small heaps of broken concrete and twisted metal."},{"instruction":"Should I get goats or chickens?

Understand your audience: Before creating any content, it's important to know who your target audience is and what they want to see. Consider their age, interests, preferences, and behaviors. 2. Keep it simple: Social media users have a short attention span, so it's best to keep your content short, sweet, and to the point. Use simple language and avoid complex jargon. 3. Use visual elements: Visual elements such as images, videos, and infographics can help your content stand out and make it more engaging. Make sure that your visuals are relevant and high-quality. 4. Be consistent: Regularly posting content can help keep your audience engaged and interested. Develop a content schedule and stick to it. 5. Be creative: Social media is a highly competitive space, so it's important to be creative and think outside the box. Experiment with different formats, styles, and topics to find out what resonates with your audience. 6. Engage with your audience: Don't just post content and walk away. Respond to comments, ask questions, and encourage discussion. This will help build a sense of community around your brand. 7. Monitor your performance: Keep track of your social media metrics such as engagement, reach, and conversions.

Moreover, at the time that life first emerged on Earth, Earth's atmosphere had almost no oxygen molecules in it. It was a reducing environment, as opposed to the current oxidizing environment. At the point when photosynthesizing microbes first emerged and started dumping oxygen into the atmosphere, there was a mass extinction of almost all other life, since those early life forms couldn't tolerate much oxygen.

In its late-70s, early 80s heyday, punk got lots of media attention but the general public much-preferred disco, AOR rock, and later on,(admittedly punk-influenced) New Wave power pop. I was in high school in the late 70s and while we knew about punk and sometimes saw punk rockers on the news, the general consensus was that punk sucked because the singers couldn’t sing and the musicians didn’t know how to play their instruments, unlike, say, such bands as Richie Blackmore’s Rainbow. Granted, we were provincials way out in the suburbs of Detroit, but still. By the end of my college freshman year I’d changed my mind and by the mid-80s I was frequently attending hardcore shows in downtown Detroit. But those shows were pretty underground as well, held in small venues and bars. No mid-80s hardcore band was going to replace the era’s true popular performers, the Madonnas and Princes, on the stage of Cobo Hall. But while in its original form punk was never truly popular, it’s parts certainly have been. Punk ideas revolutionized fashion and graphic design and completely altered the course of popular music for the next 20 years, or until Hip Hop ended rock and roll’s status as the culture’s default musical genre.

Here are the main differences between wireless and wired networks: 1. Connectivity: Wireless Network: In a wireless network, devices communicate using radio waves. They connect to the network through wireless access points, routers, or other wireless devices. Wi-Fi is a common technology used for wireless networking.Wired Network: In a wired network, devices are physically connected using cables, such as Ethernet cables. Data is transmitted through these cables using electrical signals. 2. Physical Infrastructure: Wireless Network: Wireless networks require fewer physical components since there are no cables involved. However, they do require wireless access points or routers to transmit and receive signals.Wired Network: Wired networks involve the installation of Ethernet cables, connectors, switches, and routers. These cables connect devices to the network infrastructure. 3. Mobility: Wireless Network: Wireless networks provide mobility since devices can connect to the network from various locations within the network's coverage area. Users can move freely within this range without losing connectivity.Wired Network: Devices in a wired network are physically connected to cables, limiting mobility. Users can only move as far as the cable length allows. 4. Speed and Reliability: Wireless Network: Wireless networks are subject to interference from other electronic devices, physical obstacles, and signal degradation over distance. This can lead to variations in signal strength and potentially slower speeds compared to wired connections.Wired Network: Wired connections are generally more reliable and consistent in terms of speed and performance since they are less susceptible to interference and signal loss. 5. Security: Wireless Network: Wireless networks are more susceptible to unauthorized access if not properly secured. Encryption and strong security protocols are necessary to prevent unauthorized users from connecting to the network.Wired Network: Wired networks are considered more secure due to the physical nature of the connection. Unauthorized access typically requires physical access to the network infrastructure. 6. Installation and Maintenance: Wireless Network: Wireless networks are easier to set up and require less physical installation. They are suitable for situations where running cables is impractical.Wired Network: Setting up wired networks involves the installation of cables and connectors, which can be more complex and time-consuming. However, once installed, wired networks generally require less maintenance. In summary, wireless networks provide mobility and convenience but can be subject to signal interference and security risks. Wired networks offer higher reliability, faster speeds, and enhanced security but require more physical infrastructure and limit mobility. The choice between the two depends on the specific needs, priorities, and constraints of the network environment and its users."},{"instruction":"w do I get my neighbor to accept the survey staking of our shared property line that is in dispute?

While it is essential to avoid generalizations, some potential factors may contribute to higher rates of depression among individuals in this generation. One significant factor is the changing socio-cultural landscape. This generation faces unique challenges and stressors that previous generations may not have experienced to the same extent. The digital age, with its pervasive influence of social media and constant connectivity, can create a culture of comparison, leading to feelings of inadequacy and a distorted sense of self-worth. The pressure to curate a perfect online image and the fear of missing out (FOMO) can contribute to heightened anxiety and depressive symptoms.

So, I don't think it wasn't an issue of how hard the turbines could be pushed. They probably could have configured the plane to produce more ramjet thrust. Rather, it was an issue of aerodynamic forces, and also maybe of a critical point where the supersonic shockwave would have entered the air inlets (I read that in an answer to a similar question on this site). I am sure you have seen those cones sticking out of air intakes? They manage air flow into the engines, and they are moved forward as speed increases. Their shape and adjustment range give a certain range of flight speeds, as any configuration is going to have a certain performance range. No one had supercomputers to model air flow back then. Even if they did, they had to make a plane that could take off and land from a runway. Hypersonic aircraft are darts that cannot produce enough lift at subsonic speeds to use runways. Also consider that Blackbirds are build mostly out of titanium, which has great fatigue properties, and temperature tolerance. But it is a much less stiff metal than any other structural metal. They didn't have much choice in the matter, as the temperatures the airframe were subjected to would have heated up aluminum alloys so much that they would have lost their stiffness. A very hot bird, in two different ways, but it was also not a very rigid bird. Airframe stress is always an issue, but when using a not very rigid metal, it is more critical. At least titanium will stand up to a lot more stress cycles than even steel, but that doesn't do you much good if the plane folds in half at supersonic speeds. They probably built the airframe to take anything that it would encounter at the thrust the engines would produce, but then if the engines were reconfigured to produce more thrust, the airframe would have to be reinforced. This adds more weight, and then the plane has to carry less fuel."},{"instruction":"What is the best love story people can come up with in two sentences?","output":"Here I share some: ‘Do you believe in magic?’ She whispered. ‘If these dazzling stars glistening in your iris are to be believed, then yes, I do’!

What is the speed of the pendulum bob as it passes through its lowest point?","output":"One way to answer this problem is in terms of kinetic and potential energy. Assuming that there is no energy loss (i.e. no friction or air resistance), the loss of potential energy of the pendulum bob as it swings from its initial position to its lowest point is equal to its gain in kinetic energy. For convenience, I will call the height of the pendulum bob at its lowest point height 0. Let h be the height of the pendulum relative to this base value. That is, h is the difference between the height of the pendulum bob (at a given time) and the height of the pendulum bob at its lowest point. Let m be the mass of the pendulum bob. Let g be the gravitational acceleration. Let v be the velocity of the pendulum bob. Since the string is said to be light, I will assume that the mass of the string is negligible. The string is 40 cm = 0.4 m in length and when it is released from rest, it is at an angle of 60° to the downward vertical. This means that when released the pendulum box is 0.4 m * (cos 60°) = 0.4m * 0.5 = 0.2 m below the top of the string. At its lowest point, the string is vericallv downwards, so the pendulum bob is 0.4 m below the top of the string. Hence the top of the string is 0.4 m above the pendulum bob when the latter is at its lowest point; in other words, the height of the top of the string is 0.4 m. So when the pendulum is released, h = 0.4 m -0.2 m = 0.2 m. As the pendulum a swings from its initial position to its lowest position, its height h decreases by 0.2 m, from 0.2m to 0. So it's loss of potential energy is equal to mg*0.2 m. Therefore its gain in kinetic energy is equal to mg*0.2 m. And since the pendulum bob is at rest when it is a released, its kinetic energy at that point in time is 0. So its kinetic energy at any given time is equal to its increase in kinetic energy from the moment it was released. Therefore its kinetic energy at the moment it passes through its lowest point is equal to mg* 0.2 m. Let g = 9.8 m/s^2. Then its kinetic energy at its lowest point is m*9.8m/s^2*0.2m = m*1.96(m^2)/(s^2). The kinetic energy of the pendulum bob is also equal to mv^2/2. So we have: mv^2/2 = m*1.96(m^2)/(s^2). So v^2 = 3.92 (m/s)^2. So v = sqrt [3.92 (m/s)^2]. So v = sqrt (3.92) m/s. So v is approximately equal to 1.98 metres per second."},{"instruction":"coaching really necessary for the NEET preparation?

I’m in long term treatment for CPTSD/share many traumatic childhood events. But for some reason I find comfort in imagining her sitting next to me&giving me a hug. Is this terrible?","output":"What’s terrible, and tragic, is that so many people have to live their lives craving some human touch!! And it’s also terrible that it’s so hard to find someone to trust enough to hug without taking chances. Because you trust your therapist, of course, you crave her affection. I can tell you that her hug would not feel enough. It could actually make you feel worse, needier, and it could even break the bond, because the type of hug you need, a therapist can’t give it to you. But you are not craving it, you are just imagining it, which is a good thing. One of the problems with emotional neglect in childhood is that it can go unnoticed forever. Kids need milk and dry clothes, but they also need affection. A kid that grows without affection will be always “hungry” with a type of hunger that is hard to satiate. Hugs, sex, money, success, spouses, children, etc., never seem enough to placate that need for human affection. It’s as if the skin were hungry. I call it emotional starvation. There are so many mothers that hardly caress their children. They are responsible and may feel and look like good mothers because they provide, but they are busy, distant, cold, and aloof to the emotional need of the baby. Young mothers nowadays have all sorts of objects to make their lives easier to transport their babies, to feed them, to change their diapers, to make diapers disappear, to warm the bottles, to teach the kids to feed, drink, self-soothe without the participation of the mother. But stores don’t sell any products that are conducive to giving affection to the baby, except maybe the skin-to-skin carriers like this one: But what you are describing in your question is actually great. The fact that instead of craving a hug, you imagine the therapist giving you one and finding comfort in it, shows that your therapist is doing a great job in reparenting you: she has helped you developing trust in her, and she has taught you to do self-soothing. There is nothing horrible about that! It’s actually very effective. I explicitly teach my clients to use images to imagine that affection. My favorite ones are angels. If you imagine one taking care of you, and putting you to sleep caressing your hair, for example, you’ll sleep like an angel yourself. So, congratulations to you and to your therapist. It sounds like you both are doing great progress in your healing process."},{"instruction":"w can I get my criminal record expunged or sealed in New Mexico?","output":"For expungements in New Mexico you must start the process with an attorney.

As it is usually retold, a crucial detail is left out of this box (or “closed elevator cab”) thought experiment. Freely floating in empty space is indistinguishable from falling in a homogeneous gravitational field. That is to say, a gravitational acceleration that does not vary from point to point. Realistic gravitational fields are not like that. The Earth’s gravitational acceleration diminishes with altitude. So yes, with sufficiently sensitive instrumentation, this difference could be measured even inside a relatively small box, and those instruments would unambiguously measure this gradient.

If Jeff The Killer was real; then Homicidal Liu/sully, Jane The Killer, Smile Dog, and Nina The Killer would be real because they all have something to deal with Jeff The Killer. Homicidal Liu/Sully is Jeff’s brother(s), Jane’s family was killed by Jeff The Killer, Nina is Jeff’s fan girl, and Smile Dog is Jeff’s pet. But if Jeff was real it would be dangerous. I’m a fan of Jeff but not enough to want him to be around, same thing with Jane The Killer, Homicidal Liu, Nina The Killer and Smile Dog. If Slenderman was real then Offenderman, Tranderman, Splendorman, Masky, Hoodie and Ticci Toby would be real since they have something to deal with Slenderman. Offenderman, Splendorman and Trenderman are his brothers, Masky, Hoodie and Ticci Toby are his proxy's. Slenderman might Be cool to have around, Idk about you but I want to be his proxy or adopted child (I’m not a fan girl). But there are gonna be down sides to having him around. Children would go missing and his brother Offenderman would be out raping people. So Slenderman would be nice but Offenderman no thanks. Trenderman and Splendorman are cool tho. Masky, Hoodie and Ticci Toby, I’m not sure about yet. If Laughing Jack was real, then my fear of clowns is going sky high! I kind of feel bad for him but he kills kids and replaces their organs with candy, that’s sick! No thanks LJ. If Eyeless Jack was real, I’d be cool with it if I was still his fan girl but having a kidney eating cannibal, no thanks. Sorry EJ. If Sally was real, well I’d be fine with that, she doesn’t kill people and she’s very sweet (in my opinion). If Bloody Painter was real I’d be fine as long as he doesn’t take my blood to paint, that’s, that’s not ok… If Zalgo was real, then I’d kill myself because he’s the worst. So if any of them would be real then I’d pick Slenderman, Trenderman, Splendorman, or Sally. Also to anyone I offended; I am sorry, I’m just talking smart, plus it’s like 2:30 AM and I can be smarter the later it is. I am a fan of Creepypastas and love them all, I’m just being smart.

Those who liked the White meat were genteel delicate sophisticated types who didn’t have to work themselves. Those who liked Dark meat liked to live on the wild side and might even lift a finger occasionally. Possibly. Of course that distinction is no longer apparent as thanks to intensive farming methods, those preferred by those who pick quantity over quality and profit over ethics, have eliminated a chickens need to roam free and work the muscles. The legend for calling the meats White and Dark is that the pearl clutching Victorian era Americans, those who had to cover the oh so erotically shapely table legs, were too precious to ask for Breast or Thigh meat.

Sadly due the fact the tales paint the Norman victors in a less than favouravble light, the stories have been downplayed and largely ignored. [LINKED_TEXT: Hereward the Wake - Wikipedia11th-century English rebel against the Norman Conquest Hereward the Wake Hereward fighting Normans, illustration from Cassell's History of England (1865) Born c. 1035 Died c. 1072 (aged 36-37) Other names Hereward the Outlaw and Hereward the Exile Movement English Anti-Norman rebellion Hereward the Wake (Traditional pronunciation /ˈhɛ.rɛ.ward/, [1] modern pronunciation /ˈhɛ.rɪ.wəd/ [2] ) ( c. 1035 – c. 1072 ) (also known as Hereward the Outlaw or Hereward the Exile ) was an Anglo-Saxon nobleman and a leader of local resistance to the Norman Conquest of England . His base when he led the rebellion against the Norman rulers was the Isle of Ely , in eastern England. According to legend, he roamed the Fens , which covers parts of the modern counties of Cambridgeshire , Lincolnshire and Norfolk , and led popular opposition to William the Conqueror . Hereward is an Old English name , composed of the elements here , \\"army\\", and ward \\"guard\\" (cognate with the Old High German name Heriwart ). [3] The epithet \\"the Wake\\", first recorded in the 14th century, may mean \\"the watchful\\" or derive from the Anglo-Norman Wake family , which later claimed descent from him. Primary sources [ edit ] Several primary sources exist for Hereward's life, but the accuracy of their information is difficult to evaluate. They are the version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle written at Peterborough Abbey (the \\"E manuscript\\" or Peterborough Chronicle ), the Domesday Book , the Liber Eliensis ( Latin 'Book of Ely') and, much the most detailed, the Gesta Herewardi . The texts are sometimes contradictory. For example, Gesta Chapter XXVIII places Hereward's attack on Peterborough Abbey after the Siege of Ely whereas the Peterborough Chronicle (1070) has it immediately before. This probably indicates, as the preface to the Gesta suggests, that conflicting oral traditions about Hereward were already current in the Fens in the late 11th and early 12th centuries. In addition, there may be some partisan bias in the early writers: the notice of Hereward in the Peterborough Chronicle , for instance, was written in a monastery , which he was said to have sacked, some fifty years after the date of the raid. [4] On the other hand, the original version of the Gesta was written in explicit praise of Hereward; [5] much of its information was provided by men who knew him personally, principally, if the preface is to be believed, a former colleague-in-arms and member of his father's former household named Leofric the Deacon . [6] Gesta Herewardi [ edit ] The Gesta Herewardi (or Herwardi ) is a Middle Latin text, probably written around 1109–31. [7] The 12th-century Latin text purports to be a translation of an earlier (and now lost) work in Old English , with gaps in the damaged original filled out from oral history . The earliest surviving copy of the Gesta Herewardi is in a manuscript produced around the middle of the 13th century at Peterborough Abbey , along with other materials relating to the abbhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereward_the_Wake] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereward_the_Wake]"},{"instruction":"Why is it called electrostatics if the charges are not that really at rest?

These are rock bolts. In this case they’ve been driven through chain link fencing to stop small debris from falling on passers by, but the chainlink isn’t needed to support the roof or wall, the bolts do that all by themselves. They do it by holding the rock within a few feet of the surface in compression. Most types of rock are incredibly strong in compression, but rather fragile in tension. Without the bolts (which are like expanding cement anchors but bigger), tiny fractures in the rock would grow until the roof collapsed. This is exactly what will happen if you spin up an asteroid made of silicate rock to anything approaching 1G, only it will happen in reverse. Every little fracture will open and spread until the asteroid falls apart. Indeed, this is what natural asteroid do when uneven solar heating causes them to spin up over a long period of time—they fly apart. To make this work, the entire outside of the asteroid would need to be riddled with rock bolts to hold it in compression and prevent cracks from spreading. And…that’s probably not going to work either, because it now looks like most asteroid are more floating gravel beds than rocky planetoids."},{"instruction":"What happens if a person who orders pizza takes the pizza and refuses to pay?","output":"The delivery person usually pulls out a Sig Sauer and shoots them."},{"instruction":"Can an employer continue to ask for help once an employee has resigned?","output":"Ask ?

Plus it is an obscenely hyper-processed substance. The main reason it got foisted on us was that, at the end of the Second World War, there were vast overstocks of seed vegetable oils that had been produced to make explosives, synthetic rubber and industrial lubricants. Not to mention the vast farms and factories involved. Corruption by seed oil companies such as Monsanto and fake research by the likes of Ancel Keys demonised good healthy fats such as butter, and seed oil margarine was touted as good for heart health. In fact cardiovascular disease exploded during the sixties and seventies as a result of this scam and recently other horrible ailments such as macular degeneration in the elderly can be traced to unnatural seed oils such as canola (rapeseed) ingestion.

A do-follow link is a type of link that search engines like Google can follow to reach a website. When a website links to another website using a do-follow link, it passes on \\"link juice\\" to that website, which can help to boost its search engine rankings. A no-follow link, on the other hand, is a type of link that instructs search engines not to follow the link to the linked website. When a website links to another website using a no-follow link, it does not pass on any link juice to that website. This is typically done to prevent spam or to indicate that the link is not an endorsement of the linked website. No-follow links are commonly used in user-generated content, such as blog comments and forums, to prevent spammers from using these platforms to build backlinks to their websites. They can also be used when linking to websites with low authority or those that may violate Google's webmaster guidelines. It's worth noting that while no-follow links do not pass on link juice, they can still be beneficial for driving traffic to your website if they are placed on high-traffic websites or if they generate clicks from users."},{"instruction":"Other than cheating, what's the biggest betrayal in a relationship?","output":"Disrespecting or disregarding their needs like time and attention intentionally and deliberately"},{"instruction":"What are some constraints on innovation that are preventing us from becoming the science fiction world so many movies predicted?","output":"Though I mostly agree with Dan Holliday, I’d also like to say that these things are holding us back from achieving more: Religion.

Sorry this is happening to you. When I was maid of honour I really did not like the dress. We sewed our own (I didn't mind that, mum could help if I got stuck or frustrated). She had picked 3 and it was the lesser of three evils. I complained to my mum, but never said a word to her. Why you may ask? It wasn't MY wedding. I was her best friend and this is what SHE wanted. It was HER wedding not mine. Mum didn't need to say a word really other than give me the LOOK, and say it's her wedding. Ya I know, the dress just isn't my cup of tea. I'd have NEVER thought to complain to the bride. Srsly who does that? Mum just nodded her head and off we went fabric shopping. It was a shiny slick pink material as she wanted. No idea what it was called. I was lucky as a blonde, and a late summer wedding, I was tanned and the colour worked for me. Did I pitch a fit no, I had a choice of 3 patterns she wanted in HER wedding. What would I do if a bridesmaid did that to me? I'd say it's my wedding not yours. She'd have a choice if I was feeling not to stressed. Wear it or don't be involved. At all! Those would be her options. However, if she caught me at a bad time, I'd likely say I'm sorry you feel that way. I was looking forward to you being in the bridal party and sharing my day. Thanx for the heads up. She'd be persona non grata at that point. Brides suffer to much crap from mum's mum in laws, aunt's, etc to have to deal w some uptight twit. The bridesmaid should've groaned under her breath and just accepted it. Now she's making drama? In something that is already loaded w drama and hidden landmines? I don't think so. She'd be kicked to the curb and not invited regardless of relationship. For some reason I'm tempted to quote Shakespeare, but I won't"},{"instruction":"Can someone who is wellinformed about guns tell me all the terminology related to guns? For example, magazines, clips, assault rifles, assault guns, assault weapons, ARs, etc.","output":"Every answer here so far is wrong. Not for most of the words you’ve requested definitions for, but predictably most of the answers here seem to blow past most of these terms to focus on the word “assault weapon,” and yet they get it wrong. All but one answer here has claimed that assault weapon is a ‘nothing term,’ a ‘buzzword,’ a ’meaningless word’. This is not true, it is a common expression used by people who have no substantial arguments for their views to discredit the opposition by saying that people who say “assault weapon” don’t know anything about guns and so should shut up and sit down. People who say that though are either liars or just ignorant. Assault Weapons were defined legally by the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act or Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 “Under the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994, the definition of ‘assault weapon’ included specific semi-automatic firearm models by name, and other semi-automatic firearms that possessed two or more from a set certain features: Semi-automatic rifles able to accept detachable magazines and two or more of the following: Folding or telescoping stockPistol gripBayonet mountFlash hider or threaded barrel designed to accommodate oneGrenade launcher Semi-automatic pistols with detachable magazines and two or more of the following: Magazine that attaches outside the pistol gripThreaded barrel to attach barrel extender, flash suppressor, handgrip, or suppressorBarrel shroud safety feature that prevents burns to the operatorUnloaded weight of 50 oz (1.4 kg) or moreA semi-automatic version of a fully automatic fire-arm. Semi-automatic shotguns with two or more of the following: Folding or telescoping stockPistol gripDetachable magazine.”"},{"instruction":"What hiking gear should I never buy?","output":"A pack because you like the way it looks and/or the features. Look for fit fiirst. If the pack doesn’t fit you properly, it can be somewhat uncomfortable at best and could really spoil your hike at worst. Find those packs that fit you properly, then worry the features and finally, the looks. If you find packs that fit you well then look for features next. If you find one with the proper fit and the features you want, go for it even if it is in the ugliest color you can imagine. Hiking is not meant to be a fashion show. Hiking boots/shoes because they had a 5 star review on a hiking/backpacking website, came highly recommended by a friend or some “expert” on an Internet site. Everybody’s feet are different. Shoes and boots that are perfect for one person may be living hell on the feet of another. Few things will spoil a hike faster than ill fitting shoes/boots. A tent that had great reviews but doesn’t fit your needs. A “four season” tent is a misnomer. They are appropriate for winter or perhaps summer camping at very high elevations. You will be miserable in one during the summer, spring and fall in most climates. They also tend to be on the heavy side. Even with three season tents (which means summer, fall and spring), consider where you will be camping. If you expect to camp in hot, humid climates, look for plenty of ventilation. If you are camping where summer temps may be fairly cool at night look for less ventilation. A sleeping bag that is too heavy or not appropriate for the seasons in which you usually hike. I can’t count the times I’ve encountered a backpacker on the trail with one of those cheap, bulky bags meant for car camping or sleepovers strapped to the outside of their pack. You don’t need a 20 degree bag if you are camping in July unless you are camping at high elevations. If you hike in multiple seasons, get a bag appropriate for each season. Cotton socks. Always choose wool, wool blend or synthetic socks for hiking. Cotton socks retain moisture and are a blister waiting to happen. Cotton clothing period. In cold temps, cotton can kill you (google “cotton kills”). Even in hot, humid conditions, synthetic clothing will feel cooler because it allows sweat to evaporate quickly."},{"instruction":"Which is the best position to sit in for studying?","output":"Hello There, Can u specify the age of the student, I mean is he/she in primary section or in secondary high-school.

I am about to show you a rather nice trick; a rather obvious trick, that is, which trick becomes obvious after years of experiencing and experimenting with open-source. It stems from the fact that the open-source world is as open as it is and allows you to experiment… in fact, it inherently supports and promotes experimenting, only to reward you at the end of your journey. That inherent openness is provided by it’s creators and maintainers: the open-source world is built on and through real needs, by solving real use cases through passion, rather than by various product managers and different overlapping and contradicting interests, which often land quite far from reality. Before I reveal my trick, let me introduce you to it. So, if you think about it, with sftp, you transfer data between hosts via a secure tunnel -, and, most of the times, you transfer files from a remote host to your local host. Through it’s execution, the sftp tool will do the following (in layman’s terms): parses and interprets command optionslogs in to remote host (in the background, contacts the remote sftp -server, authenticates)passes on the details around the file to transfer to the remote hostawaits for the remote sftp server to send dataopens local filewrites received data to local filecloses connection ; closes file I highlighted an interesting step above, which is the basis of the trick I am describing. Before I reveal the essence of my trick, let me highlight to (or, rather, remind) you that in Linux and in most open-source environments, everything is a file. Now, and here’s the trick: what if the ‘local target file’ I set on the command line of the sftp is /dev/stdout? Yes. As simple as that. You have sftp transfer the remote file directly to your local standard output. As a result, the contents of the remote file will appear on your local standard output, without having to transfer and allocate first (taking up space locally) and then, conveniently, you simply grep in a separate second command, locally. Now, finally, all you have to do to answer the opening question is to pipe the sftp command with /dev/stdout into grep, which, locally, will do its job wonderfully. Do you find it a nice (and obvious trick)? Upvote if yes. Enjoy. Thanks :) PS: here is an example command line for the above: sftp -q user@remotehost.com:path/to/file.txt /dev/stdout 2>/dev/null | grep -e \\"filterexpression\\" Note two things about my example command above: “-q” that option will silence sftp so that session messages from sftp are superseded and not interfering with the file output on /dev/stdout“2>/dev/null” also superseding error messages, for the same purpose With the above two, you can then expect to see only the contents of the file on the standard output, ready for your grep. PS2: the file data to be transferred being mainly text-only (“grep-able”), I strongly recommend adding the “-C” switch to toggle on compression on the transfer. You should not worry about getting compressed data to stdout (so, “ungrep-able”), because in our case, /dev/stdout acts like a file destination file, and so sftp will be making sure internally that decompressed data gets into the destination “file”."},{"instruction":"Can a squirrel scratch give you rabies?","output":"Thanks for the A2A. Its decades since I left Rabies Research. To my knowledge any creature in the wild which bites, scratches or licks you has the potential to transmit rabies. The Lyssa Bodies ( also called Negri bodies) is found in bats, rats, cats, squirrels, wild dogs and pigs . The risk of infection is too great. The incubation period for the rabies virus stretched from 10 days to 6 months! I remember only one case where the symptoms went as far as two years. It is so much safer to take the vaccines and stay on top of hydrophobia.Those vaccines are designed to ward of infection. Once the virus grows there is very little chance your body can generate enough antibodies to stave off the deadly disease. To my knowledge the fatality rate is 100% Tell you doctor to read up on the latest literature or you do that yourself and be satisfied. The risk is not worth it. Take the injections. Stay safe."},{"instruction":"After losing everything that you own, what would you do?","output":"You learn a lesson from it. \\"Do what you can, with what you have, where you are.\\" Theodore Roosevelt, ex-president of the United States.

The financial industry is interesting because there are very few players consolidating a vast number of consumers, with low margins but a huge daily recurring volume of transactions. Finance + Tech = nirvana. Unfortunately, social media companies in the US are facing insurmountable regulatory hurdles, and are possibly not a cultural fit for finance. First things first: Banking is a highly regulated industry, and the appeal is a clear set of rules by which to operate. There is nothing more disconcerting to a software developer than fuzzy logic, irrational emotion, and the marketing types…! AI is supposed to bridge that gap, but better consumer purchasing modeling based on limiting consumer choice eventually bites its own tail. “Now we know what the customer wants before the customer wants it…!” And then the marketers will tell you the exact opposite: “People buy only when we create demand for the consumer good in question…” The fetish object producing creatives are right of course. The appeal of a clear regulatory landscape, is more than a technologist can ignore. But then again, the regulatory landscape is a reflection of the existing power structure. That is what makes it hard to scale for a non financial player. EU GDPR makes it impossible for a startup to comply with the regulatory burden. That is what legislated relegation does: it burns in the monopolist’s profit expectation in legislative requirements. That is why social media companies want regulation, it locks in their advantage and mandates regulations built around their existing internal processes. By the same token, hyper successful social media companies are being excluded from the financial market by the regulatory framework the banks built to protect their businesses. Banks have had since 1913 to perfect the model. An individual with 500k to invest is a no money liability for most large brokerage firms. You would need to manage thousands such clients before it starts to make sense financially. Okay, I’m exaggerating, but if all you got is 100k to invest they will offer you a selection of mutual funds, and call you once a year. The breakeven point is somewhere between those two data points. Seven figure accounts require real people skills, because they have options. The credit card business is a volume game. A very large volume game, one that can only be played with neck breaking financial leverage. Its the failure to understand the scale, that has haunted the software industry. They do not get that a 500k deposit is a liability, and they do not understand how to manage 5m consumers maxing out their credit cards. The issue of scale has yet to be worked out in the digital exosphere. The social media companies have created a social media culture built around certain aspirational ideals. The result is a lack of pragmatism. Here is a perfect example of how aspirational ideals fail to scale the financial system: Last week the tech press was all indignant when Apple Co-Founder Wozniak went on a social media tirade after he learnt that the Apple Card, a GS product, gave him 20X the credit line that his wife got. That of course prompted the usual social media calls for a gender discrimination suit. But here is the list of his ex wifes: Alice Robertson (1976–80); Candice Clark (1981–87); Suzanne Mulkern (1990–2004); and Janet Hill, the offended spouse that he married in 2008. Now lets call this out: I am absolutely 100% certain that Wozniak had all his better halfs, sign a prenuptial agreement. Which means they are at most entitled to 1/20 of his wealth. Credit decisions are based on facts, not on aspirational goals. Meanwhile, in Amazonia the soon to be the ex Ms Bezos is worth every penny of her credit line, not that she needs it. The good news is that the big social media players have failed to make serious inroads into the financial world. Which means that there is room for smaller startups to come up with new ideas, technology and platforms. With one caveat, namely that they will have to deal with established players. Software engineers selling to software engineers is a model that works well. Selling to consumers is marketing driven, and most technically minded people completely fail to understand marketing. Absent marketing you cannot sell to consumers. Those that mastered social media did spectacularly well, for the rest of the technical community, social media and marketing proved a hard obstacle to overcome. You could say the same about financial engineers, but the industry was developed around brokerage activities, and that’s a sales driven activity, so they know the score and how to run the numbers. The emotional appeal for software engineering types, is that they are selling to highly intelligent financial engineers that take decisions based on rational empirically verified data. If the numbers work, it is bought. Price elasticity does not exist if the product produces quantifiable returns. Its the absence of fetish creation, aspirational goals, and highly charged emotive externalities that appeals to the tech industry. If one trader gets a quantifiable benefit from the technology, everybody else on the floor follows suit. If it makes more money than it costs, its a buy. Financial players understand that time is money, and they have no problem paying for training and rapid customization. The Venture Capital industry is full of people trained in finance. On Wall Street only results matter, and you eat what you kill. It only follows that the mind set has utility in the allocation of capital to risky ventures. It makes even more sense that once they have some experience with technical innovation, scaling technology, technology at scale, and entrepreneurship that they should go back and apply those skills to financial engineering. The VC industry has deep roots in, and extensive networks to tap into. It follows that investment follows knowledge, and it follows that knowledge would seek out the investment. There are extensive network externalities that make the process efficient. A corporate sale can take six months, only for cash to be allocated in the following calendar year. Consumer marketing initiatives can take more than a year before bearing fruit. Financial sales happen allot faster and propagate within the organization much faster if the value add is there. Its part of the trader mentality, you throw bacon at the oil, and if it sizzles it sizzles, and everybody wants some. What makes investors impatient is the not knowing whether the product has a market or not. You get a shorter feedback mechanism in finance. What nobody in finance likes is throwing good money after bad money. In finance you know pretty quickly if the value add is there, and how much somebody will part to acquire that edge. With consumer corporates, the product has to be 3–5X better before it will replace the incumbent product supplier. In finance even a marginal improvement gets funded. The financial industry will replace all the riffles if it finds a better bullet. Follow the money, and you will find the financial engineers. Finance is where the money is at. Fintech is not a social media play. Right now, its VC talent, hard fast engineering talent and established banking. The VC ecosystem is a perfect bridge between the two worlds. There could not possibly be a better time to do a fin-tech startup. And that is my story and I am sticking to it. Thanks for the ask."},{"instruction":"What is ताजमहल किस नदी के किनारे स्थित हैं?","output":"यमुना नदी के दक्षिण तट पर"},{"instruction":"Do you have a different opinion on climate change?","output":"Climate change is a scientifically documented phenomenon that involves long-term changes in Earth's climate patterns, including rising average temperatures, shifts in precipitation patterns, and more frequent and intense extreme weather events. The overwhelming consensus within the scientific community is that climate change is primarily driven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels and deforestation. The consequences of climate change are far-reaching and can impact ecosystems, weather patterns, sea levels, biodiversity, and human societies. Efforts to address climate change typically involve a combination of mitigation (reducing greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation (building resilience to its impacts). Addressing climate change is a global challenge that requires international cooperation, policy changes, technological advancements, and individual actions. The urgency to combat climate change stems from its potential to disrupt ecosystems, economies, and the well-being of current and future generations. It's important to stay informed about the latest scientific research and to support initiatives that aim to reduce emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, protect vulnerable communities, and promote sustainable practices to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

To learn more on how to lose weight and supplements [LINKED_TEXT: Click here] [URL: https://mssg.me/lossweight2023] Here are some strategies to consider, but it's important to consult a healthcare professional before making any drastic changes to your diet or exercise routine: 1. Create a calorie deficit: To lose weight, you need to consume fewer calories than you burn. Aiming for a calorie deficit of 500-1000 calories per day can help you lose about 1-2 pounds per week. 2. Eat a balanced diet: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods that are nutrient-dense and low in calories. Include a variety of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats in your meals. Avoid sugary beverages and limit your intake of high-fat and high-calorie foods. 3. Portion control: Pay attention to portion sizes and practice mindful eating. Use smaller plates, measure your food, and avoid eating in front of screens to prevent mindless overeating. 4. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Water can help you feel full and may boost your metabolism. 5.

Well … you can fail to learn the lesson. The students are kinda told it’s a test, in a way… so that they will be committed to trying to complete the mission. ie. their instructors are lying to them. (That’s Kirk’s complaint in the Kelvin timeline.) It seems more that it is a scenario in a collection of simulations cadets are expected to try as part of their training. Being included in the set invites the inference that it is doable. The point of the lesson is that students cannot achieve the specified mission objectives… they need to come to terms with this, and, as a result, grow as leaders. Become more mature and grown up. Have a more balanced and grounded viewpoint. The only way to “fail” is to achieve the mission objectives. In fact… the exercise has failed it’s purpose if students think of it as a pass/fail situation. Crews are not failing if they do not rescue the Kobiashu Maru.

Some hotels consciously recycle their soaps (have them sent to recycle centers) eg IHG and Hilton There are also a few organizations that collect used toiletries for recycling, e.g. Clean the World, Clean Conscience. Smaller or local hotel chains have usually have a “on demand” policy that eliminates excess from the point of origin, they provide toiletries only when asked for. And then too their products are the very tiniest single or dual use type - which means that any excess is minimal. Some frugal hotel owners press the used bars together to be used by their staff later on, or make a solution of the leftover soaps to be used in cleaning toilets.

He couldn’t believe his luck and was elated beyond his imagination. Before winning the lottery Billy, a former marine had lost his 12 year old job as a print shop manager and was working with Home Depot as a stocking agent for the past 3 years. Married with 3 children, a highly religious man — he was barely able to make ends meet. Winning the lottery changed his life. But a series of poor decisions made him lose it all. Let’s take a look👇🏾 The lottery company was supposed to pay Billy 25 annual instalments of 1.24 Million. This is a significant windfall. However, Billy had other ideas. He… — Donated 10% of his money to his Church. — Couldn’t say “NO” to other churches when they approached him for more money. — Bought 480 turkeys for needy families. — Bought a ranch, a few houses for his family, and new cars for himself, his wife and his kids. — Found a new girlfriend and to impress her he bought her expensive gifts, cars, jewellery, etc. — Couldn’t control his spending. He agreed to pay 6 Million in 10 years to a fraudulent company to access a lump sum loan of 2.25 Million immediately. This string of poor decisions started impacting his relationships. His wife decided to separate and divorce him 8 months after winning the lottery. The pressure kept mounting and Billy shot himself in May 1999. Less than 2 years since he won one of the biggest lotteries the world has known. What can we learn from this? Billy, let the winnings get to his head. He did not have to work hard to earn his windfall and he Didn’t know how to handle successHad a hard time managing his relationships. He couldn't differentiate the important from the not so importantWasn’t sure how to manage the change in his financial conditionDidn’t value the money he earned When success takes a long time to come, it provides you Lessons along the way to handle failure & struggleWith tools and a mindset to manage your emotionsUnderstanding to value the money and successInsight and confidence regarding how to get there if needed all over again Moral of the story: BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR.

It is obviously sexist, but I cannot see racist undertones in it.","output":"As others have said “If” is not racist (or sexist for that matter being addressed to his son Jack). However Kipling is regarded by many as racist and imperialist (often by people who haven’t read him), and therefore verboten; his poem “White man’s burden” is often regarded as proof of this, whilst a couple of his stories have disparaging comments about Jewish people. The issue is do we ban work by writers whose views are at odds with those of the educated Western elite? Off the top of my head Shakespeare, Marlowe and Dickens all have horrible Jewish stereotypes in their work, do we ban these writers? And many other great writers also have viewpoints that I find uncomfortable. Looking into the future; presumably many of our present lauded writers will in fifty or hundred years appear to offend the mores of that time. Kipling wrote many great stories and poems (although I find “If” trite and childlike), and unfortunately he is undervalued now, and even was towards the end of his life."},{"instruction":"Would you vote me for president?","output":"President of what?"},{"instruction":"w do Democrats explain the peerreviewed paper on the 4 hidden algorithms found in the NY voter rolls using multiple obfuscation techniques built into the system?","output":"Not a democrat.

But I felt that the 2016 Tamil film called Joker is underrated in terms of popularity in TN. Ofcourse it has rated as 8.4 in IMDB rating. Hence it's not considered as underrating. But it's not popular as it was expected by Tamil audience is my opinion. What a simple story line and the exposure of an ordinary person's life in harsh conditions is tremendous. Joker is not simply funny term but a harsh reality in this movie. Please do watch. And I love the below song which reverberates in mind with nice feeling. It reflects the life of an ordinary Indian in this simple yet powerful song."},{"instruction":"Are antiabortion laws Godly?","output":"Many good answers here.

At first glance, it seems like just having one isotope of each element shouldn’t cause any problems. Now, you could randomly pick a radioactive isotope (like only H-3 for hydrogen), but that’s a little too easy (not that I normally mind that sort of thing). If we pick just stable isotopes, though, life should soldier on without incident. But what fun is that? How am I going to ruin everyone’s future just by eliminating isotopes? By preventing the universe from creating heavy elements…naturally. Stellar nucleosynthesis - Wikipedia [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis ] You see, without different isotopes, hydrogen fusion just doesn’t work. You need both protium and deuterium to make it possible for hydrogen to fuse into helium. From there, the helium fuses into carbon and all of the heavier elements of which planets, rocks, and people are largely made. No deuterium? No life."},{"instruction":"What is the most misunderstood picture that has become famous (or infamous)?","output":"Fair warning - there's a disturbing albeit familiar image in this answer. . . . . . . . Most of you may remember this image. It is a grisly, iconic, Pulitzer Prize-winning photo from the Vietnam War that shocked the world. My eyes were always strangely drawn to the Executioner, General Nguyen Ngoc Loan. The blend of his menacing face, the nonchalance in shooting the man, one must wonder, what leads a person down this path to villainy? How could one so quickly kill a bound, unarmed prisoner? Upon my further investigation - this might be one of the most misunderstood photos in history. The plainly dressed victim might resemble a normal pedestrian - but he was no ordinary prisoner. He was the leader of a Vietcong death squad, that had infiltrated Saigon with the express purpose of assassinating a long list of people. He had personally executed several military officers and their entire families. He was found standing over a grave with 34 bodies in it, that included women and children that had been killed execution style. Following this famous photo, Loan continued fighting in the war for several years. He was later injured, losing one leg. Loan and his wife eventually escaped to the US. Where he had 5 children and owned a restaurant in Virginia. But his life was haunted by the photo that was taken of him as he was held up as a standard bearer for the evils of war. Loan's property was frequently vandalized and he was targeted by various outlets over the years. The photographer, Eddie Adams, was deeply regretful of ever having taken the picture. He knew Loan well and stated that he was a good man and misrepresented. Adams felt he captured two deaths in that photo: that of the victim and that of Loan. And - to be clear - this answer is not an attempt to absolve this man of all blame. This is dark stuff. However, what Loan did was not far beyond the bounds of what other soldiers were doing. War is and has always been hell. To pretend it is anything less is to pretend fire isn't hot. So before making demons of men, remember: given the wrong circumstances, we are all capable of terrible things. After all, we are human."},{"instruction":"w can a piece of paper folded 103 times be larger than the observable universe?","output":"2^103 is a ridiculously large number, so taking an imaginary sheet of paper that is say 0.05 mm thick, that’s 5*10^29 mm, 5*10^23km, and one light year is 10^13 km. 1 billion light years are 10^22 km, still fifteen times smaller than our paper tower, which rises 15 billion light years.

It still has tons of room to grow. There are always speed bumps in Silicon Valley's growth, as there are in every economy’s. Currently the biggest issues are traffic congestion and insufficient housing. Traffic jams on weekends are now very common, and rush hour congestion is terrible. This drains productivity and quality of life. The very high housing prices, rent, and the bidding wars to get housing are getting out of hand. It is normal and healthy to have a downturn. That pullback gives housing, highways and public transit time to catch up. It also forces weak companies out of business. I would not be surprised to see a one or two year recession soon. After that I would expect to see strong continued growth. Why do I predict more growth? For all the same reasons that SV is so strong now: diverse, technical workforce, innovative spirit, access to VC, modern, open management philosophy, etc. all in the world's most perfect climate."},{"instruction":"LPU good for taking admission in the CSE branch?","output":"Computer science encompasses the study of various topics such as languages, programming, algorithms, program designing and software designing. The field of computer science has its roots embedded in subjects such as maths, electrica engineering and linguistics.

They often write codes for softwares, electrical devices such as printers, modems and scanners to name a few. They also write codes for operating systems such as Windows and Linux. Computer engineering is a branch of study where individuals design and develop various technological devices and computer systems. They basically research, design & develop processors, motherboards, circuit boards, memory devices, routers and test computer systems. A computer engineer works to integrate the developed components into network systems and computers as per the respective requirement.

I am assuming you live with your dog and therefore see and touch him every day. So if your dog was making you sick, you would never get better (no breaks in between illnesses) unless you got rid of your dog. However, this is not the case.

Perhaps that’s because a luxury car loses value through depreciation even more rapidly than does a vehicle with a lower MSRP. But there’s a cost to having the latest and greatest all the time. “You’re paying only for that part of the car’s lifetime that you’ll be using’” is a common claim. That’s true, but it’s the most *expensive* part of the car's lifetime. And this greater loss ends up being paid for by the person doing the leasing. The fact so many ordinary cars are leased is an indication either that 1) most people are very well off today, or 2) there are too many people out there living beyond their means, and who will suffer for this later when they can’t afford to retire. The classic case was a guy calling in on the radio, who had purchased a 55,000 truck on a 44,000 annual income. A huge number of people run up debt they’ll never be able to repay. Leasing can be a factor in this… people living a far wealthier person’s lifestyle, who might regret their actions later, when it’s too late. The average person would do well to buy either a new car or a certified used car, and keep it at least 7 or 8 years. Plus, I think people concerned about their financial future should buy a car with an MSRP price not exceeding half their gross income."},{"instruction":"w do I analytically analyse an engine’s cooling system?","output":"The purpose of the cooling system is to remove excess combustion heat from the engine block and cylinder head. The efficacy of the system is determined by comparing performance to design criteria. If you don’t have the design criteria, you can do real time testing. From cold start at average ambient temperature and moderate speed, it should take 5 to 8 minutes to come to operating temperature.Begin at normal operating temperature, average ambient temperature, and moderate speed; increase speed by 10 mph steps; observe if there is a rise in operating temperature. There should be no increase in the first three speed increase steps. There may be a slight increase in the fourth speed step. This is normal.At full operating temperature; park the car in an area that is sheltered from any wind. Block the wheels and set the parking brake; place automatic transmission in drive; run the engine with AC on for 10 minute periods. There should be no increase in engine temperature for the first two periods and a slight rise in the next two. This is normal.At the end of the last test; if you can safely do so; still in drive gear; increase the engine RPM by 300 to 400 RPM for two more 5 minute periods. The temperature will increase some with each period of time, but should not approach the temperature warning point (usually 240 to 250 degrees F). AT THE END OF THIS TEST, RETURN TO PARK, RELEASE THE PARKING BRAKE, UNBLOCK THE WHEELS, AC OFF, AND DRIVE FOR 10 MINUTES AT MODERATE SPEED. The aggregate of these tests will give a good indication of the “health” of the cooling system."},{"instruction":"meone ever thought about creating a cyber security company that brings security tools for free (just like the opposite thing of Metasploit)?","output":"Q: Has someone ever thought about creating a cyber security company that brings security tools for free (just like the opposite thing of Metasploit)?

He nods his appreciation of it, and gets on with his business. That's what wine etiquette dictates. Appreciate the wine, and then get on with your business. Why does this happen? Because people want to make everything bigger and fancier than it needs to be. I love a great glass of wine, a delicious meal, a beautiful work of art, or anything else enjoyable.

This means that the light we observe from distant objects has been traveling for billions of years to reach us.There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on Earth. It's estimated that there are about 1 billion trillion stars in the observable universe.The human brain is the most complex structure known in the universe. It consists of approximately 86 billion neurons that form trillions of connections, allowing for extraordinary cognitive abilities.Time dilation occurs in areas of high gravitational force. As a result, time passes more slowly near a massive object, such as a black hole. This phenomenon has been confirmed through experiments and observations.The deepest part of the ocean, the Mariana Trench, reaches a depth of about 36,070 feet (10,994 meters). It is deeper than the height of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth.A teaspoon of a neutron star would weigh about 10 million tons. Neutron stars are incredibly dense remnants of massive stars, and their gravity is immensely strong.The average adult human body is made up of about 7 octillion (7 followed by 27 zeros) atoms. These atoms come together to form molecules, cells, and complex biological systems.The Great Barrier Reef, located off the coast of Australia, is the largest living structure on Earth and can be seen from space. It is made up of billions of tiny organisms called coral polyps.A hummingbird's heart can beat up to 1,260 times per minute. Their rapid heart rate enables them to hover and move swiftly.Quantum entanglement allows particles to become connected in such a way that the state of one particle instantaneously affects the state of another, regardless of the distance between them.

This is obviously lighter and less complex than a retractable nose wheel. Most single engine fighters had no room in the nose for undercarriage, an obvious exception being the P-39 Airacobra which had the engine behind the pilot. An aircraft like the Spitfire had extremely thin wings, with the undercarriage stored in the wings. To fit, they had to be in the deepest part of the aero foil, near the front of the wing.

[LINKED_TEXT: Introduction to Web AccessibilityIntroduction to Web Accessibility You are here: Home > Articles > Introduction to Web Accessibility Article Contents Introduction People with Disabilities on the Web Implementing Web Accessibility Principles of Accessible Design Conclusion Introduction Most of us can hardly conceive of life without the internet. Some have argued that no other single invention has been more revolutionary since Gutenberg's printing press in the 1400s. The world can be “at your fingertips” at the click of a mouse—if you can use a mouse... and see the screen... and hear the audio. The Web Offers Unprecedented Opportunities The internet is one of the best things that has ever happened to people with disabilities. Recall the pre-internet days: How could blind people read printed newspapers? They could travel to a library for an audio tape or bulky Braille version, or they could ask someone to read to them at home. This made blind people dependent upon others, but it was all we could do. Today we can do better. Screen reader software is designed to read online content aloud. Blind people no longer need to rely on others to read to them. They simply open a browser and interact with content independently, on their schedule, and as soon as the content is published. People with motor disabilities interact with online content using assistive devices that map their abilities to their hardware. Some are simple, like a mouth wand to interact with the keyboard. Others are more sophisticated, such as alternative keyboards, or eye-tracking software that allows people to use a computer with nothing more than eye movements. People who are deaf or hearing-impaired rely on captions and transcripts of multimedia. Many people with cognitive disabilities also benefit greatly from the structure and flexibility of web content. Falling Short of the Web's Potential The web's great potential for people with disabilities remains largely unrealized . For example, some sites can only be navigated using a mouse, and some multimedia is not captioned. What if you can’t use a mouse? What if you can't hear the audio? As soon as we begin asking these types of questions, we begin to see how the internet can create barriers to people with disabilities—harming the internet's potential, frustrating users ( customers ), and leaving them dependent on others. However, once we recognize the barriers, we can begin to remove them. People with Disabilities on the Web One in four adults in the United States has a disability. Although not all disabilities impact internet use, businesses would be unwise to purposely exclude 25, 15, or even five percent of their potential customers. In education and government, in many cases it is illegal discrimination . Disability Categories Visual Blindness, low vision, color‑blindness. Auditory Deafness and hard-of-hearing. Motor Inability to use a mouse, slow response time, limited fine motor control.

Is life easier? What are the advantages you feel you have over others? Are there any disadvantages?","output":"I never struggled to learn anything. The hardest is to grasp the concept of whatever it is, after that learning the details is very intuitive. It just happens with Introverted Intuition of INTJ with an 155 IQ score. Whenever there is a problem to solve I just mind in the solution and it appears in the thoughts as if I was “searching” the mind until finding it out, so many eurekas. The problem is my cognitive blindspot which is how to properly interact according to social protocols which I have no idea, I stumble on something fragile here and there inevitably. Duty and service I also have no idea, how to properly do the basics of these common natural traits most people have. Many people belive I am evil because of the way I sound when talking and I also have the “death” stare when talking with people sometimes more often than not. Many people who were my friends just assumed I am a bad person and treated me as if I had done something to them. Sometimes its the factual reality of the truth I speak about how the world works makes people mad at me. I also see an intense difference of level between me and everybody else. Most proccesses behind the scenes are intuitive and obvious to me while people think otherwise and mostly will buy the general common version of how things work. I look at people on the bus and on the street doing things, at their homes with their lives and I find it too extremely unbearably simple… I talk to myself about those common things and it is just so stupid. There is something extremely letharging about society advancing and it is the way it should be ( or perhaps not because depending on most 95% of people we’d be stull in medieval ages). Most people are not smart and have boring personalities ready to ‘duty and service’ and this requires monolithic societies with lots of irrational ritualistic dogmas ( even dinner is a dogmatic ritual that has to always be the same ). And the people who are more rational, are also completely arrogant and rude ( and stupid).

Cryptocurrency investments may provide high returns, but also carry a high level of risk.

No investment is guaranteed, so it's important to approach cryptocurrency with caution and a long-term mindset. Market volatility: Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and prices can fluctuate rapidly, making them a risky investment.Legal and regulatory risks: Governments worldwide have yet to come to a consensus on how to regulate cryptocurrencies, making it uncertain for investors.Security risks: Cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets can be vulnerable to hacks and cyber-attacks, potentially leading to loss of funds.Liquidity: The market for cryptocurrencies is still relatively small, making it difficult to sell large amounts without affecting the market price.Lack of adoption: Despite their growing popularity, cryptocurrencies are still not widely accepted as a means of payment and have limited real-world use cases.Scams and frauds: The crypto market is plagued with fraudulent projects, ICO scams, and other forms of financial deceit.Expertise: Understanding how cryptocurrencies work and how to assess their potential requires a certain level of technical expertise.Market trends and future development: The future of cryptocurrencies is uncertain, and their success will depend on factors such as technological advancements, wider adoption, and regulatory developments.

It can be hard to find examples of human willpower, but one of the best is overcoming addiction. Addiction can take many forms, but it usually involves a person becoming dependent on something that is harmful to them, such as porn, drugs or alcohol. Quitting an addiction can be incredibly difficult, but those who have done so often cite willpower as the main reason they were successful. Sticking to a difficult diet is another good example of human willpower. Diets can involve many sacrifices, including giving up foods we love or skipping meals. Most people give up on diets after just a few days or weeks, but those who stick with them are demonstrating incredible willpower. Those who lose weight and keep it off are also a testament to the power of willpower. Finally, quitting a bad habit is also a great example of human willpower in action. Bad habits can be hard to break, especially if you're used to doing them regularly. But if you have enough determination, it's possible to quit smoking or drinking alcohol, even if it's difficult at first.

Kannadigas have built one the richest & greatest empire in world - Vijayanagara empire.We have built greatest & one of the largest empire in India - Rastrakutas.We have built finest and architectural marvels of the world - Kailasanatha temple (in Maharashtra now), Hoysala temples, Hampi group of monuments, Pattadakallu GoM.We have classical dance known as Yakshagana (2000 years world, first mentioned in Shathavahana dynasty), Purandara Dasa is father of Carnatic music.Immadi Pulikeshi is the only ruler of South India to defeat greatest North Indian empire. (Harshavardhana). But we are unable to find anything (or very less) about them in central government text books. Rahul Dravid, Anil Kumble, Javagal Shreenath, Chandrashekar, Kirmani (cricketers) & other player like Joshna Chinnapa (squash), Pankaj Advani (Billiards) they represented India wholly without any religion identity. (Like Tala or Mumbaikar or typical Dilli attitude guys) There is no North-South division in Karnataka, We are not anti-Hindi gang, We are not Communists, We don’t kill anyone in the name of cow, No Tukde Tukde gang in Karnataka, So we won’t be in Prime Time debate. When most of the Kannadigas migrate to other parts of India, we become one among them without any language/culture barrier. When most the non-Kannadigas migrate to Karnataka we welcome them whole heartedly and make them feel home without any language chauvinism. Karnataka has many stalwarts like Narayan Murthy, CNR Rao, Kiran Kumar (ISRO), Field Marshal Cariappa, General Thimmayya, C B Muthamma (first women civil servant), Kuvempu, Dr. Raj, Girish Karnad, S L Bhyrappa, Mallikarjun Mansur, Pandit Bhim Sen Joshi & many more who identified them as more Indian than Kannadiga. If you go north Karnataka you can survive by knowing Marathi, If you go to South Eastern part of Karnataka you can survive if you know Telugu, In Bengaluru you can survive by language. We Kannadigas have not imposed our Kannadiga Identity on Kodavas, Tulu Nadu & Tibetians living in refugee camps. Karnataka is mini India, we believe in “unity in diversity”. It’s not that we are not proud of our language, in fact we have got 8 Jnanapapeeta awards and Kannada books have best market in India. It’s not that we are not proud of our culture/traditions, we can see age old practices which are still intact.

So, what should I give them to eat? I feed like 45 of them once/twice a week, need some recommendations?","output":"Parle G and other types of biscuits have xylitol or added sugars in them which can affect stray dogs. However, the immunity of strays is stronger than domesticated dogs, hence you will find most strays are fed biscuits on the streets. If you want to feed in bulk, like you mentioned for 4–5 strays, check if you can get rice (jaade tandul) which absorbs more water from the local grocer. Might cost you Rs 40 or some such. Take 2 katoris of the rice, add diced carrots, sweet potato and beans and lots of water. Pressure cooker it for 2–3 whistles. Do not add salt but you can add a pinch of turmeric. Second option, same quantity of rice in the pressure cooker, let it cook for two whistles and once you open it add 3-4 eggs in the boiling water. Dogs love this eggy smell. Serve once its cool to your stray pets. You can replace rice with dalia too. Actually I read this on a blog on [LINKED_TEXT: Wiggles] [URL: https://bit.ly/2ySpURy], that’s the reason I was able to come up with these answers. My pug’s name is Summer and we often feed the strays in my locality.

Even the kids in grade school know how to make a muscle; they immediately raise and bend their arm — to show you their bicep (muscle), and when one thinks with that simplicity and clarity, “results” are not only possible, but inevitable. What’s lost in all the broscience jargon on exercise is that results must be produced because of the greatest difference achieved between a full contraction alternated with a full relaxation of any muscle because that change in muscular states produce a flow — which is the simplicity of how the heart works infallibly. If the heart just contracts and never relaxes, then one is dead, and if the heart merely relaxes and never contracts, one is also dead. It is the change from one muscular state to the other, that is life-giving — and that is what one is hoping to achieve in any effort — change. So obviously, if one is doing the same thing over and over and never producing any change, obviously, they are not doing anything “significant” by which change is measured. It doesn’t matter how much weight is being lifted for how many times; what matters to produce the health effect, is how effectively one can fully contract and fully relax a particular muscle — because that action, is enhancing the flow (circulation) from that area (volume) back towards the heart — which is the weakness of the human body — particularly in sedentary lifestyles in which there is little articulation of the skeletal muscles that affect the flow back towards the heart — thereby creating the space for the heart to pump blood into it, with as little effort as possible. This is desirable because the heart is always the hardest working — and in sedentary lifestyles — often the only muscle working, but it can’t do the work of the circulation alone. The heart only pumps blood out to the extremities; that contraction of the skeletal muscles at the extremities produce the motive force for blood returning towards the heart, and in sedentary people, is often nonexistent, and in others, tends to degrade in time in what is known as venous insufficiency (varicose veins), resulting in the accumulation of these fluids as edema, lymphedema, lipedema — causing the bloating and inflammation characteristic of people in poor condition. For this reason, people often wear compression clothing and other devices to aid in this compressive flow back towards the heart — and in many people, will produce an instant reduction in their bloated condition, as well as relieve the pain of inflammation. In health-aspiring people, these principles work in that same way — along with millions of years of evolutionary wisdom. Skeletal muscles contract from the insertion (distal) towards the origin (proximal), and the origin of a more distal (distant) muscle, is anchored into the insertion of the underlying supporting muscle until they all end up at a point next to the heart where all the muscles are eventually anchored (the core). The beauty of that, is that is how the system is designed to work — and one doesn’t have to reinvent the wheel for that purpose. The proper understanding of that design and function, is enough to know to optimize those capabilities and produce the desired greatest health of every individual. Beginning with this large picture overview is what most people need to be clear on — or they will predictably receive none of the desirable effects and results — no matter how much of it they do with the improper understanding of what and why they are doing what they do."},{"instruction":"f you shoot yourself in the chin, would the recoil crush your throat/sever your spinal cord?","output":"Call your county medical examiner or coroner and ask that question.

On Friday July 11, 2008, twenty four hours after the initial launch of App Store, I witnessed something I have never seen before or since, after I asked one of my colleagues sitting in front of me if I could borrow his iPhone 3G. Back then, I was in the mobile industry for a few years, developing and distributing mobile apps (we were calling them by their category names then eg. games, ringtones, images). As everyone in the industry, we were selling ours through 1) telecom portals 2) independent operators and distributors 3) manufacturers and 4) our own portals. On that July day, I was gobsmacked. I literally told all the office: ‘ok guys, this is game over. This is going to be the end of an era for everyone we’ve known.’ I just could not believe what I was seeing: You didn’t need to register a new payment method to start buying stuff on the App Store. You could use the credit/debit card or bank account you already had registered on iTunes… and since Apple firmly encouraged everyone buying a new iPhone to open an iTunes account and register a credit or debit card at the same time, it was ALREADY THERE even before you’d switch on your iPhone the first time!You didn’t have to pay any additional charges for downloading an app. That was because Apple agreed with all the few carriers they partnered with in the beginning (and remember, they weren’t the biggest ones!) that any iPhone customer would have to be on a flat data subscription. This flat data subscription WASN’T WIDELY AVAILABLE THEN: Apple made this the norm, eventually, because of the App Store onslaught.You buy, you keep F.O.R.E.V.E.R. Yep, that’s right. You could buy another iPhone and all the apps, the music you purchased were still… on your iPhone. That was the cloud… BEFORE THE CLOUD!!!As a developer/publisher, you kept 70% of your revenues.One phone = little to no development cost, little to no QA cost = finally a profitable business. Today, you’ll think that all these 5 points feel very familiar, and very normal. You might also think, what am I so excited about, writing a lot of this with capital letters and lots of question marks? But back then, these things were not normal. In fact, none of these things existed in one package. And here’s Apple, doing EVERYTHING at the same time, with a phone that works well and only for 30%?! To do THIS, basically to create the iOS ecosystem we know of today, Steve Jobs had to find and bring people together who knew what the problems were in the industry and how to solve them. But more importantly, Steve Jobs saw something that no one else saw: he saw that by solving all the problems the mobile content industry had, it would put Apple in the lead for decades. And THAT is the true stroke of genius, the patience it took the man to create this, brick by brick, solution upon solution. Now, here’s some more contextual information, to explain where I was and still am coming from. The payment method.to buy mobile apps before the App Store, consumers used what we call direct carrier billing. You clicked ‘buy’ and you were billed at the end of the month on your mobile phone statement for all the apps you bought. Thing is, you never knew what those extra fees were about, there was no itemization and it was all aggregated. Bear in mind that most of the mobile app industry in 2007/8, at least in Europe, was almost obliterated because of billing scandals. In Spain, most people blocked their carrier billing not to access what they saw as a much bigger fraud risk than the internet.consumers could also buy mobile apps through what we called wap pushes and premium SMS. These were also used by carriers for their own portals, but were most especially used by companies like JAMBA, the infamous mobile content distributor that literally destroyed the entire market in Europe because it wouldn’t just bill you once, it would also automatically subscribe you weekly to its portals, costing to some parents thousands of dollars in ringtones and games bought by their kids.as a developer, if you wanted to distribute your games independently or in countries far, far away, you had to contract very costly and very complicated contracts with specialist billing providers - basically companies with a monopoly to buy billing SMS numbers from telecoms and resell them to everyone else. The data charges.Best selling apps were (as ever) games. The latest games would be around 500kB or at worse 1MB.The cost of the data to download a game already costing 5.99 would add another 5 to your bill. And to make it worse, this data charge would not appear under your ‘content’ total, but under data costs. You read this right: it would cost over 10 to buy a game worth half the price, but there wasn’t a way to know or see this on your statement.Of course, developers were not making a penny out of the data charges. The cloud:one very good way telecoms would make a lot of money was when consumers would buy a new phone. At the time, what we call the refresh cycle was mostly 1 year: this was mostly because telecoms would pay/subsidize the purchase of the phone in exchange of a 1 year subscription at fairly high cost. And every year, consumers could not transfer their old purchases onto the new phone, they had to re-purchase the same apps if they wanted them ‘back’.Now, what do you think this did to innovation? Imagine if you’ve had Tetris (one of the earliest mobile games to be released) ever since you owned a mobile phone? That wouldn’t encourage you to buy new games that much, right? That’s something a lot of carriers were telling me about what they thought of the state of the industry, a year or so before the iPhone and the App Store were released. The revenue share:you think 70% isn’t enough? Did you know that a developer could sometimes get as little as 20% of the product of the sale with a telco? that’s especially true if they forced you into an ‘aggregation’ contract, basically an agreement forcing you to work with a distributor of their choice AND giving them 20% of your rev share with it.the best you could make was 50% back then.But that wasn’t even the biggest problem - the biggest problem was that you had to spend some extra out of pocket marketing money to promote the carriers portal services via separate marketing channels. If not, well, you’d go straight at the bottom of the release charts - which was ‘ok’ then, since portals could only accomodate up to 500 games / apps at any time (we’re talking hundreds, not millions). Development costs:in Europe, the most ‘fragmented’ market of them all, a developer had to deal with about 3,000 skus: so 3,000 keyboards, 3,000 form and screen factors, 3,000 memory systems = 3,000 ways to make a game. The real number anyone could ‘cover’ and port onto was actually closer to 500 skus, because it was simply impossible to buy 3,000 phones.there was no Unity then, no platform to ‘unify’ all the development for all the skus into one single, cheap package. You had to have a lot of people developing and testing all the time, and for some developers, 24 hours a day.if you were lucky, telcos would give you a ‘priority list’ with % of revenues per phone.the truth is, these costs were so onerous that the entire business was a loss making one. That’s why at the time you’d be better selling ringtones and images rather than games. Now, imagine how many companies disappeared, how much money was saved, how much new business was created because of Apple decisions to make the iOS ecosystem: that is the true Apple revolution, that is where the 1 trillion is coming from. We can always ask questions such as ‘how long can it last?’. But this is a moot point: to me, those decisions are the true mark of Apple when it was led by Steve Jobs, a bit like when Bill Gates made Windows a standard for all PCs in the early days of MS - you just don’t see that happening very often, in such a short period of time."},{"instruction":"it appropriate to wear high heels with a knee length skirt?","output":"Very much so, I wear a knee length skirt with high heels regularly and often with stockings and suspenders and a high waisted shapewear thong, this looks feminine and feels sexy."},{"instruction":"What rules are to be followed in order to do intraday trading?","output":"Intraday trading involves short term trading, where the trader squares off all his positions before the market closes on a particular day. A lot of discipline goes in to have good returns in intraday trading. Here are some points that you should avoid if you want to succeed as an intraday trader. Never start to intraday without a trading plan. That is a must. Sticking to your trading plan will boost your confidence and you will be able to take better trading decisions.Don’t let emotions reflect in your trading. Decisions taken under stress or utter excitement can prove bad for you. Take a break and start again later.Don’t give in to greed and continue to hold a position in order to achieve more. If you think you have reached a sufficient positive point in a trade, quit the position and gather the profits. Market is really volatile in case of intraday trading, you don’t want to miss on any profits.Traders often stop paying attention towards learning once they start to trade. This is wrong. Trading is something in which you get to know something different everyday. So avoid losing interest in the research and education part.Another thing is to always trade in your budget constraints. You should know how much money you can afford to lose and risk that much amount only. Avoid using funds over and above your limit, that can be dangerous."},{"instruction":"coaching really necessary for the NEET preparation? Can I join coaching in 12th standard?

I await even the smallest sign of your response, even the least whispered invitation that will allow Me to enter. And I want you to know that whenever you invite Me, I do come – always, without fail. Silent and unseen I come, but with infinite power and love, and bringing the many gifts of My Spirit. I come with My mercy, with My desire to forgive and heal you, and with a love for you beyond your comprehension – a love every bit as great as the love I have received from the Father (\\"As much as the Father has loved me, I have loved you…\\" (Jn. 15:10) I come - longing to console you and give you strength, to lift you up and bind all your wounds. I bring you My light, to dispel your darkness and all your doubts. I come with My power, that I might carry you and all your burdens; with My grace, to touch your heart and transform your life; and My peace I give to still your soul. I know you through and through. I know everything about you. The very hairs of your head I have numbered. Nothing in your life is unimportant to Me. I have followed you through the years, and I have always loved you – even in your wanderings. I know every one of your problems. I know your needs and your worries. And yes, I know all your sins. But I tell you again that I love you – not for what you have or haven’t done – I love you for you, for the beauty and dignity My Father gave you by creating you in His own image. It is a dignity you have often forgotten, a beauty you have tarnished by sin. But I love you as you are, and I have shed My Blood to win you back. If you only ask Me with faith, My grace will touch all that needs changing in your life, and I will give you the strength to free yourself from sin and all its destructive power. I know what is in your heart – I know your loneliness and all your hurts – the rejections, the judgments, the humiliations, I carried it all before you. And I carried it all for you, so you might share My strength and victory. I know especially your need for love – how you are thirsting to be loved and cherished. But how often have you thirsted in vain, by seeking that love selfishly, striving to fill the emptiness inside you with passing pleasures – with the even greater emptiness of sin. Do you thirst for love? \\"Come to Me all you who thirst…\\" (Jn. 7: 37). I will satisfy you and fill you. Do you thirst to be cherished? I cherish you more than you can imagine – to the point of dying on a cross for you. I Thirst for You. Yes, that is the only way to even begin to describe My love for you. I THIRST FOR YOU. I thirst to love you and to be loved by you – that is how precious you are to Me. I THIRST FOR YOU. Come to Me, and I will fill your heart and heal your wounds. I will make you a new creation, and give you peace, even in all your trials I THIRST FOR YOU. You must never doubt My mercy, My acceptance of you, My desire to forgive, My longing to bless you and live My life in you. I THIRST FOR YOU. If you feel unimportant in the eyes of the world, that matters not at all. For Me, there is no one any more important in the entire world than you. I THIRST FOR YOU. Open to Me, come to Me, thirst for Me, give me your life – and I will prove to you how important you are to My Heart. Don’t you realize that My Father already has a perfect plan to transform your life, beginning from this moment? Trust in Me. Ask Me every day to enter and take charge of your life. – and I will. I promise you before My Father in heaven that I will work miracles in your life. Why would I do this? Because I THIRST FOR YOU. All I ask of you is that you entrust yourself to Me completely. I will do all the rest. Even now I behold the place My Father has prepared for you in My Kingdom. Remember that you are a pilgrim in this life, on a journey home. Sin can never satisfy you, or bring the peace you seek. All that you have sought outside of Me has only left you more empty, so do not cling to the things of this life. Above all, do not run from Me when you fall. Come to Me without delay. When you give Me your sins, you gave Me the joy of being your Savior. There is nothing I cannot forgive and heal; so come now, and unburden your soul. No matter how far you may wander, no matter how often you forget Me, no matter how many crosses you may bear in this life; there is one thing I want you to always remember, one thing that will never change. I THIRST FOR YOU – just as you are. You don’t need to change to believe in My love, for it will be your belief in My love that will change you. You forget Me, and yet I am seeking you every moment of the day – standing at the door of your heart and knocking. Do you find this hard to believe? Then look at the cross, look at My Heart that was pierced for you. Have you not understood My cross? Then listen again to the words I spoke there – for they tell you clearly why I endured all this for you: \\"I THIRST…\\"(Jn 19: 28). Yes, I thirst for you – as the rest of the psalm – verse I was praying says of Me: \\"I looked for love, and I found none…\\" (Ps. 69: 20). All your life I have been looking for your love – I have never stopped seeking to love you and be loved by you. You have tried many other things in your search for happiness; why not try opening your heart to Me, right now, more than you ever have before. Whenever you do open the door of your heart, whenever you come close enough, you will hear Me say to you again and again, not in mere human words but in spirit. \\"No matter what you have done, I love you for your own sake Come to Me with your misery and your sins, with your troubles and needs, and with all your longing to be loved.

Just ask yourself this..why do you find it difficult to wake up? Because your body still feels tired, right? Why does your body feel tired? Maybe..just maybe, it's because you haven't had a good nights sleep and either the quantity or quality of your sleep is compromised, or maybe both, no? So what would be the most sensible way to address this problem? To fix your sleep, right? That is where your efforts should be directed, instead of a shrieking alarm placed at a distance or a cold shower or caffeine. Fix your sleep. If you want to wake up at 6am, go to bed at no later than 10 pm. Avoid looking at mobile screens or TV screens an hour or two before this time. Switch off your lights or atleast dim them an hour before going to bed. Do not take a very heavy dinner and try not eating after 7pm. Tire yourself out by the evening by doing exercises and physical activities in the morning and afternoon. A fatigued body sleeps better than a lazy ass virtually stimulated screen addicted brain. Try getting a decent sunlight exposure throughout the day. Research has proven that old age people who get sunlight in the day sleep better at night. Drink a glass of warm milk before going to bed, it promotes the release of sleep inducing chemicals in brain. You can also take a 3mg melatonin supplement before going to bed to help aid your efforts. Try doing these and your body will thank you with energy and enthusiasm in the morning."},{"instruction":"Why are people with CCR5Δ32 resistant to HIV1 infection when HIV virus can enter target cells by either CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptor, and in the same way why are CD4+ T cells of which CXCR4 coreceptors are disrupted resistant to HIV infection?","output":"Bear in mind that much of the research on this issue is still ongoing, and there often aren’t clear and definitive answers to these questions. Also, while I know enough immunology to interpret the literature, this isn’t my field so apologies if I make any glaring mistakes; take this response as pointing you in the right direction rather than being the definitive and authoritative answer on the question! While CCR5 and CXCR4 are both potential points of entry for HIV, you shouldn’t assume that this means they are both equal as potential targets. Not all T-cells express both receptors, and not all virus particles are equally equipped to exploit both receptors. Bear in mind that viruses even within a single infected individual are not all identical clones; they should be considered a diverse population which can shift and evolve throughout the progression of the disease. The ability to utilise CCR5 vs CXCR4 as an entry point - referred to as tropism - seems to some extent to be an either-or situation, viruses that are good at using CCR5 are less good at using CXCR4; viruses that are better at using CXCR4 are necessarily less good at using CCR5. Again, this tropism is the result of a very small genetic change, so it’s easy for it to evolve back and forth rapidly throughout the course of the infection of a single individual. (I haven’t been able to get a hold of it, but this review paper sounds like it will go into detail on the topic: [LINKED_TEXT: The HIV coreceptor switch: a population dynamical perspective.] [URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15936659]) The tendency seems to be that use of the CCR5 is more important in establishing an infection early in the disease, with an evolutionary shift towards CXCR4 later in the infection. This probably reflects a difference in cellular targets for infection during the course of the disease, with circulating CCR5+ T-cells being the primary target for an initial exposure, and CXCR4+ memory cells being an important target as the disease progresses. Hence, while it would seem at first glance that if the virus came across an individual with a resistant CCR5 allele, they could just make use of CXCR4, it turns out that in practise that makes the process of infection much more difficult. CXCR4 is just not a useful target for HIV during early infection. Also, it’s worth bearing in mind that resistant is not the same as immune - you could probably still infect a CCR5Δ32 individual with HIV if you injected a massive population of viruses directly into their thymus, but with the normal routes of exposure to HIV virions (sexual contact or contaminated sharps) tropism is just too inefficient to establish a firm infection. Also, in general with immunology it’s probably wise to imagine that the immune system is actually pretty good at fighting viruses like HIV, and the disease only occurs when that natural defense is quickly overwhelmed. Hence, it shouldn’t be a surprise that simply reducing the efficiency of infection below some threshold could effectively prevent a disease from occurring at all, rather than just making it’s progress slower. As to your second question (why are T-cells which experimentally lack CXCR4 resistant to infection), I’m not sure I can comment without seeing the specific article, but the obvious questions I would have are a) did the T-cells in question express enough CCR5 to allow an alternate route to infection, and b) did the population of HIV particles used in the experiment have the correct tropism to exploit CCR5?"},{"instruction":"My blood pressure was 138/83 and my pulse was 52. Is this borderline high?","output":"A blood pressure reading of 138/83 mmHg is considered high-normal or borderline high. The first number (systolic pressure) is above the optimal range of less than 120 mmHg, but below the hypertension range of 140 mmHg or higher. The second number (diastolic pressure) is also above the optimal range of less than 80 mmHg, but below the hypertension range of 90 mmHg or higher. A pulse rate of 52 beats per minute is within the normal range for adults, which is typically between 60 and 100 beats per minute. A lower pulse rate may indicate good cardiovascular fitness, but it can also be a sign of an underlying medical condition or medication use. It is important to monitor blood pressure regularly and take action if it is consistently high or if you have other risk factors for hypertension. Lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, stress reduction, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol intake can help to lower blood pressure. If lifestyle changes are not sufficient, medication may be needed to control blood pressure and reduce the risk of complications. You should discuss your blood pressure readings with your doctor to determine the best course of action for your individual situation. You may use [LINKED_TEXT: Blood Pressure Support] [URL: https://htm101.com/track.php?c=cmlkPTgyMjU3NyZhaWQ9Mzg3MDA0MDQ] Blood Pressure Support supplements may be needed by individuals who have high blood pressure or are at risk of developing high blood pressure. Blood pressure support supplements contain a variety of natural ingredients that may help to lower blood pressure, reduce inflammation, and improve overall cardiovascular health. High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, can increase the risk of a range of complications such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease. Therefore, it is important to manage blood pressure levels to reduce the risk of these health problems. Blood Pressure Support supplements may contain ingredients such as magnesium, potassium, CoQ10, hawthorn berry, and garlic, which have been shown to have blood pressure-lowering effects. These supplements can complement a healthy diet and lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, reducing sodium intake, and quitting smoking. However, it is important to note that blood pressure support supplements should not replace prescribed medications or medical treatment for hypertension. People with high blood pressure or those at risk of developing high blood pressure should talk to their doctor before taking any supplements or making changes to their medication regimen."},{"instruction":"Aren’t you upset seeing a tattoo all over Jungkook’s arm?","output":"Noooo..

I saw a picture of this flight recovery and the pilot could not get out of the airplane because it was so hot, it really glowed. So it would seem like the Blackbird could attain a much higher speed than reported.

They’re not designed to be reminders of the dangers of division but to celebrate the most divisive and use their memory to oppress others. If they were meant to be warnings of the dangers of division, they would include monuments to the Union dead of Andersonville or show Nathan Bedford Forrest hanging from a tree (depicted in the way his treason and terrorism had earned him, instead of his leading the lynchings of formerly enslaved people). The vast majority of Confederate monuments were actually created after the reconstruction period, in order to reinforce white supremacy. They are part of the visual language to communicate that the Confederates’ cause — a white supremacist one — was one for the white population to support and the African-American population to submit to. Though some Confederate monuments were built in the periods during and immediately after the Civil War, the busiest period of monument construction began around 1900 and peaked shortly after 1911 (at a time when Jim Crow laws were being implemented). Building then slowed, with another small bounce around the 1919–21 race riots. The building of the monuments continued irregularly — but mostly above the pre-1900 rate — until the Civil Rights era, when there was another notable surge. These were not memorials to the recently deceased, but the physical embodiment of racial oppression — and an essential part of the myth of the Lost Cause.

It is the longest lasting and most expensive of the three. Perfume is designed to be worn on special occasions or for a night out. Eau de toilette is less concentrated than perfume, containing around 5-15% of essential oils. It is designed to be used as a daily fragrance, and is often considered a lighter version of perfume. It has a moderate longevity and is typically less expensive than perfume. Cologne is the least concentrated form of fragrance, containing around 2-5% of essential oils. It is designed to be used as a casual, everyday fragrance and is often considered the lightest of the three. It has a shorter longevity than the other two and is the least expensive. In summary, perfumes contain the most concentrated form of essential oils, and are the longest lasting, eau de toilette is less concentrated, and is designed for daily use, and cologne is the least concentrated, and is intended for casual use."},{"instruction":"Why aren't bullets sharp?","output":"Some of them are sharp and pointy most are NOT because it would have too much penetration and go through walls and bodies to KILL people that’s NOT the target"},{"instruction":"What is a candid picture?","output":"Photography is a way of feeling, of touching, of loving” And when it comes to candid picture the secret ingredient is- emotions!

Going headless means the expensive part of the load becomes less expensive as it’s static; and the important content comes in via an AJAX call. If the calls are cheaper to perform, the server infrastructure is less taxed and potentially speedier. I don’t like relying on AJAX calls for critical content: if anything interrupts the client side calls for content, the intent of the page fails.

What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that you can buy, sell and exchange directly, without an intermediary like a bank. Bitcoin, often described as the King of Cryptocurrency, a virtual currency or digital currency has seen a parabolic rise in its price which has lead to its new found acceptance amongst the public, mainstream media and Government Institutions; With El-Salvador being the first Country to officially accept Bitcoin as legal tender. As talk of the currency has gone global, the Bank of Singapore has suggested that the 12-year-old currency could replace gold as its store of value. However, in October, the head of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, warned about the unpredictability of Bitcoin, saying it makes him, \\"very nervous\\". When the richest person in the world gives his support to a virtual currency you know it's big business. Elon Musk has told users of an online social media app that he thinks the virtual currency, Bitcoin, is a \\"good thing.\\" His comments resulted in the value of Bitcoin rising significantly. So much so, that a singular Bitcoin went from being worth £3,600 in March last year to more than £37,000 now. How does Bitcoin work? Bitcoin works and functions on the blockchain platform as a proof of stake P.O.S for transactions. Each Bitcoin is basically a computer file which is stored in a 'digital wallet' app on a smartphone or computer. People can send Bitcoins (or part of one) to your digital wallet, and you can send Bitcoins to other people. Every single transaction is recorded in a public list called the blockchain. This makes it possible to trace the history of Bitcoins to stop people from spending coins they do not own, making copies or undo-ing transactions. How does Bitcoin Investing Work?

Wells popularize the idea of time travel?","output":"H.G. Wells' The Time Machine was published in 1895, and was then considered novelty. Mark Twain's A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (in which time travel takes place, although if I remember with no known mechanism, but instead a kind of 'transport of literature') was published in 1889. Samuel Taylor Coleridge's (1772 - 1834) poems \\"This Lyme Tree Bower My Prison\\" and \\"Kubla Khan\\" express a sense of momentary timelessness that could be compared to time travel. On the other hand, there are stories of ancient gods who were timeless, such as Zeus and Hermes. Time travel in the ancient sense might be compared to travel between the realms of the immortal and the temporal. The belief in the timelessness of the deities may have prevented time travel beliefs from developing. Early mythology also had themes involving special realms that obeyed different time rules, such as the Astral Plane and the aborigine concept of Dreamtime or Creation, which must have predated psychology. These beliefs may place time travel to an even earlier period than Ancient Grecia, through Stone Age beliefs that may have involved deference to the power of the gods. Thus, the power of the gods in addition to their timelessness may be the major factors preventing humans from believing in time travel. The development of sciences based on Aristotle may have been an additional influence which emphasized chronological time and the importance of cause and effect over non-linear correlations. Notably, during medieval times history was not seen to be evolving or progressing, but instead was seen as 'in abeyance' beneath the governance of the Almighty. The changes that could occur were seen as arbitrations of Justice, which put men in heaven or hell, or if they were philosophers or fools or merchants or traders, then they remained on earth like hanged men until their bargains were fulfilled. This mentality put the power of time travel metaphorically in the hands of the powerful kings, priests, nobles (the 'righteous'), and only secondly witches, Jews, saints, etc. However, the laws of time were often said to be determined by Death and Aristotle and the Wheel of Fortune and sometimes the Fates. There was a sense of determinism involved. Time travel remained largely the province of gods and devils, as inherited from Chinese mythology and folklore. In China, time travel got a boost with Lao Tzu's concept that 'The Way or River is Older than God' and concepts of herbs that would grant immortality. Herbs were seen as the way to prevent old age, but it was not assumed that time was linear. Instead, it was thought that the gods could control the 'gates' of time. Like the medieval Europeans, there was much obsession over the meaning of death, and the importance of figures like gods and devils in influencing the fates of mortals, and thus, the nature of the intermediate, possibly magical realms which divided the changeless from the normal. Lao Tzu's concept of the 'I Ching' or Book of Changes may be the original inspiration for time travel, as well as early concepts of magical objects like flying carpets and magic wands. You might also attribute time travel to drug experiences, or else real gods. In Ancient Greece, Heraclitus may have hit upon time travel when thinking about his statement that 'you can't step in the same river twice'. A scientist would see that statement as responding to a norm in Heraclitus' society that time travel was seen as taken-for-granted because of belief in gods, so his idea seemed radical to him. In that way we've come full circle by the time of Mark Twain."},{"instruction":"The justice department has told the state of Missouri that they can’t void federal gun laws.

Death by lung cancer is extremely unpleasant. COPD is no fun either. With that said, as a former smoker, quitting isn’t easy and it gets harder the longer you smoke. That’s especially true since I enjoyed every cigarette I smoked, even though I realized it was more-or-less-slowly killing me. I managed to stop (after 20 years) by having a long talk with my doctor: we came up with a plan, I committed to it, stuck with it and quit. The first 90 days were tough, but after that, I was done and haven’t gone back, not so much as a single puff.

It was a lunar calendar that based each month on actual observations of the moon. Each month started with the first observed new moon and ran approximately 29.5 days. Lunar calendars help agriculture, which was important to early cultures. The new year always began with the spring equinox because that drove spring planting of crops. But, the Sumerians were aware of the natural seasons as well as the solar year. The lunar calendar, then, allowed for 12 full months within the solar year. But, that typically results in 354 days. 11 days shy of the typical solar year. To ensure the first month remained linked to the spring equinox, the Sumerians decreed an extra month every 3 or 4 years and always at the end of the calendar year. Sumerian calendar As the Sumerian culture began to fade, they were replaced by the Akkadians who made some minor changes to the calendar they inherited but not much more. The Akkadians were replaced by the Babylonians who are probably the ones that decided to group days into weeks of 7 days each. Lunar Phases and Weeks They observed the moon and noticed that each phase required approximately 7 days. So they began celebrating every 7th day as holy. Work was prohibited on the holy day. There are theories that suggest the Hebrews adopted a 7-day week during the Babylonian Captivity. Evidence isn’t that clear but it is possible. Other cultures either adopted, inherited or basically recreated this approach. Some cultures tried to group days within a lunar cycle by a different number of days but as the European calendar - the Julian/Gregorian/Christian calendar - became the dominant calendar for international relations and trade, the 7-day week became commonplace around the world. I believe there were several 8-day week calendars including a Burmese calendar, Etruscans, and some Celtic calendars. The French Republic created a 10-day week calendar that was only used for a few years since it really didn’t catch on. I also think I read about 5-day and 6-day weeks in the Soviet Union."},{"instruction":"To what extent can we change human nature?","output":"Practically to the full extent, as long as this is physically possible.

I am 22 and it may change with experience! In one sentence, Purpose of my life is to keep my family members' smile intact, save as many as lives possible and keep myself busy with challenges. I divide my life in 3 components. My professional life. I am a doctor. (MBBS student completing final year in 4–5 months.) Sometimes I feel like I was born to be a doctor! I love the fact that I will save and transform many lives. I may lose some. I may fail at times, but I know I will give my 101% effort. I work hard even when at times I don't want to live. Whenever something bad happens, I am facing severe emotional trauma, I become sad for sometime but then I remember, if these things in my life will affect me, how will I save lives??? And the moment is enough for me to forget everything and work. I understood it as principle purpose of my life when I wore white coat for the first time. When I visited OT. When I see respect and hope in eyes of patient and relatives. When I saw the way patient thanks doctor. My own thoughts. I like change and progress. That's why I keep fighting for what I want. I love challanges. I love seeing other people grow! That's why I help people. Numbers I haven't count but it's surely in hundreds… Although it helps many people, and they do show their respect for me, I can say, I am not doing it with pure selflessness, I get inner and uttermost joy from it is also the reason why! I understood this when I helped a few, I was feeling worthy. In my own mind, my existence matters a lot now. Someone wanted to attempt suicide, motivated by me, when get to live dream life - I feel like I can create a difference!!! Still I put my family over my career. I know my parents and few friends whom I believe my family, understands the fact that life is more precious than dinner. Whatever I am now is because of their support. When my best friend asked me to go out. I asked him if it was urgent, because I had some serious reading plans. He said yes, and I didn't ask for a reason. We spent 7 hours together. My mother asked me, if you are reading, you can call me later. But how can I be busier than her!!! I am not monk. I need people around me. Even if in my hard times, I get support from people due to their respect for my work, I need family to share my happiest moments!!! I understand this when after achieving something when I think whom to meet and say - who will be happy from corner of the heart after listening it!!! Whatever reason I feel I am living for, I feel I can jump out of bed, I can work for hours without tiredness, I love to work without thinking of results - is purpose of my life. I found it while thinking constantly, analyzing every small fact(My mind never stops), travelling(22 states of India), reading books (2500+) working like anything(mostly 14–16 hours a day for anything), meeting and talking with thousands of people(Quora, Real life, Authers by articles). My age is 22, but experience does not come only with age. It comes with exploration. It comes when you change your mindset, when you reach out. When you sense all opportunities to learn - though it may come with countless troubles and failures - That's when you can find purpose of your life hidden inside you and ultimately it makes you, ‘you’."},{"instruction":"ve the Democrats ever been as far to the left as they are in the 2019/2020 election cycle?","output":"1932 1936 1940 1944 1972"},{"instruction":"Would spending 100 dollars a day or week on lottery tickets increase your odds at hitting the jackpot?

The usage is just about exclusively US, and I note that a large proportion of answers so far are along the lines of “you cannot counter the statement because it is true”. My counter to the proposition that whatever that requires other people’s labour cannot be a basic human right is - tada - the US Second Amendment, the “right to bear arms”. Manifestly, this right requires the labour of others, to make the guns and ammunition that exercising second amendment rights requires. Strangely, the strongest proponents of the notion that “whatever that requires other people’s labour cannot be a basic human right” seem also to be adherents of the “right to bear arms”. There is something amiss here. Are there different types of rights? Does the need for labour only matter some of the time? Is the original premise wrong? So, why would rights never require the actions and cooperation of others? You may have freedom of worship - but that requires others to cooperate in allowing you to worship as you see fit (although I wonder if the Founding Fathers actually considered the multiplicity of religions that exist) and might require the labour of others to ensure that your worship is unhindered, like a police force. Or is that another exception?"},{"instruction":"What is the slickest way a person has gotten out of a traffic ticket?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: What is the slickest way a person has gotten out of a traffic ticket?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-slickest-way-a-person-has-gotten-out-of-a-traffic-ticket] I’ll share them with you. I’ve lived in Los Angeles for 42 years since 1979. in 2010–2011 I had just graduated from law school with my J.D. I’m not sure what it was? maybe absent-mindedness or carelessness or or being goofy or just still having a racing mind from law school but in a 12 month period from 2010–2011 I received not less than 11; yep 11 moving traffic violations. But it wasn’t reckless I just wasn’t paying attention to my driving mostly. However, I fought in Traffic Court and won every one of those Eleven moving traffic ticket violations. Some by skill; some by luck; but I got out of every one of them. Here are the ones I can remember. 1. Speeding ticket (LA County Sheriff’s deputy on a motorcycle) I was in Rosemead eastbound on Valley Blvd just East of Rosemead Blvd. in a 35 mph zone; he said he (radar) clocked me doing 50 mph. El Monte Superior Courthouse at Traffic court trial; the judge just called out like 20 names and mine was one of them and said traffic ticket dismissed; I was curious why; so I asked the clerk; she said he (motorcycle Deputy) was hit by a car and laid up in the hospital so he couldn’t testify to convict so all his traffic ticket citations were dismissed by ‘default’ 2. Failure to make a complete traffic stop at a stop sign; by CA Highway Patrol; Alhambra courthouse. Here CA Highway Patrol has a website that you can complain about their patrol officers. I explained that I had stopped however briefly; the CHP even said, “you paused, you didn’t stop’; I replied, “my stop, is your pause”? Anyway, I filed a complaint against him; apparently, my complaint got back to him so he didn’t show for traffic court; which is an automatic dismissal by “default” for failure to appear to testify by the cop. The LT. from Sacramento that called me personally spoke on the phone with me. I said, “he was hiding in the dark at a stop sign just off of the freeway exit. I had stopped for a micro-second and proceeded. The law (DOES NOT, DOES NOT) require you to stop and count to 3; that’s a LIE, there is no such requirement. As long as you stopped and traffic was clear? you are clear to proceed however brief that stop was. Any cop that tells you different is a liar and that’s a bogus traffic ticket. Furthermore, an actual Lt. from CA HP in Sacramento called me on my cell phone; when I explained what happened; he said, “we (CHP) don’t hide at exits in the dark”; I said, “this guy did”. Apparently, CHP must constantly drive around while on patrol and catch traffic violators. While in the news a while back; they caught a CHP who would pick up his Girlfriend and change out of his uniform into civilian clothes and go shopping at the mall with her. How do we know this? Mall surveillance cameras caught him and the girlfriend and someone reported it when they recognized him. Then he has to hurry back and write a bunch of bogus traffic tickets to cover for their time. Otherwise, they get called out by their boss after their shift and patrol is over?; “you mean you worked an 8-hour shift and couldn’t write a single traffic ticket”? I wondered if it was this guy who gave me that traffic ticket who was at the mall with his girlfriend. 3. Another one I got a ticket for tinted windows; by San Gabriel PD motorcycle cop and trial was at the Alhambra courthouse; Here not only did I get a ticket for the tinted window; but because I gave the cop “some lip-service and an attitude”; he dicked back with me. In CA this TINTED WINDOW Ticket is known as a fix-it-ticket; he checked off 3 things which bail should have been 25 each for a total of 75 total; Well, He didn’t check that box; so my bail ended up being 1150 dollars; When I went to the courthouse traffic-clerk-window, she saw that he did that on purpose and changed it so my bail to post to attend trial was only 75. Note TBWD: Now in California; I found out this was new, we have something called “TBWD” aka Trial-By-Written-Declaration” that means you can type up your arguments like a trial brief or a pleading and submit your arguments that way, and the cop has to do the same. (see sample formats below). Well, I submitted my argument that CA LAW was changed to allow “tinted windows” that are colorless and transparent for the purposes of reducing harmful and heat-generating UV rays. A tint is a shade of light and is not considered a color; there are only TWO COLORS that are EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED those colors are RED & BLUE because they resemble the colors of the lights of police car light bars. Okay, and I quoted the law. Well, the Traffic courts are often manned by corrupt “volunteer” attorneys moon-lighting to be a future or wanna-be judge someday. So to give that façade of being pro-law-enforcement most of the time they just rubberstamp the police/deputy/highway patrol arguments. They are called “commissioner-pro temp” aka temporary commissioners. This frees up the real judges to hear and try real Civil and Criminal cases, not traffic tickets which are minor infractions. so in my TBWD, I was ruled “guilty”; well you’re given 10-days to file a Trial-de-novo AKA Latin for “new-trial”; so you get a second chance. So I filed my request for Trial-de-novo and was granted. At that trial, the same “commissioner pro temp” was there; So my first argument was for a Motion to Request a Real judge and not that commissioner. My argument is this commissioner already adjudicated my TBWD; the same court may NOT hear the same case again in a Trial-de-novo. I DEMANDED a real judge. This commissioner tried to deter me and said that might be a wait; I SAID, I’LL WAIT. So in the real courtroom with a real judge. And I didn’t have to wait, my case was the first one heard, right away. The judge opened by looking at me and saying, “so what evidence do you have that you are in compliance with tinted window laws”? I almost yelled but in a real loud and firm voice said, “OBJECTION, DEFENDANT HAS NO BURDEN TO PROVIDE ANY EVIDENCE CULPATORY OR EXCULPATORY FOR A CONVICTION OR TO CONVICT MYSELF OF THIS CITATION”. “THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS ON THE GOV’T FOR A CONVICTION, THAT’S THIS OFFICER (and I pointed at the San Gabriel PD COP);” “this citation has 4 subsections 1,2,3,4 ALL 4 ELEMENTS MUST BE MET AND THE PROOF MUST BE PROVIDED BY THE GOV’T; where there are no facts of evidence to prosecute? the court must dismiss for lack of evidence to convict; MOTION TO DISMISS IS HEREBY ENTERED”. I further said, “On the citation under my signature, it says in fine print; (signing this is not an admission of guilt but a promise to appear); I have not admitted any guilt and I have kept my promise to appear - I AM HERE; this officer THE GOV’T has the burden of proof; NOT ME”. The judge was taken a-back and recoiled in his chair; then he reached under his desk and pulled out the CAVC CALIFORNIA VEHICLE CODE book and looked up that citation #? then the judge turned to the cop and said, “what evidence do you have to submit to convict on this citation?” Cops reply: “I thought he had to prove that”. (pointing to me) (wrong, mistake, big mistake) Me: “MOTION TO DISMISS” Judge: Motion to dismiss granted I didn’t say a word, I just turned around and stormed out of there. Now after the fact: I went to the San Gabriel PD and filed a complaint; I wrote it up beautifully in a Trial Brief format. Remember I have a J.D. law degree. Anyway, I used this format to file my complaint; and the Internal Affairs investigators asked if I could come in to interview me. I did, and I told them everything above. and how he dicked with me to drive up my bail. That complaint is now in his file. The first thing the cops doing the investigation into my complaint did was to “compliment me”; saying we usually don’t get complaints this nice (referring to my court trial brief format above and all typed up real nice). I told them I have a J.D. law degree. ANYWAY, I gave them my statement vs that motorcycle cop and left. 4. and 5. 2 Traffic-red-light-camera tickets. One was where I was driving westbound around 6 pm in the evening and I had the sun visor down to shield from the sun and so my face was not visible. so that was dismissed. Another one was the front windshield of my car was dirty and so the picture and face was blurry and not clearly visible so that was dismissed. BTW THOSE tickets, ALL THOSE TICKETS, ALL THOSE TICKETS, ALL THOSE TICKETS for “ Traffic-red-light-camera” are voluntary; compliance; YEP. You DO-NOT-HAVE-TO-COMPLY with the ticket; but they don’t tell you that. So those tickets are “illegal”. YEP, that’s why LA CITY did away with them. But some cities still have them like Montebello, Westminster, Southgate, and a few other cities. Why? Because the “violate-your-14th-Amendment-rights” to be able to “confront-your-accuser” and question them; It’s called the “Right-of-Confrontation”. You CAN’T CONFRONT A CAMERA-MACHINE; It doesn’t talk; you can’t do “direct-examination of the machine. And on that ALL THOSE TICKETS for Traffic-red-light-camera? It even says on the ticket they mail to the registered owner? Somewhere near the bottom; “I did not witness this”. That means even the camera operator “did not witness” the infraction and was not there at the time of the infraction and so, therefore, cannot testify at the traffic court trial for that ticket. 6. Another was for a speeding ticket wherein the LA County Deputy said I must have been doing 50–55 mph. In that one, I went on Google map and printed out the speed limit sign in that section which was 45 mph, and included those pictures as Exhibits A, B, C, D, and I showed from a Google map picture printout that from the distance where he claimed he saw me to where he was less than about 1 football field length or about 100 yards. And that he didn’t clock me (radar); or pace me; but just visually eye-balled me and guesstimate my speed. He had no technical reference he could produce as facts to be entered into evidence to the court. I further argued that my car, as at the time a 1992 Mercedes-Benz E300TD Turbodiesel that was totally bone stock; not modified, not lowered, not supped-up; and I said nobody races a diesel or does the display of speed in a 4-door-sedan family car. And I included a picture of my car; several pictures as Exhibits. The judge bought my argument; the citation was dismissed. 7. This was much later, but in April 2018. I had just bought a 2018 Nissan LEAF EV which allows my EV to drive in the HOV (High-Occupancy-Vehicle aka Carpool) lane. But I also had my teenage son with me which also double qualified me to be in the HOV lane. so I cut over two-double-yellow-lines to enter. A CHP motorcycle cop behind me saw that and pulled me over and wrote me a ticket. Now you have to produce 3 things in all traffic stops: 1) driver's license; 2) registration; 3) proof of car insurance aka financial responsibility. When I handed him my registration; it was a copy and NOT the original. He demanded the original; I said a copy is sufficient; and he replied, “fine, I’ll just write you up for that also”. I had just bought this car in March the month prior brand spanking new from the dealer, but I had a copy of the registration. Well, my car has 3 Dashcams, 2 point front-ward, 1 pointing backward. but I was also watching him in my rearview mirror. We argued back and forth that he said I had to have the original registration; I said no I don’t. Well, he said he’ll write that and add that to my ticket. The problem was in my rearview mirror, he was there checking his vehicle codebook; for 15 minutes for the code violation and he couldn’t find it; because I knew you don’t have to have the original registration in the car. Another time during a traffic school class held by a moonlighting highway patrol officer; he even said, “don’t keep the original registration in the car”; because if your car gets towed; you need the “original registration” to get it out of the tow yard. Okay, he wrote the ticket and I’m on my way. I fought it and won. Dismissed. I told the court; this cop is corrupt and tried to write me a bogus additional traffic ticket on a non-requirement to have the ORIGINAL REGISTRATION in the car; which IS NOT REQUIRED because the point is my car has current registration; and he could check that on his motorcycle computer. I wrote a separate answer on that here: [LINKED_TEXT: Stanley Hutchinson's answer to What is an old law that needs to be changed?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-old-law-that-needs-to-be-changed/answer/Stanley-Hutchinson-2] I wrote another answer on speeding here: [LINKED_TEXT: Stanley Hutchinson's answer to I got a ticket for going 45 mph in a 35 mph when the speed limit was just about to change to 45 mph.

But I got so good at doing TBWD for traffic tickets; THAT I started doing traffic tickets for friends and co-workers then started doing that as a side gig for money. I’m happy to say I’ve got like a 90% dismissal rate for all the ones I did. One of those I helped get off was a family friend of my wife’s. The woman was pregnant and was driving on a street that abutted the 210 Fwy in Pasadena eastbound near Lake Ave; My argument was three-fold. 1) The officer clocked her on radar was pointing his radar with the freeway in the background within in few yards (25 to 50 yards) and clearly visible to the naked eye and he mistakenly clocked or pointed the radar gun at a freeway car and not her car; 2) The officer clocked and wrote “several” tickets; “several” tickets at that location; constituting a “speed-trap” which is Illegal; to not be a “speed-trap”; that officer must write one ticket, then move to a new location. 3) This was a woman who was pregnant and was driving carefully in consideration of her pregnancy and not speeding. The judge bought it and the traffic citation by TBWD was dismissed. I charged her 150 to get her off on that ticket. ———————————————————————————— Another was a co-worker lady friend, she got a traffic ticket for failure to stop for a yellow-school-bus; 630; yep; ouch 630 Well the argument was the officer misspelled her name; on this one I actually went with her to traffic court; and argued on her behalf that this was not her on the citation “look at the misspelled name” “the court must err on the side of the defendant”!; the judge initially ruled against her; I yelled, “objection for purposes of the appeal” and the judge reversed himself and dismissed the citation. I didn’t charge her. She didn’t make a lot of money. I said just to buy my son a Lego toy from Walmart; she said just go to Walmart and buy the toy he wants and give me the receipt. I did and it was 60 bucks and she gave me 60 bucks. ———————————————————————————- I got my own wife off on a ticket for tinted windows on our 2015 Mercedes-Benz SUV. ———————————————————————————- I have noticed (date from March 2020 to October 2020) cops and CA Highway Patrol are not/ and have not been issuing many tickets or as many because of “fear of CV-19” aka COVID. Recently in limited contact, they are writing more tickets as I see cars being pulled over now. Lesson learned: One of those 11 tickets? I think the last one of those 11 tickets?; I think I did attend traffic school to get out of it and that was a good thing; because it made me re-evaluate my driving style and technique and just to be more attentive and careful and check my speed.

She’s originally from Columbia but lived in Germany for over 10 years and was as fluent in German as she was in Spanish and English. While she could not shake her Columbian accent when speaking German, she had a perfect grasp of German slangs and colloquial sayings (the ones used in Germany, not Austria or Switzerland). In many ways, she spoke like a native German speaker, except for her accent. As a native English speaker from Malaysia, there’s no doubt my accent sounds weird to British or Americans. I personally find it fun to confuse my foreign counterparts when I use slang words from both cultures, as well as sayings from my own Malaysian upbringing. Fundamentally, I don’t believe there is a “native-way” of speaking the English language. The most “native” way of speaking is to use the language in a way that reflects who you are. The best way to speak English fluently is to use and consume the language as much as possible. If you live in a place where you’re surrounded by native speakers, use the opportunity to jump into the deep end and learn to swim. Start by practising with waiters or baristas when you go out for lunch or coffee. I would also encourage you to speak the language with people you’re comfortable with like close friends or colleagues. You could also try texting in English or replying to emails in English since these forms of communication closely mirror the way people speak. If that sounds too far out of your comfort zone, or if you live in a non-English speaking country, you could try using a flexible online service like [LINKED_TEXT: English Ninjas] [URL: https://landing.englishninjas.com/quora/] to practice with a native English speaker. Sometimes, it’s easier to first practice the language in a more private setting before trying it out in public. When it comes to using the language, it’s like a snowball effect - the more you use it, the more confident you become with the language which then encourages you to use it more. Also, remember to be patient with yourself. Learning a new language is really difficult and you’ll make mistakes every now and then. With more practice and time, you’ll gradually get better at speaking in English. Good luck!"},{"instruction":"What is the difference between granite and marble?","output":"Marble vs Granite So what exactly is the difference between marble and granite? Both are beautiful natural stone materials that can be used in a variety of ways around the home, from flooring and countertops to backsplashes and more. But while they may look similar at first glance, they actually have quite a few differences. Keep reading to learn more about marble and granite, and how to tell them apart. [LINKED_TEXT: Marble] [URL: https://www.youtube.com%2F@www.youtube.com/@vardhmansagarmarbles3977/videos] is a metamorphic rock formed when limestone is subjected to high temperatures and pressures. This process changes the structure of the stone at a molecular level, making it much harder and more durable. It also gives marble it's characteristic veining, which is created when different minerals are pulled to the surface during the metamorphosis process. [LINKED_TEXT: Granite,] [URL: https://www.youtube.com%2F@www.youtube.com/@vardhmansagarmarbles3977/videos] on the other hand, is an igneous rock, which means it’s formed from molten lava that has cooled and solidified. It’s made up of a variety of different minerals, including quartz, feldspar, and mica. Granite is also very hard and durable, but because it has a slightly different composition than marble, it doesn’t usually take on the same veining pattern. So, now that you know a little more about the difference between marble and granite, which one is right for your home? Here are a few things to keep in mind: - Marble is a softer stone than granite, so it can be more susceptible to scratches and stains. - Granite is a porous stone, so it needs to be sealed periodically to prevent staining. - Because of its veining, marble can be more difficult to match for large projects like countertops. Here are 10 key ways that marble and granite differ: 1. Price – Granite is usually more expensive than marble, due to its durability and scratch/stain resistance. 2. Composition – Marble is composed of 100% natural limestone, whereas granite is an igneous rock made up of various minerals including quartz, feldspar, and mica. 3. Pattern – Marble typically has a veined or swirled appearance, while granite is more consistent in color and pattern. 4. Maintenance – Granite is much easier to care for than marble, as it does not require sealing and is less susceptible to staining or scratching. 5. Heat Resistance – Granite can withstand high temperatures much better than marble, making it ideal for use in kitchens. 6. Acid Resistance – Due to its high quartz content, granite is much more resistant to acid than marble, making it a good choice for countertops near sinks or areas where acidic foods will be prepared. 7. Durability – Overall, granite is more durable than marble and less likely to chip, crack, or break. 8. Weight – Granite is much heavier than marble, so it requires more reinforcement when being installed. 9. Environmental Impact – Marble quarrying can be harmful to the environment as it releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the air. Granite quarrying is less impactful but still involves"},{"instruction":"Why is MCU phase 4 looking so aimless and too divergent?","output":"There are also at least two different “agendas” going on in MCU Phase 4, completing unfinished character arcs and introducing new torchbearers and seeing how the audience reacts. Some of the Phase 4 shows combine both. The first is pretty clear, Thor, Loki, Spiderman, Wanda and Doctor Strange all had ongoing story arcs that were brought to conclusions (of sorts) in their Phase 4 movies and shows, Spiderman’s to rousing critical and fan acclaim. The second mirrors Phase 1, where similarly disconnected movies and shows were presented, and audience/fan reaction gauged to determine which would become the torchbearers. Hulk was first, and the tepid response is why Hulk became just a comic relief/tank/side character during the Infinity War saga. Robert Downey’s Iron Man was a huge hit, as was Chris Evans’ Cap, so both got multiple solo sequels that began unrelated but were tied together first with cameos and post credit and mid credit scenes to the Avengers. If Iron Man had met the same response as Hulk, there wouldn’t have been two sequels and the character would not have been the pivotal arc of Infinity War. The combo features gave us a new Black Widow, a new Hawkeye, a Ms Marvel, a She Hulk and a “new” Cap, introduced at the same time as completions of their predecessor heroes, and the brand new features gave us Moon Knight, Shang Chi and the Eternals. The reactions/popularity of those will likely determine which get featured in Phase 5 and 6, just like the reactions to the Phase 1 and 2 features determined who got to be the lead characters in Infinity War."},{"instruction":"Should I buy a PS Vita or an Xbox One?","output":"Xbox One"},{"instruction":"What is it like being a farmer?

To be truthful I didn't knew any basics about how pots should be used. So now trying to be intelligent I used all my brains and planted a potato in it, so all the basics I remembered from school are potato grows in the ground so it's a seed in itself, all plants need sunlight and water, I thought I cracked it and was waiting for the plant to grow, but even after weeks and continuous water supply there was no growth. Only thing which bothered me was that the water I was pouring was not getting absorbed so I stopped after that and dint pay much attention to it for some time. One day my mom came to my flat and when I explained her the whole story the simple question she asked me is “did you put holes at the bottom of the pot” Like I said I didnt even knew the basics and was being dumb in not understanding why the water was getting stagnated, so this time I put some holes and planted a potato again to which my dad said potato doesn't need lot of water so on a occasional basis I started watering this plant and used to ignore it .

Why?","output":"A capacitor is a passive electronic component that stores energy in an electric field. In a DC circuit, a capacitor blocks the flow of direct current (DC) by charging up to the source voltage and then preventing any further current flow. However, in an oscillator circuit, the capacitor is part of a feedback loop that allows alternating current (AC) to flow through the circuit, which in turn allows the oscillator to produce a continuous AC output. In an oscillator circuit, the capacitor is typically connected in parallel with an inductor to form a resonant LC circuit. When the oscillator is first turned on, the capacitor and inductor form a resonant circuit that allows AC to flow back and forth between them. As the AC current flows through the circuit, it charges and discharges the capacitor, causing the voltage across the capacitor to oscillate back and forth. The oscillation of the voltage across the capacitor, in turn, creates an oscillating voltage across the entire circuit, including the output of the oscillator. Because the capacitor is part of a resonant LC circuit, it is able to pass AC signals while still blocking DC signals, allowing the oscillator to produce a continuous AC output. In summary, in an oscillator circuit, the capacitor is part of a resonant feedback loop that allows AC to flow through the circuit, which in turn allows the oscillator to produce a continuous AC output. While the capacitor still blocks DC signals, it is able to pass AC signals because of its role in the resonant circuit."},{"instruction":"Why does modern English have so less Celtic words than FrancoGrecoLatin ones, even though the AngloSaxons and the Celts were intertwined for most of their history while the French kings ruled only conquer and rule England in a few short decades?","output":"“Why does modern English have so less Celtic words than Franco-Greco-Latin ones, even though the Anglo-Saxons and the Celts were intertwined for most of their history while the French kings ruled only conquer and rule England in a few short decades?” Be careful not to oversimplify history. The amount of mixing of languages does not simply depend on the degree of contact. That is to say that just because two languages were in close proximity does not necessarily mean there will be a lot of mixing. It depends on lot on the socio-political aspects too. When the Anglo-Saxons came to England, then came in large numbers. They were certainly not a minority culture. And regardless they mostly drove out all of the Celts from England relegating Celts to Scotland, Wales, and Cornwall (as well as those that fled to Brittany). The Anglo-Saxons adopted the same superior attitude as the Latins in terms of how they treated the Celtic culture and thus had no motivation to want to adopt much from the Celts. This is not to say that English did not absorb any Celtic vocabulary at all but it was not all that much. When the Normans came to England, they made French culture a prestige culture across England. The English language was relegated to second-class status and thus the English speakers ended up picking up vast amounts of Norman French vocabulary (and later Parisian French vocabulary) trying to emulate the upper-class speech. This was an entirely different situation from Celtic. Regarding the heavy Greco-Latin influence in English, that was largely a result of the Renaissance. The Renaissance period was a time when Western aristocrats were trying to both re-affirm their faith and prove their education by becoming developing expertise in Latin. At the same time, though, the Arabs had stirred a passion for Greek philosophy in the West, and the arrival of Greek-speaking Roman scholars in Western Europe fleeing the Ottoman conquest of the Eastern Empire created an opportunity for learning classical Greek. These two things let to lots of borrowing of Latin and Greek vocabulary into English other European languages. Again, entirely different from the Celtic situation."},{"instruction":"Why does Transcendental Meditation smell like a scam?

The first dilemma is that had best men at my wedding and not bridesmaids, my wife had the bridesmaids. I suppose I could have had a groomsmaid if I really wanted to, but in general I don't think that happens to often. But because it is impossible for me to be a bride, I cannot have bridesmaids. Anyway, my wife gave her bridesmaids a little freedom with what she wanted. It ended up being a disaster because the lady who made them messed up their measurements completely and made the most awful dresses. I haven't seen them, but the ladies couldn't wear them. So they made an emergency effort and found two matching dresses at a Chinese shop that worked rather well. We didn't mind at all because my wife is the opposite of a bridezilla and I got her. People normally choose their best friends for bridesmaids and often family and future in laws. So you kind of know your friends and direct family quite well and would most probably know what they don't like wearing. The future sister in law might be a different story. But in general your wedding is your day, but it is supposed to be a celebration, so you don't have the green light to be a jerk. People have different body types and different things that make them uncomfortable. I have been to many weddings where the bridesmaids had similar designed dresses but completely different styles. I remember some girls in bright pink, one had straps, one had a boobtube and one had a single shoulder strap. It made each look very similar, but also nicely dissimilar. But where these type of questions and the dilemmas they contain normally comes from is when a bride insists on her bridesmaids wearing a boobtube. Some people hate them and feal very uncomfortable in them. Some girls do not have enough features to keep them up and some have features that can't go without the kind of support that comes in the form of shoulder straps. I personally think that boobtubes are stupid. The girls wearing them are normally forever busy pulling them back up. Fortunately, my wife feels the same as me about them. Don't try and force someone into wearing something they hate or that doesn't suit them just because you want something specific. If you are going to be that pedantic, you would probably not enjoy you own wedding.

The choice of technique depends on the specific requirements of your project, the characteristics of the dataset, and the desired level of accuracy. Here are a few commonly used techniques: 1. Color-based Extraction: Since rice plant diseases often manifest as changes in leaf color, color-based extraction can be a suitable approach. This involves analyzing the color channels of the images and extracting color features related to the presence of diseases. Techniques like thresholding, color space conversions (such as RGB to HSV), and color segmentation can be applied to isolate and extract the disease-affected regions. 2. Texture-based Extraction: Diseases can introduce specific texture patterns on rice plant leaves. Texture-based extraction methods, such as texture filters (e.g., Gabor filters) or texture descriptors (e.g., Local Binary Patterns), can be employed to capture disease-related textures. These techniques can quantify the texture variations caused by diseases and extract features to distinguish between healthy and diseased regions. 3. Shape-based Extraction: Diseases often alter the shape or morphology of rice plant leaves. Shape-based extraction techniques, such as contour detection, edge detection (e.g., Canny edge detection), and morphological operations, can be utilized to extract shape-related features. These techniques enable the identification and extraction of disease-affected areas based on shape irregularities or deviations from healthy leaf structures. 4. Deep Learning-based Extraction: Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have demonstrated promising results in image analysis tasks, including disease detection. CNN-based architectures can learn discriminative features directly from the images without explicit feature engineering. By training a deep learning model on the provided dataset, it can automatically extract relevant features for disease detection in a data-driven manner. It is important to note that the choice of extraction technique should be complemented with appropriate classification algorithms or models for disease detection. Depending on the scale and complexity of your project, it may be beneficial to combine multiple techniques or explore advanced methods such as ensemble learning or transfer learning. Regarding the dataset you provided, it appears to be a relevant resource for rice plant disease detection. You can utilize this dataset to train and evaluate your image processing and machine learning models. However, please ensure that you have the necessary permissions and adhere to any licensing or usage restrictions associated with the dataset. As for the specific implementation details using MATLAB or deep learning frameworks, it would be best to consult relevant documentation, tutorials, or seek assistance from experts with expertise in image processing, machine learning, and MATLAB to ensure the effective utilization of the extraction techniques in your project."},{"instruction":"What mobile app development companies are based in Chicago?","output":"List of Mobile App Development companies are : [LINKED_TEXT: Cubix] [URL: https://cubix.co/aff/app?camp=g&refurl=http%3A%2F%2Fgoodfirms.co%2F][LINKED_TEXT: Web Development | Mobile App Development Company - Irvine CA] [URL: https://www.think360global.com/web-mobile-app-development][LINKED_TEXT: Utility] [URL: https://utilitynyc.com/?utm_source=gf&utm_medium=lst&utm_campaign=dev][LINKED_TEXT: Think 360 - Award-Winning Native Mobile App Development Agency] [URL: https://think360studio.com/services/mobile-app-development][LINKED_TEXT: Swenson He] [URL: http://www.swensonhe.com/][LINKED_TEXT: RipenApps] [URL: https://ripenapps.com/?utm_source=goodfirms.co]"},{"instruction":"What would you do if one of your bridesmaids didn't like the dress you have chosen for her?","output":"Tell her “Too bad.

While you are welcome to have a service in your church, mosque, synagogue or whatever, there is nothing official about that. The official bit takes place with some sort of civil official - mayor, registrar, or some other title - and the signing of official paperwork in front of them. Marriage predates any of the worlds major religions, and hence their priests. It has always been a ceremony and a celebration with the families of the two parties. In theistic communities, it is customary, and very reasonable, to ask the priest to bless the ceremony. Just as it used to be customary to ask a priest to bless the launch of a ship, a newly completed house, the departure of an army or war band and so on.

It allows us to bind the data and enables us to automatically see changes in JavaScript on the user interface. Moreover, AngularJS contains instructions that allow us to create a more independent and reusable code. It allows us, programmers, generally, to write apps in MVC or MVVM architecture (sometimes referred to as MVM architecture). Due to its dependency injection mechanism, which helps mock dependencies, it has taken the lead in testing front-end applications. Over time, many developers have supported it. A lot of useful packages have been developed which make coding even quicker. Besides, the Angular Team decided to build an entirely new framework more and more things into its core. In the beginning, Angular 2 was the new framework. It can sometimes be subdued because the beta version has been renamed angular after some time. Now, you may find stuff connected to Angular 2 or later when people want to find some pieces of AngularJS code. Controller VS Components So how is Angularx different from AngularJS? First of all, Angular is TypeScript based while AngularJS is JavaScript based. TypeScript is an ES6 superset and ES5 compatible. Angular also has ES6 advantages such as lambda operators, iterators, or mechanical reflection. AngularJS uses scope and controller terms and conditions. You can add many variables that are visible both in view and in the controller to scope a variable. CorporalJS also has a rootScope concept. RootScope variables are available for every application. The difference in the template engine AngularJS has many guidelines and all developers can also specify custom new guidelines. Angular has regular instructions as well, but they are used somewhat differently. For instance, the ng-model means you want to create a double-way bond in AngularJS. You should use ng-bind if you want to create a one-way binding. Angular occurs only with ngModel, but you're going to get one-way binding if you write it only in:”[ ]\\". You must write it in “[()]\\". If you want to construct a two-way binding. This must be written because “[]” is used to bind property, and “()” is used to bind events. Angular is a great framework. [LINKED_TEXT: AngularJS web development] [URL: https://www.biztechcs.com/angularjs-development/] has made many improvements. It is increasingly popular, and I believe it can be used in large applications as well as in smaller applications.

I think this can be the best thing done before one dies.Now how can one offer a life? It is simple.Adopt a child. Love, care, grow her/him.Make her/him learn how to live/survive in this world.By this you won't die, you are there in someone else. Is it difficult?Monetarily, no. We waste a lot of money for nothing. We go for movies for the first show, spending a lot of extra money,why?. We party a lot and spend a lot of money for sake of nothing and just show off. We buy expensive clothes from malls(where they overcharge for service tax). We smoke, drink (god knows why) and waste a lot of money. We use expensive rides(cabs) and spend extra money when it can be done using public transport. We waste mess foods(payment is already done) and spend money in expensive restaurants. We register for classes/coachings which we don't find interesting after attending them and don't attend them more than 5%. There could be a lot of such instances where we can observe that we are spending money for nothing. Now like energy, money can be conserved by utilizing them for a life. If we start saving such extra money, it would be more than enough to raise a child.Maturity, yes.You got to understand the fact that you are going to be ideal for someone. If you are short tempered/alcoholic/smoker/full of hatred/egoistic/any bad habits that you think you possess and is visible to people around you and you can't give them up, give up this idea. If you have lots of kids and you can't handle, don't do it. Basically you got to be responsible. BenefitsYou will get immense pleasure. Comparison of two types of money expenditureYou are happy(virtually, I think) in present and probably heard or seen somewhere on facebook or somewhere else, when you get old, you will get happiness by the thoughts of current activities. So you smoke(??), party and others to make good future thoughts.But when you offer a life, and when you get old you will be happy with your past as well as present. Mind it that same amount of money is being spent/invested. Let's see a little bigger picture.If you observe, terrorists use the same ideology. They raise someone who needs support, who are left with no one, who are still in the process of making up their mind onto something, who needs mentor. Then they fill hatred in them and make them do bad things.Now suppose every one individual in hundred(possible?) adopt a child and raise them fill up love/happiness in them. Then in the world we will see a lot of love/happiness around and no one will be left lonely/blank thoughts. Then terrorist won't even get the cards to play. So you see you are being part of a very big fight. ;) I get the idea, and I will be glad if someone else as well.If one can care a pet animal, then one can also care a human. Humanity first. :)"},{"instruction":"Do soldiers pick up fallen enemy weapons to use if they are out of ammo on their weapons?","output":"Certainly during the battle of Arnhem. The British Airborne had to use anything they could get their hands on because they received little in resupply. The Germans were using the supplies dropped to the Brits and there are many pics in existence proving that they used them in battle. During the Falklands War, British Paras played with captured Argentinian weapons, even playing “grenade cricket” into the sea - but, to my knowledge, didn’t use them in battle if they could help it. An associate of mine somehow brought back an Argentine Para FAL and had it legally de-activated. There are TWO good reasons why you should try to avoid using captured weapons: 1) Your own weapon is zeroed in so you (in theory, if you’re any good) hit what you aim at. 2) “Fallen” weapons are sometimes boobytrapped. Usually with a grenade or the like. I think it was in Stalingrad where German soldiers removed the safety fuses from their egg grenades then left them to be captured and used by Soviet soldiers: the things would explode as soon as the Soviet soldiers pulled the caps…"},{"instruction":"Do female users get harassed for the questions and answers they post on Quora?","output":"I'm fairly new to Quora, and just had an answer get (barely) popular overnight.

Slowly, I realized that this city has much more to offer than bread and butter. What I like about this city is its helpful nature, honesty and professionalism. Unlike Delhi, in Mumbai you have a better social life, you know your neighbors very well and do have good interaction with almost all members of society.It is one of safest city for women, Everyday thousands of girls and women returning home even in odd hours and never feel unsecured.One of safest city for elders too.This city celebrate almost all the festivals with much fun fare and enthusiasm. In most part of north India Rakhi, Janmastami, Ganesh Utsav, Navratri & Dashhera and X-mas are more like a routine affair, whereas in Mumbai you will see plenty of enthusiasm, as city has adopted these as its own festivals. Most remarkable part of Mumbai life is its helping nature, you will find people are there whenever need arises to help you. I still remember deluge of 2005, when people cooked and provided to food to those who were stranded on roads. People stayed overnight to guide people through flood waters. Otherwise even in routine flooding of roads, you will find someone telling you not to go on that side. Other remarkable feature of this city is its never say die spirit. As we say “Mumbai never stops” even after the deluge of 2005, Mumbai was back on its feet within couple of days. Even 1992 bomb blast couldn’t shatter its spirit. During 2008 terrorist attack most part of Mumbai was functioning as usual.Then professionalism, you will find people thoroughly professional and even in government sector, even being non-Marathi , I never had any issues. You will find even policemen very polite and helping."},{"instruction":"What are your silly little parenting tricks that you're so glad you discovered?","output":"Whenever your child asks for something, get something you want first. Ex. Daddy can I use your phone? Sure, just put your dishes in the sink first. Always break up big chores into little ones. If my daughter’s room was a mess, I would ask her to put away a certain number of items during every commercial or before she could do something she wanted to do. She always got her room clean without an argument and when her dad wanted her to clean her room she told him to please let her do it how mama does it. 😊👍 Always have an array of groups of toys and snacks ready to go to make sure your child isn’t getting bored with the same things every time you go out. It will hold their attention much longer. I would also occasionally sneak a new toy or snack in every once in awhile. Same with their regular toys. Rotate them every once in awhile. It’s like getting new things to them. I keep a bag of small toys with me all the time in case I unexpectedly wind up entertaining my grandchildren. They like stuff they haven’t seen before."},{"instruction":"f you had one wish from a genie in a bottle, what would it be?","output":"As expected, a lot of people here are asking for a lump sum of money. I want to point out why that isn’t a good idea. First of all, money in any amount is finite. If you have a million dollars you might expect that you could live off of it forever, but this would not work. Why? Well, a million dollars— Despite being a huge amount of chedda’— is under the amount a high school dropout will make in his or her life, it is not enough to live comfortably. Asking for a billion dollars seems the obvious solution to this. A billion dollars is enough to sustain any normal human without working for the rest of their lives, but there are some major drawbacks. Lottery winners prove to be more likely to declare bankruptcy than average people, almost 1/3rd of them eventually declare bankruptcy, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Now that's true, but you might be saying that's not going to happen to you because you would be smart with your money, not spend it all, invest in business maybe. Keep in mind many who came into a large amount of cash thought this as well. Another thing to keep in mind, in that money changes people, not only you but those around you. People who you thought were your friend will now only see you as a bank, rather than a person. So what do I wish for instead? I wish for 1,500 dollars a week, which is above average for America. This allows my life to continue quite comfortably but I won't be loaded. In addition to this, I could get a job and work to add to this amount, but only part-time in a place that I enjoyed. I would save myself some pain of not having money, but also the stress and risk of coming into large amounts of cash."},{"instruction":"Why is there an exclamation mark on an empty battery icon and my Kindle paperwhite won't start?","output":"I would think that would be kind of self-explanatory. It needs charging. Either your power strip needs to be reset, your adapter is loose, or you need a new power cord. I'm the queen of scavenging, but if I plug in my Kindle and the charge keeps going down, it's time to toss the power cord. Once you've got it plugged into something functional, give it some time. Then hold down the power button until the Kindle restarts. I can't believe anyone is more careless with Kindles than I am, and mine are still chugging along.

Like string theory. A famous, disputed and sometimes misunderstood story, regarding the character of everything. Why did we tend to return up with it and is it correct? or simply a concept we must always chuck out? to grasp actuality nature of reality, we glance at the items up shut and were astonied. Wonders of landscapes within the mud, zoos of outlandish creatures, advanced supermolecule robots. All of them made up of structures of molecules created up of innumerous even smaller things: Atoms. we tend to were thought that they were the ultimate layer of reality, till we tend to smashed them along extremely arduous and discovered things that cannot be divided anymore: Elementary particles. But now, we tend to had a problem: they're therefore tiny that we tend to might now not verify them. rely on it: what's seeing? If we tend to see one thing, we want lightweight, associate degree nonparticulate radiation. This nonparticulate radiation hits the surface of the factor and gets mirrored back from it into your eye. Electromagnetic wave carries info from the thing that your brain uses to form a picture. therefore you cannot see one thing while not somehow interacting with it, a lively method, not a passive one. this is often not a drag with most things. however particles ar however particles ar terribly, however particles ar terribly, very, however particles ar terribly, very, very small. That waves we tend to accustomed see ar too massive to the touch them. actinic ray simply passes over them. We can attempt to solve this by making magnetism waves with a lot of and far smaller wavelengths. however a lot of wavelengths, suggests that a lot of energy. So, after we bit a particle with a wave that features a ton of energy it alters it. By watching a particle, we modify it. So, we will not live elementary particles exactly. This truth is therefore necessary that it's a name: The nuclear physicist indeterminacy principle. the idea of all natural philosophy. So, what will a particle appear as if then? what's its nature? We don't grasp. If we glance extremely arduous, we will see a fuzzy sphere of influence, however not the particles themselves. we tend to simply grasp they exist. however if that the case, however will we tend to do any science with them? Humans what do and unreal a brand new story: A mathematical fiction. The story of the purpose particle. we tend to determined that we might faux that a particle could be a purpose in area. some extent is any negatron with a precise charge and a precise mass. All indistinguishable from one another. during this physicists manner might outline them and calculate all of their interactions. this is often known as Quantum theory, and resolved heaps of issues. commonplace model of high energy physics is constructed thereon and it predicts countless things fine. Some quantum properties of the lepton for instance are tested and square measure correct up to zero, 0,00 0,0000 0,000000 0,00000000 0,0000000000 zero,000000000000 zero,0000000000002 nada. So, whereas particles aren't extremely points, by treating them as if they were, we tend to get a fairly sensible image of the universe. Not solely did this idea advance science, it conjointly crystal rectifier to a great deal of real-world technology we tend to use everyday. however there is a Brobdingnagian problem: Gravity. In quantum physics, all physical forces square measure carried by bound particles. however per Einstein's general theory of relativity, gravity isn't a force just like the others within the universe. If the universe could be a play, particles square measure the actors, however gravity is that the stage. to place it merely, gravity could be a theory of pure mathematics. The pure mathematics of space-time continuum itself. Of distances, that we'd like to explain with absolute exactitude. however since there's no thanks to exactly live things within the quantum world, our story of gravity does not work with our story of natural philosophy. once physicists tried to feature gravity to the story by inventing a replacement particle, their arithmetic stone-broke down and this can be a giant downside. If we tend to may marry gravity to natural philosophy and also the commonplace model, we might have the idea of everything. So, terribly sensible individuals came up with a replacement story. They asked: what's a lot of complicated than a point? A line- A line or a string. What is String theory? String theory was born. What makes string theory therefore elegant, is that it describes totally different|many various|many alternative} elementary particles as different modes of vibration of the string. a bit like a string string vibratory otherwise will offer you a great deal of various notes, a string will offer you completely different particles most significantly, this includes gravity. String theory secure to unify all basic forces of the universe. This caused monumental excitement and hoopla. String theory quickly graduated to a potential theory of everything sadly, string theory comes with a great deal of strings connected. a lot of of the maths involving a homogenous string theory doesn't add our universe with its 3 abstraction and one temporal dimensions. String theory needs 10 dimensions to figure out. So, string theorists did calculations in model universes. and so try and get eliminate the six extra dimensions and describe our own universe however up to now, no one has succeeded ANd no prediction of string theory has been proved in an experiment therefore, string theory failed to reveal the character of our universe.

He sees aggression against mutants as an act of war and will fight accordingly. Lensherr is not a psychopath. He is the General in the war against humans. To humans and some mutants he is a monster, as are most military commanders that would use any means to accomplish their mission. The power levels on Magneto have led him to deploy “shock and awe” tactics to cause great harm and loss of life including famously sinking a military vessel with all hands on board. During Secret Wars the Beyonder who was essentially a God assembled two opposing groups of heroes and villains to fight for the ultimate prize. And guess which side he decided that Magneto should go on, much to the chagrin of the Avengers assembled. If its good enough for the Beyonder, it should be good enough for us. If Magneto (who was based loosely around Malcolm X’s Civil Rights message) and mutant-kind would have been left in peace then he would never have been a threat.

They all get along but they are not huskies. My neighbors across the road were a very young couple who rented their home and had two Siberian huskies. There were a few times I found their huskies on the hiway and brought them back to their home, and asked nicely that they keep their dogs in as I didn’t want them hit or killed by a car. After a while their dogs would get loose, come over to our front fence and get my dogs all riled up. They would run back and forth and fight with our dogs with the fence between them. This happened almost everyday,and one time at 2am. I asked the neighbors again if they could keep their dogs in, but the couple just got a smart a** attitude with us. The guy said that they have an 8 foot fenced area for them but they got out all the time. I told them that they were very lucky I loved dogs….otherwise I would call animal control, but they didn’t seem to care. The guy laughed and said, “what is animal control going to do”? The sad thing is that they were breeding their dogs and selling puppies on Facebook. Anyway, The dogs started coming over everyday and eventually started coming on our property over our 4 foot fence. I eventually had to call animal control. I asked animal control NOT to punish the dogs, but they asked me to document it with pictures, etc . They also warned the owner of the dogs. One morning the dogs came on our property and killed my dog. ( mind you, this was after two or three months of dealing with it). Naturally, I was losing my patience and now I was livid and upset. We called animal control and reported it. I didn’t want the dogs put down or anything like that. I wanted the owners punished. As a result, animal control gave them a stiff fine and referred it over to the DAs office for potential prosecution. Here is the kicker….while my husband was outside burying our dog, the young owner stopped his car. He accused my husband of lying to animal control saying that his dog was never on our property and did not kill our dog. The guy then he said, “there is no way they got into your yard and over your fence”. He said that his dogs could never jump our fence. .

Why is turning a profit on ownership not a good thing?","output":"Rent seeking is not the sum of its two words; rather, it refers to something entirely different, that is, the “practice of manipulating public policy or economic conditions as a strategy for increasing profits.” A similar concept would be crony capitalism, i.e., making money off connections to those in power. Let me give you two examples: many states have massively expanded the number of jobs that require licenses. In Louisiana, for example, you must pass a rigorous test (roughly 50% fail) and be licensed in order to be a florist. That is, you can’t just open a shop and trust that a market will develop (or not) for your arrangements of flowers, you must be approved by a state commission. Who favors this approach? Well for one, the government, as it gets annual registration fees. But a group that lobbied both for the creation and maintenance of this licensing scheme was established florists themselves, as it serves as a barrier to entry for competition. This is rent-seeking. Or second, take liquor. In Texas, it has long been the case, owing to blue laws, that hard liquor may only be sold in liquor stores, and there only on Mondays-Saturdays that are not holidays. Beer and wine, on the other hand, are more generally available, including at least partially on Sundays. There’s no compelling reason why someone who can buy Budweiser or Yellow Tail (1) in a supermarket (2) on a Sunday shouldn’t also be able to purchase vodka, but those rules have created a system where massive liquor stores have developed, and they don’t have a great deal of competition. Every other year, bills are introduced to do away with this antiquated arrangement, but the biggest lobbyists for the status quo are of course the state’s major liquor stores, as (1) they generally don’t see an advantage to being open 7 days a week and (2) they definitely don’t want more competition, such as from supermarkets. This, again, is rent-seeking behavior. I could go on and on, because this kind of conduct occurs at every level of government, but you get the idea. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with ownership and trying to profit off your ownership of property. Absent exceptional circumstances, there is something wrong with using government to constrain the free market."},{"instruction":"Do conservatives realize that the only reason our manufacturing jobs went to China was because the country provides cheap labor? Trump wants to bring back manufacturing jobs, but are they ready for the big paycut that would require?","output":"Business consultants currently advise against shifting manufacturing to China. There have been huge gains in the wage level in China, particularly in the coastal areas with best infrastructure. Wage rate there is now higher than Mexico. When you count transport costs as well as any setup costs and so on, it no longer makes business sense. But conservatives want to force workers into competitive struggle to reduce wages and working conditions — to make more profit. US conservatives are about helping the capitalists maximize their profits. That’s the be-all and end-all for the Republicans. There are other ways to promote manufacturing in the USA, such as requiring certain essential products, such as pharmaceuticals, to be made in USA. Under a socialized health care system, there could be an industrial policy favoring manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment in USA, unless special circumstances — such as an immediate need — over-rule this."},{"instruction":"My son gets a slip home every day from his teacher that needs to be signed because he gets in trouble.

I had a friend who worked for a university that accepted MANY of these type kids…the first year most of them had to be in HS level “Remediation” classes to dispel them of the notion that evolution is a lie and the fossils of dinosaurs are actually false things placed by the devil to draw people away from God by making them believe in such falsehoods as evolution…and clarify their viewpoints on slavery and the civil war. (She remembers a professor telling her about the kid SCREAMING at her that “Slavery was a fair and JUST practice and we did those (n-word) a huge disservice when they were freed since they have gorilla brains, not human ones!”) The same can be said for public schools.

Iphone 11, galaxy s10, or Galaxy note 10?","output":"Many people will obviously say iPhones and rant about how \\"Android isn't secure\\" but Samsung has one of the best security system in their phones. Samsung has Knox security which has been said to be \\"unhackable\\".. it's enterprise approved and it's commonly used as a business phone. Honestly, I think people are more paranoid about phone security than they should.. most of the hacking happens over the cloud.. Especially from email phishing or spoofing. I have never gotten my Windows laptop or Android phones hacked ever, in all the years I've used it.. but I've had my cloud accounts hacked from \\"data breaching\\" which had absolutely nothing to do with me or my phone. I bet if you ever get hacked, it would likely be through email phishing or your cloud accounts gets hack due to using a weak password or you gave your password away by getting tricked by a website or something. So don't freak out about security.. all phones today are pretty secure.. especially Samsung with Samsung Knox. Just be smart and teach yourself how to be more careful and tech savvy. Just pick a phone that has the features you like and want to use, and pick the phone that best fits your budget. So simply put, all Smartphones today are secure enough. The only concern is if you work in government.. if you're a regular person, I wouldn't worry about it.

Or If you weren’t fat (I was carrying 20 extra pounds then) This would not have happened. A board fell off a shelf and sliced through my ankle. But that is an obesity issue and put it on the paperwork. My very favorite though is when giving birth to the second child. Like the first I was not in agony. I told the nurse that I would like someone to check the incision site as it felt very warm. Eventually he shows up like nothing has been said… OK. I tell him I think something is not quite right. Maybe he would like to look at the incision . Nope He needs to get up close and personal. I tell him again and he takes the “the man” out and says he believes I am getting hysterical.

The Wise Men of Gotham. You may recognise the name, and Gotham is why Gotham City got it’s name. But not the pronunciation, which is Goatum. [LINKED_TEXT: The real Gotham: The village behind the Batman stories] [URL: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-24760791] Anyway, the Wise Men of Gotham. Oral tradition has it that, in the 13th Century, King John wanted to build a hunting lodge near the village. This would entail a new road being built through the village, the upkeep of which would have to be paid for by… the village. The people of Gotham didn’t want to pay for a road they’d seldom use, so they hatched a plan for when the King’s men came round to do their surveying. One group built a fence (or hedge) around a tree to stop a cuckoo from flying away. When the cuckoo left, the group berated themselves for not building the fence (or hedge) high enough. Another group were trying to drown an eel accused of killing their fish. A man was observed to cut his horse in half with an axe. The horse’s crime was swallowing the moon. Allegedly, the owner had seen the moon reflected in a pond and it disappeared when his horse drank from said pond. The village blacksmith found a wasps nest in his rafters. Instead of removing it safely, he decided to set it alight, causing his house and shop to burn down. A local farmer rode into the village carrying 2 bushels of wheat in his hands, claiming he was carrying them (on horseback) because his horse wasn’t strong enough. A bushel of wheat was around 64lbs. Whether the farmer was in on it, or just an idiot, is unknown. Upon observing this madness, the King’s men decided it wasn’t a good idea to be near this place of madness. Madness was thought to be contagious at the time, and they didn’t want to the King to catch the madness. So the King’s hunting lodge was built elsewhere, and the villagers didn’t have to pay for the upkeep of a road. To this day, Gotham has never had a major road built through it, nor did it get a train station despite having had a rail line passing through the village itself. And, of course, the name has been made much more famous by DC Comics. Nottingham City Transport managed to take advantage of it during the advertising for Batman v Superman And Gotham had a population of 1,563 at the 2011 census. As an aside, nearby-ish Grade I listed Wollaton Hall served as Wayne Manor in the Dark Knight trilogy. This was not King John’s hunting lodge as it was constructed 1580–88, but is sat in a deer park. And hosts an annual music festival among other things."},{"instruction":"After losing everything that you own, what would you do?","output":"We forget everything, and start again."},{"instruction":"What is the best defence against ransomware?","output":"The best antivirus for pc is Norton premiun 360, it is powered by one of the world's largest 24x7 threat monitoring networks.

A total of five hotels (all Five-Star) were booked for their stay. All the relatives shopped in expensive Malls every day and bought things for lakhs and lakhs of Rupees. The bills were charged in the name of the entire State Department. This was the daily story throughout the currency of Manmohan Singh's tour. The entire Indian-staff servant of the State Department used to dance in front of them all. Manmohanji did not come to the Embassy even once or meet us. Now when Modiji came to Germany twice as Prime Minister, the entire staff was expecting the same show again. But I'm surprised he came all alone! There is no army of relatives. So only one floor of the hotel was fully booked for reasons of Security & Safety. There is no shopping in the Malls They are busy with work fulltime. The Embassy staff was not allowed to do chamchagiri; Rather, the staff continued to carry out the day-to-day tasks of their office. In fact, we were so busy collecting all the data and putting it in the file folder that we could not go home for three days. Despite his busy schedule, Modiji took some time out and came to the Embassy and gave credit to everyone for making the visit a success and they all had a cup of tea with him.

His VASCAR beeped, showing 153 mph, in a 55 zone. He didn’t believe it and ran it through the on-board calibration. Then the car went past him. VASCAR said 157. He believed it that time. Problem was he was the only deputy on the south end of the county, and his car topped out at 135. But he called it in, hit the lights and siren, and turned around, anyway. He actually caught up to the car pretty quickly because there was traffic on the road. That particular stretch is rather hilly, and there are multiple “no passing” zones. The driver pulled over right away. Deputy ran the plates, everything came back clean. Approached the car, and the kid (17 y.o.) already had his license, insurance, and registration in his hands. The officer asked him if he had any idea how fast he was going, and he said he didn’t. The officer told him it was 157 mph, and the kid said, “That’s about right, based on the tachometer.” The deputy told him, “No, that’s NOT RIGHT. What were you doing driving 157 miles per hour down my road?” The kid said that his girlfriend lived around one of the lakes further south in the county, and wanted to go shopping at the mall in the north of the county, and he needed to get her there before the stores closed. Turns out the kid has been working on this car for three years. Built it almost from the ground up, totally legit, receipts for everything. No “midnight auto parts.” The deputy called the kids parents to come get him, and impounded the car. As they parted, the deputy told the kid, “I’ll be in court when your case comes up, and I expect you to tell the judge the same thing you just told me.” Traffic court. 82 in a 70, 66 in a 50, 44 in a 30, the usual stuff. Bailiff hands the judge another folder. Judge opens the folder, and practically shouts, “157 MILES AN HOUR!!” Deputy said the courtroom got so quiet you could hear hair grow. Bailiff called the kid forward, and the judge asked him, “What were you doing driving down my roads at 157 miles an hour?” Kid looked around, and there was the deputy, watching him. Kid told the judge the same things about the girlfriend and the mall. Judge said, “Well young man, in our state driving is a privilege, not a right, and your actions demonstrate that you are not yet capable of discharging the necessary responsibility that goes with the privilege. Your license is revoked until you are 21, and your car will remain off my roads until that time.” The young man asked, “How will I get around?” The judge said, “There are bicycles. Next case!” Deputy said everyone else that session was exceedingly polite to the judge."},{"instruction":"With how hard it is being an undocumented immigrant, why not just give them citizenship?","output":"NO Deport them.

There is hardly any drama there. While Tamil Nadu has had major anti-Hindi protests, Kerala stands out as a Communist bastion and Andhra Pradesh went through a very messy divorce with Telangana, Karnataka hardly has that kind of masala news. Temples and mosques are not destroyed, trains are not burned, cities are not bombed and there is no major caste or religious violence. Nature also blesses them with fewest of natural disasters [touchwood]. All makes for very little Karnataka related story in the front page. On a related note, there was hardly any migration out of Karnataka - especially in the past couple of centuries. This is possibly due to fewer agricultural disasters and better governance. In contrast, Tamil Nadu and Kerala have had major outbound migrations and so did Punjab, Bihar and Gujarat. Due to the migrations, Tamils are everywhere. Besides being a major language of Singapore, Malaysia and Sri Lanka, it has very active communities across the world. These migrant communities help educate the locals about Tamil culture, build Tamil temples, run Tamil schools etc. Besides having had good governance relative to other Indian states, Karnataka didn't have many ports either. Its access to the coast is quite rocky. Both these limited outbound migrations and thus outsiders would not have had interactions with Kannadigas."},{"instruction":"Which cryptocurrency has the lowest transaction fees?","output":"Here’s my top 3 list: StellarIotaTamadogeNanoCardano This article actually did justice, compiling a whooping 17 which I always refer to every now and then - [LINKED_TEXT: Top 17 Cryptocurrencies with low transaction feesLearn about the top 17 Cryptocurrencies with low transaction fees you can trade with today for more profit as a low or high volume trader.https://blog.bitmama.io/top-17-cryptocurrencies-with-low-transaction-fee/] [URL: https://blog.bitmama.io/top-17-cryptocurrencies-with-low-transaction-fee/]"},{"instruction":"What are the differences between a wireless and a wired connection?","output":"A wired network uses cables to connect devices, such as laptop or desktop computers, to the Internet or another network.

It’s all about you healing you and that healing being reflected back to you by your twin (and/or the trigger) The concept of running and chasing is not external to you, it is within you. You are separated from God source energy (separation) and then you rejoin/reconnect with God source and you are back to your heart space. What will happen is nothing, for you are a team, you are a single unit working together, the DF energy (heart/intuition) will keep seeking the deeper spiritual realm which will naturally pull up the DM (logical/thinking/action) energy and together they will become whole independently and then, together. Do not worry about what is going with them or their journey for each has a unique journey planned from birth you cannot change or influence, you can only work on yourself and trust that this is all your twin needs to do for your part of the connection. I KNOW what I say and I do is reflected in my twin’s behaviour, it’s uncanny how much this is my reality. I remember telling him a few weeks ago, “wouldn’t it be great if, when you felt like leaving the connection (ie being unfaithful) to your partner, )you could talk it through instead of doing that” and just Friday he told me that he talked through a departure scenario with his current karmic. He was getting better at speaking about his feelings than anything and I’ve noticed, that he is talking more and more about his other relationships (I don’t ask, and to be honest, I certainly don’t want to hear but I do). I listen to his challenges and try to help if I can but what’s important is I see he hears me. It was like last fall when I said “when you are with many you hurt them all” and he committed to her a few weeks later. He did say “who’s hurting who”, “they all know about how I feel and they CHOOSE to stay”. I said that’s like punching someone in the face (to me) and saying “this is going to hurt” and him saying “but I told you I was going to do it”. Having said that I sort of got it. We CHOOSE to stay in the connection when we are not happy, we choose to accept less and this is us abusing ourselves. This is why standing in your own power and accepting nothing less than you deserve is key to loving yourself is key to this journey. You cannot do the work for your twin, you can only do YOU and hope that they pick up on their own growth through you. You can only model the behaviour you want over and over until it sticks. I was in the grocery store yesterday and a couple was at the check out, all I heard him say to her was “You don’t have to fucking yell” as he stormed off without her. It was loud enough for me and the cashier to hear and the lady did nothing. Later as I stepped up to the cash I said “well, wasn’t that a piece of abuse we witnessed” and then I said, “but she is accepting, thus she feels she deserves no better treatment. The cashier actually asked me if I was in psychology (she was quite young) and I said no and she said “You seem to know a lot about human behaviour”. WE choose what we accept as treatment, this is something we must all learn, to show others how best to treat us. Your twin is affected by everything you do so keep doing you and working on you and know that together the healing happens."},{"instruction":"What are some short stories about wives?","output":"A short and Sweet story about a wife.

She did not sleep well, falling asleep only in the morning and got tired very quickly during the day. Our relationship was on the verge of break up. Her beauty was leaving her somewhere, she had bags under her eyes, she was poking her head, and stopped taking care of herself. She refused to shoot the films and rejected any role. I lost hope and thought that we’ll get divorced soon ... But then I decided to act on it. After all I’ve got the most beautiful woman on the earth. She is the ideal of more than half of men and women on earth, and I was the one allowed to fall asleep next to her and to hug her shoulders. I began to pepper her with flowers, kisses and complements. I surprised her and pleased every minute. I gave her lots of gifts and lived just for her. I spoke in public only about her. I incorporated all themes in her direction. I praised her in front of her own and our mutual friends. You won’t believe, but she has blossomed. She became even better than before.

I once heard someone complain about ‘just getting 85% on a test’…yikes! First of all understand that the University of Toronto one of the most prestigious, most historically renowned University in Canada. So congrats to you getting into begin with, I’ll offer a few of my tips as below. Go to Class!!!! Now this may seem obvious but now in my 3rd year, it’s more obvious than ever, with attendance records on the line and knowing exactly who’s in your class this can be a potential game-changer. I used to sleep in and throw off going to class until I realized that the content taught in class, is what’s going to come on the test. Pretty much common sense right? Also, if you attend your classes you will befriend others in your same program of study. This way you can pick out who seems to understand the subject the best to either pepper them with questions, work on past papers or form study groups. Helpful right?You don’t need to buy your textbooks. Now the professor may stand in the front of the humongous lecture hall on the first day and tell everyone which textbook is required and dadada, but honestly the only ones I spent my money on were the ones that required either an online sign-in online homework that’s connected to TopHat (a subscription based service) and textbooks that I wanted to read. Honestly, they’re not worth the hassle. Professors usually upload lecture slides, and the material and content they provide in class is usually content. A lot of my fellow classmates usually rent out the exact same textbook in the Library anyway. It’s a good way to save several hundred dollars that you can better spend on food and outings with your friends.Go to Office Hours. Yeah that’s right, go on a one on one meeting with your professor, get to know them, let them know you. Look them in the eye and show them you want to succeed, let them know, let them know you stand out from the 500 students that in the same lecture hall as you. Sure there may be others that line up to go to office hours, but trust me it’s worth it. Knowing UofT as much as professors deny it, there IS a bell-curve and professors decide which students they take marks off of during tests / assignments and so forth. If they don’t know you / don’t recognize your name. You might find yourself asking…hey I got 75 all year long why is my final grade as 68? Hmm maybe if you had known the professor a bit better you could ask.Don’t be anti-social. Some people that I knew used to know actually got depression and dropped out as a result of this. Why? UofT is a HUGE school, yeah it’s huge. And that’s what could make you feel lonelier than you’ve ever felt before. Don’t be afraid to reach out and make friends, but choose wisely. University is full of different people, I have friends on a very wide spectrum on one hand I’m friends with a Canada top 20 under 20 student who goes on motivational speaking tours, Ted Talks and Microsoft talks and the other end of the spectrum I also know drug dealers. So yeah, welcome to UofT I guess.Don’t take things so personally. I was so excited the summer that I was going to UofT that I joined a ton of Facebook Groups to get associated with the Future Class of 2020 and proceeded to be friends with exactly 1 one of the close to 100 people I met on the platform. Why is that? People online are different to people you meet in real life. I once greeted a person that I had met on the platform and he disregarded me with a disinterested nod before walking around me and laughing it off with his 2 female compadres.Remember Grades Aren’t Everything. If this happens to you, and I hope it doesn’t because it really sucks and you find yourself facing a failed test / or course or assignment…just know it’s not the end of the world. They do not define you, it might make getting into graduate school harder if you’re trying to do a Masters or an MBA Medicine or Law but it’s not the end. If you feel like you can’t pass a course, drop it so it doesn’t affect your GPA. I knew people who graduated UofT with a minimal CGPA—in fact close to the point of academic probation and they still managed to nab themselves a good job at a good firm. Now at barely 27/28 they’re planning their home purchase already.Your T-Card is important! On the first day of school / frosh-week you’ll probably go to get your unique T-Card on it will be your UofTID as well — the same one to login to Wifi and whatnot. Don’t lose it! If you lose it, I believe it costs 50 to replace. Anyway, that’s not the whole point. The T-Card is used universally across three campuses. Which means you can take the bus from UT St.George to UTM and use the gym facilities you can check books out and so forth. The same goes for if you want to visit anybody you know at UT Scarborough, you can use the gorgeous and fully-equipped Toronto Pan Am Center and all of it’s facilities for free (well technically you pay for it for your school fees but still).Allocate your time and spend it wisely. Don't get burnt out, don’t go out too much, don’t spend all your time in the gym. Space it out and divide your time up, if you have class—go to class and then you can hit the gym. If you don’t have class, don’t neglect catching up on all your notes that you took in class in the Library. Time is your most valuable asset in University, use it wisely.DO Past Exams. Usually the professors like to mention that the exam format has changed it’s different and whatnot but no, trust me it’s worth it. I once had a professor tell me again and again how the department has changed the test is not the same, it’s not the same. I opened the exam and there it was the exact same Multiple Choice Questions. MCQ’s and Short Answer make up the majority of tests in UofT which is a relief. No more essay-styled answers—unless if you take some kind of Sociology course. Practice the questions on the past exams over and over again, I suggest going back 3–4 years and practicing all of the exams. You can do this by accessing the past exams portal which you can find on the main website and on Blackboard as well.Have the best years of your life. It’s hard, it’s tough, and you think it’ll never be over but once you’re graduated you’re done. You're no longer a kid, a teen, an adolescent, young adult, no no you’re a full-blown adult now. Enjoy your years at University as hard as they may be, network when you can, join events, groups, take your classes seriously, keep in shape and good luck!"},{"instruction":"What are the advantages and disadvantages of using a nongeared twowheeler over a geared one?","output":"Easy driving/riding in the city but at the expense of a little more petrol consumption.

Arguments for HK: Bigger, more to explore, greater variety of neighborhoodsBetter, cheaper transport systemMore energy. This is hard to explain but almost universally held to be true. Singapore can feel a bit too \\"small town\\" after you've been there for a few years. More beautiful. Both the skyline and natural scenery are absolutely amazing -- when you can see them through the smog. Arguments for Singapore: Better natural environment. Greener, and much cleaner air.Cheaper and better quality housing (Singapore housing is expensive, but HK is like another planet)More diverse -- Chinese/Indian/Malay as well as people from many other places. HK is pretty much exclusively Chinese outside of a few expat areas."},{"instruction":"What does the British word bint refer to?","output":"When used in a British English context it refers to a woman of low status.

English can never be grammar- less ,with rules governing usage of adjectives , adverbs , nouns , articles , the phrases and clauses and etc.. not forgetting the * killer* tenses. But due to the flexibility English allows , those not in the know may think we can juggle the words as we like , seeing nouns and adjectives being verbalized at random.

Mike Tyson hit twice as hard, was twice as fast, and more skilled, than Fury. If somehow mythically they met, timmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmber! CREDIT PICTURE METRO The only thing Fury has on Mike is he is bigger. That’s it. Oh, I can hear it already, the Fury-lovers saying “Fury is 90 pounds heavier and a foot taller, how could he possibly beat him!” Because bigger size differences have been overcome quite easily in boxing! The same fanboys worship at the alter of “bigger is better” without remembering the biggest truism in boxing, as Floyd Mayweather says: “Skills pay the bills.” The fanboys ignore what Fury himself says - and Fury, like Mike Tyson, is a serious student of boxing history and calls it like he sees it Fury makes no bones about the fact he believes Mike Tyson would have knocked him out in the first round. According to Tyson Fury, he would have been knocked out by Iron Mike Tyson in the first round. After Deontay Wilder made his comments about Mike Tyson a while back, Fury spoke up defending Iron Mike, and then, after a reporter asked how he himself would have done against Tyson, Fury said this: Speaking to TMZ Fury said there would be no contest if he fought ‘Iron’ Mike back in his prime: “Yeah, I think Mike Tyson would have knocked me out in 30 seconds.” The reporter asked was he serious to which Fury replied: “Yeah.” [LINKED_TEXT: https://www.boxingnewsandviews.com/2018/10/30/tyson-fury-on-how-he-would-have-done-against-mike-tyson/] [URL: https://www.boxingnewsandviews.com/2018/10/30/tyson-fury-on-how-he-would-have-done-against-mike-tyson/] Fury is no fool. He was able to substitute size for power with Wilder because Wilder had not a clue how to counter Fury’s bullying tactics. Somebody like a Joe Frazier or a Mike Tyson would slip up under his guard and beat his body like a giant Gypsy bongo drum. Bigger is not better, and bigger men than Fury have fallen to smaller men than Mike Tyson… Former two time world champion and current trainer Buddy McGirt said: “Bigger is not better. People always think that -- but it's not better…It's not the bigger man that's going to win the fight, it's the better man -- and the smarter man. It's not the size of the dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog.” And Lord, could the dog in Mike Tyson bite… Great fighters in much smaller classes have frequently beaten far larger men. Middleweight Sam Langford at 161 drew with Heavyweight contender Sam McVeigh who weighed 201.Welterweight Charley Burley beat heavyweight Jay Turner on March 13, 1942, and Turner weighed 219 1/2 pounds to Burley’s 151! He outweighed Charley by 68 pounds, and had a record of 24–22 so he was not a bum. Jay was also 6 inches taller than Charley! Jack Blackburn, history’s greatest trainer, said it best about fighting far less skilled big men: “Don’t worry about him being no giant, by the time you’re done, he be a foot tall laying on the damn canvas!” As for much smaller heavyweights beating up far bigger heavyweights: all time heavyweight Primo Carnera, the former undisputed heavyweight champion, was the #2 contender when he fought Joe Louis. The 6′6″ Carnera had an 85 inch reach, equal to Fury, and weighed a rock solid 260 (Carnera was literally a circus strongman before boxing!). Nonetheless, Louis knocked Carnera down 3 times before the referee stopped the beating. Primo was 63 1/2 pounds heavier than Joe, with the most knockouts of any heavyweight champion and the former Undisputed Heavyweight Champion - and Joe beat him like a bongo drum.top heavyweight contender Buddy Baer and heavyweight contender Abe Simon were also both huge men, and Louis beat them into retirement.Buddy Baer, 6′6 1/2 ″, was the #7 contender when he met Louis, and he nearly matched Tyson Fury in height, had almost the same reach, and was 250 pounds of muscle, when Joe Louis knocked him out in the first round. Baer retired after fighting Louis. He outweighed Joe by 44 pounds and 53 of his 57 wins were by knockout. it didn’t make a bit of difference, Joe sparked him out in 2 minutes and change.The 6′4 1/2″ Abe Simon, was the #5 contender when he met Louis, had an 82 inch reach, and he weighed 255 pounds of muscle. Louis stopped Abe in the 6th round after beating on him all night. Simon also retired after the beating Louis gave him. He had 47 pounds of muscle on Joe, and oh well… Bigger men than that have lost despite having bigger size advantages Nikolay Valuev, the two time WBA heavyweight champion (ranked historically ahead of Fury, by the way!), was soundly beaten by David Haye, who was best at cruiserweight. Valuev was 9 inches taller than Haye, and 99 pounds heavier, with 8 inches of reach advantage.Valuev also lost to Ruslan Chagaev, who was 91 pounds lighter, and 11 inches shorter, and had 14 inches less reach.Haye beat Valeuv easily by using constant movement and slick footwork to dart in and out, hitting Valuev at will, and not providing the biggest man to ever hold a title much to hit. Oh, Valeuv was 99 pounds heavier.Chagaev, 90 3/4 pounds lighter, beat Valeuv by going inside and throwing harder and more accurate punches, especially vicious body shots, under and inside the giant’s reach. And other smaller, but tough and powerful sluggers have beaten up giants. Jack Dempsey, the original Mauler, was 58 pounds lighter than Jess Willard and 6 inches shorter - and he knocked Willard down 7 times in the first round alone!Jack also imposed his will, and style, on Willard. Dempsey darted inside, and beat the stuffing out of the big man.Max Baer was 54 pounds lighter than Primo Carnera - and knocked the big man down 11 times and sent him to the hosptial! Max was able to box outside, but chose to come inside, and beat the big man up, staying inside his long jab. Max Baer said it best, when asked about fighting the gigantic Primo Carnera, Max laughed and said: “There’ll be a lot more of him to hit!” Tyson Fury may be huge and can talk a good game…but… BUT, as Lennox Lewis so wittily said: “Never has a man so big punched so small!” Fury beats an old man and a guy who can’t box, and has one other universally ranked opponent in 13 years and fanboys are elevating him to greatness! What a joke! He simply has not earned all time greatness…or even the title of best right now. He needs to beat Oleksandr Uysk and Anthony Joshua, plus Fat Andy Ruiz, before braying about being the best in 1,000 years. The fanboys who parrot the line that Tyson Fury has proven all time greatness have forgotten the most basic tenet of boxing. As Jack Blackburn, Hall of Fame trainer and fighter says: “We are the business of winning fights. The guy who beats the best the most often is top dog” And Tyson Fury has not done that. How about showing you can defeat the other contenders right now, Tyson Fury? He is huge, with a high ring IQ and courage. He is also not a great athlete, not particularly strong, not a great puncher, and has little speed. He lumbers about like Lurch from the Adam’s Family, without Lurch’s strength. Pure courage, high ring IQ, and great fundamentals are the secret to Fury beating far, far, superior athletes. Past greats would have disposed of him handly, says former champ Larry Holmes: “I would've knocked Fury out,” Holmes stated firmly. “I would've hit him in the body, head, then circled around. Hit him with right hands and left hooks. I ain't going to stand there and trade with him like Wilder did.: Fury is undefeated because he has avoided facing anyone who is a real threat. The Great Jack Blackburn said it best: “Boxing is the ultimate you gotta win business. You can have Joe Louis talent but if you have a Chub Crawford record you ain’t the best, you’re just not.” Tyson Fury has a Chub Crawford record. The only thing he is great at is bragging. In bragging the Big Blowhard is the best of all time. in 15 years, Tyson Fury has fought exactly 3 universally ranked fighters, and only two of them were ranked #3 or higher. One of the two was 39, one can’t box. Fury will actually have to fight some contenders in order to risk a loss. Fury has not fought ANY of the top 10 except Wilder and Whyte, who he was sure he could beat. Jack Blackburn, history’s greatest trainer, had the best, and simplest test for greatness: “Who you beat, when did you beat them, how did you beat them, did you rematch them?” But Jack had a caveat to that test that clearly applies here: “You get more credit for losing to Joe Louis than you do beating Chub Crawford.” Fury never faced the best, he made sure he fought the Chub Crawford’s, the Derek Chisora’s of boxing… Certainly Oleksandr Usyk - who Fury has ducked - does not have respect for Fury’s abilities Oleksandr Usyk’s promoter, Alexander Krassyuk, who tried to entice Fury to be his fighter’s next opponent after Anthony Joshua, believes the Gypsy King (and Wilder) are not skilled enough to handle Usyk. Krassyuk said dismissively after the last Fury-Wilder go around: “Wilder and Fury, in the shape they performed in the fight are a sweet dessert for Usyk because none of them performed with boxing skills, if Usyk shows his technique, his style of technique, I don’t think either Fury or Wilder can do anything serious to Usyk.” [LINKED_TEXT: Neither Tyson Fury Nor Deontay Wilder Have Boxing Skills to Match Oleksandr Usyk, Says Promoter - Nigerian SketchNeither Tyson Fury Nor Deontay Wilder Have Boxing Skills to Match Oleksandr Usyk, Says Promoter, Alexander Krassyuk.https://nigeriansketch.com/neither-tyson-fury-nor-deontay-wilder-have-boxing-skills-to-match-oleksandr-usyk-says-promoter/] [URL: https://nigeriansketch.com/neither-tyson-fury-nor-deontay-wilder-have-boxing-skills-to-match-oleksandr-usyk-says-promoter/]Usyk himself refers to Fury as: “fat belly.” Joe Louis had a “bum of the month” club - but Fury has a bum for a career club. A good example of Fury’s great talk and lousy fighting was his return from his latest retirement to fight, you guessed it, a 38 year old he had beaten twice, and who had lost 3 of his last 4 fights before Fury resurrected him for his latest “title defense.” Derek Chisora has never, in his career, been universally ranked. This last time, when Fury fought his 3rd fight against him, his third “title defense,” the 38 year old Chisora was not ranked at all by anyone but the WBC - who ranked him #13 in the world. So who did Fury duck this time in order to fight an old, fat, unranked in the top 10 journeyman? For the title he holds, the WBC strap, Fury ducked the entire top 10 in December 2022 in order to fight Derek Chisora: Deontay WilderJoe JoyceJospeh ParkerFrank SanchezAndy RuizArslanbek MakhmudovLuis OrtizFlip HgrovicMichael HunterTony Yoka Let this be clear, in his latest fight, for the WBC title, Fury ducked the entire top 10! Why did Tyson Fury fight Derek Chisora for a third time instead of a contender? Anthony Joshua’s Mom was evidently not available. Fury would rather fight a stiff than a contender. Fury has managed to fight only 3 universally ranked contenders in 14 years, only two of them ranked #3 or higher, and except for Deontay Wilder, has one of the worst resumes in title history. Fury ducked not only the entire top 10, but the entire top 12, in order to fight a 38 year old who had 12 losses, including 3 in his last 4 fights. Fury is one of the most overrated fighters of all time, and comparing his record to Mike Tyson’s is like comparing a rusty tricycle to a fine, shiny, Cadillac. This is not knew - in 2019 Tyson Fury was ranked #1 - who did he select to fight that year? Those powerhouses Otto Wallin and Tom Schwarz!Neither was in the top 10, of course.Neither was in the top 20 either.Hell, Schwarz was not in the top 1,000! Unranked Otto Wallin chopped Fury up like a giant beefsteak. Hannibal Boxing was as nice as it could be in describing the Unranked Wallin when Tyson Fury avoided the entire top 10, hell, the entire top 25, and selected Wallin for a defense of his lineal title: “To call Wallin, 20-1 (13), limited would be an understatement…he was considered a walking target when he entered the ring against Fury.” Wallin had never faced a ranked fighter, ever. But he chopped Fury up like a good steak. Fury managed to beat Wallin by decision, then got his face sown back together with a surgeon and 47 stitches. Who did Fury skip over, in order to select a guy never ranked in the top 1,000? The entire top 10! The top 10 contenders at that time were: No. 1 Tyson FuryNo. 2. Deontay WilderNo. 3 Anthony JoshuaNo. 4 Dillian WhyteNo. 5 Luis OrtizNo. 6 Andy Ruiz Jr.No. 7 Alexander PovetkinNo. 8 Joseph ParkerNo. 9 Michael HunterNo. 10 Adam Kownacki And Fury skipped every single available ranked contender not once, but twice, to fight 2 completely unranked opponents, one not even in the top 1,000! Yes! Tyson Fury claimed he was defending the lineal title against two guys who had never been ranked in their lives, while ignoring the entire top 10, or top 20, or top 50! In Schwarz’s case, Fury was by passing the entire top 1,000! Fury avoids anyone he thinks can beat him - look at his blowing up contract talks with Usyk! Usyk’s team finally said enough was enough as Fury deliberately sabatoged the unification fight. Usyk’s manager, Egis Klimas, said: “No matter how much Usyk compromised, he was pushed for more.\\" [LINKED_TEXT: Tyson Fury vs Oleksandr Usyk Off - Dubois Fight To Be Pursued] [URL: https://boxing-social.com/news/tyson-fury-vs-oleksandr-usyk-off/] First, Fury blew up negotiations with the Saudis. Eddie Hearn said: “It’s unclear whether the Fury-Usyk fight will happen, though, as Fury reportedly asked for too much money from the Saudis and spoiled his chances of fighting there.” [LINKED_TEXT: Tyson Fury Has Perfect Style For Oleksandr Usyk Says Tony Bellew - Boxing News 24] [URL: https://www.boxingnews24.com/2023/02/tyson-fury-has-perfect-style-for-oleksandr-usyk-says-tony-bellew/] Then Fury demanded 70% of the purse, even though Usyk owns 3 of the 4 belts, and Fury only holds a quarter. Reports were ongoing that when Usyk gave in to that, Fury began looking for other things to demand, delaying a contract signing until he blew up the fight. Usyk’s manager made clear that Fury kept changing his demands, as Usyk met each, Fury came up with more. Fury made his attitude clear with this post: “From where I'm standing, Usyk, you and your team are worth 30. You either take it or you leave it. And if you don't want it, go fight Daniel Dubois at the Copper Box [Arena in London] and get a few million dollars. If you want to make some real money, come and fight 'The Gypsy King.' ... I will say, for every day from today that you linger, mess around, I'm going to deduct 1% from the 30%. ... Sign the contract, get your money and get f---ed up. ... Tick, tock.\\" [LINKED_TEXT: Sources: Usyk, Fury break off talks for title bout] [URL: https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/35915536/oleksandr-usyk-tyson-fury-break-talks-title-bout] The Usyk fight was one the Big Blowhard never wanted Fury has no real interest in fighting Usyk because Fury has never fought a great boxer in anything close to his prime, and thinks he could easily lose. I doubt a Fury-Usyk fight will ever happen, Fury knows he is not the boxer Usyk is, and he values that zero, and being able to brag he is the greatest, blah, blah, blah… Of course, hundreds of millions of dollars might change his mind…but…unranked Otto Wallin chopped Fury up like a giant beefsteak - what do you think Usyk, an infinitely superior boxer, would do? Fury certainly knows that. If Fury really wanted to challenge himself, or prove his greatness, he would have fought Joshua or Joe Joyce, not a shopworn 38 year old Derek Chisora, a guy he already beat twice, a guy who has lost of 3 of his last 4 fights, a man who has never, ever, in his entire 15 year career been universally ranked! Fury retired rather than give Wlad Klitschko his rematch, he declined to unify the titles when Usyk offered to give Joshua step aside money, and he has fought exactly 3 ranked fighters in 14 years. Fury has proven himself great at bold bragging, but not boxing… Who and what was 1988 Kevin Rooney trained, Mike Tyson? Tyson was more than a puncher as the youngest heavyweight champion ever. He was a boxer-puncher of appalling speed, hand-speed, constant movement and power, who threw \\"punches in bunches\\" with bad intentions while maintaining superb defense. People who never saw him fight, or who never understood boxing in the first place, like Never Was a coach, cannot tell the difference between a volume boxer-puncher, and a single shot headhunter like Wilder. Kevin Rooney, who worked with Tyson, from the start of his career up to the Spinks fight, describes the Prime Tyson better than anyone else. Tyson was trained to be, and was, a volume combination boxer-puncher. Rooney says: “he punched fast and hard. That’s a difficult combination to deal with. Especially when those fast punches come in bunches, in good, solid, combinations,\\" Rooney goes on to talk about Mike's defense in those days, saying: “he was elusive. The best thing about it was these guys couldn’t hit him. When you can’t hit somebody, that becomes very frustrating. In boxing, I’m trying to hit you, you’re moving your head and I can’t hit you. And I’m like, what the ****. That’s what happened in a lot of Mike’s fights. They couldn’t hit him.\\" So what changed? Don King and Robin Givens came into Mike Tyson's life, and it all was gone with the wind. But that is another story - today's is to ask if short Prime Mike Tyson could defeat the tower of today, 6'9\\" Fury. Mike, a short, lightning fast boxer with enormous power and incredible handspeed, was always vulnerable to taller rangy fighters who could rotate out and away, and control the fight with a jab. But in his prime years, under Rooney, he neutralized those fighters by being in good enough shape to go the distance, with constant movement, bobbing and weaving, to slip punches, and great defense. Under Rooney Mike had landed 56 percent of his power punches, which is 15 percentage points higher than the heavyweight average. For instance, against Trevor Berbick, Tyson landed more power punches (46) than the total punches that Berbick threw (43), according to CompuBox. As Rooney said: “speed kills, and Mike had speed, f****** unbelievable speed!\\" Hall of Fame Trainer Eddie Futch assessed the Prime Tyson bluntly: “Under Cus and Rooney Tyson was well conditioned and ready to go all night, lots of gas, great combinations, great defense.\\" Unlike Fury, 1988 Tyson made a practice of brutal knockouts Mike Tyson at his best with Rooney, was a freak of nature. A guy 5'10\\" (who says now he is really 5'9\\") with a 71 inch reach. He should not have been able to terrify giants, and yet he did. Mike Tyson had a combination of hand-speed coupled with power, that enabled him to throw, as he said: “punches in bunches with bad intentions.\\" Teddy Atlas has said a boxer must have three things in order to punch with authority, saying:: “Mike had the hat trick of hands. There are three things a boxer most wants as a puncher, and Tyson had all of them. He had a combination of quickness, speed, and power, which is not common.” Atlas emphasized what set Tyson apart during his days with his original team was his speed and ability to deliver power shots from both sides in abundance: “He hit hard, fast, and often.” And that was the key to Mike: he did not have the hardest one shot punch, but he had the ability to hit mighty hard, mighty fast, mighty often! As Kevin Rooney said,: “speed kills, and Mike had speed, f****** unbelievable speed!\\" Peter McNelly said: “I don’t care what fighter you are – any fighter over 200lbs can punch – but with him, the power and that speed? Deadly combination.” Kevin Rooney, who worked with Tyson, from the start of his career up to the Spinks fight, describes the 1985–1988 Tyson better than anyone else. Tyson was trained to be, and was, a volume combination boxer-puncher. Rooney says: “he punched fast and hard. That’s a difficult combination to deal with. Especially when those fast punches come in bunches, in good, solid, combinations,\\" Lou Saverese said: “The thing about him that’s amazing is there are guys that are strong and there are guys that are fast. He’s strong and fast. It’s so deceiving how quick he is. That’s what makes him so different. You don’t realise how quick he is until you get in there with him.” Dave Jaco said about fighting Mike: “The fight ended at 2:16 of the first round because of the three-knockdown rule. The referee came up to me and said 'Nice fight, David,' \\" Jaco recalled. \\"And I said, 'What the hell are you talking about?' He said 'You've been down three times!' I said, 'Bull----! I've only been down twice!' \\" Donnie Long took up boxing in prison, and thought he had seen it all. He was Mike’s 9th opponent. Donnie said: “I remember going to the fight, and I remember waking up in the hospital,\\" Long said. \\"As far as the actual fight, I can't tell you a single thing.\\" Tyson floored Long three times in 88 seconds. William Hosea, stopped by Mike inside the first round, said sadly:: “I just wanted to get through that first round and get my shoes taped up. That was then.\\" Oops. Marvis Frazier doesn’t remember much of his fight with Tyson: “Tyson was just another guy who was going to be a statistic,” Marvis Frazier recalled.: “Yeah, that’s what I thought. I threw a jab and that’s all I remember.” [LINKED_TEXT: Marvis Frazier has no regrets - The Ring] [URL: https://www.ringtv.com/123931-marvis-frazier-has-no-regrets/] For a brief spell, Tyson opponent Sammy Scaff lived with Tyson at Cus D'Amato's compound in the Catskills. He thought he was ready for Tyson: “At that time, he was pretty quiet and kept to himself, I met him more than halfway across the ring to get an early jump on him. He didn't knock me out, but he broke my nose. I was really gushing blood.\\" Gone in 79 seconds. Conroy Nelson had a plan to fight Tyson: “At the time, I said to myself \\"I'll go in there and box him. He's a shorter guy.' Usually my jab is pretty good, but the way that he avoided the jab ruined the plan I had for him. He set the pace for himself. He ducked underneath it and came up with a body shot, a left hook. Then it was bam, bam, bam! I was on the ropes, and he broke my nose. The referee came over and my eyes were watering. I wanted to continue, but I couldn't see.\\" He lasted 3 minutes and 30 seconds. Mike Spinks said when asked what puncher was the hardest he ever faced: “Oh, Mike Tyson, most definitely the biggest puncher I ever fought Julius Francis said: “If someone hits me I want to hit him back, that's the sort of person I am, but it's different against Tyson. He hit me immediately with a big right and, though I was well up for the fight, I was shocked by the speed and power of the punches that followed. I was knocked down in the first round. I got up, he carried on and the rest of the fight was a bit of a blur. He was hitting me with all sorts of body and head shots; he even lifted me off the ground with some of them and I weighed 17 stone! It was relentless. [LINKED_TEXT: Graham: Tyson foils] [URL: https://www.espn.com/sports/boxing/columns/story?columnist=graham_tim&id=2086508] Comparing competition: Anthony Mason, boxing writer, said: “I think the only way to fairly rank a boxer's place in history is by comparing their résumés. And that does not mean just wins and losses - it is too easy today to fight only has beens or never will be's, and run up the record.” Who did Mike Tyson up to 1988, knock out when he was blasting out heavyweights right and left? former heavyweight champion and then #1 contender Pinklon Thomas,#1 WBA and IBF contender Tyrell Biggs#1 WBA contender Truth Williamsformer heavyweight champion Larry Holmesundefeated former light heavyweight and lineal heavyweight champion Mike Spinksheavyweight champion Trevor Berbickformer heavyweight champion Tony Tubbsfuture heavyweight champion Frank Bruno#2 contender and WBC Cruiserweight Champion Alonso Ratliff Mike also beat by decsion: WBA heavyweight champion and #2 contender Bonecrusher Smithformer heavyweight champion Tony Tuckerformer contender Quick Tillis That is a 100% victory rate, and 75% KO rate, over contenders and top opponents. Tyson Fury has beaten exact three highly ranked opponents in his entire career, only 2 ranked #3 or higher - one was old, one could not box, one had just been knocked out Wlad Klitschko (39 years old)Deontay Wilder (can’t box and has never beaten a top 5 contender)Dillian Whyte (Povetkin had just knocked Whyte colder than a frozen salmon) Fury claims to be the best of the modern heavyweights, but that is like being the best swimmer among American buffalo. His signature victories are over a 39 year old has been, who would have easily beaten him a few years before, and a guy in Deontay Wilder who simply could not box. Fury’s highest ranked opponent who wasn’t old or could box, was Dillian Whyte, who had just been brutally knocked out cold just two fights before Fury. Fury’s only other even half decent opponent was high level journeyman Derek Chisora, who he fought twice, the first time going the distance with, and in the rematch managing to stop him in the 10th round. Dillian Whyte, though Fury beat him, and beat him up, was right about Fury not being some great fighter: Speaking of Fury, [LINKED_TEXT: Whyte stated on Sky Sports, as per The Sun:] [URL: https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/boxing/14625071/whyte-tyson-fury-wilder/] [LINKED_TEXT: “] [URL: https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/boxing/14625071/whyte-tyson-fury-wilder/]Everyone lets him get away with talking s***. It's frustrating. Fury and Wilder get too much credit for their padded, cherry-picked records and have only beaten one current Ring Magazine top 10 fighter each. I've beaten three.” Give Me Sport said it best after analyzing Whtye’s rant: “Whyte does make a valid point. Prior to the Wilder victory in 2020, Fury's most famous win came against the great [LINKED_TEXT: Wladimir Klitschko] [URL: https://www.givemesport.com/wladimir-klitschko] back in 2015. But there are no other top 10 fighters on the Gypsy King's record, and Wilder's record is even less impressive when you look at the calibre of some of his opponents.” Roy Jones points out the lack of names on Fury’s resume (except an old man and Wilder) saying: “Right now, he still has to beat a few more fighters to become one of the greats. There is no comparison in their resumes…Fury has 1/3 the number of top opponents, and his were all old, beat up, or couldn’t box. Hell, Mike had 3 times the number of top opponents the first 3 years he boxed over Fury in his 13 1/2 year career! Unranked Otto Wallin chopped Fury up like a giant beefsteak. Hannibal Boxing was as nice as it could be in describing the Unranked Wallin when Tyson Fury avoided the entire top 10, hell, the entire top 25, and selected Wallin for a defense of his lineal title: “To call Wallin, 20-1 (13), limited would be an understatement…he was considered a walking target when he entered the ring against Fury.” Wallin had never faced a ranked fighter, ever. But he chopped Fury up like a good steak. Fury managed to beat Wallin by decision, then got his face sown back together with a surgeon and 47 stitches. Styles of the two proposed opponents: Styles make fights… Mike Tyson was pure speed and volume punching with power. He would dart in and out, punching away. It boils down to this: Fury tries to make it the WWE and keep Mike out of range by leaning, grabbing, clinching, and using his 277 pounds to lay on him and wear him down as he did Deontay Wilder. Mike on the other hand, tries to evade the bigger but far slower man, dart in, and get busy! Fury’s abilities and style Fury’s biggest ability is his mind, his ring IQ, size, his ability to adapt, and his ferocious willingness to do what he has to win. He is a first rate fundamental boxer, and though he lacks traditional athleticism, speed, and strength, he is a giant, and knows very well how to use that size. Further, like Lennox Lewis, Fury is not adverse to doing what Manny Steward said needs to be done when you face a faster opponent beating you off the jab: “Take it to the street.” He basically beat Wilder by laying on him, leaning on him, draping himself all over him, jab, grab, lean, clinch, and use his 277 pounds to wear him down and out. Could he do it to the far, far, far, faster and infinitely more skilled Mike Tyson? Tale of the Tape Size: Fury is 6′9″ tall, (really 6′7 1/2″) with an 85 inch reach, and weighed 277 in his last Wilder fight Tyson was 5′9 1/2 weighed 215 and had a 71-inch reach Size advantage: FURY by a mile Speed: Fury is moderately quick for a giant. Tyson is incredibly quick for a heavyweight, especially hand speed Speed advantage: Tyson by two miles and a horse Strength: Fury is strong, but not as strong as his size would indicate. Tyson was pit bull strong Advantage: Slight to FURY who will use his size to substitute for traditional strength Power: Fury showed you can substitute bulk and size for traditional power using the right technique, but he still lacks traditional punching power Tyson had rare power from his volume power punching and had a 94% KO rate at that point in time Power advantage: Mike Tyson by three miles and a fast car Fundamentals and technique: Fury has great fundamentals and sound technique Tyson had greater fundamentals and sound technique Fundamentals and technique: Tyson Defense: Fury has a good chin, and a good defense, but can be hit Tyson had a great defense at that point in his career, he used the bob and weave to slip and duck punches on his way in - but his competition was not as good up to that point in time, and Ali had seen and adapted to more than Mike Defense advantage: Tyson by a quarter mile Intangibles: Fury has a fighter’s heart, a great chin, a good ring IQ, and solid intangibles. Tyson never once got up off the canvas and beat a fighter, but he was the best he would ever be at this moment in time. Intangibles: Even Other factors: Fury is also a very dirty fighter. Is there a foul Tyson Fury doesn’t like to committ? He has been penalized for punching repeatedly behind the head of Wlad Klitschko, penalized for headbutting Steve Cunningham, penalized for hitting off the break against Kevin Johnson, and penalized for fouling against John McDermott in their second fight. But against Iron Mike this would not help him as much as usual. Mike reacted poorly to being fouled, (see Holyfield’s missing ear). When Fury started fouling the tough kid from Brooklyn, he would discover the joys of having his kneecaps bitten. A 2020 Fury versus a 1988 Mike Tyson fight: Like most fights, this would be a clash of styles: Fury would desperately jab, grab, lean, and try to lay draped all over Mike, to smother his punches and tire him outMike would pitbull past the leaning giant, and beat his body like a chef pounding a big fat steak. As Rooney said: “speed kills, and Mike had speed, f****** unbelievable speed!\\" Tyson (I cannot outpunch my Granny) Fury would fall in one round to a 1987–8 Tyson, as he has about as much chance of keeping that Tyson off him as I do of becoming the next Pope! He has heart and boxing skills, if he could only punch...but if I had wings, I could fly! Fury would try to smother Tyson with his great size, and huge arms. But he simply does not have the power to keep Tyson out of range, and Tyson would beat his body like a huge British Bongo Drum. In addition, people forget how blazingly fast Mike Tyson was - Fury simply does not have the speed, strength, or power, to keep Tyson at bay. Mike Tyson would have gotten in-range, and beaten Fury’s body like Charlie Watts playing the drums until the giant Clown fell down. Fury simply does not have the speed to stay outside of Tyson’s range, the power to keep a Tyson out of range and off him, and Mike was far faster, hit harder, and the Rooney-trained Mike would have had a good fight plan to cope with Fury’s size. If Fury resorted to dirty tricks, Mike would teach him some he has never seen from the mean streets of New York! Fury might be taller than Mike, but all that would mean would be he would have had further to fall. Timmmmmmmmmmmmmber!

So I pulled out my trusty compass and observed that the mosque orientation and the faithful were praying in the wrong direction. The prayer mats, structures etc were directed to the west so the Cleric, Architect or Contractor goofed. Well, it turned out I goofed. It then occurred to me that anyone living in Mecca was at 39.8 E longitude while if you were in Xian you would be at 108.9E longitude. (towards Mecca’s east).

How could it happen? Without a cause, there can never be an effect. SPACE, MATTER, ENERGY and TIME are the parents of the BIG BANG. They are indestructible, eternal, beginningless, endless, inconceivable, limitless, unimaginable, timeless; precisely INFINITE. Out of the MATTER and ENERGY existing in the SPACE, NATURE creates, maintains and dissolves UNIVERSES, at different periods of TIME, by way of BIG BANGS. Yes ! UNIVERSES had been created , maintained and dissolved millions of times in the past; and will be created, maintained and dissolved millions of times in the future too. This is not the first UNIVERSE that had been created ! Compared to the SPACE, the UNIVERSE is a grain of sand on the Marina beach or on the Miami beach or in the Sahara desert or all of the three put together. Such is the INFINITENESS of the SPACE and FINITENESS of the UNIVERSE. How had the BIG BANG happened ; what activity in the SPACE had lead to the formation of the SINGULARITY ( a CONDENSED SINGLE SOURCE) which was the ‘ mother ‘ of the BIG BANG; how was the UNIVERSE created ; had all been explained below , in 6 stages, which can be perceived as a Universal Cycle. Kindly go through the same. STAGE 1 : All the stars in the UNIVERSE , running to trillions to septillions in numbers, after exhausting their life time and energy, converge, shrink and contract ; and become a CONDENSED SINGLE SOURCE ( SINGULARITY, which is the condensed form MATTER and ENERGY) at the CENTRE of the UNIVERSE. STAGE 2 : That CONDENSED SINGLE SOURCE ( SINGULARITY) remains dormant for a few million billion years. Except that CONDENSED SINGLE SOURCE ( SINGULARITY), the SPACE is empty with vacuum everywhere. Fusion ,combustion and amalgamation take place inside that CONDENSED SINGLE SOURCE ( SINGULARITY), due to which that CONDENSED SINGLE SOURCE ( SINGULARITY) starts spinning with enormous , immeasurable speed. STAGE 3 :At the breaking point, that spinning CONDENSED SINGLE SOURCE ( spinning SINGULARITY)blows out, blasts out , explodes; and the fragments of that spinning SOURCE are thrown out throughout the SPACE in all the directions. This activity only is termed as BIG BANG. STAGE 4 : In the absence of any obstructions in the SPACE and the presence of the vacuum, those fragments, thrown out throughout the SPACE in all the directions by that CONDENSED SINGLE spinning SOURCE , travel to various distances depending upon their individual mass. This activity is only termed as EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE. STAGE 5 : After reaching their maximum distances depending upon their individual mass, those fragments, formed as STARS , start revolving around the CENTRE of the UNIVERSE, as they were thrown out from a spinning SOURCE . That path of revolution is only termed as ORBIT. The place where that SINGLE spinning SOURCE was once standing, is the CENTRE of the UNIVERSE. STAGE 6 : From the dust and ashes of the STARS , are created planets ( and natural satellites too ) ,which revolve around the respective STARS. All these STARS put together is the UNIVERSE. There are no divisions and classifications in the UNIVERSE. Various galaxies, Observable Universe, Parallel Universe, omniverse and Multiverses are our own segmentations only for our own understanding ; but are not separate entities. All these trillions of STARS ( carrying along with them, their planets and natural satellites) continue revolving on their respective ORBITS for trillions of septillions of years , around the CENTRE of the UNIVERSE , before getting dissolved, to become MATTER and ENERGY.

They are not some kind of gambling or a way to earn fast money that is already “too late” to participate in it. Cryptocurrencies offer an alternative to the traditional financial system, their purpose is not to make you rich, their main goal is to provide you with the freedom of owning your assets without relying on intermediates and without the risk of losing them due to someone’s fault or decision. People should see them as an alternative that won’t just disappear. Think about it like you have fiat saving in EUR and USD - you keep your money in one of these fiat alternatives, and you don’t expect to gain profit from one of the currencies. Cryptocurrency is just another alternative to keep your assets.

However there are problems with having a large game that, if not overcome, can wreck the game. Not maintaining density This is a problem that comes with selling a game on its size. They double the size of the map, but keep a similar number of things to do. All it means is that you're spending more time travelling between points rather than actually playing the game. Worse, they can give you a vehicle to use and you end up spending less time playing the game than if you had a smaller map and traversed by foot. Early [LINKED_TEXT: Grand Theft Auto] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto] games (I stopped playing after IV) suffered from this; each map was bigger, but you had faster cars meaning that the size of the map just became a figure. The actual gameplay remained pretty similar in scope. I don't want a large barren world; I'd prefer a smaller but denser world. If you build a large world then be prepared to fill it with interesting features and interactive entities so that it feels busy. Maintaining density by copying and pasting repetitive challenges This is another great Sin. Often it appears in games that are segmented that you unlock as you progress; usually by doing x number of mini missions to qualify for the next area. [LINKED_TEXT: Spider-Man 3] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_3_(video_game)] did it ok, but [LINKED_TEXT: Assassin's Creed] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin%27s_Creed_(video_game)] got quite repetitive very quickly and [LINKED_TEXT: Guild Wars 2] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guild_Wars_2] very quickly became a game of grinding mini quests that were virtually identical to each other with the odd main quest to liven things up a little bit before returning to grinding again. It's the easy way out of maintaining density of gameplay, but unless it is meaningfully different, it doesn't help much beyond satisfying the maths. I don't want to have to do the same thing over and over in order to progress, I left that behind when I stopped playing Pokèmon. Instead fill the game with meaningful experiences. Have the characters at least appear to have depth to them. Give me mini quests that draw me in beyond “Go fetch 10 of this.” Not having replayability Usually a symptom of the previous two, if there are not a lot of meaningful gameplay experiences, you just can't bring yourself to replay them. Not having adequate travel abilities You don't have want to spend your entire time just travelling to get to where you want to go. You need some of this to build scale and to have that density of gameplay, but I really don't want to be trudging the same piece of 30 mile road twenty times to fulfil a quest. You need an adequate system for bypassing the drudgery, but at the same time doesn't minimalist the scope of the game and getting the player to interact with it. Give me a game that exploring is fun and meaningful, but at the same time when I want to I can just get into the game and play; I don't have to spend 30 hours in the wilderness getting to the next city, but give me the option to do do if I wish. As you can see, there is no real hard limit to the size of the game, but the size of the game does need to be in proportion to the ability of the developers. If you can't populate a massive world with meaningful entities, then scale it back. Don't make it big for the sake of being big; instead build the world up as much as you can with decent gameplay. If you are a great developer than you will need to create a massive world to contain the game, rather than trying to create a game to fill your massive world. As a rule of thumb, I find that Elder Scrolls does a decent job in the above areas."},{"instruction":"w do you calculate","output":"There are a few ways to calculate 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 quickly. One way is to use the following formula: sum = n(n+1)/2 where n is the number of terms in the series. In this case, n is 10, so the sum is equal to: sum = 10 * 11 / 2 = 55 Another way to calculate the sum is to add the first and last terms, then add the second and second-to-last terms, and so on. This will give you a series of five pairs of numbers, each of which adds up to 11. The sum of the series is then equal to 5 * 11 = 55. Finally, you can also use a calculator to calculate the sum. This is the most straightforward way to do it, but it may not be the quickest. Here are some code examples that you can use to calculate the sum of the series: Python def sum_of_numbers(n): \\"\\"\\" Calculates the sum of the first n natural numbers. Args: n: The number of natural numbers to sum. Returns: The sum of the first n natural numbers. \\"\\"\\" if n == 0: return 0 else: return n + sum_of_numbers(n - 1) def main(): \\"\\"\\" Calculates and prints the sum of the first 10 natural numbers. \\"\\"\\" print(sum_of_numbers(10)) if __name__ == \\"__main__\\": main() JavaScript function sumOfNumbers(n) { if (n === 0) { return 0; } else { return n + sumOfNumbers(n - 1); } } console.log(sumOfNumbers(10));"},{"instruction":"What would happen if we could use 100% of our brain?","output":"We already do use 100% of our brain."},{"instruction":"What is the best ayurvedic medicine for diabetes?","output":"Check out this [LINKED_TEXT: Special OfferTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT AN ACTUAL NEWS ARTICLE, BLOG, OR CONSUMER PROTECTION UPDATE.

My elementary school was private and very prestigious (Kobe Bryant's daughters currently go there). We had to wear uniforms and the rules were very strict. My friends and I were known for our defiance and troublemaking. On the last day of school as an 8th grader, I decided to pull the best prank of my 9 year career (kindergarten through 8th grade). Being a private school, we had all of our lunches catered from various, local, third-party restaurants each school day. The people in charge of ordering the food were a group of student council upper classmen and a committee of parents that probably oversaw the food budget. Anyways, on the last week of school there were no lunches being served because we had half days every day and went home early. For the solo prank, I thought it would be a good idea to call in some pizzas from a local pizza shop. I used my mom's cell phone the day before I planned to have the pizzas arrive and because I hadn't hit puberty, I talked in a really high voice pretending to be a girl from student council, and ordered 15 large pizzas to be delivered to the school the next day. \\"Pizza prank day\\" arrives and I, being the naive idiot that I was, started to tell people what was going to occur. Come \\"lunch time\\" mostly everyone in the upper class (about 30 people) had congregated to the front of the school to see these pizzas being delivered. Sure enough at the time I had scheduled a car rolls up to the front of the school and out comes the pizza boy. The poor kid had to make 3 trips from the car to the school because there were so many pizzas. Everyone was laughing hysterically but I began to slightly panic because I knew that too many people had known what I did and that I was likely going to get in trouble at this point. The prinicpal announced on the loud speaker to the entire school minutes later, \\"whoever ordered the pizzas, they are at the front desk.\\" The school was frantic because they had no idea who ordered these pizzas. The next day, every 8th grader was called into the official conference room at the school and all that was in there were the principal, the vice principal, the woman in charge of discipline and a white board with nothing written on it but, \\"305.73\\" in red marker. The authority figures explained to us that pizzas were delivered the day before, they knew it was a prank and that someone was going to have to pay 305.73 (they must have left a nice tip). In small groups, students were removed from the room. There were a few of us who were known to be the troublemakers, so we were pulled out last. By the end of the interrogations, I was found guilty and fessed up (someone told them it was me of course). My \\"punishment\\" was that I had to spend the first two weeks after graduation (my summer after I had just finished 9 years at this institution) with the janitors doing whatever it is they needed me to do. My mom was given the option to pay instead but she sent me to this \\"labor camp\\" because she too was not happy. It ended up being some of the best 2 weeks I've ever had. I learned so much about hands on labor and about the beautiful lives of the janitors that worked there. The two brothers lived together, worked at the school together and their third brother used to be a part of it all but was shot and killed when they were younger. They were the nicest people and taught me a lot about work ethic, hard work and philosophy really. It was almost a perfect send off because I was able to see parts of the school (went on all the rooftops, etc.) that I had never seen before in my 9 years there. That whole moment in time reminded me a lot of The Breakfast Club. Needless to say it was a blessing in disguise and I would order those pizzas 10 times out of 10 if I had to do it again. I thank Isidro and Lorenzo for that great experience...and maybe my poor pranking skills."},{"instruction":"What are some travel tips for an Indian visiting Bhutan?","output":"10 Travel Safety Tips For First-Time Travelers. 1. Get Travel Insurance I know this sounds like a no-brainer, but you’d be surprised by how many people get too caught up in their trip itinerary plans to think of travel insurance. If you don’t already have it, you most definitely need it; safeguard against lost luggage or canceled flights can save you big bucks in the long run and give you peace of mind. 2. Keep Electronics to A Minimum For tech-savvy millennials it’s tempting to tote around every camera accessory possible, but in the case of electronics less is more. You don’t need your huge digital camera on every excursion, and who are you kidding – you won’t be working from your laptop in your free time. Your phone can take awesome quality photos and send emails if need be. Lugging around bulky electronics not only slows you down but also makes you an obvious target for those looking to snatch them up. With the exception of your phone (obviously), keep your electronics locked up in your hotel room’s valuables safe – or better yet, don’t bring any on your trip to begin with! 3. Keep Your Head Up Walk like you know where you’re going; it’s widely known that your less likely to be approached if you are quick and alert. As an alternative to staring down at your phone’s Google maps while navigating around a new city, plug in an earbud and listen to the voice guide you! You’ll take in more sights and be more aware of your surroundings. 4. Be Cautious at Bars No one’s telling you NOT to go on Tinder dates when traveling, just be careful. Advertising that you’re in town on vacation makes you a bit more susceptible to being targeted than the next person. Watch your drink (that goes without saying), but watch your bartender make your drink too; not everyone is trustworthy. [LINKED_TEXT: (HEY! Are you planning a trip to somewhere? Don’t forget to check out My Travel Vlog for Travel Tips And Tricks.)] [URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2trVK0yAEU] 5. Download Safety Apps With solo travel trending right now, it’s likely that at some point you’ll end up wandering around an unfamiliar city alone. Family and friends can keep tabs on you even from a distance, thanks to some of the free apps on the market. Must-haves include: Uber: Most 20- or 30- somethings already have Uber downloaded, but don’t forget that it spans beyond just your local barhopping scene! If public transportation intimidates or confuses you, don’t be afraid to call for an Uber during your travels. bSafe: Although your friends or family members must download it as well, it is definitely worth it if traveling alone. If you are in a situation that feels unsafe, the app can give your friends your location, have them “follow” you as you walk to your destination, or send them an SOS if you are panicked. Although they may not be able to come to your rescue, they can notify police who can. Drunk Mode: Another app that’s probably already downloaded on your phone, but (amazingly enough) can be put to use when sober. Turn it on before setting out on your day’s activities, and if you decide to separate from the group at some point to take your own detour it’s easy to find your friends’ location. Plus, it’s fun to look back and see where you went at the end of the day! 6. Be Aware of Your Money Keep always keep small amounts of cash on hand, and keep copies of the fronts and backs of all of your credit cards (as well as passports or IDs). Also, don’t forget to notify your bank that you are traveling because they will freeze your cards at the most inconvenient times if you don’t. 7. Dress Inconspicuously Try not to stand out; do some basic research as to what the locals generally wear. What may be standard summer clothing in the U.S. may be much too revealing in other countries and can even be considered inappropriate. Men and women alike, though, should try to be as inconspicuous as possible when in an unfamiliar place. Blend in! You’re less likely to be targeted by pickpockets and potentially dangerous predators. Which leads me to my next point… 8. Don’t Let People Distract You Pick-pocketing is a thing; it really happens, especially in tourist hotspots. The innocent-looking woman or child shoving a sign or paper in your face is often an attempt to catch you off guard and grab your wallet. Don’t be vulnerable – if anyone suddenly approaches you, be mindful that it may be a ploy to quickly divert your attention. Keep valuables secure on your body at all times! 9. Be Health-Conscious If you happen to get a few bug bites or a scratch while traveling – especially internationally – make sure to clean and treat them carefully and quickly! Neglect to care for even the most minimal of flesh wounds could lead to serious discomfort and health issues. Keep in mind that most travel and health insurers do not cover medical fees internationally; although your insurance may reimburse you in the future, be prepared to front the cost of any potential hospital bills. 10. Know Your Country’s Embassy Information Your country’s embassy or consulate in foreign countries can be helpful in so many unexpected situations. Know their contact information and location! Or better yet, if you live in the U.S. you can sign up for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program – a free service provided by the government that keeps you updated on safety and security information, and can help you stay in contact with your family in case of emergency.

Compassion has nothing to do with certain only kind behavior or nice soothing actions. Compassion is about being authentic, discerning, speaking you truth, saying no directly and boldly and unapologeticly. Because if you take a role and mental idea of nice and kind monk who never say No - you are dummy ego. Compassion is also saying what people do not like to hear as well as doing things many wont be happy about since its not mind who evaluates but consciousness and consciousness knows that neither good or bad exist. Therefore only raw real authenticity is the key and not mental idea of being nice = compassionate. Compassion works in both ways whether you help someone or deciding not because of discernment. Discernment is the key. Otherwise most of the people would love to take advantage of you being endlessly kind and nice and thinking that this is compassion. Thats not compassion - thats martyr ego position or so called pleaser ego. In real compassion - you can say yes and no equally without being attached to any behavior or role."},{"instruction":"w long does a hairbrush spanking hurt after?","output":"If my mother gave me a spanking during the day usually had to bring my pillow down to sit on at supper time.

Unlike a VPN, you don't connect to a network, you pass the connection to the Internet through a proxy server. In this case, the IP address and location are replaced with proxy data. But, unlike a VPN. the user uses the individual IP address of the proxy, not the IP address of the entire network. That's why proxies are used to maintain anonymity and bypass blocked sites, because each proxy uses an individual IP address, which protects your accounts from being banned.

Bravo! Real Hero: doctor who charges Rs 5 for treatment Doctor Shyama Prasad Mukherjee has been treating poor patients for a mere Rs five for the last 55 years. He is said to be a medical marvel of a different kind. His consultation charges have helped many poor patients in times of sickness when other doctors and hospitals are too expensive for them. Dr SP Mukherjee said, \\"I have learnt that one has to draw a line and to know how much is enough. That's the point that one should look for because if I am the doctor I should have a sympathetic attitude to my patients. Everything cannot be commercial. If I would have liked to become a billionaire or millionaire, I should have taken up some other profession.\\" Dr Mukherjee, 75-years-old, has been following his professions' Hippocratic oath every single day since 1957. Perhaps his own personal tragedy holds the key to his selfless service. He lost his first wife when she was just 29. She died of an incurable disease leaving behind two young daughters. Dr Mukherjee remarried but sadly his second wife is crippled and bed ridden for the last three years. \\"So things have been very bad… Very very bad all my life. I could have served the people better if my family life could have been better,\\" Dr Mukherjee said. However, most of his patients are not aware of Dr Mukherjee's personal tragedy, for them his cure is god sent. Dr Mukherjee spends two hours everyday in his Lalpur Pathology Lab. What he earns in the pathology lab helps him give free medicines to patients and treat them for just Rs 5 - an insignificant amount in today's time. This Rs 5 treatment is what gives his patients the cure and happiness which is priceless, and perhaps in their good will Dr Mukherjee finds a remedy to his life's tragedies. \\"When a child suffering from broncho demonia or a child suffering from diarrhea vomiting comes to me in a very precarious condition I treat him. Sometimes I suggest him for hospitalisation but they don't go and subsequently they come back with a smiling child that is my reward and that is my professional fees\\" . The Good Doctor This is not all. Dr. Mukherjee does not even charge extremely poor patients, besides offering them free medicines, which he gets from pharmaceutical companies. Dr Mukherjee also advises his relatively well-off patients, who feel embarrassed in paying just Rs five as his consultancy, to help others. “I cannot accept more than Rs 5,” he says. With the clock striking half past ten, Doctor Shyama Prasad Mukherjee settles down at his clinic near Lalpur in Ranchi where he stays till 7.30 PM. These days, the first half is reserved for his pathology laboratory, while he devotes his entire time after lunch attending patients. The age may have made its impact, but it is no deterrent for this indefatigable old man from Jharkhand. Mukherjee’s story would be incomplete without a mention of his who despite facing several ailments has helped him remain focused and motivated. Even from the little income, Dr Mukherjee makes donations to schools. Over the years, the doctor has made his little compromises to bring a benign smile on the pale, ragged faces of the poor he serves. “My pension and the earning from the pathology lab help me run my household. You need to draw a line somewhere. One can desire for so many things but perhaps one does not need everything that he craves for,” he says. Even today, 44 years after he started practicing in Ranchi, Dr Mukherjee is still motivated to treat patients for a pittance. But what drives him on? “A poor man’s plight and the realisation is that my contribution is still too little to make a difference,” he says. In fact, Dr Mukherjee is known to be a person who has refused requests for newspaper interviews and many felicitation offers. He does not do it for publicity.” Sources: Newspapers and various websites."},{"instruction":"w can I be a bulk SMS messages provider?","output":"Nowadays, the world has completely changed.

Above: The Vickers “Valiant” V-Bomber, the MOD’s safety net. A blow to AVRO and Handley Page for sure at the time, but this only pushed the other competitors to ‘out do’ the standard set by the Valiant, Victor soon followed with its revolutionary Crescent Wing design the wings were structurally secured foreword of the bomb bay granting the Victor’s the best conventional bomb carrying capacity loading not 20 not 25 but an astonishing 35, 1000 pound bombs! This thing if used in a conventional bombing raid would’ve put the fear of god into whatever poor sod happened to be in this things sights. Above: The Handley Page “Victor” V-Bomber, a step in the right direction. Fun Fact: The Victor is the only V-Bomber to have dropped a live nuclear weapon on Christmas Island (Operation: Grapple) for testing Britain’s independent atom and Hydrogen bombs. After the American government kept the technology from us, the people that gave America the technology to BUILD the atom bombs in project Manhattan. (Yeah still a little salty about it and yes we Brit’s will continue to hold that against America.) Then came the Vulcan, the most sophisticated of the V-Bombers, this beast had a climb rate un-matched for the decade, it’s four engines when fully upgraded in it’s later years could produce 20,000 lbf (89 kN) of thrust. The Delta wing proved to be superior to the traditional and crescent wing designs of it’s cousins, capable of hitting just below Mach 1, below typical radar ceilings, the design proved to be the most durable with fewer if any stress fractures while travelling through the thicker atmosphere. The Vulcans were so effective during NATO training operations, namely SKYSHIELD the Vulcans penetrated and successfully ‘Bombed’ key American Cities with only one of the eight bombers intercepted in 1960 by an F-101 Voodoo. Above: The AVRO “Vulcan” V-Bomber, the only V-Bomber to deploy in anger. The Results of Operation SKYSHIELD were partially de-classified in 1997, but have yet to be fully disclosed to the public. God damn can this thing put the fear of death into you with it’s iconic Vulcan Howl. They don’t make them like they used to I’ll tell you that much. Fun Fact: The Vulcan also has the distinct honour of starring in one of the worlds largest film franchise’s in the world. James Bond: Thunderball. (1965). Now to answer the question: Conventionally bombing a target I’d pick a Valiant, it has the greatest bomb carrying capacity of the three, it also has the distinct advantage of looking absolutely threatening, it looks like something from a 1950 SCI-FI franchise. For strategic bombing capacity I’d go Vulcan without a question, skimming below radar no problem, climbing at ridiculous rates to her full ceiling height, check, could out run and out manoeuvre any fighters in thinner atmospheres, oh and lets not forget the damn thing can do THIS!

Start slowly: Yin yoga can be challenging at first, especially if you're not used to holding poses for long periods of time. Start with basic poses like the butterfly, child's pose, and sphinx pose, and gradually work your way up to more advanced poses. 2. Focus on your breath: In Yin yoga, the breath is an essential part of the practice. Use your breath to help you relax into each pose and release any tension in your body. 3.

For example, magazines, clips, assault rifles, assault guns, assault weapons, ARs, etc.","output":"Kevin's answer is great! I'll answer with a much shorter list for reference. I can't tell you \\"all\\" terminology but I will list the ones I believe matter during conversation. Magazines - These are the plastic or metal cases that hold your ammunition. You will hear people say \\"clip\\" or \\"clips\\". That is wrong. Clips are something else entirely. Here is a fun picture that is very clear. Assault Rifles - This used to be easy to answer. The media has done a phenomenal job disseminating factually wrong information. In the broadest sense you can consider any maganize operated long gun as an \\"assault rifle\\". To people more familiar with the industry, an assault rifle would be a military issued carbine or AK, GSK etc capable of burst, rapid, auto fire. *These firearms are not used by civilians. It is technically possible to get a full or burst auto but it is 10's of thousands of dollars and just not worth it. Most people, soldiers included will use semi fire 90% of the time. An additional note on assault Rifles. AR15, AR10, these do not mean assault rifle or auto rifle. ARmalite is a company that produces an m16 style carbine…like many many other companies. If you hear some idiot news anchor talking about assault this and assault military that. You can diehard all of that and know that they just mean a long gun that is black and Scarry. I have an AR10. That doesn't look Scarry AT ALL. I'd much rather being hit by a .223 than a 7.62 or .308"},{"instruction":"Prince Harry says he and Meghan won't return to the UK.

If the pizza delivery driver doesn’t leave, then the castle doctrine can be invoked. Not saying I agree with that, but try going inside a hotel/casino in Reno or Vegas and reporting the security staff because they confiscated your possessions while detaining you; the police won’t do anything and will tell you that it being private property gives the security staff the “right” to take your stuff. If you’re kicked out of the hotel without being given your valuables, it’s considered a civil matter. So why then, can the homeowner not keep the pizza when hotels, casinos, and even department stores (see shopkeeper’s privilege) get away with keeping your possessions? Even some movie theaters can confiscate your camera if they catch you recording while a movie is playing. If big businesses like movie theaters are allowed to steal your valuables, then why can’t the homeowner take the pizza without paying? Do you not respect private homes the way you respect big businesses like Pizza Hut? Legally speaking: The police could technically arrest you for theft since they exist to serve big business, not the people, and also because somoneone being on private property doesn’t mean you can snatch their pizza or laptop from them, but the whole “arrest for theft” thing is really only true if you take the entire pizza rather than just sample a slice. Moreover, that still doesn’t guarantee prosecution since only the D.A. can file charges, and if I was on the jury, I would acquit any homeowner who chose to do that. It also doesn’t give the pizza guy the right to remain on the property. So if he refuses to leave, that’s trespassing and the castle doctrine can be invoked."},{"instruction":"Are namjoon and rm close?","output":"Yes, ThEy’Re PrActiCaLLy ThE sAmE perSOn"},{"instruction":"w do I get rid of lower back pain?","output":"Dr. Steve Young DPT, MPT, CSCS has 31 years experience and is one of the world’s leading Back pain specialists and injury prevention experts He’s helped more than 31,591 people to completely eliminate their joint pain.

The Telecaster was more of a breakthrough in terms of design and tone, and the Gibson Les Paul wins for sheer power and attack - great live - whereas a single-coil Fender guitar sometimes struggles to get “over the top” of the mix, unless you are able to play loud. Single-coils sound great through a high-gain setting on your amp. This is especially true of a Tele. Many of Jimmy Page's greatest solos/riffs were played and recorded using a Telecaster (Stairway to Heaven) but he'd use the Les Paul for the live shows. For versatility, the Strat wins.

All I need is you're name…."},{"instruction":"Are scrubs soiled with blood destroyed or laundered?","output":"There are three areas of the hospital where you are especially likely to get blood and other bodily fluids on your clothing; surgery, labor and delivery and the ER. Each manages it a little differently. If you work at a hospital with access to the hospital scrubs as your uniform then at the end of your shift you strip off your dirty stuff and place it in a hamper of sorts and it is laundered by the hospital. This is the standard operating procedure in the OR and L&D. It applies to pretty much everyone that works there including the nursing staff and physicians. In the ER however, most of the nurses wear their own scrubs that they bring from home. A lot of the doctors do too. they may choose to do this because it is more comfortable or flattering because you can purchase scrubs that are somewhat tailored. The trade off to having your own scrubs is that the hospital doesn’t launder them. That is, you take them home with you. You launder them yourself. Now, working in the ER is not a bloodbath, contrary to popular opinion. However, it is not uncommon to get bodily fluids on your shoes or clothing during a shift. I have seen a lot of staff sitting in the break room, using hydrogen peroxide to lift blood out of their scrubs before taking them home. Sometimes though, even hydrogen peroxide isn’t enough. We had a nurse in our department named Mark. He was a very tall man. I believe I am not exaggerating when I say he was 6’5”. One shift he was taking care of a patient who was intoxicated and possibly had overdosed. In the course of his care for the patient he got some throw-up on his clothes. By “throw-up” I mean vomit. By “some”, I mean like a Monty Python skit with a vomit hose. By “on his clothes” I mean covered from head to toe in Taco Bell and partially digested vodka, beer and some red sauce. Because Mark was so tall he always had his own scrubs that fit him well. After this case he came out to the ER after a brief break wearing hospital scrubs that were far too short for him. he looked like he was wearing knickers because his pants were so high-water. I asked him what he did with his scrubs and he told us “I threw them away in a contamination bin.” If that weren’t funny enough he then added, “My underwear too.” I guess the vomit soaked through his scrubs. There was just no way he was even going to try to launder them at home after all that. Can’t say I blamed him."},{"instruction":"Who is the most powerful Marvel character in MCU?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: powerful Characters In The Marvel Universe] [URL: https://www.fortressofsolitude.co.za/15-most-powerful-characters-in-the-marvel-universe/] One-Above-All [LINKED_TEXT: One-Above-All] [URL: https://www.fortressofsolitude.co.za/who-is-the-one-above-all/], who first appeared in Doctor Strange #13, is the most powerful and the most mysterious character in the Marvel multiverse.

It is based on what texture of chicken do you want. If you want a juicy chicken then do marinate it for atleast 1 hour before frying. Once the chicken is marinated heat the oil at high flame and put the chicken in that hot oil at high flame and after a minute of frying reduce the flame to medium and continue frying for next 4 to 5 minutes or till the brests becomes golden brown in colour and you will get a juicy chicken breasts. Or you can use high flame continuously to get crispy one. You can use egg wash (dipping in egg) and coat it with little flour and bread crumbs before frying also.. It will give even more juicy texture. With crispy coating on the surface. For more information there are 2 parts of chicken breast. One is the main breast with exercised muscles and another is called supreme which has very tender muscles and can be eaten raw. You can cook this supreme for about 2 minutes maximum for great taste. Logic behind oil temperature and juicy chicken breasts High temperature sears the outer surface of the chicken thus helps in retaining juice inside it. The pores of the flesh gets sealed and the chicken juice does not comes out while frying . Low temperature oil oozes out the juices from chicken thus end up making the chicken rubbery and dry.

Network marketing involves selling products or services through a network of distributors, and it can provide the potential for earning additional income. However, it's important to approach network marketing with caution and conduct thorough research before getting involved. Here are a few steps you could consider: Research network marketing companies: Look for reputable network marketing companies that align with your interests and values. Investigate their products, compensation plans, training, and support systems.Evaluate the business opportunity: Assess the costs involved in joining a network marketing company, such as startup fees, product purchases, and ongoing expenses. Consider the potential income and time commitment required to build a successful network marketing business.Develop skills and knowledge: Network marketing often requires marketing, sales, and communication skills. Take advantage of training resources provided by the company and invest time in learning and improving these skills.Create a business plan: Develop a clear plan outlining your goals, strategies, and target market. Consider how you will promote and sell the products, as well as build and expand your network of distributors.Seek guidance and support: Connect with experienced network marketers who can provide insights and mentorship. Engage with online communities, attend seminars, and participate in events related to network marketing. While network marketing can offer potential opportunities, it's essential to approach it as a business venture and be aware of the challenges involved. It may take time and effort to build a successful network marketing business.

Swift writes “I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will not be liable to the least objection. “I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee, or a ragout.” The first sentence conveys an attitude and tone of hesitation and mildness. Since what is to come is blatantly absurd and, to any humane individual, a proposition that would elicit the strongest outrage, “not … liable to the least objection” is savagely ironic, and “humbly propose,” in its putative self-effacement, is obviously opposed to how the essay is going to proceed. The second sentence intensifies this irony. Normally, the purpose of “nursing” a year old child is to help him or her to live, to sustain life; in this case the aim is to prepare the babe for death. In a further ironic skewering, the death is seen not as an instance of cruelty but as an excuse for sensual delight, for gourmandising: such an infant will taste good to the person eating that baby, whether it be “stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled.” The murder might even be a matter of epicurean discrimination: the young child could be served up to the person about to devour it—in a fancy dish, such as a “fricassee” or a “ragout.” Those words are ironic because they are substitutes for “killing” or “committing infanticide.” They suggest the opposite of what they say, which is how irony works. Take any two or three sentences in this essay and you will find more examples."},{"instruction":"What’s your best advice for a 17yearold turning 18?","output":"For 17years old girl should protect himself against sexuality"},{"instruction":"Before legalization, what did people think zig zags were used for?","output":"I used them to roll tobacco when I was too poor to buy store bought cigarettes.

The place was so beautiful just like her and we checked the place and there was an amusement park also the time spend there was just amazing and that was my one of the best memories with my friends and we ate lunch, I was watching her playing in water. In the whole trip I was near her but we didn't got any chance to talk. This made me so sad and the time flew and we need to get back to bus so me and my friends thought to go back early and capture the best seats so we friends were sitting and talking to each other I was sitting on the window to enjoy the scene when we go back and other classmates also started to come, I was still watching out trying to find her then suddenly a voice came can I sit in this seat? I just turned and guess who's that there is she I was freezed for two seconds then I say of course,I was so efrom inside but can't show that out, then she asked can I seat on the window seat I said yes this is not the best part of the story the best part is coming. Then we started talking she asked where was you I was looking for you I said what happened she: nothing much just for the group selfie's then I said her I was at the other part of the park then after some time she started to look outside and started enjoying the nature. Then I was talking to my friends after some time we all were quite and tired so I started to listen music on my headphones my friends were busy on there on world. Then after a while I felt something on my left shoulder I just turned and there she is sleeping on my shoulder ,just like this Source: Google When I saw her hair were coming to her face and her Head was on my shoulder this was the best feeling. I watched her for sometime and that feeling can't be expressed on words that can only we feel. Then after sometime she woke up and she realized that she was sleeping on my shoulders she said sorry I said it's ok that five minutes was the best then she again slept I was also tired so I thought of taking a nap and I also felt sleep when I wake up it was six in the morning then I realized that it was a sweet dreams, then I get ready and went to school 😅😅.

A directory is a file system object. A folder is a GUI object. Strictly speaking, there is a difference between a directory which is a file system concept, and the graphical user interface metaphor that is used to represent it (a folder).

What would the justice department seek to do if the state went ahead with their plans anyways? Have many states pushed back against the federal government?","output":"Our government is a Federal system, that was designed with several strict limits on the Federal system leaving remaining issues to the states and individuals. There are two approaches that states take to blocking federal law, and the Missouri law contains both. Background Congress has used some of the clauses - like the interstate commerce clause to regulate things far beyond the strict original meaning. For example some of the environmental rules about water is based on the fact that the water may eventually flow into navigable waterways that are needed for interstate commerce. While the Federal government has the right to regulate a militia if it is called up, that doesn’t given them to right to regulate everything about able bodied males from 18–45. Further when called up they are considered part of the Military and using them to enforce Federal laws domestically could be seen as a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. The Federal government has used a variety of means to encourage things. For example when the Congress wanted the drinking age to be 21 nationwide, they tied funding for interstate highways to the states drinking age laws. In 1986 both Texas and North Carolina raised their drinking age to 21[LINKED_TEXT: AROUND THE NATION; Texas and North Carolina Raise Drinking Age to 21 (Published 1986)] [URL: https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/01/us/around-the-nation-texas-and-north-carolina-raise-drinking-age-to-21.html] Non Participation The federal governement can not order a state to assist with federal agents enforcing federal law without declaring martial law and federalizing those agencies. Likewise the Federal government does not need to provide funding to state programs. When several cities, counties and states refused to enforce Immigration laws, the government threatened to withhold funds for law enforcement. This refusal to cooperate is how immigration sanctuaries work, and how medical marijuana laws work. Declaring Federal Law Unconstitutional This is the other method. Precedent establishes that the Supreme Court gets the final decision on what is constitutional. This does not prevent lower courts, legislative and executive bodies from saying something is unconstitutional. Just like a state Attorney General may tell a city police department they should let somebody go because the arrest was unconstitutional, a state Attorney General can say federal laws violate the constitution setting up a show down in the courts. Note about Federal law being supreme over state law Yes, Federal laws do take precedence as long as the Federal law is constitutional. They key is whether or not the law is constitutional. A lot of Federal laws take their constitutional justification from the interstate commerce clause. States with recreational marijuana specify it must be grown, processed, packaged, shipped, etc all within the state and not leave the state.

While US rapidly industrialise itself aftermath of Independence, adopted constitution India was systematically destroyed and even british don't let us to industrialise ourself. 1947 India was huge, chaos everywhere, 90% population below poverty line, literacy less than 17%, negligible Industrialisation and destroyed Agriculture.

Even during 1920s Gangster were ruling cities when there was Abolitionist period, corruption and political violence, much what India is facing now.

Therefore there is a strong case for creation of an All-India Judicial Service, in line with the IAS and IPS. FDR/Lok Satta in 2010 urged three eminent jurists – Sri Justice MN Venkatachaliah, (late) Sri Justice JS Verma, and (late) Sri Justice VR Krishna Iyer – to examine the issue of creation of an Indian Judicial Service. They gave their joint view as follows: “We agree with the urgent need to constitute the All India Judicial Service envisaged by Article 312 of the Constitution of India, at par with the other All India services like the I.A.S. to attract the best available talent at the threshold for the subordinate judiciary, which is at the cutting edge of the justice delivery system to improve its quality. Moreover, the subordinate judiciary is important feeder-line for appointments to the High Court. The general reluctance of competent lawyers to join the Bench even at the higher levels adds an additional urgency to the problem. AIJS will, in due course of time, also help to improve the quality of the High Courts. The modalities for creating the AIJS to achieve its avowed purpose, and the necessary constitutional changes and the legal frame-work can be worked out after acceptance of the proposal in principle.” Article 312 of the Constitution provides for the creation of an All–India Judicial Service (AIJS) common to the Union and the States. Such a service can be created and regulated by the Parliament by law, provided that the Council of States has declared by resolution supported by not less than two-thirds of the members present and voting that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest to do so. Speedy implementation of The Gramnyayalayas Act, 2008 The Government through the President’s address to Parliament gave a commitment to make dispensation of justice simpler, quicker and more effective, and to double the number of courts and judges in the subordinate judiciary in a phased manner. The government also announced its commitment to a policy of zero tolerance for violence against women, and to strengthen the criminal justice system for its effective implementation. As a result of FDR/Lok Satta’s efforts towards speedy, accessible and affordable justice the Parliament has enacted the Gram Nyayalayas Act in 2008 (Act 4 of 2009), providing for rural local courts for speedy justice through summary procedure, as an integral part of independent justice system. Under this law local courts should be appointed at intermediate Panchayat level. One of the problems of our justice system is many simple cases – civil or criminal – do not even reach the courts because of inaccessibility, cost and delays. Often people suffer injustice silently, or resort to rough and ready justice through extra-legal, often violent means.

When you give too much power to government bureaucrats, politician to interfere in economy, business, entrepreneurship, it stop economic growth. This is why we have employment problem because we don't want to encourage business, people are poor and entrepreneurs run to foreign nations to start a business.

Quasi federalism and Municipality: India is a huge, diverse nation with bulk of population, we need more power to locals amd tight check and balances to govern country. In India, Urban body or Municipality, responsible for sanitation, roads, infrastructure, education and development at local levels lack not only resources but power. Some states in India who contest a direct election for Mayor still don't give any power to them other than a ceremonial purpose. Simply because we retain 1888 Bombay municipal act where government bureaucrats hold all executive power. Lack of development, infrastructure accountability leads to more corruption.

How do you think they got such money? Ofcourse corruption from highest to lowest level.But how? Weak transparency, weak regulations. It's duty of election commissions to check balances but transparency is still a dream. Where are these parties getting huge money? No one knows. Cash, liquor, drugs are om full swing during elections. Often to gain such large capital Political party give shelter to Goons, criminals who fetch money for them and continue their fear among society. MLAs and MPs in India poses so much power that they can influence economy, transfers, promotions of bureaucrats. Famous web series Mirzapur is perfect example. Goons fund parties in term for protection. Criminal Candidates. Have you ever wonder why criminals wins election in India? Is it because of ignorance? Actually not. Citizens often vote for powerful criminal candidates because of weak law and order. Many states in India lack support of police, judiciary, government and as Bollywood show us, these powerful criminals are famous among voters because they can get their work done. The muscles power will solve disputes since Rule of law is absent. Not just voters even political parties field candidates facing criminal charges who can use muscle power, money to get votes. In India MPs and MLAs become a more power lust occupation instead of governance. Party Appeasement.

Not due to any superior speed, but due to the STRIL (Combat control and air surveillance) system, originally built up with British help after the war, and gradually modernized, which made it possible to find the SR-71 over the Baltic. On one occation, an SR-71 got an engine problem, and then was escorted to safety by two Viggen pilots, who recently were awarded by the USAF for this. Otherwise, it would likely would have been forcefully intercepted by Soviet pilots and supposedly brought down in Soviet Russia. The Soviet suirveillance system wasn’t nearly as efficient as the STRIL system. The Russians kept a whole fleet of “fishing vessels” with suspiciously many antennae on board outside Swedish territorial waters to keep track of Swedish air movements. The Swedes countered this by giving operational orders in secrecy to fighter pilots to start silently at low altitude from northern Sweden towards the gap between Gotland and the Baltic coast just to see how fast the Soviet Air Force would react without the help from the “fishing trawlers”. They didn’t have a chance (let alone that this was around 1960 - 1970 with JA 32 Lansens doing the trick). However, the Swedish air force also routinely exercised over the Baltic by flying just 10 - 20 m above sea level which not many other air forces did, the exceptions obiously being the Israelis, and I believe the Buccaneers of the RAF / RN. Some commentators seem to have complained about me not answering the question. What I tried to do was to show that speed in itself is not everything in the calculus. The fact is that the SR-71 was intercepted at numerous occations. And that was not due to an aeroplae with superior speed or ability to gain altitude (the Russians presumably hadcomtenet aircraft too), but due to the Command and Control System of the Swedish Air Defence, which made it possible to vector the Viggens - and the Drakens - onto an interception point. The largest difference to the Soviets was that their Command and Control system was more rudimentary. So with all respect to the USAF (and the Soviet Air Force, for that matter). It was possible to intercept the SR-71. Regarding the Soviet Air Force at the time: The lifted off for intercepting the troubled SR-71, but stayed off when realizing the Swedes beat them to it. In those days the Russians actually played by the rules, and rarely tried anything stupid. They were predictable, earning much greater respect than today’s Russian Air Force, now even flying with their transponders off just outside Kastrup international airport in Copenhagen, forcing the Swedish Air Defence system to warn the civilian traffic."},{"instruction":"What does an IITian's resume look like?","output":"I would not say it is best IITian, But worth seeing: Bear with me, Please read this full.

The organ is a sustaining instrument while the piano is rhythmic or percussive. The piano has one sound while the organ can have hundreds and the organ requires knowledge and taste to pull the most desirable stops. For some it also requires courage. Piano music is written differently than organ music especially since organs have pedals. An organist playing organ music on a piano will require a third hand, a pianist will have to change how their piece is arranged to make it sound well on an organ. The pipe organ is not touch sensitive, some stops have no volume deviation, there is no sustain pedal. Of course these things have been added to some electronic organs. Although the action is different for both piano and organ, the action on many organs can be different, also. The acoustic piano has a point of sound that the pianist should train to play to while the organ doesn’t. Both have static keybeds which neither should play to. Some organs have tracker actions which make the keys very stiff and requires the same technique that pianists employ such as arm weight, pronation, suppination, interdependence. Despite all the actions being different, the laws of physics and ergonomics remain the same and both they are played exactly the same. Those who disagree just don’t know. I would compare it to walking through snow, on ice, through water, through tall grass or on rocks. Each medium changes how you walk but the general concept remains the same. Once a keyboard player finds their arm weight and key resistance, they adjust how much weight to let down. The same can be said for a pianist who plays five different pianos. Each one will make the player alter how they depress the keys and how they use gravity. The bottom line is both will have to adapt their music if they switch instrument. You can’t just play the exact same arrangement and notes unless it is something like an invention. Otherwise one needs to get creative with arranging, leaving stuff out, sustaining notes, inversions, registering and even how to listen. With a piano the sound comes out the front, back, side, top and bottom. On the organ, the sound can be coming from somewhere far away and the organist must adapt their touch, phrasing and even speed to compensate for the distance between pipes (or speakers) and the console."},{"instruction":"T Madras mess has introduced separate entrance, utensils and basins for nonvegetarian students, some of whom are considering it as equivalent of 'untouchability'.

It uses scientific methods such as observation, experimentation, and data analysis to develop theories and test hypotheses. Social science is also interdisciplinary, which means it draws on knowledge and methods from multiple fields to better understand human behavior and social phenomena. For example, sociologists may use psychological theories to explain why people behave the way they do in groups.

There’s lots of conspiracy theories about explosives etc etc… but it’s not difficult to work out why. Construction - The WTC is… sorry, WAS… built out of concrete and steel. The steel I beams provide the strength to support the concrete. They have strength in compression and are flexible enough to allow the building to flex in high winds. Remember though they aren’t designed to take high level percussive impacts of aircraft weighing hundreds of tonnes travelling at a couple of hundred mph. They will lose some of their structural integrity upon receiving that sort of impact. Flammable building contents - Wood, paper, furnishings including carpets, upholstery etc etc… oh and not forgetting the large amount of kerosene from the aircraft.750 Metallurgy - As has been pointed out by many conspiracy theorist, jet fuel or wood/paper don’t burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel. This is a fact and is NOT in dispute. HOWEVER… YOU DO NOT NEED TO MELT STEEL TO MAKE IT MALLEABLE. Steel melts… i.e. becomes a liquid between 1425 – 1540°C or 2600 – 2800°F. To make steel MALLEABLE, i.e. easily deformable it only needs to be heated to 580°C or ~1000°F. Guess what temperature Jet Fuel burns at, or wood… or paper… Jet fuel… 650 - 680°C or ~1100 - 1200°FWood… 400 - 650°C or 750 - 1000°FPaper… ignition is about 450°F but a paper fire will reach 680 - 700°C or 1200 - 1500°F quite easily. Wood and paper were present in huge amounts in the buildings and burned for several hours between the plane impacts and the collapse. More than enough time for the steel cores and supports to reach malleability… at which point it loses approximately 50% of its strength. What does that mean for the buildings? If we say the I beams were designed to take a load of say 1000 tonnes under normal conditions, and have a weight of 800 tonnes on them; they are safe. Then we heat them to their malleability point, where they lose ~50% of their structural strength, now they can only support 500 tonnes, but they’ve till got 800 tonnes on them. Now they fail… and cause a collapse. No explosives required.

Meanwhile, there are many of us who believe that life begins at conception. Those of us who believe that abortion is the murder, by definition, of a living human being, might consider a compromise that allows abortion up until 15 weeks after conception because, even with the best efforts of a woman at preventing contraception, it does sometimes occur. At 15 weeks the fetus is, according to the best evidence available right now, not yet able to feel the pain of being aborted — although that is still questioned by some researchers. However, that compromise is not even under consideration from the hardline Leftists. There are hardliners on the Right, too, who won’t even consider an exception of a “no abortions” policy to exclude rape, but these are usually overridden by their more moderate colleagues. However, there doesn’t seem to be any effort from the Left to moderate their own hardliners, so the issue is extremely contentious."},{"instruction":"Which Bollywood movie has a very effective, well crafted, and brilliant climax scene?","output":"Sometimes the best climax is the one where there isn't one...in other words an ANTI CLIMAX.

That said, people I meet tend to love me or hate me. There’s not a lot of neutral reactions. I’m pretty old now (but still vain enough not to say how old—lol) and I’m O.K. with people who don’t like me. (Or mostly O.K. with it.) I’m “popular” in that I have a lot of friends from a lot of different worlds. I’m a degenerate horseplayer, so I have horseplayer friends. I’m a journalist, so I have journalist friends. I have a lot of hobbies and pursuits. I know a lot of people. I’ve written about a lot of people. I forget some of the people I’ve written about. ENFPs have a lot of interests and passions, so they meet a lot of people. But we are also said to be the most introverted of the extroverts. I really like and need my alone time. Personally, I’m not interested in meeting new people. I’m interested in being able to spend more time with my real “friends.” By that I mean people who I like & who like me and not because I can write stories about them or hit jobs on their enemies. I’ve always known these people are not my friends, but that’s something that’s been driven home for me on several occasions in the last 10 years. But….I do seem to keep meeting new people and can’t help becoming friends with some of them. Being old makes me aware time is short. More than anything, I want friends I can laugh with.

I don’t do that to make friends, but to spread info on NPD and awareness of Empaths. The NPD thing is more like a duty. Once you’ve been tricked by one and figured out the slick & sick gamers they are, you just have to tell other people about it. To warn them. Empaths are real, despite what the Empath-bashers say (I haven’t figured out the Empath-bashers). I wouldn’t mind having more Empath friends, but you have to let them come to you.

Noah disembarked from the Ark with his wife, his three sons and his three daughters-in-law. They came out of the East and settled in the land of Shinar, which is Mesopotamia, part of which is ancient Sumer. According to the Bible (Genesis 11:1), the entire world spoke a common language, Sumerian in my opinion. What do we know about the Sumerian language? We know that it is a language isolate, i.e., no known source. This has caused much confusion with secular scientists and the source of the Sumerian language is referred to as the “Sumerian problem.” Both the Bible and Sumerian history document Sumerian as the original language that was later confused. Both histories document this as the beginning of the various languages (Reference 1 and Genesis 11:9). Moreover, before the confusion of tongues, everyone on earth was a Sumerian. Then, after the confusion of tongues, the Babylonians separated from the others and spoke Akkadian, a language not related to Sumerian. Reference 1.

Also, these are just my opinions and it is okay if you found it unpopular or brutal. The movie was average. There, I said it. But, there are certain things that make the movie not easily forgettable. Since the movie was 0% nepotistic, we could see only talent in the movie. Whether it be lead characters or the supporting ones. Direction: It was not that good. The movie became a bit slow in the second half of the movie and all the emotional scenes would not have made me tear up if it wasn't for Sushant. Also, I think the movie was a bit rushed. I wanted to see slow romance but, here everything went too fast. If you consider it as a directorial debut, then it was good. The character development of everyone was on point especially, Kizie. Actors: Sanjana Sanghi is a promising debutant. To play such a complex character like a cancer patient and that too, in your debut movie, requires guts. I would like to see some acknowledgement given to her performance in this movie. (Filmfare, I am not talking to you.) Now, talking about Sushant, I think Manny was his best performance in his career. How Manny goes from being a goofy character who makes everyone happy around him to a helpless cancer patient who wants to live a bit longer was brilliantly portrayed. In the first few minutes of the movie I thought he was trying too hard but, by the end I really enjoyed his acting. All the other supporting characters did justice to their roles, especially Swastika Mukherjee who played Kizie's mother. Music: The music was good even though it did not exceed the 'Rahman Expectations'. The songs were average and the ones I liked were ‘Khulke Jeene Ka’ and ‘Maskhari'. Dialogues: The one thing about the movie that is truly good is its dialogues. They were very touching and meaningful. Overall Review: Dil Bechara is a remake but it did not seem like they copied off the whole movie with different actors. It added some elements of it's own and gave the movie a whole new meaning and life. Anyways, the movie was a fun ride. The movie gave us a fresh new talent and definitely, was a befitting goodbye to Sushant.❤"},{"instruction":"Why aren't Macs being built with touch screens?","output":"As originally pointed out by Steve Jobs with the release of the iPad a decade ago, reaching up at a screen to do gestures becomes tiring on arms, and its better to either just look down while touching a screen or use a standard keyboard with a great trackpad, as MacBooks have continued to dominate on for years.

I also read the authentic Bori & KMG edition of MB as well as some other versions. And in my opinion, There are three warriors who were just remarkable in the kurukshetra war. I'm not including Virata War or any other war because the virata parva creates a lot of confusion. The virata war states that arjuna overpowered all the kaurava warriors single handedly including warriors like Bhisma, Drona & Karna. That's something really idiotic as the same arjuna was unable to defeat & Kill the same warriors in kurukshetra. And the most interesting question, why karna didn't used his vasavi shakti in Virata. Now some may say, that Karna got the weapon after the battle and timeline is mixed up as it was post narration. So going through this statement, it indicates karna had Kawach and kundal with him, which even krishna said even my sudarshan can't able peirce it. So how arjuna? Anyways, it can't be ignored 1) Arjun was protected by Lord hanuman present at the flagstaff......2) It was Agnidev who supplied inexhaustible arrows to arjun....... Sacred-Text: (Virat Parv )Jishnu returned again to the cemetery and having approached the same Sami tree stood there with body mangled by the arrows of the enemy. Then that terrible monkey(Lord Hanuman) blazing like fire ascended into the sky with those other creatures in the flag-staff. Karna was using ordinary bow and he was indeed the first who hit the bow of opponent, but as arjuna bow was celestial, it didn't broke. While karna was using ordinary bow, and when arjuna aimed karna's bow, the rest is history. And when karna & bheesma recovered by Arjuna's blow and came back to fight, Arjuna used Sammohna Astra in order to escape. the wielder of the Gandiva who was capable of enduring all foes, evolved another irresistible weapon obtained from Indra, called Sanmohana. So anyways, Here are the list of top three most powerful warriors of Mahabharata. 1: Bheesma 2: Karna 3: Drona And if you talk about the 4th position, it's indeed the mighty *Dhananjaya*. Now some will say, Lord Shiva himself told that Arjuna was the most courageous warrior as well as equal to him as a warrior. Now that's something a god word, with no vanity. Even Parshuram or you can say lord vishnu told karna there's no khsatriya thy equal to you. Even lord Krishna told to arjuna that i consider karna superior to you. Now it points that karna is stronger than Lord Shiva who was equal to Arjuna. We all know Lord Shiva is the supreme god and calling arjuna equal to him was just a blessing. If you really think Arjuna was equal to Lord Shiva (The supreme god) in terms of power then there's nothing to say about it. 1: Bheeema: Now if we talk about bheesma, the man who was capable to give a tight fight to Lord Parshuram, the disciple of lord Shiva & the avtaar of Vishnu. That's an amazing feat! Though we all know if Lord Parshuram wants, he had destroyed Bheesma within a few second. He was himself the Vishnu, the Krishna, the Rama, the supreme being. But he was just testing the skills of his disciple and even blessed him when the fight ends. Infact, in kurukshetra war, Lord Krishna was ready to broke his wow in order to kill bheesma. “Fulfilling my vow and sacrificing His own promise, He got down from the chariot, took up its wheel, and ran towards me hurriedly, just as a lion goes to kill an elephant. He even dropped His outer garment on the way” 2: Karna: Son of Radha, one of the most powerful character in MB. I have read more than 15 versions of MB and found that most of them include Drona rejecting Karna from teaching archery. However Bori & KMG both clarifies that Karna was indeed a student of drona. Now these seems really illogical, as karna was a suta putra and drona got the contract for teaching kuru princes only, then why only karna got that opportunity and not other learners of suta caste. In Draupad war, it was Khsatriya Karna, the son of Gandhari, who was defeated by Dhrupad. While the Suyaputra Karna single-handedly defeated Draupad during his Digvijay ( Dig - World, Vijay - to Conquer): Sacred-Text : \\"Then, O bull among the Bharatas, that mighty bowman, Karna, surrounded by a large army, besieged the beautiful city of Drupada. And he, after a hard conflict, brought the hero under subjection, and, O best of monarchs, made Drupada contribute silver and gold and gems, and also pay tribute. And, O foremost of kings, having subdued him, (Karna) brought under subjection those princes that were under him (Drupada) and made them pay tribute. I'm clarifying every doubt in this post and so i had to mention some misconceptions. Karna overpowering Arjuna in Kurukshetra war \\"Then Karna, with a number of whetted shafts endued with great energy, cut off the string of Arjuna's bow. Similarly he cut off the second string, and then the third, and then the fourth, and then the fifth. The sixth also was cut off by Vrisha, and then the seventh, then the eighth, then the ninth, then the tenth, and then at last the eleventh.\\" KARNA CUTTING OFF ARJUNA'S GANDIVA STRINGS 11 TIMES CONSECUTIVELY. This was a feat which none had achieved. Neither Bhishma nor Drona. Karna possessed the vasada dart, which could kill Arjuna in plenty of seconds. Section 146 of Drona Parva, Krishna says \\"For the present, O Partha, it is not proper for thee to fight with Karna.The latter hath with him the blazing dart, like a fierce meteor, that Vasava gave him. O slayer of hostile heroes,he hath kept it for thy sake, worshipping it with reverence.\\" (Fine, that was a normal situation, Krishna stopped Arjuna to fight, that's fine) But again, in Section 173 of Drona Parva, Krishna says \\"I do not, however, O sinless one,regard the time to have come, O mighty-armed one,for thee to encounter the Suta's son in battle. The blazing dart, resembling a mighty meteor, given himby Vasava, is still with him, O thou of mighty arms, kept for thee with care,by the Suta's son. He keepeth that dart by him, and hath now assumed a terribleform.\\" (This was unacceptable since Karna was smashing away everyone and Yudhishthira was panicking) Lord Krishna was creating illusions so that karna would not use his vasava dart. Same happend in virata war. “'Karna having assented to this, saying 'So be it' (the desire of) slaughtering the wielder of Gandiva, O bull amongst the Sinis, was ever present in Karna's heart. I, however, O foremost of warriors, always used to stupefy the son of Radha. It was for this that he did not hurl the dart at Pandu's son, owning white steeds.” Parashuram told Karna in a gentle way that his Brahmastra alone would be forgotten when he faced a \\"warrior equal to his prowess\\" and also said \\"On earth,no Kshatriya will be thy equal in battle\\". But Karna used Brahmastra despite forgetting. Becauseof Parashuram’s counter praising that no Kshatriya would be Karna’s equal. He used it thrice against Arjuna (Section 89, Section 90 after forgetting for a moment, and again in Section 91) Thus, Karna made the praise of his Guru truthful by invoking Brahmastra 3 times and proved his Guru’s fact that that Karna was a better warrior than Arjuna, if they were by any means equal, Karna could have never used Brahmastra even once! Even Lord Krishna offered Sudarshana to Arjuna for killing karna. Now those who think that Arjuna had pashupatastra but he didn't used it. So for your kind information, Lord Parshuram also had pashupatastra and it has been well mentioned in Brahmand Puran. And karna got all the astras of Lord Parshuram. Even Lord Krishna said Yonder Karna urges forward the mighty car-warriors of the Dhartarashtras towards the son of Pritha with the weaponscalled Sthunakarna, Indrasjaha and *Pasupata*, and with clubs and other weapons. *Now some arjuna fans will say, that pashupatastra which karna possessed was different and one that arjuna had was different. Please stop this! Arjuna may have used it way before to kill karna as per his vow, but he knew karna would counter it with his own PPA and hence he didn't used it. Arjuna himself accepted that he didn't have any weapon capable to counter bhargavastra thus bhargavastra was equally powerful, if not, Superior to pashupatastra!* It has been written by vyass that pashupatastra can damage world only if mahadeva shot it thus Arjuna shooting pashupatastra will cause no effect as Arjuna himself was weak. He couldn't do anything even after firing brahmastra many times so after release by partha, all weapons lost its power. Despite being Superior to Arjuna, Karna never used his vasavi Shakti against Arjuna (though he got many chance). He also not used bhargavastra second time once Arjuna fled the battlefield so was nagastra. It's Karna who avoided to use nuclear weapons most of the times. Even when Karna’s wheel sunk badly and his car tilted badly, Karna had a real shot at killing Arjuna when he made Arjuna lose his Gandiva from his hand’s grasp for the first time ever (An unimaginable feat). Arjuna trembled like a mountain in an earthquake, Gandiva fell down but Karna did not kill Arjuna. He took the time gap to retrieve the sunken wheel. 3: Drona: Drona overpowering Arjuna And then the preceptor struck Dhananjaya at the breast with a long shaft shot with great force and capable of drinking the life-blood of every foe. Then Arjuna, deprived of strength, shook in all his limbs, like a hill during an earthquake. Soon, however, regaining for fortitude, Vibhatsu pierced Drona with many winged arrows. Then Drona struck Vasudeva with five arrows. And he struck Arjuna with three and seventy arrows, and his standard with three. Then, O king, the valorous Drona getting the better of his disciple, within the twinkling of an eye made Arjuna invisible by means of his arrowy showers. Arjuna accepted his inability to defeat Drona in the first encounter. Arjuna answered, 'Thou art my preceptor and not my foe. I am thy disciple and, therefore, like to thy son. Nor is there the man in the whole world who can vanquish thee in battle. “Believe it or not, But Arjuna was incapable to defeat these three with the help of Lord Krishna. Though Arjuna was a Maha Nayak, The Hero of Mahabharata, and i'm a big fan of him. And if arjuna not, there was no one who can able to kill these three even with the help of lord krishna.* Sorry for grammatical mistakes!

The term “illegal alien,” which describes an individual person, means someone who committed an unlawful act (illegal) was not a citizen of where the illegal act was performed (alien). An “immigrant” by English definition is someone who is lawfully traveling from their home country into another country. So, there is no such thing as an illegal legal. That’s like saying an illegal pilot flew the plane when being a pilot is an acquired legally licensed act.

Yes, we can self-edit, but trying to edit while you’re writing usually leads to bad writing. Or the process takes way longer than it should.

They get so bogged down on the words that they forget about the idea. Don’t do this. Get your thoughts down first. Get the main idea down on paper, then go back and edit. It can help to step away from it completely. Put it down for an hour, or a day even. Then come back and edit as if somebody else wrote it. At that point it isn’t your baby anymore, and it’s a lot easier to call somebody else’s baby ugly. Fill in the missing words. Move this sentence there, that sentence there. Make it yours again.

They always engage China in skirmishes and fights with their neighbor countries and smaller countries to “show” their supremacy in possessing military equipment.

They invaded and killed citizens of Iraq and the reason to do so was that they possessed Weapons Of Mass Destruction.Which every country is entitled to have, the US has it and even India has it.

R is more of programming tool rather than database tool like SAS. If we take an example of running a logistic regression, both tools are able to do it but SAS takes less coding and less steps to do so. That's why SAS is preferred more in analytics industry. 2. SAS has good support services because it is paid software and R is freeware. So big companies prefer SAS over R. 3. Under SAS umbrella there are all analytics tools that are used in industry from ETL extraction to Data visualisation. 4. SAS has ' SAS Intelligence Platform', it is a framework of comprehensive sets of business solutions, technologies, and services. All of the functionality is available from one vendor and through one framework. 5. Small and mid cap companies opt R for its cost effectiveness but R is not able to handle big volumes of data(there are techinque used to break the data and feed it into R). In SAS there is no such restrictions. 6. R is better for dotcom interactions and extensions, in SAS you need specialised product for the same. 7. SAS has its own database structure. 8. R does not have its own database format. In R, you can save your session. Data can be exported to flat files/SAS/Excel and many more file formats, but none inherent to R only. P. S. - It is not always about which product is better. It depends on the usability and requirement of company and its users.

I have tried a few option when I had transfer money to India. I must say that Indian population in Japan is very small, less than 1% of total foreign population. There are almost three times more Nepalese than Indian. So there is not much demand for transferring money to India. Hence, there are not many companies and banks that provides International Money transfer service. As my knowledge is concerned, there are only 6–7 options to transfer money to India. Lets discuss all these options - one by one 1 - Wise (Formerly Transferwise) I am currently using Wise to send money from Japan to India. Wise is not only the cheapest but also the best option I could find. Everything is in English, so no problem with the language. It is completely online, so no visit to the bank or any branch required. You can fix the conversion rate, so even if the exchange rate changes, you are safe. Especially since the massive volatility of JPY to INR, I feel its important to fix your exchange rate, so not to loose your money if JPY rate declines. You can find a comparison chart here I must mention here that although Transferwise completes their transaction withing few hours. The first transfer needs you to verify your identity, and if you do not have proper documentation, the process can delay a bit. If you have your my number card, or at least the receipt of your my number, you are good to go. 2 - Revolut Revolut started their business in Japan recently. They provide excellent exchange rate. But I have heard from my other collogues, they had issues signing up to their app. I also tried signing up to Revolut many times, but I do not know what is the problem, the camera app in their app could never complete my verification. 3 - OFX OFX is an australian based company that provides a competitive exchange rate (JPY to INR). If you are trying to transfer small amount, you may need to pay additional fee. 4 - Western Union Western Union is one of the oldest and wide spread money remittance company with over 100,000 branches spread all across the globe. Although not very common, but you can find Western Union office in Japan, you can drop by to deposit your Yen and have them in India. 5 - World Remit I find the exchange rate of World Remit quiet bad when compared to Wise or Revolut. But if you are trying for a quick money transfer, you can use it. But again you need to sign up and verify for the first time, and it can have a waiting period. 6 - SBI The Indian Banking Giant has their office in Tokyo. If you live around Tokyo and have issues trusting, other remittance companies, SBI Tokyo can be a great option. But do note that their exchange rate is very bad, and it comes with additional fee. Overall, I would say, out of all these options, Wise seems to be best option. If you plan to stay longer in Japan, create a wise account, get it verified, and start using them. Once you have your account ready, sending money to India is only few clicks away. Reminder - Do not forget to use the [LINKED_TEXT: discounted link of wise,] [URL: https://rb.gy/qbpvex] using which you can get a free transfer, or at least reduce your fees. Win Win for both of us.

I’m sure by now, all the other respondents have warned you about how big and heavy such an asteroid would be, or that, generally speaking most asteroids are thought to be “flying gravel-piles”. They are bits of smaller, older material that have accumulated into a single mass through weak gravitational attraction, though likely not in a way that “cements” the thing together as a single rigid body. The second you introduce a spin sufficient to simulate a fraction of one Earth gravity, the individual particles of our flying mountain will be flung off into space by centrifugal effect. The best way to turn an asteroid into a space habitat is to skip the whole “Rama” scenario and just mine the metals you need to engineer a purpose-built structure. NOW… Having said that, let’s us take a little detour. Say you arrive at your asteroid in your handy-dandy Acme brand spaceship. Then you notice your target asteroid is spinning. Hint: Most (ok, all…) asteroids have a slow spin. You could lasso the asteroid along a circumference which is perpendicular to the major axis of spin, then attach the other end of the tether to your shiny spaceship… and push off. As you reel out the tether, your spaceship will increase separation. At some point, I would imagine you might need to expend rocket fuel to stabilize your ship at the end of this tether where it would act like a pendulum, or more accurately, like a bucket of water held at arms length while spinning around and around. No expensive or self-destructive spin-rate change, no risk of disintegration, no mining. Just pull up, rope the rock, spool out, and… Viola! Artificial gravity in a cool, comfy spaceship!!! There are no new ideas under the sun as the saying goes, but I cannot recall ever seeing this one being expressed anywhere, either in sci-fi material or in scholarly articles on innovative space flight technique. Still, I am reluctant to claim the idea as my own wholly original conception. Let me give at least partial credit to U.S. physicist, Robert L. Forward whose Saturn-bound crew (from his 1997 Sci-Fi novel, “Saturn Rukh”) navigated by harpooning small icy bodies, whipping around, then cutting loose, travelling in a new direction without expending rocket fuel.

For example, a gang leader may be able to amas followers, but being in that gang is not generally in the best interest of the gang members or society. Hitler is another example.

East of Java and west of Lombok , the province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller offshore islands, notably Nusa Penida , Nusa Lembongan , and Nusa Ceningan to the southeast. The provincial capital, Denpasar , [7] is the most populous city in the Lesser Sunda Islands and the second-largest, after Makassar , in Eastern Indonesia . The upland town of Ubud in Greater Denpasar is considered Bali's cultural centre. The province is Indonesia's main tourist destination, with a significant rise in tourism since the 1980s. [8] Tourism-related business makes up 80% of its economy. [9] Bali is the only Hindu-majority province in Indonesia, with 86.9% of the population adhering to Balinese Hinduism . [3] It is renowned for its highly developed arts, including traditional and modern dance, sculpture, painting, leather, metalworking, and music. The Indonesian International Film Festival is held every year in Bali. Other international events that have been held in Bali include Miss World 2013 , the 2018 Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group and the 2022 G20 summit . In March 2017, TripAdvisor named Bali as the world's top destination in its Traveller's Choice award, which it also earned in January 2021. [10] [11] Bali is part of the Coral Triangle , the area with the highest biodiversity of marine species, especially fish and turtles. [12] In this area alone, over 500 reef-building coral species can be found. For comparison, this is about seven times as many as in the entire Caribbean . [13] Bali is the home of the Subak irrigation system , a UNESCO World Heritage Site . [14] It is also home to a unified confederation of kingdoms composed of 10 traditional royal Balinese houses, each house ruling a specific geographic area. The confederation is the successor of the Bali Kingdom . The royal houses are not recognised by the government of Indonesia; however, they originated before Dutch colonisation . [15] History [ edit ] Ancient [ edit ] Subak irrigation system Bali was inhabited around 2000 BC by Austronesian people who migrated originally from the island of Taiwan to Southeast Asia and Oceania through Maritime Southeast Asia . [16] [17] Culturally and linguistically, the Balinese are closely related to the people of the Indonesian archipelago, Malaysia , Brunei , the Philippines , and Oceania . [17] Stone tools dating from this time have been found near the village of Cekik in the island's west. [18] [19] In ancient Bali, nine Hindu sects existed, the Pasupata , Bhairawa , Siwa Shidanta, Vaishnava , Bodha , Brahma , Resi, Sora and Ganapatya . Each sect revered a specific deity as its personal Godhead. [20] Inscriptions from 896 and 911 do not mention a king, until 914, when Sri Kesarivarma is mentioned.

Historically, mining booms have also encouraged population growth via immigration to Australia , particularly the gold rushes of the 1850s. Many different ores, gems and minerals have been mined in the past and a wide variety are still mined throughout the country. Production overview [ edit ] In 2019, Australia was the world's largest producer of iron ore [1] and bauxite ; [2] the second largest of gold , [3] manganese , [4] and lead ; [5] the third largest of zinc , [6] cobalt , [7] and uranium ; [8] the fifth largest of salt ; [9] the sixth largest of copper [10] and nickel ; [11] the eighth largest producer of silver [12] and tin ; [13] the fourteenth largest of phosphate ; [14] and the fifteenth largest of sulfur . [15] The country is also a major producer of precious stones. Australia is the world's largest producer of opal and is one of the largest producers of diamond , ruby , sapphire and jade . In non-renewable energies, in 2020, the country was the 30th largest producer of oil in the world, extracting 351.1 thousand barrels/day. [16] In 2019, the country consumed 1 million barrels/day (the 20th largest consumer in the world). [17] [18] The country was the 20th largest oil importer in the world in 2018 (461.9 thousand barrels/day). [16] In 2015, Australia was the 12th largest world producer of natural gas , 67.2 billion m3 per year. In 2019, the country was the 22nd largest gas consumer (41.9 billion m3 per year) and was the 10th largest gas exporter in the world in 2015: 34.0 billion m3 per year. [19] In the production of coal , the country was the 4th largest in the world in 2018: 481.3 million tons. Australia is the 2nd largest coal exporter in the world (387 million tons in 2018) [20] History [ edit ] Mining was an important early source of export income in Australian colonies and helped to pay for the imports needed for the growing colonial economies. Silver and later copper were discovered in South Australia in the 1840s, leading to the export of ore and the immigration of skilled miners and smelters. The first economic minerals in Australia were silver and lead in February 1841 at Glen Osmond , now a suburb of Adelaide in South Australia. Mines including Wheal Gawler and Wheal Watkins opened soon after. [21] The value of these mines was soon overshadowed by the discovery of copper at Kapunda (1842), [22] Burra (1845) [23] and in the Copper Triangle ( Moonta , Kadina and Wallaroo ) area at the top of Yorke Peninsula (1861).

Singapore [LINKED_TEXT: Merlion - WikipediaOfficial mascot of Singapore \\"Singa laut\\" redirects here. For the Indonesian film, see Singa Laoet . Merlion The Merlion Park viewed with the Singapore skyline in the background Country Singapore Region Singapore The Merlion ( / ˈ m ɜːr ˌ l aɪ ə n / ) is the official mascot of Singapore . It is depicted as a mythical creature with the head of a lion and the body of a fish . Being of prominent symbolic nature to Singapore and Singaporeans in general, it is widely used to represent both the city state and its people in sports teams, advertising, branding, tourism and as a national personification . [1] The Merlion was first used in Singapore as the logo for the tourism board. Its name combines \\" mer \\", meaning the sea , and \\" lion \\". The fish body represents Singapore's origin as a fishing village when it was called Temasek , which means \\"sea town\\" in Javanese . The lion head represents Singapore's original name— Singapura —meaning \\"lion city\\" or \\"kota singa\\". The symbol was designed by Alec Fraser-Brunner , a member of the Souvenir Committee and curator of the Van Kleef Aquarium , for the logo of the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in use from 26 March 1964 to 1997 and has been its trademarked symbol since 20 July 1966. Although the STB changed their logo in 1997, the STB Act continues to protect the Merlion symbol. [2] Approval must be received from STB before it can be used. The Merlion frequently appears on STB-approved souvenirs . Original location [ edit ] Merlion at its original location on the mouth of the Singapore River in 1994 On 15 September 1972, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew officiated the installation ceremony of the Merlion statue. [3] The original statue stood at the mouth of the Singapore River in Merlion Park . It was conceptualised by the vice-chancellor Kwan Sai Kheong of the University of Singapore and constructed from November 1971 to August 1972 by Singapore sculptor Lim Nang Seng ( Chinese : 林浪新 ; pinyin : Lín Làngxīn ). [4] It measures 8.6 metres high and weighs 70 tons. [3] [5] The project cost about S 165,000. [3] Relocation of original statue [ edit ] View of Marina Bay Sands hotel from the Merlion The completion of the Esplanade Bridge in 1997 blocked the views of the Merlion from the Marina Bay waterfront. [3] By then, the original Merlion location was also no longer the entrance of Singapore River due to land reclamation works. [3] In response, the statue and its cub were relocated 120 metres to the current Merlion Park that fronts Marina Bay in 2002, where it stands on a newly reclaimed promontory in front of the Fullerton Hotel . Another solution considered — to raise the Merlion on a pedestal at its original location — was deemed unsuitable, as the view would still be blocked by the bridge.

If you want to make sure the feature is not enabled, you can also go to Settings > Privacy > Photos and make sure that Messenger is not in the list of apps that are allowed to access the photos on the phone. Once these steps are completed, Messenger will no longer save photos that are sent and received in conversations. If you want to further optimize the performance of your AI applications, you should consider disabling the Messenger saving feature as it can impact the performance of any AI process on the device, due to the increased levels of data it stores.

The more we trust in Christ the less we’ll depend on self and our faith will grow. The two (merit and grace) are mutually exclusive and cannot co-exist in our salvation—they’re antithetical We must not confuse nor mix them: the dichotomy is clear in that we are either saved by our own efforts and works or by grace and Christ alone.

So there is no way Modi can celebrated Ramadan. The P.M. is busy and can not celebrate every festival with the Army, it would also distract the Army. However he realizes that army men live away from family and need at least one occasion which they can celebrate in style. He picked Diwali as it is a Hindu festival and he is a Hindu himself and Diwali is also the biggest festival of India and appeals to the most number of people. It is not just celebrated by Hindus but by all sections of the society, in a way it is a secular festival in today’s India even as it has Hindu roots. Diwali is also an Indian festival unlike Eid which originated from Arabia and is only connected to India because a section of the Indians follow the same religion. Diwali on the other hand is celebrated by different sections of Indians for different reasons. For my family Diwali is not Lakshmi Puja, it is Kali Puja for us, for some it is the homecoming of Ramachandra after his victory in Lanka, for many it is Lakshmi Puja.

What do I do?","output":"In addition to the answers that are already given, I want to add a very important concept: Progressive overload. If you keep doing the same exercises, with the same weight and the same number of reps every time your progress will stagnate. I see a lot of people performing the same workout routine week after week. Not performing progressive overload is why so many people see their results stagnate. Continue to make great demands on your body. Don´t accept a status quo, if you want to see results you have to keep pushing. Progressive overload is the continuing increase of stress placed upon the body during your workouts[math][1][/math]. You have to keep forcing your body into situations to which it has to adapt to more and more stress. Let it experience an overload in weight, endurance, volume, intensity, frequency and time. Here are some examples of how you apply progressive overload in your workout routine. Increase number of reps Example: you are currently making 10 reps per set. Progressive overload is increasing that number to 11 or 12 reps per set without reducing the weight. Increase number of sets Example: you are currently performing pull ups for 3 sets, 10 reps per set. Progressive overload is increasing the number of sets to 4 without reducing the number of reps per set. Increase weight Example: you are currently bench pressing 200 lbs, 8 reps per set. Progressive overload is increasing the weight to 210 lbs without reducing the number of reps per set. Increase performing time Example: you are currently performing squats with your own bodyweight for 45 seconds per set. Progressive overload is increasing the performance time to 60 seconds per set. Increase number of exercises Example: on Monday you train your chest. You perform 4 different chest exercises. Progressive overload is increasing the number of exercises to 5 without reducing any other components of your workout (number of sets, reps etc.).

However, there is a caveat. As a beginner, much of the learner’s capability to grasp the technicalities of the subject lies in the hands of the tutor and the manner in which the course is delivered. Inefficient coaching can pretty quickly cause the learner to lose interest in the subject. In worst cases, this can significantly alter the direction of one’s career. Frankly, I too learned these lessons the hard way. Well, to master PHP, I had left no stone unturned. I had learnt from plethora of courses, books, PDF material, etc., but I always used to hit a wall a few days into the learning. In most cases, I felt that the author/tutor was in a hurry to get to the end of the course and was not educating the rationale behind writing those pieces of code and assuming that one is well versed with programming in PHP. But, that is not the case with someone who is a beginner. Here, I am sharing the link to the course that helped me master PHP programming, you would find it useful - [LINKED_TEXT: My Preferred PHP Learning Resource] [URL: https://allaboutphp.quora.com/My-Preferred-PHP-Learning-Resource-1] See, when it comes to gaining skills in PHP, it is imperative to decide on an effective resource - the one that makes the learning curve linear and progresses on difficult topics only after providing enough insights and examples on the concepts the one that explains why the program is executing the way it is, the one that discusses the questions asked by recruiters in interviews of top organizations, the one that considers that students are new to the domain and are not well adept with PHP programming environment, the one that provides in-course support in the form of solving the doubts the students might have in a concept or while solving practice problems. I wish to bring to light that in my initial days of learning, I resorted to free video tutorials available online. But, over the time I realized that a major issue with learning from them is that they being ‘free and open for all’ community, attract lots of creators who are considering to make a quick buck. Content quality of such tutorials is questionable. Also, one cannot prove one’s grasp on the subject to potential employers, due to no provision of obtaining certificate for the courses completed on those platforms. This may hinder one’s career, especially in cases where employer has set a criteria of choosing candidates with relevant degree/certificate. Moreover, in several resources, I found that while solving programming questions/explaining a concept, the author applies a logic that has not been taught yet. This leads the learner to skip to those sections of the tutorial where that particular topic is discussed. The concepts taught in those sections in turn apply logic that belongs to another concept, discussed in another part of the resource. Often, this is a repetitive cycle. Those who wish to read more about my journey of how I, a complete amateur in several aspects of web development including PHP, mastered the subject, and eventually bagged a high-paying job in one of the leading Telecom companies, here I am sharing it in detail - [LINKED_TEXT: My PHP Learning Journey] [URL: https://allaboutphp.quora.com/My-Detailed-PHP-Learning-Journey-1]"},{"instruction":"What do you think about the new Marvel comics characters Safespace, Snowflake, Trailblazer, B Negative and Screentime from “The New Warriors?”","output":"It’s what they think"},{"instruction":"Where can I invest?","output":"Hmm crypto.

My son had been bullied verbally by this kid for at least a year and a half ( since the kid enters middle school ). This kid found him on Facebook and messaged him there. Since I was monitoring his Facebook at that time I read the messages and replied back warning him that I was not my son (he didn’t believe me) and if he continued I would file charges for not only harassment but cyber bullying. He deactivated his account after that. My son was really good at ignoring him. What happens when a bully gets ignored? He ups his ante. It came to a head one day when my son came home with scratches on his arm, a fist sized bruise on his back and a knot on the front side of his head near his temple. I of course asked what happened. Kid didn’t like being ignored anymore so as my son was preparing standing up to get ready to get off the bus, kid grabbed his arm. My son jerked his arm out of kid’s hand and said don’t touch me again. Kid punched my son in the back which in turned pushed him causing his head to his the section of bus in between the windows. I was done. Called the school. They can’t do anything because it didn’t happen on campus (never mind the fact that the bus is school property as well as the bus stop where fighting is a suspendible offense.) so they suggested I call the police. I did. A very nice officer came out and took his statement as well as photos and we showed her the messages. Didn’t need a visit to the ER cause the number on his head wasn’t as bad as it looked but was cautioned anyway about looking for signs of concussion. She asked if I wanted to press charges. I told her honestly all he and I wanted was for kid to stop and to leave my son alone. She said that she would leave the case open for one year and we could file at anytime if he continued. She came back a couple of hours later to tell us she had visited the kid and his mom. Mom was not surprised about kids action but panicked when told that I was well within my rights to press charges but I chose not to at this time provided kid leaves my son alone. Ultimately kid was suspended from the bus for 10 days then he disappeared from the school for the rest of the year. My son found out later that he was pulled out of that school and was put into an alternative school. So to answer your question yes you can file a police report."},{"instruction":"Does 'nick' mean 'idiot' in British English?","output":"No. Perhaps you misheard someone call you a “dick”, which could mean idiot, as you assumed."},{"instruction":"What happens when you get pulled over doing 100 mph?","output":"A friend of mine back in the early 80s managed to get off with a warning for 161mph.

One not getting a ticket and secondly he built the engine in the car with money he saved while working while in high school. He was out seeing how fast it would actually go. The office that stopped him was more interested in what was under the hood that giving out a ticket. I don’t think this would normally happen, especially now days.

There was no money. So my mother controlled the family finances with an iron fist. Scarcely a penny could be spent by anyone except her. So we never had our own music, we never bought our own clothes, going to a rock concert was unthinkable. I did go to a nightclub maybe twice in my whole childhood (most people at school went every week), computers were just coming in but there was no games console, no videos, no money for drink, cigarettes or drugs, no car or driving lessons, very few trips to the cinema though I was allowed to go occasionally, no takeaways or restaurant meals. Some of these things my parents wouldn’t have allowed anyway, some of them were forced, but they tended to put a “but it’s not a good thing” gloss on it rather than “we can’t afford it” so it’s hard to know what the truth was. I got to Oxford, partly because I coped with this by losing myself in academic work. And of course that has opened up my adult life. I’m probably more moralistic than my parents. I’m more articulate and more confident than them, because I have had a far better education. I also don’t need much money. Having been brought up with it so tight, just anormal salary seems like riches. Unlike most Oxford graduates, I don’t have the pressure to be as successful as my parents.

If you can use a program editor or IDE well, then that’s great. Use it! I grew up using Emacs, so it I mostly don’t have to think about the editor when using it. Works for me. VS Code is modern and has lots of good integrations that are probably much easier to learn for a new programmer. So, it’s a good choice. I have only used it a little, because, as I said, I’m at home in Emacs. But I get it. There is a great collection of plug-ins, and it works well. I understand it also supports shared editing, which can be super helpful some times. VS Code does assume you have a working window system, though, which brings us to the next point.

It aims to capture short- to medium-term price movements within an established trend. In swing trading, traders take advantage of price swings or fluctuations that occur within a larger price trend. Instead of focusing on long-term trends, swing traders seek to identify shorter-term price reversals or bounces, typically lasting from a few days to a few weeks. Here are some key characteristics and techniques associated with swing trading: Timeframe: Swing trading operates in a timeframe between day trading (short-term) and trend trading (long-term). It usually involves holding positions for a few days up to several weeks.Trend identification: Swing traders attempt to identify and follow the overall trend in a particular security or market. They analyze charts, technical indicators, and price patterns to determine the direction of the trend.Entry and exit points: Swing traders aim to enter a trade during a price correction or retracement within the ongoing trend. They look for areas of support (price levels where buying interest is strong) or resistance (price levels where selling pressure is high). This is often done using technical analysis tools and indicators.Risk management: Proper risk management is crucial in swing trading. Traders typically set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses if the trade moves against them. They also define profit targets to secure gains when the price reaches a certain level.Technical analysis: Swing traders heavily rely on technical analysis techniques to make trading decisions. They use chart patterns, trendlines, moving averages, and oscillators to identify potential entry and exit points.Volatility considerations: Swing traders often seek securities or markets with sufficient volatility to generate profitable price swings. Higher volatility can provide more trading opportunities but also carries increased risk.Fundamental analysis: Although swing trading primarily relies on technical analysis, some swing traders may also consider fundamental factors such as company news, earnings reports, and economic data that could impact the price of the traded instrument. It's important to note that swing trading requires discipline, risk management, and continuous monitoring of the markets. Traders should develop a well-defined trading plan and stick to it to increase their chances of success.

Insulin is produced and released by the pancreas, specifically by specialized cells called beta cells in the islets of Langerhans. When you consume food, especially carbohydrates, the body breaks down these carbohydrates into glucose, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream. In response to rising blood glucose levels, the pancreas releases insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin acts on various tissues, such as muscle, fat, and liver cells, by facilitating the uptake of glucose from the blood and promoting its storage as glycogen or fat. This process helps lower blood sugar levels and maintain them within a healthy range. Insulin also plays a role in suppressing the production of glucose by the liver. In individuals with diabetes, either the body does not produce enough insulin (Type 1 diabetes) or the body's cells become resistant to the effects of insulin (Type 2 diabetes). In such cases, blood sugar levels can remain elevated, leading to various complications. Managing blood sugar levels through medication, diet, and lifestyle modifications is essential for individuals with diabetes.

There were a couple of reasons I favored node for this. I should also add that I made that choice 5 years and I am not sure I would make the same decision today. We were planning to use JavaScript in several other places throughout our product including to craft skills on our robot. Skills are to the Jibo robot what apps are to a smart phone. There was certainly some potential benefit of utilizing shared resources across different stacks. Another reason I chose node.js is because of the performance benefits of its asynchronous programming model. For some use cases, the async and event model in node.js can generate great scale when paired with stateless services. Over time the team transitioned to typescript over raw JavaScript. There were some challenges dealing with node.js in production systems and as the system got more complex. But I don’t necessarily feel those were all that much more difficult than the platform specific problems you have with any technology stack. For what its worth the current project I am working on has a little node.js as part of the Angular front end and uses Python-based systems for some services. I inherited these choices and am currently evaluating if I think they will meet our needs. I’ve coded, designed, or directed groups using C++, PHP, Java, Grails/Groovy/Java, Python, NodeJS/CoffeeScript/TypeScript/. Each system has their own pros and cons. I try not to get religious and stay pragmatic. Back to your question “Why are some companies transitioning to Node.js?” If they are porting PHP code that might be that they are search of a JavaScript-oriented stack so they can potentially utilize full stack developers. Or they may believe node.js is a better match given the runtime needs of their use case. When you fully grok async programming you understand how node.js can build highly performant and vertically/horizontally scalable systems. Another reason some may be transition to node.js is that they are buying into hype though I would have assumed the hype has ebbed by now. Some probably thing it’s money for nothing and will yield some magical performance gain. But I think experienced developers realize that performance and scalability come from a solid architecture at the systems and code layers. You can achieve decent performance/scalability with nearly any backend technology if system is well designed and built. I’d be skeptical if someone wants to change programming language solely on a vague promise of higher performance. I’d tend to take the switch more seriously if they can demonstrate an understanding of the different tradeoffs that the programming platforms make and how to best build a system that exploits the attributes that attract you to the language. I’ll give you an example related to node.js. Imagine someone pitching to you they want to use node.js because of it’s alleged high performance. The high performance is related to the match between the asynchronous event loop and the way that maps well to what a lot of web servers do. If the person then goes and uses the synchronous versions of file or network I/O and there is basically no requirement to handle a large number of simultaneous requests then you can bet that node.js will be slower than other choices. You don’t get “money for nothing” and as they say there’s no such thing as a free lunch. Great software is the result of understanding your use case/value proposition, balancing choices, making compromises, and grokking the development platform’s strengths, weaknesses and applicability to your use case. After about 6 years with my teams using node.js I think that there is some truth behind the performance claims. Equally there is truth to the concerns about its applicability to larger projects. Managing dependencies can be challenging in any platform. NodeJS has some clever techniques for managing dependencies that come with their own pros and cons. Don’t expect magic from it and you might like it. Try not to fall prey to hyped up claims or overzealous religious wars. Be skeptical of claims until you’ve researched them. I still like node. It isn’t on my shit list like some of the other languages I mentioned. The three programming languages I use most often today are: Python, JavaScript/NodeJS, C/C++."},{"instruction":"Jared Kushner said that he can’t commit to having the presidential election on 11/3.

Cutting those programs, especially SS which isn’t paid from the same account (it has it’s own fund supplied by the working class), while a large part of the annual budget, will do almost nothing about the deficit or debt. Cutting those programs would simply shift the cost because support for the elderly and sick is a permanent thing. If you don’t use programs, you end up paying even more in ER and and local government costs to do the same thing. We need to stop cutting taxes, and actually increase them, and more than just a few percentage points. We were prosperous and healthy when the top rate was 90%. Keeping it below 50% will never be enough to fix the problem."},{"instruction":"What TV series are worth watching?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: ANSWERWhat TV series are worth watching?

I am morbidly obese (and pregnant, but I checked my pre-pregnancy weight, and it put me at a BMI of 41)Most people who know me do not believe that I belong in the morbidly obese category, because underneath this fat is also a very large person. I carry my fat in my lower abdomen mostly, and I can make myself look ok in clothes. I find the label \\"morbidly obese\\" to be quite insulting because it implies that I am so fat that my fat is killing me. It is not. I am fairly healthy. Now I am not the athlete I would like to be, and I am ridiculously slow, but I've always been slow, even when I was just a chubby kid. I work out, I eat better than my husband with an average BMI, but I'm still a big and fat person. That's ok by me. My cholesterol is fine, I am not remotely diabetic, and my heart is good. As I put on more weight, I started having lower joint problems (ankle and hip), but I took off some weight and that got better, although still left me morbidly obese. I would like to lose more weight and will regain my pre-pregnancy diet and exercise program once I deliver this baby, but my goal weight actually still lands me in the obese category. On that, I simply don't care. I want to be physically active and enjoy life, not fit into someone else's idea of what I should weigh. I know my body, and it's a big one. It did take me a very long time to come to this place though, because when you weigh 200 pounds in junior high, you feel pretty crappy about that. Looking back though, I was pretty cute and only a little chubby. One thing I'm looking forward to doing is actually getting my body fat calculated in a Bod Pod so I can determine exactly how much weight I do have left to lose.I guess this is a diatribe on how crappy I actually find the BMI scale to be, rather than a reflection on being fat, but I think as a woman, I worry about my body and appearance a little more than a normal woman, but because of small chairs and society's obsession with my obesity, it gets thrown in my face a lot. Or maybe I don't even worry more than a \\"normal\\" woman. They are told they need to look like a supermodel, and while I am a supermodel height, I realized a long time ago that I was no supermodel. I want my husband to find me attractive, and I want to be healthy. As long as I feel like I'm ticking off those boxes, BMI can stuff it."},{"instruction":"What do you think about Joe Biden’s plan to create new manufacturing jobs and boost American production? He announced this plan today in Michigan.","output":"I don’t know any American that dislikes the idea of more manufacturing jobs in US. The challenge is in making it happen. There was a reason why manufacturing jobs and factories left US, and that reason still exists: The low cost of labor in other countries compared to American wages. It is well and good to want those jobs to return, but the reality is different. Unless the product being made involves advanced technologies and precision manufacturing — thus justifying its high price — American workers are simply too expensive compared to their counterparts in places like Asia. And, before we launch on a tirade against evil, wealthy corporations, Americans need to realize and accept that we did it to ourselves. China could manufacture all the cheap products it wants, but if Americans don’t buy them, they don’t sell. But, the opposite happened — Americans were overjoyed to see the low, low discount prices and bought them in droves instead of similar, higher-priced products made by Americans. When American-made products stopped selling, American workers lost their jobs; as the loss of business continued, American factories closed and gradually moved to low-wage countries so that they could compete on price. American consumers and their shopping habits unintentionally caused all of that. The reality is that little has changed. American manufacturers would prefer to make products in their own country, but the costs are still too high. If you look at the common products made in US, there is heavy use of automation and fewer human workers — bottles or shampoo, body wash, cans of hair spray, cans of food products, many other products that move along an automated production facility that has machines doing most tasks. Human labor is expensive, not only in wages but also benefits like health care. Employing machines avoids those costs and allows products to be made in high-wage countries like US. So, what manufacturing involving significant levels of human employees can be created? There is a lot of talk about “emerging technologies”, but anything the US produces can be reverse-engineered (or the technology stolen) by China. If Americans start installing more solar panels, China will produce them cheaper. If/when all electric cars become the norm, China will produce them and the batteries they run on will be cheaper. If US companies maximize automation to minimize costs, more products might be sold by American companies but still few Americans will have jobs in such factories. I think there is still benefit in having anything produced in US rather than China, but the problem for the average American is the lack of jobs that pay us enough to support a family. Could US subsidize American industries so that they can compete globally? Yes, and we need only look to the defense industries, which would not exist were it not for the huge sums of money spent by the US government for research and development, and purchase. Subsidizing the American companies that make products using a lot of human capital would be one way to make Americans pay for such jobs, via their taxes rather than paying higher prices for products. That kind of goes against Americans’ devotion to free markets and Capitalism, which promotes the idea that greatest efficiencies are created by allowing the marketplace to decide winners and losers. I also don’t know how the balance sheet would look, paying out tax monies to support industries and then hoping that tax revenues from such activity help to offset the subsidies. What the US really needs is a return of industries that employ many people, pay good wages and pay big taxes to support the Feds’ budgets. I don’t know how that happens given the current circumstances."},{"instruction":"What are some things that only electrical and electronics engineers know, but most people don't?","output":"Most people don't know about their smartphone's changer.

The aim for organic producers is to reduce the intensity of pests, and to boost plant health so that pests aren't as damaging. We reduce the intensity of pests by practicing crop rotation - we don't ever plant the same family of crop in the same place two years in a row. This helps to break the population cycles of the pests involved. This is most effective with crop diseases and soil borne insects, but there are many flying insects which aren't too bothered about flying across the way to get their favourite snacks. So we try to balance the nutrients a plant has available to it so that the plant isn't stacked with nitrates, which some research says is what many insects are attracted to. It's also very plentiful in conventional agriculture due to nitrogen fertilizers, which are very high in nitrates. The goal is to provide a healthy and nutritious (for humans) plant that is not as attractive to insects. There is other research that shows that insects are less attracted to vegetables with high sugar content (brix), and building delicious (to humans) vegetables with high brix content makes it less attractive to pests. An organic farm should also be biodiverse, which means many types of crops planted on one farm, and space left for wildflowers, hedges, verges, and cover crops which really promote beneficial insects. These are insects that eat other insects, and really aid in diminishing the intensity of pest insects. Finally there are pests that will eat our crops no matter what steps like those above we take, and we do have strategies for those as well, mainly a physical barrier called 'row cover'. It's like a very thin fabric blanket that lets light, air and water through, but not insects. It's a wonderful technology, as it also holds warmth and moisture, and speeds up growth tremendously in the spring and fall, but it can be a pain in the *ss to put out and bring back in. Also, as Aran Johnson says below, there are organic pesticides available. What he isn't mentioning is that these are only to be used in extreme circumstances, and they are completely non-persistent in the environment, as they are derived 100% from natural sources. He is wrong about your produce being covered in them, though, because they are non-persistent, as in they break down in the environment within hours after their application. However, a farmer like myself, and anyone who would go through all the pains of being certified organic - the manual weeding, the row cover, the crop rotations and cover crops, would and should make every effort to avoid using these types of 'band-aid solutions', certified organic or not. On the other hand, conventional farmers (and the corporations that supply them) have a strategy to simply kill any insects that come to the crop. Regardless of how much they are promoting those insects through they're own practices (monocropping, lack of biodiversity, unbalanced soils), the strategy is still the same. This results in much bigger populations of pest insects, and the ensuing much greater need for pesticides. It's a vicious cycle, and it's not good for the environment, the farmer, or the consumers. I would not say that what organic farmers do is perfect, but I think we are heading in the right direction. I think we need much more research into ways of controlling pests without necessarily killing every insect in the field (as well as the farmers and consumers, eventually!). The problem with conventional agriculture is that the methodology and the thinking behind it is broken. It's not going to result in a long term solution without a solid injection of holistic thinking, and that's what organic farming provides. So by supporting organic agriculture, you're doing the right thing. You're voting for a sensible approach, and one that is evolving and changing with the technology available."},{"instruction":"Why aren't Macs being built with touch screens?","output":"I’ve wondered about this question myself for years now. Yes touchscreens were clunky in the beginning but they have matured over the years…especially with advances in active stylus pens and screen and glass manufacturing techniques. Microsoft has proven with it’s surface products how good touch screens can really be. They’ve even mocked Macs in their commercials to show how they don’t fold and you can’t write on their screens with a stylus. There are a few reasons: It would cannibalize sales of other products…most notably the ipadIf you make a Mac with a touch screen people may also want a 2-in-1 convertible so engineers would also have to rework and rethink the Mac body, housing and all of the components while still retaining the sleek form factor and stylingIt would require an overhaul of OS X to be touch-friendly. This alone would require many man hours and countless hours of beta testingIt would require developers to be on board with the changes and provide them with the tools to update their software for a touch interface (if their software needs to take advantage of it)The new Mac Pro will be obsolete! People will want a pro display with touch capabilitiesOther lineups such as the iMacs will need touch and with that will require reworking of the screen hinge mechanisms to allow moving the screen to a convenient angle for touch/stylus These aren’t bad things for Apple. It would in a sense make their entire lineup obsolete so people would have to once again buy Apple products which could end up being a very good thing for Apple.

But practice without goals is meaningless. Too harsh? ok, less meaningful :) 😣 What I mean by that is if you are an absolute beginner, or are able to attempt and solve Easy questions only on various coding platforms, then I would suggest to set some realistic targets beforehand to see continuous but achievable progress. Competitive Programming is like a sport , you have to do practice as much you can. Every one faces problems like -: 1. How to start coding? 2. From where to start? 3. Which is the best language to code? And a lot of questions gathered in mind, but if you make yourself to jump in the field of competitive coding you will feel that it is not that complex. I also face a lot of problems before starting competitive coding, but my problem was solved by the best coding institute Coding Ninjas . I joined the batch and after joining I get to know everything about competitive coding. I know nothing about competitive coding but after joining Coding Ninjas I became passionate for competitive coding. 😎 I recommend CODING NINJAS for anyone who wants to be a competitive coder and wants to compete with our country’s best coders as well as with the coders around the whole world. Why you should join Coding Ninjas for Competitive Programming Course ?? Mentors are assigned to the individual group of students where they can communicate through live chats and video sessions for their doubt support.One can pause and extend his/her course for upto 60 days and easily continue with college and semester exams, even if the college reopens in between the course.You will be awarded a Course Completion Certificate only if you pass with a minimum grade of 60% and a Certificate Of Excellence if you secure 90% and above. I am telling some of the points before starting competitive coding which I get to know by CODING NINJAS Keep a small goal to solve enough Div-II 250 problems without peaking into solutions, then 500 pointers, and then 1000 pointer in Div-II. During this process, you can learn and improve your skills in implementation, solving and speed. The process will be slow and may take up to 2–3 years, be patient and measure growth in each step. As you slowly climb the steps, your confidence will improve and one day can be among the top programmers. The most important point is to not loose patience, and when you do take a break and come back stronger. PARTICIPATE PARTICIPATE PARTICIPATE • SPOJ: Its a problem Archive (recommended for all beginners) o Start with problems having maximum submissions. Solve first few problems (may be 20). Build some confidence. Then start following some good coders (check their initial submissions). Then start solving problems topic wise. o Never get stuck for too long in the initial period. Google out your doubts and try to sort them out or you can discuss with someone (ONLY IN THE BEGINNING). o Before getting into live contests like codeforces or codechef, make sure that you have solved about 50-70 problems on SPOJ. • CODECHEF: Do all the three contests every month. o Even if you are unable to solve a problem do always look at the editorials and then code it and get it accepted (this is the way you will learn). o And even if you are able to do it, do look at the codes of some good coders. See how they have implemented. Again you will learn. o Same point apply to TopCoder and Codeforces as well. • Codeforces: 4 to 5 short contests of 2 hour in a month (Do them once you develop some confidence). • TopCoder: Once you have proper experience and you can write codes very fast. Common mistakes by beginners : 1. Program should not print any extra character. Writing a statement like printf (‘’enter value of n”) would cause rejection on any platform. 2. Input and output format specifications must be read carefully. For example, most of the problems expect a new line after every output. So if we don’t write printf(“n”) or equivalent statement in a loop that runs for all test cases, the program would be rejected. To help with your algorithm preparation, I would suggest cracking the coding interview by gaayle laakmann mcdowell. Learn to code efficiently, it might take a while, but dont give up. Learn to debug and test your code , which is the most important thing for a coder. Start devising your own shortcuts and algorithms. This only comes with practise. If it interest you, you can try your hand at data sciences. Many contests are coming up with data sciences as the theme. So good luck!

The residual is the difference between the actual value and the predicted value. The sum of the squares of the residuals is called the cost function. The goal of the gradient descent algorithm is to find the line that minimizes the cost function. Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize a cost function. In the context of linear regression, the cost function is the sum of the squares of the residuals, or the differences between the actual values and the predicted values. The goal of gradient descent is to find the line that minimizes the cost function. Prediction in linear regression is based on the best-fitted line, but the best-fitted line is not always the line that minimizes the cost function. The reason for this is that the best-fitted line is based on the data points that we have, but the line that minimizes the cost function is based on the entire population. The gradient descent algorithm is used to find the line that minimizes the cost function by taking small steps in the direction that reduces the cost function the most. I hope this helps.

I don't know the statistics on it (or if they exist) but in my experience, they have mostly, if not all been young females. A percentage have a real seizure disorder mixed with the fake or pseudo seizures. A history of abuse was common with the patients that I saw. We had a couple that clearly wanted Midazolam and/or had a benzodiazepines addiction. Most of these had no idea what a seizure should look like or watched too much bad TV. They would just jerk and flop all over the place but, if you said “hold still\\" so I can get some medications into your IV, they would hold that arm perfectly still for you. Meanwhile continuing the jerking act with the other arm and legs. As soon as medication was given, they would be awake, answering questions appropriately, etc. ** A note here to clarify about the medication we gave in the IV. It was generally not benzos/midazolam but another medication, ordered by the neurologist for these episodes. Some were ordered midazolam but, it was up to the neurologist and the judgement of us on scene as to the seizure being real or not. We would always say that we needed to get to their IV, so we could give them the medication their doctor ordered. We never said we were giving drug “A, B or C” and instead, give saline. Hopefully, other facilities don't play those games either, its unethical… ** The other type of pseudo/fake-seizure patient was basically an expert at it. They could and did fool many seasoned nurses, doctors and therapists. It was usually something very subtle that made us suspicious. Sometimes it was frequent admissions to different facilities that threw the first red flag. Some were able to withstand all types of procedures and not “break\\". I intubated one patient in particular on 3 occasions over a 2 week period due to her being so good at it, she would desaturate and be apenic for an extended period. I have had to intubate several for this. Imagine the addiction they must have to put up with intubation ( of course, I didn't just intubate without proper oxygenation and premedications. I would use etomidate or propofol for induction, per RSI protocol ) The Neurological team thinks that most of this type probably have real seizures in addition to the fake ones. Most of the patients that had mixed fake and real seizures also had suffered horrible abuse in their life (another story for another day). We would transfer this type of patient to another local hospital for 24 hour video EEG surveillance. It was not usually long before we got a report from the video EEG that would definitively answer any questions."},{"instruction":"Can a Jew become a nonJew?","output":"Short Answer (without considering anything else) — No. My answer is as a goyim and based on my faith as a Christian, among whom are “Jewish Christians”, or Messianic Jews. I also need to mention that the modern nation of Israel is a secular nation, but also maintains a Jewish identity where all people have their freedoms secured by the Israeli constitution. To be Jewish is a tri-fold thing — faith, race, and nation. Can a Jewish person become non-Jewish? Most practicing Jews in the US have their faith and racial identities, and may or may not be, an Israeli citizen. Some do have dual citizenship between US and Israel. Faith — yes, a Jewish person can leave Judaism in favor of a different religion, without losing his or her Jewish identity. Also, someone may convert TO Judaism, so that is also possible.

Geography provides essential knowledge and skills that contribute to the successful planning, design, and execution of construction projects.Firstly, geography helps civil engineers in site selection and land-use planning. Understanding topography, climatic conditions, and geological features of a region enables engineers to make informed decisions regarding the suitability of a location for construction projects. It helps them identify potential hazards, such as landslides, floods, or seismic activity, which may affect the safety and stability of structures. Furthermore, knowledge of geography aids in the efficient utilization of resources. By understanding the natural resources available in a specific area, civil engineers can design projects that minimize environmental impact and maximize sustainability. They can also take advantage of local materials, reducing costs and transportation requirements. Geography also plays a crucial role in infrastructure development. Civil engineers need to consider the existing transportation networks, water bodies, and urban development patterns when designing roads, bridges, and utility systems. This knowledge allows them to create infrastructure that integrates seamlessly with the surrounding environment, ensuring optimal functionality and accessibility. Additionally, understanding the economic and social geography of an area is vital for civil engineers and construction professionals. It helps them assess the demographic characteristics, population growth, and land-use patterns, which are essential for determining the infrastructure needs of a region. This knowledge enables engineers to design projects that cater to the specific requirements of the local community, fostering sustainable development. In conclusion, geography is a valuable asset for civil engineers and construction professionals. It equips them with the necessary knowledge and skills to make informed decisions, optimize resource utilization, and design infrastructure that aligns with the natural and social characteristics of a region. Incorporating geography into civil engineering education and practice can lead to more efficient and sustainable construction projects."},{"instruction":"w many solar panels are needed to run a small middle class people’s house?","output":"Check this [LINKED_TEXT: http://link”www.rstenergy.com/blog”] [URL: http://xn--linkwww-736c.rstenergy.com/blog%E2%80%9D]"},{"instruction":"What happens if a dog bites a FedEx driver?","output":"Depends on the driver and the situation.

I guess a 1:6 teacher to student ratio is pretty good, but are the teachers better at teaching or is it just something that the affluent can brag about?","output":"“You get what you pay for” This is a very true statement for almost everything, including education. Although the extremes offer diminishing returns (For example the 20k school is not 4 times better than the the 5k school. It’s better for the fact that your kids will be with other elites and can make connections that could pay off later but by education scores it won’t be 4 times better). The fact that these schools cost money that must be “chosen” to be paid is what makes them good. ”The problem is choice” The parents that send their kids to private school choose to do without something(our hope of retirement is ours), to send their kids to a school where other parents are making the same choice. This choice by the parents at the school, is the real reason for success. If your child is the one disruptive in school it will be known by the other parents and you will be faced with social penalties. You after all are not only wasting your money you are wasting their money. Their kid is only a free spirit when they are disruptive but your child is an A-hole and future criminal. All the computers, iPads, and smart boards will never make up for the damage one or two disruptive students can make in a classroom. Every minute one disruptive student takes from the teacher is 20 to 30 minutes of education lost for society (each other student loses a minute multiplied by number of students, even public school people get this). Additionally it burns the teachers out to the point they put on Aladdin by 1pm in hopes they will learn to sing while stealing stuff in the future. Teachers love to actually teach. To watch a student who was struggling with a concept finally make that break through is why they love it. They see the progress they have made for the next generation and go home tired but with a feeling of accomplishment. It’s like going to the gym and spending the time working hard at the weights and leaving tired and sore. You know you accomplished something but if you have disruptive students it’s like going to the gym then spending the whole time telling the instragram star to get out of the way so you can lift, not take selfies. You leave frustrated and stressed and don’t want to go back (this is my reason, or it’s what I choose to tell myself). At the private school my kids go to many of the teachers are former public school teachers who left because the money difference was not worth the various issues like discipline, lack of parental involvement, and administrative staff causing more work. Many teachers there are not qualified for public school but without the distractions they can still accomplish their task or bring in help for students that need help. There is so much more time to teacher when you don’t have to stop class because Johny is making a bad choice by setting Jane on fire. Public school in contrast is not a choice. People may have moved to an area for the school but short of making one of the most drastic changes people make in their lives, buying a new home and moving, they are forced to pay for the school. There is no buy in by some of the parents. It is a cost that they can do nothing about. It is taken as tax or increased rent where the only alternative is losing your home. This psychological difference is why Johny, after extinguishing the fire, will be or won’t be disciplined at home. I am NOT against public school. I am against the way it is done and the crappy product it is producing. I am obviously not talking about your kid being crappy it’s your neighbors kids who is crappy obviously. If I was in charge public school would be “free” to all non disruptive students. James can’t read because he is dyslexic then help is available. James can’t read because Johny smashed a desk on his head means Johny’s parents are given a choice. Option 1 the full cost of educating Johny is now billed to you personally. This would be above and beyond the current property taxes. Option 2 Johny would go to a boarding school where discipline is “encouraged”. This would be paid by tax payers and would obviously cost more for everyone but I would rather see an increase in my property taxes then Johny robbing me 15 years later. The current dumping of money in the current system does not work. If you noticed I have not mentioned much about facilities. The big expensive building, sports facilities, outdoor track stuff does not have that big of impact on the mission of education. To educate the students. The non elite private schools rarely have top notch equipment yet they succeed in their mission more than many public schools. A building that handles the basics well is all that is needed. It’s what is inside that counts and that is people. People that must subconsciously or consciously make a choice to buy into the system. It may be a check or it may be effort to avoid writing a check but it must be made. I have been in a matrix mood. Also making a choice is a huge psychological step in self fulfillment. If you believe you are powerless you will act powerless and do nothing to change the situation.

You could also use regular expressions, i.e. myString.replaceFirst(“([0–9])[^0–9]+”, “1”). The round brackets just denote a part of the regular expression we want to refer to later with the 1 (the extra backslash is to get past string interpretation); square brackets indicate this character can be anything in this range - in this case any numeric character. The second square brackets have carat (^) as the first character to instead indicate any character NOT inbetween the brackets. + means the previous character appears 1 or more times. indicates the regex must end at the end of the overall string.

Yet, the most basic human right, at the root of all others, is said to be: Life. We remain, throughout our lives, interdependent: We always depend on others, for our survival. Hopefully, we return that to some extent, by their mutual dependence on us. Any “rights” we may imagine ourselves to have, are always dependent on others. In practice, any real (usable, enforceable) rights we may have are always the result or product of law. They are artificial, not “inalienable.” What some refer to as basic human rights, are not realized unless implemented by some system of laws. They are not so much “rights” that an individual can demand, as they are social responsibilities, growing out of the “Golden Rule,” to treat others as we would wish to be treated. Lists of “God given” or “inalienable” rights, are really just lowest common denominator lists of humane treatment that we would wish others to afford us. Can we demand that others treat us that way? Not unless our laws require it. We all have social responsibilities in society that demands our active response in some circumstances. We cannot walk idly by while witnessing a crime and be doing our duty as members of society. Taxes are not theft, but merely the price of civilized society, the fee for having police, fire fighters, roads, schools, utilities, laws, currency, etc. without which civilization does not function. We all owe the tax share of our labor to the common good. Some of us adopt professions that owe a professional duty that goes beyond what we are strictly paid to do. So, to ask whether a “Right” can be at the expense of someone else’s labor, is asking the wrong question. Asking whether health care is a human right is asking the wrong question. The better question is whether society has a duty or responsibility to provide it, to the extent that it can."},{"instruction":"w much fuel did/does the Hubble Space Telescope need?","output":"[LINKED_TEXT: Robert Frost] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Robert-Frost-1] has the correct answer as always, but there was another question that I had after reading it is, \\"How will Hubble maintain its orbit if it does not have any rockets\\". The answer according to this article [LINKED_TEXT: How the Hubble Space Telescope Will Die] [URL: http://www.deepastronomy.com/how-the-hubble-space-telescope-will-die-video.html] is that Hubble has relied on Space Shuttle for pushing it back up to a higher altitude however they are now no longer active.

But I’ll get to that. This question is the corollary to another commonly asked question, which is ‘Do you have to be a genius to go to Oxford?’ (or some other very prestigious and selective university). The answer, in both cases, is no. Apart from any other consideration, the supply of prodigies (depending on how exactly we might define them) isn’t sufficient to meet hiring demand among leading banks and investment firms. You certainly don’t need to be a prodigy to get in, therefore. But you do need to be very bright by most typical measures. For example, an SAT score that would be considered competitive among applicants for investment banking would be one in the 97th percentile or better. That’s some pretty rarefied atmosphere up there, to be sure, but it doesn’t fall into the realm of ‘prodigy’. Interviewing an actual prodigy The above said, I do recall a particular occasion when I interviewed a bona fide prodigy. Although I didn’t know it when the interview began. I received a resume from an analyst I knew, who asked me whether I would interview her friend, ‘Mark’, who was doing a masters degree in math at Brown University (one of the 8 Ivy League universities, located in Providence, Rhode Island). That was about all the context she gave me. The resume itself was typical enough. I noted that Mark had completed his undergraduate degree in math at SUNY Albany (part of the New York State public university system) the prior year, and was indeed now pursuing a masters degree in math at Brown. About halfway through the interview (which was by phone, rather than face-to-face), Mark quite nonchalantly, and in mid-sentence, said something like: “…so in my 17 years I’ve managed to fit in quite a bit…” A moment later, the penny dropped and I said: “Hold on a second. What was that last thing you said?” He replied: “Oh, I said, ‘in my seventeen years.’ I’m seventeen years old.” I went on to learn that Mark had in fact been the youngest student ever admitted to SUNY Albany, at the age of 14. He’d completed his math degree in less than 3 years, and was now, aged 17, well into his masters degree at Brown. Along the way, he’d also found time to be the number one ranked speed chess player in the United States in the under-18 age category. When he was 10. I sent his resume and my notes to the head of Goldman’s quant group, who had never returned a message from me so quickly in his life. After some further interviews, Mark was hired.

What was the Young Turk's involvement in this genocide?","output":"One of the most well-known Ar.menian forgeries is the famous “Talat Pasha Telegrams”, published by Aram Andonian 96 years ago, which were attributed to several high-ranking Ottoman officials, particularly the Minister of Interior Talat Pasha, allegedly ordering the “extermination” of the Ar.menians, including women, children, and even babies (!). According to Andonian, a government official named Naim Efendi provided him the documents, and the memoirs he published were written personally by Naim Efendi as well, yet, even his existence is in fact doubtful. “ The Ottoman State had yearbooks, in which all the government officials were included. Examination of these yearbooks has demonstrated that there was no official named Naim Bey in Aleppo during the years in question. ” (Kamuran Gürün / The Ar.menian File / p. 238) There is also no evidence in terms of name, signature, initials, or date indicating that these memoirs were actually written by a person named Naim Bey. Therefore, it is quite problematic to accept “The Andonian Documents” as a fact in terms of historiography. In 1937, Andonian claimed that the authenticity of the documents he published was confirmed by a German court in Berlin in 1921 during the trial of Soghomon Tehlirian, the Ar.menian hitman who assassinated Talat Pasha. However, the court records reveal that this was not the case. During the trial in Berlin, the prosecutor showed a cautious approach towards the documents, and emphasized the possibility that they could be a forgery : “ The use of forged documents cannot also lead me into error. I am familiar with the history of how, in the chaos of the revolution, we came to possess documents bearing the signatures of high ranking individuals, and how it was subsequently proved that they were forged. ” ( Şinasi Orel & Süreyya Yuca / The Talat Pasha Telegrams: Historical Fact or Fiction? / p. 19 ) The fabrication of fraudulent documents is also not uncommon in history, such as the “Hitler diaries”, or “Zinoviev telegram” which had created a public stir in England in the early 1920s, is now considered as a forgery. Andonian himself also confessed in his letter he wrote to Dr. Mary Terzian in Switzerland, dated 26 July 1937, that : “ This report [Rössler] is written in German. It contains much criticism about my book, which he considers lacking in objectivity. Moreover, he completely refutes most of the passages relating to the attitude of Germany during the war. There is no doubt that he is right in most of the matters he points out. However, he forgets that my work was not a historical, but rather a one aiming at propaganda.” ( Reproduced in the Dashnak Publication, Comite de Defense de la Cause Armenienne, ‘Justicier du Genocide Armenien’, pp. 230–237 ) ( For more: [LINKED_TEXT: An Assessment on Aram Andonian, Naim Efendi and Talat Pasha Telegrams, Review of Armenian Studies] [URL: http://avim.org.tr/en/Yorum/AKCAM-S-DISTORTIONS-CONTINUE]. )"},{"instruction":"What is your review of Kerala, India?","output":"I am in Kerala right now. This is my 4th visit to Kerala. I have been to Munnar when I was a toddler, been to Thekkady, Ashtamudi,Allepey, Cochin, Kumarakom. This time I visited the Travancore region covering the state capital, Padmanabhapuram Palace, Padmanabhaswamy temple, Kannyakumari, Neyyer river etc. A few things about the place.. It is obviously beautiful. In one day, we saw the beautiful Western ghats and the Neyyer river, the beaches near the Poovar island and the backwaters.Unlike Bengal, where there are tensions based on language with Bihar, Assam and Odisha, there seems to be a brotherhood between tamils and malyalees. Along the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border, not just government buildings but random shops had bilingual boards written in both Tamil and Malayalam and even billboards, graffitis were written in both Tamil and Malayalam.Unlike other places where Muslims and Christians live in their own ghettos, here we found Hindus, Christians and Muslims living side by side. We were playing a game to identify the religion of the family by observing the doors(Jesus was carved on them) or the photo frames of Hindu deities.There were too many Churches in that region. Almost felt like a Christian majority place. The ratio of churches to temples there could be 10:1.Even the backwaters had the holy cross installed on the rocks everywhere along with the statues of Mother Mary and Jesus in veshti. The only major Hindu places could be the Padmanabhaswamy temple and maybe the palace which were remnants of the Hindu travancore royal family. Otherwise there were many churches and mosques elsewhere with a few small Vishnu temples scattered here and there. The Churches were grand and beautiful.Unlike the belief that they don't know Hindi there, maybe because of tourists,the Tamils in Kannyakumari and malyalees in Trivandrum picked up Hindi and spoke in broken Hindi with us.Modesty is very important.Here not the men but the women would stalk you or make fun of you if you are not dressed well. We saw a few women tourists who were not modestly dressed and the Tamil girls started taking their pictures and were staring at them and mocking them haha. 😂Dress in Saree or salvar if you go there.The Tamil and malyalee girls would attract you with their pheromones haha. They smell really good and put on those flowers every morning. They put on chandan and dress up in saree or salvar and that is why they smell really good and have that feminine touch to them. Girls in kolkata do not put on flowers or dress up so beautifully.Temples in Kerala have stricter rules than Tamil temples. In temples of Kerala, one has to put on the traditional mundu and the women should be in sarees.We are bengalees and our language is sweet so we might find the way the people speak in Malayalam and Tamil to be a bit rough. But that is how it is spoken. Languages like Haryanvi, Tamil, Malayalam have that thing which may sound not so sweet like Bengali, Assamese or other eastern languages. Maybe the excessive use of vowels makes the difference."},{"instruction":"it possible to use an extensive vocabulary without being a jerk?","output":"Haha... I can feel why are you asking this question. Well a famous saying by someone I cannot recollect right now goes like When you are the only sane person,you look like the only insane person. What is more important? Choice of words? Craft of your verse? Twisted paraphrasing? So called intelligently intimidating vocabulary…huh? None. All words, or for that matter, all the languages are just mere means to convey what you feel in a particular situation. Emotions and vibes that you want to radiate are of supreme value.Nothing Else. If a word facilitates you to convey your exact reactions/opinions, you must exploit it.Never trade sense for simplicity.Never Everything Should Be Made as Simple as Possible, But Not Simpler. Albert Einstein It is rather rediculous that to most people these days, everything boils down to few words like cool,nice pic ,amazing and awesome…..and the best they try is….O..Tabaahi (Mayhem). Oh C'mon pokemons,world is full of things which are: Stupendous, Astounding,Phenomenal, Spectacular, Extraordinary, Breathtaking, Miraculous,Subliminal, and much more. But hey, there should be moderation else all the cute people around you will start hating for no reasons :-) At times it may get obnoxious: Translation: Friend: Can't you behave normal or atleast act normal. Me: Sadly,this has become my normal :( But other side is quite hillarious yet ironical.These very similar people will at times request you for crafting a classic, high-sounding,deep and personalised caption for their latest instagram photos. Haha.. :p Finally, I'll conclude that choose your words to better express and not to impress.Life is small. Don't do that.Peace. PS: Research says that having a rich vocabulary enables you to think faster and better than others in all walks of life.

At midnight Namo launched it but he protested as CM .MMS have very friendly rapport with Henry Williams Gaytes who ordered Namo to put lockdown to crush economy for global reset.EVM is totally under control of global elites so both being chosen to hold the highest seat , they didn't become PM candidate by their respective party's choice.Both support American policy in India as global elites control the world by keeping America in front.Both working for new world system but MMS worked hidden way in a slow process but Namo work aggressively in foolish way.Both obey the owner of our country ( Queen of England ,now King has taken over the power after her death). Never got freedom , only got the power to rule under independence act of Britain.PHFI was organization (private public partnership) which control our health policies, was launched during MMS period for launching plandemic in a well planned way.

Unless they too deeply involved in politics. For example Valide Sultan (queen mother) Kösem Sultan eventually got herself killed while politicking over her grandsons’ succession. She was the de Facto ruler of the empire for a while on her sons’ behalf. Her son Murad IV curbed her power after he recached the adulthood but she managed to outlive him and went back to politics thanks to her mentally weak son ibrahim I. There are claims about she was ordered her son Ibrahim’s killing in the end. Later she tried to got her grandson Mehmed IV. killed but this time his mother, Turhan Sultan got Kösem killed first. She was the only female Sultan who got officially killed because of politics. Female members of the Ottoman dynasty were probably most privileged people in the empire. Their sons even used the Khan title without threat to be executed (Ibrahimhanzadeler family for example, whom were descended from Grand Vizier Mehmed Sokollu and a daughter of Suleiman the Magnificent).

Then came the Beatles and suddenly the guitars were thicker and richer. And we all said, “Oh hell yes, this is what guitars were made to do!” And then one day we heard Hendrix. It was like music from another planet. Nobody had ever heard anything like this before. This was not a man playing guitar. This was a human/alien/guitar hybrid creature emitting music from its soul.
