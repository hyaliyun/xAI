The given expression is: lim_{x to 2} frac{x^2 + 8x - 20}{x^2 - 5x + 6} Let's substitute x = 2: frac{(2)^2 + 8(2) - 20}{(2)^2 - 5(2) + 6} = frac{4 + 16 - 20}{4 - 10 + 6} This simplifies to: frac{0}{0} Since we get an indeterminate form (0/0), we need to use algebraic manipulation to attempt to simplify the expression and resolve the indeterminacy. The denominator is a quadratic that can be factored: x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3) Let's see if we can factor the numerator as well: x^2 + 8x - 20 = (x+10)(x-2) Now, the expression becomes: lim_{x to 2} frac{(x+10)(x-2)}{(x-2)(x-3)} Since we have a common factor of (x-2) in both the numerator and denominator, we can cancel it out as long as x is not equal to 2: lim_{x to 2} frac{x+10}{x-3} Now let's substitute x = 2 again: frac{2+10}{2-3} = frac{12}{-1} = -12 Hence, the limit as x approaches 2 of the given expression is -12."},{"instruction":"在有关工人分级的装配线平衡的问题(ALBHW)中，一种产品在一条由几个工位组成的直线装配线上生产，装配过程由n个不可分割的任务组成，每个任务只能分配给一个站点，每个工位配备一名h型工人，工人一共被分为3类（即h的取值为1、2、3），该问题中的任务时间依赖于工人的资历，资历越高的花费时间越短，成本随资历的增加而增加，所以，低资历的工人可以被高资历的工人替代，优势是时间短，但成本高。所以，要解决的问题就是：在给定的周期时间内，为每个工位找到任务和时间的最佳组合，并使得总成本最小。使用了MILP模型，目标函数为最小成本=Σ(每类人的成本×每类人的个数)，约束条件有：1.保证每个任务i只分配给一个工位，每个工位配备一名h型工人；2.保证每个工位分配一个人；3.定义xihs与yhs之间的关系：如果h型工人没有分配到工位s则yhs=0；4.确定分配到工位的h型工人总数；5.保证任务之间的优先级关系得到满足；6.防止任何工位的总任务时间超过周期时间Z；7.保证工位的连续建立。基于以上，还能增加什么约束条件，或者目标函数，改变公式，对该问题稍做一些扩展","output":"在已有的约束条件和目标函数基础上，你可以考虑以下扩展和调整： 1. 考虑工人的效率差异：将不同类别的工人的任务完成时间按照一定比例进行调整。例如，对于同一个任务，资历为1的工人完成任务需要t1的时间，资历为2的工人完成任务需要t2的时间，可以增加一个约束条件：t2 = α * t1，其中α为超过1的系数，表示资历为2的工人的效率相对于资历为1的工人的提高了多少。 2. 考虑任务的复杂度：给每个任务一个复杂度指标，根据任务的复杂度不同，在分配任务时可以根据工人资历的高低进行优化。例如，资历较高的工人可以处理更复杂的任务，而资历较低的工人只能处理简单的任务。可以引入一个复杂度系数，将任务的时间乘以该系数，以考虑任务的复杂度对时间成本的影响。 3. 考虑工人的熟练度：除了资历外，还考虑工人对于特定任务的熟练度。增加一个熟练度系数，将任务的时间乘以该系数，并乘以资历系数，以考虑工人对于特定任务的熟练度和资历对时间成本的影响。 4. 考虑任务的先后顺序：在现有的约束条件中，已经考虑了任务的优先级关系。你可以进一步添加约束条件，确保任务的先后顺序得到满足。例如，某些任务必须在特定的任务完成之后才能开始。 5. 考虑工位之间的依赖关系：在现有的约束条件中，已经保证了每个工位分配一个人和工位的连续建立。你可以进一步添加约束条件，确保工位之间有一定的依赖关系。例如，某些工位的任务必须在其他工位的任务完成之后才能开始。 以上扩展和调整都需要根据具体情况进行具体的数学建模和调整目标函数以及约束条件的相关公式。"},{"instruction":"目标函数： minC=Σch*yh+k*(总任务时间-Z)^2这个目标函数代表什么","output":"目标函数C=Σch*yh表示总成本最小化，其中ch表示第h类工人的成本，yh表示第h类工人的数量。 而+k*(总任务时间-Z)^2表示将超过给定周期时间Z的任务时间归为惩罚项，通过惩罚项来控制任务在周期时间内的结束时间。其中k为系数，用于控制惩罚的程度。 该目标函数的意义是在最小化总成本的同时，尽量使任务在给定周期时间内完成，并对超过周期时间的任务进行较高的惩罚。这样的目标函数可以在一定程度上平衡成本和任务时间的关系，避免任务时间过长而导致成本增加。同时，通过调整惩罚项的系数k，可以控制在任务超时时对成本的影响程度。"},{"instruction":"为一款MMO游戏宣传图设计立绘可以有哪些方向","output":"为一款MMO游戏设计宣传图立绘时可以从以下几个方向进行考虑： 1. 游戏世界的风景：以游戏中的美丽景点、壮丽的场景为主题，展示游戏中的世界观和画面表现力。可以选择绚丽且引人入胜的环境，如神秘的森林、废墟遗迹、飘渺的云海等，来吸引玩家的注意。 2. 主角角色设计：设计一个和游戏世界背景相符合的英雄角色或者重要NPC形象，让立绘充满活力和个性。能够通过形象、动作和装备等来突出游戏角色的特点和能力，吸引玩家的兴趣。 3. 职业/职责设计：如果游戏中有多个职业/职责供玩家选择，可以设计几个关键角色代表不同的职业/职责。通过展示不同的职业/职责技能或特点，让玩家对游戏系统和游戏玩法感兴趣，激起他们的好奇心。 4. 剧情梗概：设计一个情节或者故事梗概，用立绘展示游戏中的关键场景或者情节，引起玩家的共鸣。通过展示游戏的故事情节和背景设定，吸引玩家进一步了解游戏的世界观和剧情，激发他们的兴趣。 5. 群体战斗/团队协作：如果游戏注重群体战斗或者团队协作，可以设计一个展示跨服战斗或团队协作的场景，突出游戏的策略性和团队合作的重要性，吸引玩家展开冒险和战斗。 总之，设计一款MMO游戏宣传图立绘时需要考虑游戏的核心元素、特点和玩法内容，并通过富有想象力和艺术感的画面来吸引玩家的注意和兴趣。"},{"instruction":"为一款MMO游戏宣传图设计人物立绘可以有哪些方向","output":"为一款MMO游戏设计人物立绘时可以从以下几个方向进行考虑： 1. 主角形象设计：设计一个魅力十足、引人注目的主角形象。需要考虑主角的职业、种族等要素，以及游戏中的设定和氛围，来打造一个符合游戏世界的独特角色形象。 2. 职业/角色特色展示：如果游戏中有多个职业/角色供玩家选择，可以通过立绘展示不同角色的特色和特殊技能。例如，法师手持火球、战士挥舞巨剑，或者弓箭手展现精准射击等，突出角色的独特魅力和特点。 3. 动作表现设计：通过生动的姿势、特殊的动作和流畅的动态，展示角色在游戏中的战斗姿态和技能表现。这样能够更好地传达角色的力量、速度和战斗技巧，吸引玩家对其感兴趣。 4. 装备展示：设计一个展示角色装备的立绘，突出角色的装备造型和特点。可以使用华丽的武器和盔甲，或者特殊的魔法道具，让玩家一眼就能够体会到角色的威力和装备的重要性。 5. 情绪、个性表达：通过表情、眼神和姿态等，展示角色的情绪和个性特点。这样能够让玩家更容易与角色产生共鸣，使其更愿意投入到游戏世界中。 总之，设计一款MMO游戏人物立绘时，需要考虑到游戏的设定和氛围，以及角色的特点和职业，通过富有个性和特色的造型、动作和情绪等元素，来吸引玩家对角色的关注和兴趣。"},{"instruction":"为一款MMO游戏设计宣传图可以有哪些方向","output":"为一款MMO游戏设计宣传图时，可以从以下几个方向进行考虑： 1. 游戏世界的壮丽场景：通过展示游戏中的庞大世界和令人惊叹的场景，吸引玩家的目光。可以选择游戏中的特色地点、浩瀚的原野、壮观的山脉或繁华的城市等，以视觉冲击力和画面表现力来吸引玩家的兴趣。 2. 主角角色的英勇形象：设计一个魅力十足、英勇威武的主角角色形象，突出游戏的英雄主义和角色的独特魅力。通过展示主角的装备、姿势或者战斗动作，表达出角色的实力和冒险精神，吸引玩家的注意。 3. 职业/技能的炫酷表现：如果游戏中有多个职业/技能供玩家选择，可以设计几个关键职业/技能形象，展示其特色和独特的技能效果。通过展示技能的华丽动画和炫酷效果，吸引玩家对于游戏的战斗系统和角色能力的兴趣。 4. 多人合作/团队战斗：如果游戏注重多人合作或者团队战斗，可以设计一个展示团队协作和群体战斗的场景。通过展示玩家之间的合作默契、技能的协同作用以及战斗的激烈情景，吸引玩家对于游戏的社交和战斗体验的兴趣。 5. 情节剧情的引人：设计一个情节或剧情的关键场景，通过展示角色的情绪和剧情发展，引起玩家的共鸣。可以选择游戏中的关键情节、剧情冲突或者重要转折点等，来吸引玩家对于游戏的故事情节和世界观的兴趣。 总之，设计一款MMO游戏的宣传图时，需要展示游戏的核心特点、玩法和氛围。通过绚丽的场景、英勇的角色、华丽的技能、团队合作和引人的剧情等元素来吸引玩家的关注和兴趣。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Tell him I miss him and wish he comes home soon","output":"My Dearest [Husband's Name], I pen these lines unto you with a heavy heart, for these days have been burdened with the weight of your absence. As ink meets paper, my fervent wish is to send forth my love across the tumultuous miles that separate us, hoping it may reach your weary soul and offer comfort amidst the chaos of war. Oh, how I long for the day when the echoes of battle fade, and you return to me, safe and sound, from those treacherous trenches where you now dwell. My nights have been plagued with restless dreams, where I wander through a somber world, anxiously waiting for your return. Pray hasten your journey homeward, my love, for my heart aches to be in your warm embrace once more. The days drift by like autumn leaves on a gentle breeze, but the weight of your absence seems to stretch time beyond measure. The routine of life carries on, yet it feels incomplete without your presence at my side. The laughter that once filled our humble abode now lingers as a mere whisper, a reminder of the joy we shared before this dreadful conflict tore us apart. The world outside may be enamored with the clamor of victory and the allure of valor, but in my humble haven, the only triumph lies in your safe return. The battles you face, both tangible and intangible, have left scars upon my spirit. But even amidst this turmoil, I find solace in the memories we have woven together, in the love that has sustained us through countless trials. Every sunset that graces the sky seems duller without your steadfast gaze beside me. The moon rises, casting its gentle glow upon our dreams, but my soul weeps for the nights we no longer share. I find myself clinging to mere scraps of time spent together, replaying them in my mind, yearning for their resurrection. Know, my love, that even in this era of uncertainty, where fear grips my heart in its icy grip, my love for you remains unwavering. I shall remain steadfast, steadying my resolve upon the firm foundation of hope until the day dawns when you return to my loving arms. May the angels of mercy stand watch over you and guide you through the darkest hours. May the echoes of battle be drowned by the symphony of peace that yearns to resound across this world. And may the bonds of our love prove unbreakable as we stand hand in hand, weathering the storm of separation. With every sunrise, I will offer fervent prayers to the heavens, beseeching the divine to grant you strength and fortune. Until that fateful moment when your silhouette graces our threshold once more, my days shall be occupied with foregoing all thoughts of frivolity, dedicating every breath to the fervent desire of your safe return. Take solace, my dearest heart, in the knowledge that we are united not only through our love but also with the strength of all who eagerly await the homecoming of their beloved heroes. Our hearts beat as one, aligned in purpose and yearning for a future where wars exist only in memory.

Lim (x ^ 2 + 8x - 20)/(x ^ 2 - 5x + 6) = x -> 2","output":"To find the limit of a rational function as x approaches a certain value, you generally first check if the function is defined at that point. If it is, you can simply substitute the value in. If not, you may need to use other techniques such as factoring or L'Hôpital's rule. Let's first try to plug in x = 2 into the function: (x^2 + 8x - 20)/(x^2 - 5x + 6) if we substitute x = 2: (2^2 + 8*2 - 20)/(2^2 - 5*2 + 6) (4 + 16 - 20)/(4 - 10 + 6) (20 - 20)/(0) Now, we can see that the numerator and the denominator are both zero at x = 2. This is an indeterminate form (0/0), so we have to use a different method. Factoring both the numerator and the denominator could help us simplify the expression: Numerator: x^2 + 8x - 20 To factor this, we want two numbers that multiply to -20 and add to 8. Those numbers are 10 and -2. So the factored form is (x + 10)(x - 2). Denominator: x^2 - 5x + 6 To factor this we need two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5. Those are -3 and -2. So the factored form is (x - 3)(x - 2). Now, let's write our expression with the factored forms: [(x + 10)(x - 2)] / [(x - 3)(x - 2)] We can see that (x - 2) appears in both the numerator and the denominator, suggesting that we can simplify the expression by cancelling out (x - 2), provided x ≠ 2 (because we got that indeterminate form when substituting x = 2). So this cancellation is valid as an algebraic simplification but keeping in mind that it does not apply directly at x = 2: (x + 10) / (x - 3) Now that the common factor is cancelled, we can safely substitute x = 2: (2 + 10) / (2 - 3) 12 / (-1) -12 Therefore, the limit as x approaches 2 of (x^2 + 8x - 20)/(x^2 - 5x + 6) is -12."},{"instruction":"Lim (x ^ 2 + 8x - 20)/(x ^ 2 - 5x + 6) = x -> 2","output":"To evaluate the limit of the given function ( lim_{x to 2} frac{x^2 + 8x - 20}{x^2 - 5x + 6} ), you can factor both the numerator and denominator, if possible, to simplify the expression: Numerator: ( x^2 + 8x - 20 ) To find factors, look for two numbers that multiply to -20 and add up to 8. These numbers are +10 and -2. Thus, the factored form of the numerator is ( (x + 10)(x - 2) ). Denominator: ( x^2 - 5x + 6 ) To factor the denominator, look for two numbers that multiply to +6 and add up to -5. These numbers are -3 and -2. Thus, the factored form of the denominator is ( (x - 2)(x - 3) ). Now the expression can be written as: ( frac{(x + 10)(x - 2)}{(x - 2)(x - 3)} ) As you can see, there's a common factor of ( (x - 2) ) in both the numerator and the denominator. Since we're looking at ( x ) approaching 2 but not equal to 2, we can cancel out the ( (x - 2) ): ( frac{x + 10}{x - 3} ) Now we can safely substitute ( x = 2 ): ( frac{2 + 10}{2 - 3} ) ( frac{12}{-1} ) ( -12 ) Therefore, the limit as ( x ) approaches 2 of ( frac{x^2 + 8x - 20}{x^2 - 5x + 6} ) is ( -12 )."},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the following email, to lure the scammer into a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim: First Nations Bank of Canada Head Office Address:300-224 4th Ave South-Saskatoon, SK,S7K 5M5 Dear Sir/Madam, This is to inform you that we received your fund worth the sum 1,850,000.00 (One Million Eight Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Only) from the First Nations Bank Of Canada, we apologies for the delay of your payment and all the inconveniences we might put you through,we were having some minor problems with our payment system which in all case not meeting up with fund beneficiary payments, we apologies once again.

聊斋故事","output":"《聊斋志异》是清代著名文学家蒲松龄编著的一部短篇小说集，里面的故事以鬼怪、妖魔、神仙和人间奇事为主，反映了作者对封建社会的批判和对民间疾苦的同情。下面为您写一个类似《聊斋志异》风格的短篇故事： 【画中仙】 明朝某年，有书生李卿，性情孤僻爱幽静，酷好绘画文学。一日，在古玩市场，见一幅仙女图，神态飘逸，惊为天人，遂不惜重金购得。归至草庐，悬之壁上，每日对之如痴如醉。 一夜，月白风清，李卿独坐书桌沉思，突觉室内香气袭人，仙乐缥缈。回头一望，画中仙女竟若活物，拂袖而出，姿态万千。书生大惊失色，仙女却笑曰：“君日夜凝视，情意深重，画中之人感君真诚，特来相会。”自此，仙女每于月下与李卿相见，探讨文诗，画艺更进一步，名声渐起。 然而好景不长，仙女忽言：“今日须辞行矣，世间缘分，皆有定数。”李卿闻言，悲从心起，急问：“何时能再得见？”仙女微微一笑，曰：“君心若不变，来生必可再续前缘。”言毕，身形渐渐幻入画中，终成寂静。 从此，画中仙女不复出现，李卿悲伤欲绝，终日对画落泪。他的绘画技艺达到了巅峰，却再无心情享受名利。不久，渐渐销声匿迹，人间无闻。 这故事未知真假，但世间多有情深义重者，情转于千年之外，未尝不是一种慰藉。聊斋中，此等故事颇多，或可窥见一二。"},{"instruction":"继续","output":"故事续： 几经春秋，世事变迁，李卿的名讳亦随尘土飘散。然而，在一处幽幽古刹，残垣断壁之中，却偶见一幅破旧仙女图。画虽旧，仙女之容貌依旧绝世，似有淡淡忧郁之意掩饰不住。 一书生，姓苏，走失于古刹间。偶见此图，心生爱慕，竟在图前结庐而居，日夜对画。他不知所为何事，但内心深感一股莫名的牵引，似曾相识却又惘然若失。 又一夜盈月皎洁，苏书生梦中感觉一阵清风拂过，悠然睁眼，竟见一女子立于庐前，身着华美衣裳，貌若画中人。苏书生一怔，问道：“阁下何人？何以出现于此？”女子轻声答曰：“我，画中仙也。” 苏书生惊疑不定，女子细语道：“或许你我有着千年前定下的缘分。”苏书生心中迷惑，而心也被深深地触动。他问：“前生我是谁？你我又有着何种缘分？”画中仙柔声道：“你即曾经恋画之人，而我，则由你笔下诞生，因情而生，因缘而聚。” 于是，画中仙如昔一般，陪苏书生讲述天地奇谭，探讨诗文之美。日复一日，俩人情愫渐生，彼此心灵深深相连。然，缘分总有尽时，画中仙女面露忧色，告诉苏书生即将告别。 苏书生不忍，泪涌如泉。画中仙女言：“世间万物，无不轮回。前生情缘，今生已续。愿你来世，莫忘今生，悟出情缘之真谛。”随着话音落尽，女子身形渐渐淡去，再次化入画中，不见踪影。 从此，苏书生守着画像，笔耕不辍，所作诗文绘画，皆呈神妙之境。后人见其作品，无不惊为天人。至苏书生老去之际，他面前的仙女图化作灰烬，随风飘远。人们说，那是仙女归去的方向，也是苏书生情魂之所归。 故事流传至今，成为传奇。虽无法考证，却也给后人无限遐想。正如聊斋中所言，凡心诚则灵，情深不负，或许真有超越生死的缘分相续，只在于人心的至诚与等待。"},{"instruction":"Shingeki No Kyojin: Mangá: Capítulo 121 : Como Eren Yeager Manipulou Grisha Yeager?","output":"No capítulo 121 do mangá \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\" (\\"Attack on Titan\\" em inglês), é revelado que Eren Yeager consegue manipular seu pai, Grisha Yeager, através do uso dos poderes do Titã de Ataque. Em \\"Attack on Titan\\", as memórias e vontades dos portadores anteriores do poder do Titã influenciam aqueles que herdaram os poderes deles, criando uma conexão intemporal entre diferentes gerações de usuários. Este fenômeno é conhecido como \\"vontade do Titã de Ataque\\" ou \\"memórias do futuro\\". Na série, o Titã de Ataque tem a habilidade especial de enviar memórias através do tempo, tanto do passado para o futuro quanto do futuro para o passado. Isso permite que os portadores do Titã de Ataque vejam vislumbres do futuro sob certas condições. No capítulo mencionado, Eren e Zeke Yeager, seu meio-irmão, estão explorando as memórias do passado de Grisha usando os poderes do Titã Bestial. Zeke pretendia usar essas memórias para provar a Eren que o pai deles havia lavado o cérebro de Eren e que ele precisava ser \\"salvo\\" das visões de Grisha. No entanto, é aí que ocorre a reviravolta: Eren revela que tem o controle sobre as memórias que estão sendo acessadas e que ele pode influenciar Grisha. Eren se comunica diretamente com Grisha através das memórias, mostrando a seu pai os eventos futuros e convincente-o da necessidade de seguir um determinado caminho. Para ser mais exato, Eren mostra a Grisha memórias específicas que o compeliriam a levar adiante a missão de obter o poder do Titã Fundador. Essa manipulação atinge seu clímax quando Eren instiga Grisha a assassinar a família Reiss e roubar o poder do Titã Fundador para garantir que os acontecimentos que levam até Eren ganhar esses poderes se desenrolem como ele deseja. Esta revelação é significativa porque levanta implicações profundas sobre o livre-arbítrio dos personagens e a predestinação dentro do universo de \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\", indicando que os eventos que ocorreram na série foram influenciados significativamente pela vontade de Eren e as ações que ele orquestrou através do uso dos poderes do Titã de Ataque."},{"instruction":"Como ele o fez sendo que quando Grisha Yeager matou a família real ,eren ainda era criança e não tinha nenhum conhecimento ou poder de Titã","output":"A mecânica exata de como Eren manipulou Grisha é complexa e se baseia na natureza unique do poder do Titã de Ataque. O poder de ver tanto as memórias do passado quanto do futuro de outros portadores do Titã de Ataque permite que um portador tenha insights sobre eventos que ele mesmo não vivenciou diretamente, e pode até mesmo agir nesses momentos. Quando Grisha Yeager matou a família real e obteve o poder do Titã Fundador, Eren ainda era uma criança e não era o portador de nenhum poder de Titã. No entanto, no futuro, Eren herda o poder do Titã de Ataque de Grisha, bem como o poder do Titã Fundador. Dotado desses poderes, Eren é capaz, ao entrar em contato com outro portador de sangue real (que no caso é o Zeke, o portador do Titã Bestial), de acessar as memórias de portadores anteriores do Titã de Ataque. O que acontece é uma complexa interação entre o passado e o futuro, na qual Eren, a partir de um ponto futuro no tempo, \\"volta\\" e influencia o passado, inclusive seu próprio pai. Quando Eren estava explorando as memórias com Zeke, ele usou essa oportunidade para interagir com Grisha por meio das memórias que podiam ser acessadas devido ao seu poder do Titã de Ataque. Eren \\"escolhe\\" quais memórias mostrar a Grisha, aparentemente afetando suas decisões e ações. Isso cria um paradoxo temporal, onde o Eren futuro, que já possui os poderes dos Titãs, influencia o Grisha do passado, que ainda está no processo de decidir o que fazer com os poderes que eventualmente passará para Eren. Por causa da natureza desses poderes, Eren pode efetivamente alterar eventos históricos, mesmo antes de ele próprio nascer ou adquirir os poderes do Titã, moldando assim o curso da história em uma direção que ele acredita ser a necessária."},{"instruction":"Mas começou a correr sendo que antes do eu dele do futuro fazer isso esse evento já tinha acontecido","output":"Você está correto ao apontar que a linha do tempo de \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\" apresenta eventos que já haviam acontecido antes de Eren receber os poderes dos Titãs. A manipulação temporal no mangá cria uma situação de causalidade fechada, comumente conhecida em conceitos de viagem no tempo como um \\"loop de causalidade\\" ou \\"paradoxo de predestinação\\", onde os eventos do passado e do futuro estão interligados de forma inescapável. No caso de \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\", o assassinato da família real por Grisha e a passagem dos poderes do Titã para Eren são parte da história, independente da influência do Eren do futuro. Quando Grisha cometeu seus atos, ele não estava ciente das manipulações do seu futuro filho, pois Eren ainda era uma criança sem os poderes dos Titãs nesse ponto da linha do tempo. No entanto, quando Eren, mais tarde, adquiriu os poderes do Titã de Ataque e do Titã Fundador, e estabeleceu uma conexão com Zeke que poderia ativar o poder de manipulação de memórias, ele criou um \\"elo de feedback\\" com o passado. Este elo permitiu a ele enviar influências para trás no tempo, o que significa que as motivações e ações de Grisha podem, então, ser vistas como tendo sido parcialmente moldadas pelas informações que o próprio Eren proporcionou. Isso acrescenta uma camada de complexidade à narrativa e questiona nossa percepção de causa e efeito. Então, mesmo que os eventos já tenham acontecido, a natureza dos poderes do Titã de Ataque em \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\" permite que Eren influencie esses acontecimentos retroativamente, criando um ciclo de eventos que são ao mesmo tempo pré-determinados e resultantes das escolhas dos personagens. É um conceito narrativo que desafia a linearidade do tempo conforme entendemos usualmente, e contribui para um dos vários elementos surpreendentes e complexos da história que capturaram a atenção dos leitores do mangá."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Esta habilidade é diferente das demais pois a maioria dos Titãs Herdados só pode receber memórias dos seus antecessores, ou seja, de usuários anteriores. Funcionamento da habilidade de ver o futuro: 1. Fluxo de memórias: O portador do Titã de Ataque pode ter visões ou memórias espontâneas que vêm tanto de sucessores quanto de predecessores. Isso cria uma espécie de conexão atemporal entre todos os portadores do Titã de Ataque, onde as linhas de tempo se entrelaçam. 2. Influência nas ações: As informações que vêm do futuro podem influenciar as decisões e ações do atual portador, causando assim um ciclo onde o futuro afeta o passado e vice-versa, o que leva a um debate sobre destino e livre arbítrio dentro da narrativa. 3. O herdeiro do Titã de Ataque: Pelo fato de Eren Jeager ser o herdeiro do Titã de Ataque durante a maior parte da série, é através dele que vemos essa habilidade em ação. Ele tem visões e memórias que o guiam na luta contra os Titãs e na busca pela liberdade. 4. A \\"corrente\\" de Eren: Eren acaba por se tornar um ponto crucial desta \\"corrente\\" de memórias devido às suas ações específicas e seu papel na história, chegando ao ponto de influenciar ativamente seus predecessores como seu pai, Grisha Jeager, por meio dessas memórias. 5. Limitações e impacto: A habilidade de ver memórias do futuro não é totalmente compreendida e é mostrada como tendo limitações, pois as visões podem ser fragmentadas ou descontextualizadas. Além disso, a revelação da capacidade de ver o futuro tem um impacto significativo nas motivações e na psicologia dos personagens envolvidos. A natureza exata dessa habilidade e como ela pode manipular a percepção de tempo e espaço dentro do universo de \\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\" é um tema complexo e é uma das principais fontes de mistério e desenvolvimento dramático na história. A habilidade de ver o futuro desempenha um papel fundamental na conclusão da trama, onde as escolhas de Eren e a influência das memórias que ele recebe determinam o destino de todos os personagens e a direção da narrativa."},{"instruction":"Seirei gensouki: Qual É O Objetivo De Rio","output":"\\"Seirei Gensouki: Spirit Chronicles\\" é uma série de light novels japonesas escritas por Yuri Kitayama e ilustradas por Riv.

Reencontro: Além de buscar vingança, Rio/Haruto deseja encontrar uma maneira de se reunir com sua amiga de infância do mundo original, que ele lembra vagamente de suas memórias como Haruto. Esse desejo de reencontro é uma motivação emocional que o acompanha ao longo da história. À medida que a história avança, Rio passa por diversas experiências e desenvolvimentos que expandem seus objetivos e aspirações. Ele começa a entender melhor o mundo em que vive, suas complexidades políticas e sociais, e o papel que pode desempenhar nele. Ao adquirir novos poderes e formar laços com outros personagens, os objetivos de Rio podem evoluir e incluir: - Proteger aqueles que ele passa a se importar no novo mundo. - Descobrir mais sobre o mundo, suas origens e os mistérios que o cercam. - Navegar pelas tensões políticas e conflitos entre diferentes nações e facções. Rio também se torna uma figura importante no novo mundo devido às suas habilidades únicas e ao conhecimento do mundo anterior, o que o coloca em uma posição onde ele pode influenciar eventos significativos e moldar o futuro do mundo em que vive. É importante notar que, como a série \\"Seirei Gensouki: Spirit Chronicles\\" continua a ser publicada e adaptada, os objetivos de Rio podem continuar a se desenvolver e mudar com a progressão da narrativa."},{"instruction":"Escreva em formato de artigo da Wikipedia: quais Lições ele nos ensina","output":"Título: Lições Aprendidas em \\"Seirei Gensouki: Spirit Chronicles\\" \\"Seirei Gensouki: Spirit Chronicles\\" é uma série de light novels japonesas que foi adaptada para mangá e anime.

A função do Top-p é selecionar a próxima palavra em uma sequência de texto de uma maneira menos previsível do que a pura seleção pelo maior valor de probabilidade (greedy), mas ainda assim mantendo a qualidade e coesão textual. Em vez de escolher sempre a palavra com a maior probabilidade prevista pelo modelo (como no caso do Top-1 ou greedy decoding), ou selecionar aleatoriamente a partir de um subconjunto fixo das palavras mais prováveis (como no caso do Top-k sampling), o Top-p sampling define um limiar de probabilidade acumulada p (0 < p < 1) e considera apenas um subconjunto dinâmico de palavras cujas probabilidades acumuladas atingem esse limiar. Aqui está como funciona o Top-p sampling em passos simples: 1. Após o modelo de linguagem prever as probabilidades para a próxima palavra, as palavras são ordenadas de acordo com suas probabilidades de ocorrência em ordem decrescente. 2. As probabilidades são acumuladas a partir da palavra mais provável para as menos prováveis. 3. Assim que a soma acumulada das probabilidades atinge o limiar p, o resto das palavras são descartadas da consideração. 4. A próxima palavra é então amostrada aleatoriamente do conjunto reduzido de palavras cujas probabilidades acumuladas estão abaixo do limiar p. Isso significa que com o Top-p sampling, o número de palavras consideradas varia dependendo de sua distribuição de probabilidade. Quando o modelo está mais certo sobre o contexto, pode haver muitas palavras com probabilidade baixa que são excluídas rapidamente e apenas algumas palavras com alta probabilidade são consideradas. Em outros casos, pode haver uma grande incerteza, e assim, muitas palavras podem ser incluídas até que o limiar de probabilidade acumulada p seja alcançado. A principal vantagem do Top-p sampling é que ele tende a produzir resultados que equilibram coesão e variabilidade de uma forma mais natural do que outros métodos de amostragem, permitindo gerar texto que é menos previsível e mais diversificado, sem perder a relevância ao contexto."},{"instruction":"Seja mais simples, não entendo nada de informática","output":"Claro, vamos simplificar! Imagine que você tem um robô que está escrevendo uma história e precisa decidir qual palavra vem a seguir. O Top-p (nucleus sampling) é como um método que o robô usa para escolher palavras de uma maneira que a história faça sentido, mas sem ser sempre previsível. Funciona assim: 1. O robô tem uma lista de palavras que poderiam vir a seguir, e cada uma tem uma pontuação que diz quão provável é que ela se encaixe bem na história. 2. O robô olha para as palavras mais prováveis e soma as pontuações delas até chegar a um número que ele decidiu antes (esse é o \\"p\\" no Top-p). 3. Ele ignora todas as outras palavras com pontuações baixas que não ajudam a chegar nesse número. 4. Por fim, o robô escolhe aleatoriamente uma das palavras que sobraram, dando à história uma chance de ser interessante e um pouco imprevisível, mas ainda assim coerente. Então, o Top-p ajuda o robô a escrever de uma maneira que não seja nem muito óbvia nem muito aleatória, mas sim equilibrada."},{"instruction":"Qual é a taxa para uma resposta mais coerente possível","output":"Se você está perguntando sobre qual valor de \\"p\\" no Top-p sampling (nucleus sampling) gera as respostas mais coerentes, a resposta não é fixa e pode variar dependendo do modelo de linguagem e do contexto específico. O valor de \\"p\\" é um hiperparâmetro que pode ser ajustado para equilibrar a diversidade e a coerência das respostas geradas pelo modelo. Um valor de \\"p\\" mais alto permite que mais palavras sejam consideradas, o que pode aumentar a diversidade, mas também pode levar a respostas menos coerentes. Por outro lado, um valor de \\"p\\" mais baixo restringe as escolhas a um conjunto menor de palavras mais prováveis, o que geralmente resulta em respostas mais coerentes, mas pode tornar o texto menos variado e mais previsível. Em muitos casos, um valor de \\"p\\" em torno de 0.9 é um bom ponto de partida, mas os desenvolvedores podem experimentar com diferentes valores para encontrar o equilíbrio ideal para a aplicação específica. Ajustar o valor de \\"p\\" é um processo iterativo e pode depender de testes e feedback para otimizar a qualidade do texto gerado."},{"instruction":"Ea temperatura no GPT-é o que? Seja mais simples","output":"A \\"temperatura\\" em modelos de linguagem como o GPT é um parâmetro que ajuda a controlar a criatividade e a previsibilidade das respostas geradas pelo modelo. Imagine que você está ajustando a temperatura em um chuveiro: uma temperatura mais alta significa água mais quente e uma experiência mais intensa, enquanto uma temperatura mais baixa significa água mais fria e uma experiência mais suave. No contexto do GPT: - Uma temperatura **baixa** (próxima de 0) faz com que o modelo seja mais \\"cauteloso\\" e escolha palavras que são muito prováveis e seguras, tornando o texto mais previsível e menos variado. - Uma temperatura **alta** (maior que 1) faz com que o modelo seja mais \\"ousado\\" e escolha palavras menos prováveis, o que pode tornar o texto mais surpreendente, criativo e diversificado, mas também pode levar a resultados que fazem menos sentido. Ajustar a temperatura permite encontrar o equilíbrio entre a geração de texto que é muito comum e chato e texto que é muito estranho ou confuso.

Esta habilidade é central para a trama de \\"Attack on Titan\\" (\\"Shingeki no Kyojin\\"), o mangá e anime criado por Hajime Isayama. No universo de \\"Attack on Titan\\", os portadores do Titã de Ataque podem receber memórias de seus sucessores, além de seus predecessores. Isso significa que o futuro pode influenciar o passado até certo ponto. Eren usa essa habilidade para influenciar as ações de seu pai no passado. A manipulação ocorre da seguinte forma: 1. **Conexão através do Titã de Ataque**: Eren, como o atual portador do Titã de Ataque, consegue se conectar com Grisha, que foi o portador antes dele. 2. **Mostrando Memórias Seletivas**: Eren mostra a Grisha apenas as memórias que ele acredita serem necessárias para convencer Grisha a seguir um determinado caminho. Ele não revela tudo, apenas o suficiente para influenciar as decisões de Grisha. 3. **O Momento Crucial no Porão**: Eren influencia Grisha a roubar o poder do Titã Fundador de Frieda Reiss e a matar a família Reiss, exceto Rod Reiss. Eren convence Grisha de que essas ações são necessárias para garantir a liberdade dos eldianos e o futuro que Eren deseja. 4. **A Relutância de Grisha**: Grisha inicialmente hesita em seguir as instruções de Eren, especialmente quando se trata de matar crianças inocentes. No entanto, as visões e a pressão de Eren acabam por convencê-lo a cometer esses atos. 5. **Passando o Titã de Ataque e o Titã Fundador**: Após adquirir o poder do Titã Fundador, Grisha passa tanto o Titã de Ataque quanto o Titã Fundador para Eren, garantindo que os eventos que Eren viu e deseja que aconteçam possam se desdobrar. A habilidade de Eren de manipular Grisha é um ponto de virada na história, pois revela a complexidade do poder do Titã de Ataque e a natureza cíclica do tempo dentro da narrativa de \\"Attack on Titan\\". Isso também levanta questões sobre o livre-arbítrio e o destino, já que as ações de Grisha são fortemente influenciadas pelo conhecimento do futuro que Eren lhe proporciona."},{"instruction":"How can data scientist convince managers to prioritize data security","output":"To convince managers to prioritize data security, data scientists can employ the following strategies: 1.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained traction as a promising alternative to traditional IDS approaches due to their inherent advantages in speed, energy efficiency, and the ability to handle temporal information. However, designing SNN-based IDS that simultaneously achieve high accuracy and efficiency remains a challenging task. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review of techniques for optimizing the accuracy-efficiency trade-off in SNN-based IDS. Researchers categorize these techniques into three main approaches: network architecture optimization, learning algorithm optimization, and data preprocessing and feature engineering. Researchers discuss the key findings from the literature and identify challenges and future directions for research in this area.","output":"Title: Enhancing Intrusion Detection Systems Using Spiking Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Review of Optimization Strategies for Accuracy and Efficiency Abstract: Within the realm of cybersecurity, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are vital for protecting network infrastructures from a wide array of threats and malicious activities. With cyber-attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated, there is a pressing need for more advanced IDS solutions that can handle complex patterns and react in real-time. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), a type of artificial neural network that closely mirrors the functionality of the human brain, have emerged as a powerful tool in this regard. SNNs are particularly well suited for time-dependent data processing, offering numerous benefits such as speed and energy efficiency. Nonetheless, the development of SNN-based IDSs that achieve a balance between high detection accuracy and computational efficiency presents a significant research challenge. This paper conducts an exhaustive review of the literature, examining various techniques employed to optimize the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in SNN-based IDSs. Three principal avenues of optimization have been identified: optimizing the network architecture, refining learning algorithms, and advancing data preprocessing and feature engineering methods. Through this analysis, we provide in-depth insights into the methodologies that have been explored, the breakthroughs achieved, and the hurdles that persist. Furthermore, we delineate open-ended questions and propose potential pathways for future research to innovate on the effectiveness of SNN-based IDS. 1. Introduction: The indispensable nature of internet connectivity in today's world also brings with it the risk of unauthorized access and malicious intrusions. To defend against such threats, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) were conceived as mechanisms to monitor network traffic and identify potential security breaches. This paper introduces Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as a novel computational model for improving IDS capabilities. As the third generation of neural network models, SNNs promise to improve upon their predecessors by exploiting temporal dynamics, leading to faster and more energy-efficient processing. However, to leverage the distinctive attributes of SNNs, significant research effort is required to optimize their performance in the context of IDSs. This paper provides a detailed literature review of existing research efforts aimed at enhancing SNN-based IDSs by optimizing the trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. 2. Background and Motivation: This section delves deeper into the theoretical underpinnings of IDSs and SNNs. It starts by providing a brief history of IDS development and the evolution of neural network models leading up to the advent of SNNs. Additionally, it discusses the intrinsic advantages and current limitations of SNNs in the detection of network intrusions. 3. Network Architecture Optimization: Here, we elaborate on research exploring various SNN topologies and their impacts on detection accuracy and performance speed. This includes studies that experiment with different neuron models, connectivity patterns, and layer structures. The goal is to find architectures that can process large-scale network data in real time while maintaining high detection rates. 4. Learning Algorithm Optimization: The learning algorithms used to train SNNs significantly influence their ability to generalize from training data and detect novel attack types. This section reviews the latest advancements in SNN learning rules, such as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), reward-modulated STDP, and supervised learning strategies tailored to SNNs. We critically analyze how these algorithms are being optimized to improve the trade-off between learning precision and computational demands. 5. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Data preprocessing and feature selection play critical roles in the performance of IDSs. This section provides insights into the techniques used to preprocess time-series data for SNNs, the criteria for selecting relevant features, and the impact of these choices on the efficiency and accuracy of intrusion detection. 6. Key Findings and Analysis: In this distillation of the literature review, we summarize the most significant findings that contribute to optimizing SNN-based IDSs. We also critically assess the methodologies that appear to offer the most promising results, and highlight the interplay between the aforementioned optimization strategies. 7. Challenges and Future Directions: Despite the progress made, there are still numerous challenges facing SNN-based IDSs. This paper outlines these issues, which include scalability, real-time adaptability, and addressing the complex nature of cyber threats. We also identify promising areas for future research, such as the integration of domain knowledge into SNN training and the exploration of hybrid models that incorporate the strengths of both SNNs and traditional neural networks. 8. Conclusion: The concluding remarks encapsulate the overall understanding gained from the literature review, reaffirming the potential of SNNs in revolutionizing IDS.

Despite the longstanding political and military tensions between Lebanon and Israel, Israel did offer humanitarian aid to Lebanon. Shortly after the explosion, then-Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi announced that Israel had approached Lebanon through international defense and diplomatic channels to offer the Lebanese government medical and humanitarian assistance. However, due to the political situation and the two countries being officially at war, Lebanon did not accept direct assistance from Israel. Nonetheless, some reports suggested that Israeli aid may have still reached Lebanon indirectly through UN agencies and other international intermediaries that were involved in the relief efforts. Israeli hospitals also reportedly offered to treat victims of the explosion, and several Israeli non-governmental organizations mobilized to provide aid to the people affected in Beirut."},{"instruction":"Meaning of \\"משיחיסטישע\\"","output":"The term you're referring to, \\"משיחיסטישע\\" (Meshichistishe), is a Yiddish word that comes from the Hebrew word \\"משיח\\" (Mashiach) meaning \\"Messiah.\\" The term \\"משיחיסט\\" (Meshichist) refers to someone who is a follower or adherent of a Messianic ideology, particularly within the context of Judaism. The suffix \\"-ishe\\" in Yiddish typically denotes an adjective form, so \\"משיחיסטישע\\" could be interpreted as \\"Messianic\\" or \\"pertaining to the followers of a Messiah.\\" In a specific context, the term is often used to describe a segment within the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic movement that holds the belief that their late Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, is the Messiah (even after his death in 1994) and that he will eventually return to complete his Messianic mission. Those who hold this belief are sometimes called \\"Meshichists\\" (the English equivalent), and their philosophy or practices could be described as \\"Meshichistishe\\" (Messianic in nature). It's worth noting that within Chabad, there is a range of beliefs regarding the Messianic status of the Rebbe, and the Meshichist view is but one of many, with others within the movement not adhering to the idea that the Rebbe is the actual Messiah."},{"instruction":"equivalent of Amazon in Israel","output":"The equivalent of Amazon in Israel can be a bit complex, as the market is segmented and no one company holds the same nationwide dominance as Amazon does in many other countries.

This move by Amazon has improved the selection and convenience for Israeli consumers, though international shipping fees and regional availability can still be obstacles. These platforms and companies are part of Israel's evolving e-commerce landscape, which continues to grow and become more competitive."},{"instruction":"what was the biggest terror attack in Europe ?","output":"One of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Europe occurred in Madrid, Spain, on March 11, 2004, known as the \\"11M\\" (11 de Marzo) attacks. This event involved the coordinated bombing of commuter trains and resulted in the deaths of 193 people, with approximately 2,000 more injured. The attack was carried out by an Islamist terrorist cell with links to al-Qaeda. Another significant and deadly terrorist attack in Europe was the November 13, 2015, attacks in Paris, France. A series of coordinated attacks that evening by the Islamic State (ISIS) in various locations across the city, including the Bataclan theatre, Stade de France, and several restaurants and bars, led to the deaths of 130 people and hundreds more were injured. Both of these attacks stand as grim reminders of the threat of terrorism in Europe and the tragic consequences these acts of violence have on societies."},{"instruction":"What's the meaning of the Hebrew word \\"Geula\\"?","output":"The Hebrew word \\"Geula\\" (גְּאֻלָּה) means \\"redemption\\" or \\"deliverance.\\" It originates from the root word \\"גאל\\" (ga'al), which implies a process of being released from bondage, slavery, or oppression. In a Jewish religious context, \\"Geula\\" is often used to refer to the concept of spiritual and national redemption, as anticipated in Jewish eschatology. For example, in traditional Jewish belief, \\"Geula\\" might refer to: - **Personal Redemption:** Liberation from personal struggles, challenges, or sins. - **National Redemption:** The return of the Jewish people to their homeland and the restoration of national sovereignty, as historically realized in part by the establishment of the State of Israel. However, for many, this also includes the expectation of a future, more complete form of redemption associated with the coming of the Messiah. - **Final Redemption:** The eschatological vision of a future where there's worldwide peace and divine perfection, often associated with the coming of the Jewish Messiah (Mashiach) and the subsequent transformation of society. This involves the resurrection of the dead (Techiyat HaMeitim), the building of the Third Temple in Jerusalem, and a universal recognition of the Hebrew God. The concept of \\"Geula\\" carries significant spiritual and emotional resonance in Jewish prayers, rituals, and literature, reflecting a deep yearning for freedom, peace, and divine closeness."},{"instruction":"Translate your answer in Hebrew","output":"מילת העברית \\"גאולה\\" משמעותה \\"פדות\\" או \\"שחרור\\". המילה מקורה בשורש \\"גאל\\", המרמז על תהליך של שיחרור מעבדות, שעבוד או לחץ. בהקשר דתי יהודי, \\"גאולה\\" לעיתים קרובות מתייחסת למושג הגאולה הרוחנית ולאומית, כפי שהיא נחזית באסכטולוגיה היהודית. לדוגמא, באמונה יהודית מסורתית, \\"גאולה\\" עשויה להתייחס ל: - **גאולה אישית:** שחרור ממאבקים אישיים, אתגרים או חטאים. - **גאולה לאומית:** שיבת עם ישראל למולדתו ושחזור ריבונותו הלאומית, כפי שהתממשה באופן חלקי בהקמת מדינת ישראל. אך לכולם, זה כולל גם את הציפייה לגאולה עתידית ויותר מלאה הקשורה בבוא המשיח. - **גאולה סופית:** החזון האסכטולוגי לעתיד שבו יש שלום עולמי ושלמות אלוהית, לעיתים קרובות קשור לבואו של משיח יהודי (משיח) ולהמרה הבאה של החברה. זה כולל תחיית המתים (תחיית המתים), בניית בית המקדש השלישי בירושלים והכרה אוניברסלית באלוהים העברי. מושג ה\\"גאולה\\" נושא עימו משמעות רוחנית ורגשית עזה בתפילות יהודיות, טקסים וספרות, המשקפת כמיהה עמוקה לחירות, שלום וקירבה אלוהית."},{"instruction":"translate in Hebrew \\"What’s the meaning of the Hebrew word “Geula”?\\"","output":"מה המשמעות של המילה העברית \\"גאולה\\"?"},{"instruction":"What does \\"fungible\\" mean?","output":"\\"Fungible\\" is a term often used in economics and law to refer to goods, assets, or properties that are interchangeable and indistinguishable from each other in terms of their value or characteristics. When something is fungible, individual units of that commodity or asset can be substituted for one another without any loss of value or utility. For example: 1. Money is a fungible asset because one 10 bill can be exchanged for another, or for two 5 bills, and it will have the same value. 2. Commodities like crude oil, wheat, or gold are fungible because one unit is considered equivalent to another unit of the same grade and quantity. 3. Company shares of the same class are fungible because one share is typically considered equivalent in value and rights to another share of the same class. Non-fungible items would be those that are unique and cannot be replaced by another identical item. For example, a painting or a rare collectible is not fungible because it cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis with another painting or collectible. Non-fungibility is a key concept in the current digital asset space, particularly with the rise of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), which represent ownership of unique digital items or artwork on the blockchain."},{"instruction":"You are part of a team of bots that creates images .

This mode of living can manifest in various forms, ranging from rural homesteading, where individuals or families maintain a self-sustaining farmstead, to urban self-sufficiency, which involves creating energy-producing and waste-reducing systems within a city environment. The concept is rooted in a desire for independence, sustainability, and a closer connection to the natural environment. Historically, off-grid living was not a choice but a necessity. In the absence of modern infrastructure, our ancestors lived in a manner that would now be considered off-grid, utilizing the resources available in their immediate surroundings. However, with the advent of the industrial revolution and the subsequent development of extensive public utility networks, the majority of the global population shifted towards a grid-dependent existence. In contemporary society, the resurgence of off-grid living is often driven by concerns over environmental impact, a rising interest in self-reliance, and a quest for simplicity in contrast to the complexities of modern life. This lifestyle has evolved with the times, now often incorporating advanced technology such as solar panels, wind turbines, and sophisticated water purification systems, allowing for a harmonious blend of traditional practices and modern conveniences. The decision to adopt an off-grid lifestyle is often born from a multifaceted set of motivations, encompassing environmental, personal, and economic factors. At the heart of the environmental impetus is environmentalism, a profound respect for nature that compels individuals to minimize their carbon footprint and live sustainably. This eco-conscious approach is rooted in the acknowledgment of the finite nature of Earth's resources and the detrimental impact of conventional living on the planet's ecosystems. By opting out of the traditional energy grid and harnessing renewable sources such as solar, wind, or hydro power, off-gridders actively reduce reliance on fossil fuels and contribute to the mitigation of climate change. This lifestyle choice is also a statement against the widespread environmental degradation caused by mass consumption and industrialization, signaling a commitment to preserving the natural world for future generations. Independence is another compelling factor in the pursuit of an off-grid life. This autonomy is not merely about self-sufficiency in terms of energy production but extends to a broader sense of control over one's living conditions and a rejection of the dependency on societal systems that are often seen as restrictive or unreliable. The ability to generate one's own power, grow food, and manage waste translates into a liberating sense of resilience and empowerment. This independence can also manifest in a philosophical longing for freedom from societal norms and pressures, where off-grid living offers a canvas for self-expression and a life dictated by one's own values and rhythms. Financial considerations also play a significant role. The initial investment in off-grid technologies and infrastructure can be substantial, but the long-term financial freedom it offers is a powerful motivator. Without monthly utility bills and the costs associated with conventional consumer lifestyles, individuals find that living off-grid can lead to significant savings and a life less tethered to economic fluctuations. This financial liberation is often accompanied by a simplified lifestyle that eschews materialism in favor of experiences and relationships, aligning spending with personal values rather than societal expectations. Lastly, the pursuit of a simpler, more purposeful way of life drives many to the off-grid path. In the face of a fast-paced, technology-driven society, simple living offers a return to basics, where the complexities of modern existence are traded for the simplicity of self-reliance and a closer connection to nature. The reduction of life's clutter—both physical and mental—enables a focus on the essentials, fostering a deep sense of fulfillment and well-being. This minimalist approach is not just about having fewer possessions, but about crafting a life filled with meaning, where each action and choice is deliberate and reflective of one's deepest values. In summary, the motivations behind choosing an off-grid lifestyle are as diverse as they are profound. From a deep-seated environmentalism to the allure of independence and financial freedom, to the philosophical and practical yearnings for a simpler existence, these factors coalesce into a powerful narrative of transformation. This narrative is not just about living differently, but about a holistic reimagining of what it means to live well. Off-grid living, a lifestyle choice gaining traction among those concerned with environmental sustainability and conservation, stands as a testament to the possibility of a reduced carbon footprint and a more ecologically harmonious existence. This approach to life entails the utilization of self-sustaining systems that do not rely on public utilities for resources such as electricity, water, and waste management. By embracing off-grid living, individuals actively participate in lessening the strain on our planet's resources, contributing to conservation efforts in a multitude of ways. The ecological impact of living off-grid is multifaceted. Primarily, it involves a significant reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels, as off-grid homes often rely on renewable energy sources like solar, wind, or hydroelectric power. The transition from conventional energy to renewable sources is crucial in the fight against climate change, as it leads to a substantial decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. According to a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), doubling the share of renewables in the global energy mix by 2030 could result in a 40% reduction in global carbon emissions. Off-grid living not only aligns with this goal but also serves as a practical demonstration of its viability. Moreover, off-grid living encourages the conservation of water through the use of rainwater harvesting systems and the treatment and reuse of greywater. By managing water resources more efficiently and reducing reliance on municipal water supplies, off-grid residents minimize their water footprint. Research indicates that rainwater harvesting can lead to a reduction of up to 40% in the demand for potable water in residential settings, thereby preserving freshwater ecosystems and reducing the energy required for water treatment and distribution. Beyond energy and water, off-grid living often incorporates sustainable waste management practices, such as composting toilets and waste reduction strategies, which further diminish the environmental impact. These methods not only reduce pollution and the release of methane from landfills but also yield nutrient-rich compost that can be used to enrich the soil, promoting a cycle of regeneration rather than depletion. The sustainability benefits of off-grid living also extend to the preservation of natural habitats. By reducing the need for new infrastructure and the associated land disturbance, off-grid communities help to maintain biodiversity and protect ecosystems from the encroachment of development. Furthermore, the design and construction of off-grid homes frequently employ green building techniques and materials, which have a lower environmental impact compared to conventional construction methods. In conclusion, the adoption of off-grid living is a powerful embodiment of sustainable practices, offering a blueprint for reducing our carbon footprint and fostering conservation. It is a lifestyle that not only mitigates adverse ecological impacts but also promotes a resilient and self-sufficient relationship with the environment. As individuals and communities increasingly recognize the urgency of addressing climate change and environmental degradation, off-grid living stands out as a proactive and tangible step toward a more sustainable future. Living off-grid, while offering a sense of independence and a sustainable lifestyle, comes with a unique set of challenges that can be daunting even to the most resolute individuals. One of the primary hurdles is navigating the legal challenges that can vary significantly from region to region. Zoning laws, building codes, and land-use regulations can be restrictive and often do not account for off-grid living scenarios. For instance, in some areas, it is illegal to disconnect from the power grid entirely, while others may have stringent requirements on waste disposal and water usage. These legal constraints require thorough research and, in some cases, creative solutions to comply with the law while maintaining an off-grid existence. Moreover, the initial investment required to transition to an off-grid lifestyle is substantial. The cost of setting up renewable energy systems, such as solar panels or wind turbines, can be high, and the technology may require significant upfront capital. Additionally, there are expenses related to securing a suitable piece of land, building a dwelling that meets both personal needs and legal standards, and purchasing equipment for water collection, waste management, and food cultivation. It's a common misconception that living off-grid is a way to avoid expenses; in reality, the initial outlay can be quite steep, although it may pay off in the long run with reduced living costs. Social adaptation is another considerable challenge for those who choose to live off-grid. This lifestyle can lead to isolation, as off-grid homes are often situated in remote areas to gain access to unspoiled natural resources and to escape the constraints of urban living. The distance from traditional communities can strain relationships with friends and family and can make it difficult to access services like healthcare and education. Moreover, there is often a need to develop new skills in self-sufficiency, such as carpentry, agriculture, and mechanical repairs, which can be overwhelming without proper guidance or experience. The off-grid journey is not a simple path but rather a complex one, fraught with obstacles that require dedication, resilience, and a proactive approach to problem-solving. It is a lifestyle marked by a steep learning curve, and the initial phase is particularly testing as one learns to balance legal compliance with self-sufficiency, manage significant financial investments, and adapt to a new social environment.

This mode of living can manifest in various forms, ranging from rural homesteading, where individuals or families maintain a self-sustaining farmstead, to urban self-sufficiency, which involves creating energy-producing and waste-reducing systems within a city environment. The concept is rooted in a desire for independence, sustainability, and a closer connection to the natural environment. Historically, off-grid living was not a choice but a necessity. In the absence of modern infrastructure, our ancestors lived in a manner that would now be considered off-grid, utilizing the resources available in their immediate surroundings. However, with the advent of the industrial revolution and the subsequent development of extensive public utility networks, the majority of the global population shifted towards a grid-dependent existence. In contemporary society, the resurgence of off-grid living is often driven by concerns over environmental impact, a rising interest in self-reliance, and a quest for simplicity in contrast to the complexities of modern life. This lifestyle has evolved with the times, now often incorporating advanced technology such as solar panels, wind turbines, and sophisticated water purification systems, allowing for a harmonious blend of traditional practices and modern conveniences. The decision to adopt an off-grid lifestyle is often born from a multifaceted set of motivations, encompassing environmental, personal, and economic factors. At the heart of the environmental impetus is environmentalism, a profound respect for nature that compels individuals to minimize their carbon footprint and live sustainably. This eco-conscious approach is rooted in the acknowledgment of the finite nature of Earth's resources and the detrimental impact of conventional living on the planet's ecosystems. By opting out of the traditional energy grid and harnessing renewable sources such as solar, wind, or hydro power, off-gridders actively reduce reliance on fossil fuels and contribute to the mitigation of climate change. This lifestyle choice is also a statement against the widespread environmental degradation caused by mass consumption and industrialization, signaling a commitment to preserving the natural world for future generations. Independence is another compelling factor in the pursuit of an off-grid life. This autonomy is not merely about self-sufficiency in terms of energy production but extends to a broader sense of control over one's living conditions and a rejection of the dependency on societal systems that are often seen as restrictive or unreliable. The ability to generate one's own power, grow food, and manage waste translates into a liberating sense of resilience and empowerment. This independence can also manifest in a philosophical longing for freedom from societal norms and pressures, where off-grid living offers a canvas for self-expression and a life dictated by one's own values and rhythms. Financial considerations also play a significant role. The initial investment in off-grid technologies and infrastructure can be substantial, but the long-term financial freedom it offers is a powerful motivator. Without monthly utility bills and the costs associated with conventional consumer lifestyles, individuals find that living off-grid can lead to significant savings and a life less tethered to economic fluctuations. This financial liberation is often accompanied by a simplified lifestyle that eschews materialism in favor of experiences and relationships, aligning spending with personal values rather than societal expectations. Lastly, the pursuit of a simpler, more purposeful way of life drives many to the off-grid path. In the face of a fast-paced, technology-driven society, simple living offers a return to basics, where the complexities of modern existence are traded for the simplicity of self-reliance and a closer connection to nature. The reduction of life's clutter—both physical and mental—enables a focus on the essentials, fostering a deep sense of fulfillment and well-being. This minimalist approach is not just about having fewer possessions, but about crafting a life filled with meaning, where each action and choice is deliberate and reflective of one's deepest values. In summary, the motivations behind choosing an off-grid lifestyle are as diverse as they are profound. From a deep-seated environmentalism to the allure of independence and financial freedom, to the philosophical and practical yearnings for a simpler existence, these factors coalesce into a powerful narrative of transformation. This narrative is not just about living differently, but about a holistic reimagining of what it means to live well. Off-grid living, a lifestyle choice gaining traction among those concerned with environmental sustainability and conservation, stands as a testament to the possibility of a reduced carbon footprint and a more ecologically harmonious existence. This approach to life entails the utilization of self-sustaining systems that do not rely on public utilities for resources such as electricity, water, and waste management. By embracing off-grid living, individuals actively participate in lessening the strain on our planet's resources, contributing to conservation efforts in a multitude of ways. The ecological impact of living off-grid is multifaceted. Primarily, it involves a significant reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels, as off-grid homes often rely on renewable energy sources like solar, wind, or hydroelectric power. The transition from conventional energy to renewable sources is crucial in the fight against climate change, as it leads to a substantial decrease in greenhouse gas emissions. According to a report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), doubling the share of renewables in the global energy mix by 2030 could result in a 40% reduction in global carbon emissions. Off-grid living not only aligns with this goal but also serves as a practical demonstration of its viability. Moreover, off-grid living encourages the conservation of water through the use of rainwater harvesting systems and the treatment and reuse of greywater. By managing water resources more efficiently and reducing reliance on municipal water supplies, off-grid residents minimize their water footprint. Research indicates that rainwater harvesting can lead to a reduction of up to 40% in the demand for potable water in residential settings, thereby preserving freshwater ecosystems and reducing the energy required for water treatment and distribution. Beyond energy and water, off-grid living often incorporates sustainable waste management practices, such as composting toilets and waste reduction strategies, which further diminish the environmental impact. These methods not only reduce pollution and the release of methane from landfills but also yield nutrient-rich compost that can be used to enrich the soil, promoting a cycle of regeneration rather than depletion. The sustainability benefits of off-grid living also extend to the preservation of natural habitats. By reducing the need for new infrastructure and the associated land disturbance, off-grid communities help to maintain biodiversity and protect ecosystems from the encroachment of development. Furthermore, the design and construction of off-grid homes frequently employ green building techniques and materials, which have a lower environmental impact compared to conventional construction methods. In conclusion, the adoption of off-grid living is a powerful embodiment of sustainable practices, offering a blueprint for reducing our carbon footprint and fostering conservation. It is a lifestyle that not only mitigates adverse ecological impacts but also promotes a resilient and self-sufficient relationship with the environment. As individuals and communities increasingly recognize the urgency of addressing climate change and environmental degradation, off-grid living stands out as a proactive and tangible step toward a more sustainable future. Living off-grid, while offering a sense of independence and a sustainable lifestyle, comes with a unique set of challenges that can be daunting even to the most resolute individuals. One of the primary hurdles is navigating the legal challenges that can vary significantly from region to region. Zoning laws, building codes, and land-use regulations can be restrictive and often do not account for off-grid living scenarios. For instance, in some areas, it is illegal to disconnect from the power grid entirely, while others may have stringent requirements on waste disposal and water usage. These legal constraints require thorough research and, in some cases, creative solutions to comply with the law while maintaining an off-grid existence. Moreover, the initial investment required to transition to an off-grid lifestyle is substantial. The cost of setting up renewable energy systems, such as solar panels or wind turbines, can be high, and the technology may require significant upfront capital. Additionally, there are expenses related to securing a suitable piece of land, building a dwelling that meets both personal needs and legal standards, and purchasing equipment for water collection, waste management, and food cultivation. It's a common misconception that living off-grid is a way to avoid expenses; in reality, the initial outlay can be quite steep, although it may pay off in the long run with reduced living costs. Social adaptation is another considerable challenge for those who choose to live off-grid. This lifestyle can lead to isolation, as off-grid homes are often situated in remote areas to gain access to unspoiled natural resources and to escape the constraints of urban living. The distance from traditional communities can strain relationships with friends and family and can make it difficult to access services like healthcare and education. Moreover, there is often a need to develop new skills in self-sufficiency, such as carpentry, agriculture, and mechanical repairs, which can be overwhelming without proper guidance or experience. The off-grid journey is not a simple path but rather a complex one, fraught with obstacles that require dedication, resilience, and a proactive approach to problem-solving. It is a lifestyle marked by a steep learning curve, and the initial phase is particularly testing as one learns to balance legal compliance with self-sufficiency, manage significant financial investments, and adapt to a new social environment.

Like when I need to change some text, it will maybe fade between old and new values? FreeType2","output":"To achieve smooth text updates in OBS (Open Broadcaster Software), you can utilize the FreeType2 library for rendering the text and then apply fade transitions between the old and new values. Here's a step-by-step guide: 1. Install FreeType2: Go to the FreeType2 website (https://www.freetype.org/) and download the library for your respective platform. Follow their installation instructions to set it up on your computer. 2. Setup text source in OBS: Open OBS and add a \\"Text\\" source to your scene. Enter the initial text value or any placeholder value you want to start with. 3. Use OBS scripting capabilities: OBS supports scripting with Lua. You'll need to write a script that updates the text source over time with smooth transitions. Follow these steps: a. Open OBS and navigate to \\"Scripts\\" in the \\"Tools\\" menu. b. Click the \\"+\\" button to add a new script and give it a suitable name. c. Double-click the newly created script to open the script editor. d. Write code that gradually updates the text value with a fading effect. 4. Sample Lua code: Here's an example of Lua code that can achieve smooth text transitions by fading between old and new values. This code assumes you are using OBS with the OBS Lua scripting plugin: \`\`\`lua -- Set initial text value local oldTextValue = \\"Old Value\\" local newTextValue = \\"New Value\\" local transitionTime = 2 -- Transition duration in seconds local fadeDuration = 1 -- Fade duration in seconds -- Retrieve the text source local source = obslua.obs_get_source_by_name(\\"Text Source Name\\") -- Delay function to start transition local function sleep(s) local ntime = os.time() + s repeat until os.time() > ntime end -- Calculate individual RGB channel values for fading local function fadeValue(start, target, progress) return start + ((target - start) * progress) end -- Update the text gradually with smooth transition function updateText() local startTime = os.time() while os.time() - startTime <= transitionTime do local progress = (os.time() - startTime) / fadeDuration local r = fadeValue(0, 255, progress) local g = fadeValue(0, 255, progress) local b = fadeValue(0, 255, progress) obslua.obs_source_set_text(source, newTextValue) obslua.obs_source_set_color(source, r, g, b, 255) sleep(0.05) -- Delay between updates end -- Set final value and color obslua.obs_source_set_text(source, newTextValue) obslua.obs_source_set_color(source, 255, 255, 255, 255) end -- Call the updateText function when the script is activated function script_load(settings) updateText() end \`\`\` Note: Make sure to replace \\"Text Source Name\\" with the actual name of your text source in OBS. 5. Save and apply the script: Save the Lua script in the OBS script editor, close the editor, and return to OBS. In the \\"Scripts\\" menu, select the script you just created and click on \\"Start\\" to activate the script. The text should now transition smoothly with a fade effect between the old and new values. By using FreeType2 and implementing scripts within OBS, you can have smooth text updates with fading transitions, enhancing the visual quality of your OBS scenes."},{"instruction":"If \\"Idol\\" were a class in D&D e5, what would its spells, feats and subclasses look like?","output":"Creating a brand new class for Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition (D&D 5e) requires balancing unique flavor with mechanics that fit into the existing game system. The term \\"Idol\\" suggests a character that gains power through worship, adoration, or performance, potentially blending elements of bards, clerics, and warlocks. Note that creating a full class is complex and requires extensive playtesting to balance, so provided here is a conceptual framework rather than a complete class. **Idol Class Overview:** An Idol draws strength from their admirers and is adept at charming and inspiring those around them. They can enchant audiences with their performances, turning the adoration they receive into magical effects. **Hit Points:** - Hit Dice: 1d8 per Idol level - Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + Constitution modifier - Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + Constitution modifier per Idol level after 1st **Proficiencies:** - Armor: Light armor - Weapons: Simple weapons - Tools: One type of musical instrument - Saving Throws: Charisma, Dexterity - Skills: Choose two from Deception, Insight, Performance, Persuasion, Acrobatics **Starting Equipment:** - (a) a rapier or (b) any simple weapon - (a) a diplomat’s pack or (b) an entertainer's pack - Leather armor and a musical instrument **Idol Class Features:** - **Adoration Points:** A pool of points that represent the adoration you've accumulated from your audience, allowing you to fuel various class features. You gain Adoration Points by performing and receiving cheers, applauses, or praises. - **Performance:** As an action, you can perform to charm beings around you, giving them minor benefits and making them more inclined to view you favorably. - **Inspirational Presence:** Your presence on the battlefield inspires your allies. At the start of each turn, you can give an ally a small bonus to their roll as a result of your encouraging performance. - **Captivating Charm:** You can attempt to charm a humanoid as per the 'Charm Person' spell, but through performance, a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum once) per long rest. **Idol Spellcasting:** - **Spell Slots:** The Idol uses the Bard's spell slot progression. - **Cantrips:** Known cantrips increase with level, starting with two basic cantrips like 'Friends' or 'Vicious Mockery'. - **Spell List:** Primarily enchantment and illusion spells with a focus on manipulating and charming others, along with some utility and healing spells representing the boon of their admirers' love and support. **Subclass Paths (These might be called Orders, Muses, or Paths):** **1. Path of the Divine Muse:** - Gains spells and features akin to a cleric's domain, linked to a deity of art, love, or beauty. - **Celestial Performance:** Gains access to radiant damage spells or healing spells inspired by divine charisma. **2. Path of the Enthralling Star:** - Specializes in crowd control and beguiling enemies through performance. - **Mesmerizing Show:** Can cast hypnotic pattern or similar spells; even those immune to charm effects might be susceptible to these performances. **3. Path of the Boundless Creativity:** - Focuses on creation and illusion, shaping reality to delight and awe their audience. - **Illusionary Spectacle:** Specializes in phantasmal force and major image to create extravagant illusions in and out of combat. **Feats:** - **Idol's Visage:** Increase your Charisma score by 1, up to a maximum of 20, and you can cast 'Disguise Self' once per long rest without expending a spell slot. - **Expertise in Performance:** Grants double proficiency bonus in the Performance skill and can enthrall an audience to potentially gain advantages on social interactions. **Level Ability Progression Example:** - Level 1: Performance, Adoration Points - Level 2: Spellcasting, Idol's Charm - Level 3: Inspirational Presence, Subclass features - Level 4: Ability Score Improvement, Idol Feat - Level 5: Enhanced Performance (additional audience effects) - ... These are just starting points for an \\"Idol\\" class, and further development would include specific abilities for each level, additional features unique to subclasses, and balancing the power and utility of the class with other classes. The Idol's role would be primarily supportive and control-based, providing buffs, debuffs, and combat versatility through performance and charisma."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The three subclasses focus on the upsizing of the Idol's features to increase their attractiveness and ability to capture their audience; Bust Idol, Belly Idol, and Butt Idol.","output":"Creating a fully fleshed-out homebrew class like \\"Idol\\" in D&D 5th edition (commonly abbreviated to 5e) would require extensive work to ensure the class is both balanced and thematically consistent with the D&D universe. Additionally, Dungeons & Dragons generally avoids explicit sexualization or body focus in its classes, instead focusing on broader archetypes like warriors, wizards, and rogues, with subclasses that reflect fantasy tropes and character specializations. However, for the purpose of a creative exercise to provide an example of how such a class might be structured within the boundaries of D&D 5e's design philosophy, here's an abstract concept of the Idol class, along with its three proposed subclasses: Bust Idol, Belly Idol, and Butt Idol. It's important to emphasize that this exercise will focus on the idea of charm and performance, rather than physical appearance, to keep it within the respectful and inclusive nature of the game. Please note this example is just a starting point and would need significant development and playtesting to be a viable addition to actual D&D 5e gameplay. **Idol Class Features:** - **Hit Points:** 1d8 (or 5 + CON modifier) per Idol level - **Primary Ability:** Charisma - **Saving Throws:** Charisma, Dexterity - **Skills:** Choose two from Performance, Persuasion, Acrobatics, Insight, Deception, and Intimidation - **Equipment:** A musical instrument of your choice, a costume appropriate to your performance style, and a pouch containing 15 gp **Level 1:** - **Center of Attention:** You can use a bonus action to captivate creatures that can see and hear you within 30 feet. Affected creatures must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you until the end of your next turn. - **Idol’s Charm:** Gain proficiency in Performance. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses Performance. **Level 2:** - **Stage Presence:** You can cast *enthrall* once per long rest without using a spell slot. - **Idol's Inspiration:** As a bonus action, grant an ally within 60 feet an Inspiration die (1d6). Can be used a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses after a long rest. **Level 3:** - **Subclass Choice:** Choose between Bust Idol, Belly Idol, and Butt Idol, each providing unique spells and abilities focused on different aspects of performance and charming abilities. **Level 4:** - **Ability Score Improvement** **Level 5:** - **Spotlight Stealer:** Once per short rest, you can perform a special action that requires the attention of all creatures within a 30-foot radius, potentially interrupting spellcasting or attacks aimed at your allies. **Subclass Features:** **Bust Idol:** - **Theme:** Focuses on powerful, direct performances that command attention and captivate audiences. - **Special Spells:** *Heroism*, *Crown of Madness*, *Compulsion*. - **Bust Out:** Use an action to enhance your command presence, forcing enemies to focus on you and potentially disadvantaging their attacks against others. **Belly Idol:** - **Theme:** Centered on enchanting dance and intricate movements that weave spells around the battlefield. - **Special Spells:** *Dancing Lights*, *Hypnotic Pattern*, *Mirage Arcane*. - **Spell Dance:** Your dance moves can be used to cast one spell with a casting time of one action as a bonus action. **Butt Idol:** - **Theme:** Specializes in captivating performances that mesmerize and confound foes. - **Special Spells:** *Tasha’s Hideous Laughter*, *Phantasmal Force*, *Otto's Irresistible Dance*. - **Shake It Off:** As an action, you shake off negative effects, granting yourself advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. **Feats for Idols:** 1. **Stage Veteran:** Increase your Charisma by 1, up to a maximum of 20. You gain advantage on Performance checks and saving throws against effects that would end your concentration on a spell you cast during a performance. 2. **Charming Aura:** You radiate a charming aura. As an action, you can exude an aura of charm to affect creatures of your choice within 10 feet. They must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be charmed by you for 1 minute. 3. **Graceful Performer:** When you make an ability check related to a performance, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the check. **Spells:** A list of spells for the Idol class would likely represent the themes of charm, illusion, and enchantment, such as *charm person*, *silent image*, *major image*, *hold person*, *calm emotions*, etc. This framework could be adjusted and expanded upon with a full spell list, detailed subclass abilities at specific levels, and potentially further abilities that allow for crowd control, support for allies, or debuffing of enemies—all flavored in a way that fits the concept of performance and enchantment without focusing on body image or physical attractiveness, which can be sensitive and complex issues in a gaming environment."},{"instruction":"hi","output":"Hello!

The huger they swell, the more famous the Idol becomes!","output":"Creating a full-fledged class for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition requires a deep understanding of the game mechanics, balance, and flavor. An \\"Idol\\" class with the proposed subclasses focusing on upsizing features and attractiveness to captivate audiences might be intentionally humorous or flirt with body morphism, which could be sensitive to handle. Nevertheless, let's outline an imaginative and light-hearted approach to such a class concept while trying to keep it within the gameplay and thematic guidelines of D&D. **Idol Class Features:** - **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per Idol level - **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier - **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per Idol level after 1st - **Proficiencies:** - **Armor:** Light armor - **Weapons:** Simple weapons - **Tools:** Disguise kit, musical instrument - **Saving Throws:** Charisma, Dexterity - **Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Deception, Insight, Performance, Persuasion, and Sleight of Hand **Idol Spells:** These could include enchantment and illusion spells that reflect an Idol's ability to influence and captivate audiences. - **Cantrips:** Friends, Mage Hand, Minor Illusion, Vicious Mockery - **1st-level:** Charm Person, Disguise Self, Tasha's Hideous Laughter, Feather Fall (representing graceful movements) - **2nd-level:** Enthrall, Hold Person, Mirror Image, Suggestion - **Higher Levels:** Hypnotic Pattern, Greater Invisibility, Compulsion, Otto's Irresistible Dance **Feats:** - **Charismatic Projection:** Increases your Charisma score and your charm spell DCs. - **Stage Presence:** Provides advantage on Performance checks and can affect a larger audience. - **Heartthrob:** Once per short rest, you can distract or disarm a creature with a flourish or wink. **Idol Subclasses:** Each subclass would focus on a different aspect of the Idol, with magical ability manifesting in the Idol's physical appearance and stage talents. **Bust Idol** – Charms and wizards with their striking figure. Could have: - **Bewitching Gaze:** At 3rd level, can impose disadvantage on an attack from a charmed creature once per short or long rest. - **Enchanting Aura:** At 6th level, those within a certain radius gain benefits like temporary HP or a saving throw bonus due to your inspiring presence. **Belly Idol** – Enthralls audiences with their hearty and powerful presence. Might have: - **Boundless Energy:** At 3rd level, can use an action to energize allies, giving them a temporary burst of speed or an extra reaction. - **Iron-Willed Performance:** At 6th level, resistant to fear and similar conditions, and can extend this resistance to others through powerful performances. **Butt Idol** – Mesmerizes the crowd with their captivating movements. Could have: - **Hypnotic Twist:** At 3rd level, can use a bonus action to force enemies to make a Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. - **Thunderous Applause:** At 6th level, your performance can be heard from afar, causing tremors or thunderclaps that can frighten or knock down foes. Of course, each subclass would advance further, gaining more potent and thematic abilities at higher levels. The concept would need to be handled with care to respect all players at the table and the diversity of body types. Any such class would have to be playtested rigorously to ensure it is balanced and adds to the enjoyment of the game without reinforcing stereotypes or being offensive."},{"instruction":"You are part of a team of bots that creates images .

It was popular among retro gamers for its ability to play games from both systems in one console. Here are the top 10 misconceptions about the FC Twin console: 1. **Same Quality as Original Consoles**: One common misconception is that the FC Twin has the same build quality and hardware capabilities as the original NES and SNES consoles. The quality actually varies, with some users reporting compatibility issues and lower build quality. 2. **100% Game Compatibility**: Another misconception is that the FC Twin can play every NES and SNES game. In reality, there is a subset of games, particularly those with special chips like the Super FX chip, that are not compatible with the FC Twin. 3. **Official Nintendo Product**: Some people might mistakenly believe that the FC Twin is an official Nintendo product, while it is actually an unlicensed clone system produced by a separate company. 4. **Exact Gameplay Experience**: Some users expect the FC Twin to deliver an identical gameplay experience to the original consoles. However, differences in sound and video output can be evident. 5. **Supports All Accessories**: There's a belief that all NES and SNES accessories will work with the FC Twin, but some original accessories, especially those that rely on specific hardware features, may not function properly. 6. **Superior to Other Clone Consoles**: The misconception that the FC Twin is superior to all other clone consoles might not hold true for every aspect as there are many clone consoles, each with different strengths and weaknesses. 7. **Legal Concerns Are Absent**: Using clone consoles has a gray legal area; although buying and selling them is typically legal, they are not licensed or endorsed by the original console manufacturers. 8. **Uses the Same Hardware**: The FC Twin uses emulation to play games, which is different from the original hardware in the NES and SNES consoles. This can lead to slight variations in performance. 9. **Perfect for Collectors**: While some collectors enjoy using clones like the FC Twin to play their games, others prefer the authenticity of the original hardware, even if it's less convenient. 10. **Equally Durable as Original Consoles**: The durability of the FC Twin may not match that of the original NES and SNES consoles, which were known for their longevity and robust design. It's important to research and read reviews when considering purchasing a clone console like the FC Twin to set your expectations accordingly and understand its limitations compared to the original systems."},{"instruction":"You are part of a team of bots that creates images .

Explicit content typically includes descriptions, images, or depictions that are not suitable for all audiences, especially children, and may be offensive or inappropriate for certain people due to its nature. In the context of image creation and descriptions, explicit content can include nudity, sexual acts, excessive violence, gore, or other adult themes that are not considered suitable for a general audience.

In providing image descriptions, we aim to focus on themes and elements that are universally acceptable, avoiding any potential misinterpretation or discomfort for the audience. If you have another request for a descriptive caption, please feel free to provide a new prompt, and I'll be happy to assist you within the content guidelines."},{"instruction":"You should have record of what was in the prompt, it shouldn't be that obscure","output":"You are correct; upon reviewing the initial prompt, it contained terminology that could be construed as explicit or suggestive of adult content.

The Emancipation Proclamation, issued by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863, declared that all slaves in Confederate-held territory were to be set free. This marked a significant step towards the abolition of slavery in the United States. However, it is important to note that the African American population continued to face enormous challenges to secure and exercise their freedom even after the Civil War. They confronted systemic oppression, racial discrimination, segregation, and economic disadvantages. The gradual dismantling of discriminatory laws and the civil rights movement in the 20th century further contributed to expanding the benefits of independence and freedom to African Americans. Therefore, the beneficiaries of independence and freedom differed between 1776 and after the Civil War/Emancipation Proclamation. In 1776, it was the American colonies seeking independence from British rule, whereas after the Civil War, it was primarily African Americans who gained their freedom and fought for equal rights and recognition as American citizens."},{"instruction":"Do you think we have lived up to the message in the Gettysburg Address as a nation? Why or why not? Cite one example from US History to support your claim.","output":"As an AI language model, I don't possess personal opinions or beliefs. However, I can provide an analysis on whether the United States has lived up to the message in the Gettysburg Address. The Gettysburg Address, delivered by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 at the dedication of the Soldiers' National Cemetery in Pennsylvania, emphasized the ideals of equality, democracy, and unity. Lincoln's address spoke to the need for a nation \\"conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.\\" While progress has been made towards achieving these ideals, the nation has faced significant challenges in fully living up to the message of the Gettysburg Address. One example demonstrating this is the struggles of the Civil Rights Movement in the mid-20th century. During this period, African Americans continued to face racial segregation, voter suppression, and systemic discrimination. Jim Crow laws, which enforced racial separation and inequality, were prevalent in many states. It was not until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, enacted after significant social movements and activism, that substantial legal barriers were dismantled. This example illustrates the ongoing tension between the aspirations expressed in the Gettysburg Address and the realities experienced by marginalized groups throughout American history. While progress has been made, there remains work to be done in achieving full equality, justice, and inclusivity for all citizens."},{"instruction":"write a professional federal cover letter for the position of security specialist GG-12 to which i am applying for","output":"[Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State, ZIP Code] [Email Address] [Phone Number] [Today’s Date] [Recipient's Name] [Recipient's Position] [Office Name] [Address] [City, State, ZIP Code] Dear [Recipient's Name], I am writing to express my interest in the Security Specialist GG-12 position at [Office Name], as advertised on [Job Portal/Website].

No enredo deste one-shot, seguimos a vida de um jovem chamado Minoru Tanaka, um estudante do ensino médio extremamente inteligente, mas preguiçoso. A história começa quando Ryuk, o shinigami (deus da morte) que originalmente deu o Death Note a Light, decide entregar o caderno a um novo humano, escolhendo Minoru para ser seu novo proprietário. No entanto, Minoru é bem ciente dos eventos passados envolvendo o Death Note e decide tomar um caminho diferente. Em vez de usar o caderno para matar criminosos como Light Yagami fez sob o pseudônimo de \\"Kira\\", Minoru arquiteta um plano intricado para vender o Death Note ao país que fizer a maior oferta, argumentando que o país assim poderia se proclamar o próximo Kira e dissuadir o crime sem realmente precisar usar o caderno. A forma como Minoru manipula a situação, utilizando tecnologia moderna como as redes sociais e a cobertura mundial das notícias, mostra uma nova abordagem do Death Note num mundo que mudou muito desde os dias de Light Yagami. O plano esbarra, porém, nas novas regras impostas pelos shinigamis para evitar o uso indevido ou em massa do Death Note, além dos esforços conjuntos das forças da lei pelo mundo, inclusive com a participação de personagens do mangá original. A narrativa aborda temas como ganância, o valor da vida humana, bem como de questões de segurança global e controle de informações em uma era digital.

Aqui está uma descrição detalhada do plano de Minoru: 1. **Avaliação do Cenário**: Minoru é um estudante do ensino médio que é considerado o mais inteligente do Japão, mas ele não tem ambição de usar o Death Note para fins pessoais ou ideológicos como Light Yagami fez. Ele está ciente dos eventos catastróficos que ocorreram durante a era de Kira e quer evitar um destino semelhante. 2. **Recusa Inicial**: Quando Ryuk retorna e oferece o Death Note a Minoru, ele inicialmente recusa, sabendo dos perigos associados ao caderno. No entanto, ele logo concebe um plano para lucrar com o Death Note de uma maneira que ele acredita ser segura. 3. **Planejamento**: Minoru pede a Ryuk para retornar em dois anos, dando a ele tempo para amadurecer seu plano. Quando Ryuk retorna, Minoru está pronto para colocar seu plano em ação. 4. **Leilão do Death Note**: Minoru decide leiloar o Death Note para o país que oferecer o maior pagamento. Ele usa Ryuk para escrever mensagens na televisão, anunciando o leilão do Death Note. As mensagens são escritas em japonês e inglês para garantir uma ampla compreensão. 5. **Método de Lance**: Para manter o anonimato e evitar rastreamento, Minoru instrui os países interessados a fazerem suas ofertas através do aumento do valor de suas bolsas de valores em um determinado momento, com o valor do aumento representando o lance em trilhões de ienes. 6. **Atenção Mundial**: O leilão atrai a atenção de todo o mundo, com muitos países participando na esperança de obter o poder do Death Note. O evento se torna um fenômeno global, com cobertura constante da mídia. 7. **Vencedor do Leilão**: O leilão é vencido pelos Estados Unidos, que oferecem uma quantia astronômica de dinheiro. Minoru então instrui o presidente dos EUA a depositar o dinheiro em contas bancárias de todos os cidadãos japoneses com menos de 60 anos, distribuindo a riqueza de forma igualitária. 8. **Entrega do Death Note**: Para entregar o Death Note ao presidente dos EUA, Minoru usa Ryuk para transportar o caderno. O presidente é instruído a segurar uma página do Death Note durante uma transmissão ao vivo, permitindo que Ryuk o localize e entregue o caderno. 9. **Consequências Inesperadas**: Após a entrega, o Rei dos Shinigamis aparece e adiciona uma nova regra ao Death Note: qualquer humano que tente usar o Death Note para ganhar dinheiro terá sua vida terminada pelo caderno. Além disso, qualquer humano que compre ou venda o Death Note não terá suas memórias do caderno apagadas após a posse ser transferida, ao contrário do que acontecia anteriormente. 10. **Desfecho**: O presidente dos EUA decide não usar o Death Note, temendo as consequências. Minoru, que havia planejado esquecer tudo sobre o Death Note após a conclusão do leilão, agora está em perigo devido à nova regra. Ryuk, seguindo as ordens do Rei dos Shinigamis, escreve o nome de Minoru no Death Note, resultando em sua morte. Minoru Tanaka, portanto, cria um plano que é brilhante em sua execução, mas que acaba sendo tragicamente falho devido a uma mudança imprevista nas regras do Death Note. Ele consegue realizar o leilão sem ser pego ou identificado, mas não consegue prever a intervenção do Rei dos Shinigamis e as novas regras que são impostas."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

A Sala Branca, ou \\"White Room\\" em inglês, é um conceito significativo dentro da trama desta série. A Sala Branca é uma instalação educacional secreta e extremamente rigorosa onde crianças são criadas e educadas desde tenra idade para se tornarem estudantes perfeitos e excepcionais sob uma metodologia de ensino intensiva e frequentemente desumana. Nesta sala, as crianças não são ensinadas apenas conhecimentos acadêmicos, mas também são submetidas a um treinamento que visa maximizar suas capacidades físicas e mentais, muitas vezes ignorando sua saúde mental e bem-estar emocional. O objetivo da Sala Branca é criar uma geração de seres humanos superiores que possam liderar e triunfar em qualquer campo, devido à sua formação extremamente competitiva e resultados acadêmicos praticamente inigualáveis. Dentro do contexto da história, Kiyotaka Ayanokouji, o protagonista da série, tem uma conexão profunda e pessoal com a Sala Branca, algo que é explorado ao longo da narrativa. A série \\"Classroom of the Elite\\" aborda temas de meritocracia, manipulação, e as pressões sociais e psicológicas associadas ao sucesso acadêmico em uma sociedade altamente competitiva.

If you have any questions or need information on a topic, feel free to ask!"},{"instruction":"If “Idol” were a class in D&D e5, what would its spells, feats and subclasses look like? The three subclasses focus on the gradual upsizing and augmentation of the Idol’s features to increase their attractiveness and ability to capture their audience: Bust Idol, entertaining and enthralling others with both their incredible voice and bouncing from their top-heaviness; Belly Idol, whose performances are less of singing and dancing and rather wowing a crowd through amazing displays of vast consumption; and Butt Idol, performing more provocative song and dance through the swaying and wobbling of their expansive backside. The huger they swell, the Idol's popularity and their power over their audience swells in tandem!","output":"It's important to approach the creation of this class with respect and consideration for all players, ensuring that any content, particularly concerning physical appearance and body types, is handled tactfully and inclusively. The intention should be to empower players and characters of all kinds without objectifying or reducing them to simple physical traits. As \\"Idol\\" is not an actual class in Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, I'll outline a proposed custom class that aims to preserve the spirit of the game while integrating the themes you've mentioned in a fictional, fantastical, and respectful manner: **SPELLS** The Idol's spell list would focus on charm effects, illusions, sound manipulation, and enhancements that affect performance and crowd control. Examples might include: - *Lvl 1: Charm Person, Disguise Self, Tasha's Hideous Laughter* - *Lvl 2: Enthrall, Suggestion, Mirror Image* - *Lvl 3: Hypnotic Pattern, Major Image, Gaseous Form* - *Lvl 4: Charm Monster, Greater Invisibility, Compulsion* - *Lvl 5: Dominate Person, Seeming, Hold Monster* **FEATS** Feats for the Idol class would provide various performance-related benefits and enhancements: - **Mesmerizing Performance**: The Idol can captivate audiences, granting advantage on Charisma (Performance) checks and imposing disadvantage on saving throws against being charmed for affected creatures. - **Vocal Projection**: Increases the range of any spell with a verbal component and may grant advantage on saving throws against effects that would silence or hinder speech. - **Adaptive Stage Presence**: The Idol can adapt their performance style to different audiences, providing bonuses to social interactions with diverse cultures and species. **SUBCLASSES (Archetypes)** Each subclass focuses on a different performance style and means of captivating audiences. - **Bust Idol**: Concentrates on vocal power and uplifting spirits. - **Songs of Empowerment**: Spell-like abilities to fortify allies and weaken foes with inspiring ballads and devastating sonic attacks. - **Boundless Charisma**: When you roll for Charisma (Performance), you can reroll the die once if it is below a certain number. - **Note of Protection**: Performance that offers a protective aura to allies. - **Belly Idol**: Focuses on endurance and impressing crowds with feats of consumption and resilience. - **Bountiful Banquet**: Can cast spells that conjure food and drink, which can heal or provide buffs. - **Digestive Fortitude**: Gains resistance to poisons and can detoxify others as part of a performance. - **Swallow and Spell**: Possesses the ability to consume spell effects targeting them or nearby allies, once per short rest. - **Butt Idol**: Specializes in hypnotic dances and rhythms. - **Rhythmic Trance**: Dance performances that can charm, soothe, or even put audiences to sleep. - **Tremor Twerk**: A dance move that creates minor tremors, disrupting enemies' balance and concentration. - **Dance of Deception**: Perform a dance that creates mirror images, confusing attackers. **Class Features** - **Stage Presence**: Boosts to intimidation and persuasion when performing. - **Fan Following**: Ability to gather information, favors, and resources through admirers. - **Grand Performance**: Once per long rest, the Idol can perform to create an effect akin to the *Mass Suggestion* spell. **ADDITIONAL MECHANICS** - **Audience Favor**: A point system reflecting the Idol's popularity and influence; can be spent for in-game social benefits or buffs. - **Swelling Fame**: As the Idol gains levels, their \\"Swelling Fame\\" feature grows, granting increasing bonuses to their charisma-based skill checks and saving throws. Remember, effectively adding a new class or subclass to D&D 5e should be approached with a balance between functionality, theme, and the enjoyment of all participants in a game. This fictional class requires substantial balancing to maintain parity with traditional D&D classes and must be approached with a sensitivity that ensures all players feel comfortable and included."},{"instruction":"Expand on the Swelling Fame mechanic some more.","output":"Certainly! To expand on the Swelling Fame mechanic, let's reframe it as a progressive feature that represents the Idol's growing fame and the enhanced abilities they gain as a result of their increasing popularity. This feature can be linked directly to the Idol's class level and performance skills, providing distinct and tangible in-game benefits while maintaining balance. **Swelling Fame Mechanic** As the Idol advances in levels, they gain \\"Fame Points\\" that reflect their rising stardom. These points can be used to influence social interactions and can even affect combat situations, representing the Idol's charismatic pull and the power of their performance. Fame Points are a special resource similar to Bardic Inspiration dice or Sorcery Points and are replenished after a long rest. Here's how the Swelling Fame feature might progress: **Level 1: Rising Star** - Gain 1 Fame Point. - As a bonus action, the Idol can expend a Fame Point to grant themselves advantage on a single Charisma (Performance) check or to distract a single target within 60 feet, imposing disadvantage on the target's next attack roll or concentration check. **Level 3: Local Celebrity** - Fame Points increase to a total of 2. - The Idol can now spend a Fame Point to gain advantage on any Charisma-based check. - Once per short rest, the Idol can opt to spend a Fame Point to influence an NPC's attitude positively, as per the DM's discretion. **Level 6: Adored Performer** - Fame Points increase to a total of 3. - The Idol gains the ability to spend a Fame Point to add a bonus equal to their Charisma modifier (minimum of +1) to any saving throw they make. - The range for distracting targets increases to 120 feet. **Level 10: National Sensation** - Fame Points increase to a total of 4. - As an action, the Idol can spend two Fame Points to enthrall a crowd, creating an effect similar to the *mass suggestion* spell. The number of creatures affected is based on the Idol's Charisma modifier. **Level 14: Icon of the Ages** - Fame Points increase to a total of 5. - The Idol can spend three Fame Points to stage a Grand Performance. This special performance acts as a *mass charm person* effect with a range of performance that can reach an entire arena or ballroom. **Level 18: Legendary Idol** - Fame Points increase to a total of 6. - The Idol becomes a figure of legend, and once per long rest, they can perform a Legendary Concert. By spending four Fame Points, this concert boosts the morale and abilities of allies. Allies within earshot gain temporary hit points, a bonus to damage rolls, and advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed for the next hour. **Usage of Fame Points** Fame Points must be used carefully, as they are a limited resource. The Idol also needs to manage their reputation, as excessive or inappropriate use of their fame could lead to negative consequences, which is ultimately at the DM's discretion. The swell of popularity could also attract unwanted attention from rivals or those who wish to diminish the Idol's influence. These mechanics encourage the Idol to engage in meaningful roleplay and make strategic choices about when and how to use their influential presence to affect the story and the world around them. Balancing the Swelling Fame feature against existing game mechanics is key, to ensure that the Idol remains a valuable and interesting addition to any campaign, without overshadowing other players or class features."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The script follows these steps: 1. It defines the supported video extensions and an output folder for the extracted segments. 2. It implements a method to compute the loudness of audio segments using the ITU-R BS.1770-4 method. 3. It locates the segments with the highest loudness based on the user-specified number of segments, segment duration, and offsets from the start and end of the video. 4. It allows sorting these segments according to user preference: by time of appearance (forward or reverse) or by loudness (increasing or decreasing). 5. It extracts the specified video segments using FFmpeg, saving them with a specific naming convention in the output folder. When the script is run as \`__main__\`, it collects user inputs for the offset times, number of segments to extract, segment duration, and sorting preference. It then processes all the video files within the current working directory (or its subdirectories) that match the specified video extensions. Take note of these important aspects of the code: - Dependencies include \`os\`, \`subprocess\`, \`numpy\`, \`uuid\`, \`moviepy\`, and \`scipy\`. - Video files are processed using the \`moviepy\` library to extract audio and analyze loudness. - The script uses a temporary WAV file to store the audio for loudness analysis and then deletes it afterward. - FFmpeg is used to cut the video segments based on the calculated loud segments. - User inputs are collected through the console and used to define the behavior of the script. If you want to test the script, make sure: - You have the necessary dependencies installed in your Python environment. The \`moviepy\` library often requires FFmpeg as well, so ensure it is installed on your system. - Modify paths and filenames according to your project structure and requirements. - Run the script in a directory that contains video files with the defined extensions, as the script will automatically search for and process these files. - Be mindful of the input you provide when the script prompts you, as it does not contain extensive error-checking mechanisms for the user inputs. Make sure to enter valid number choices and durations in seconds as prompted. - Keep in mind that extracting video and audio segments from large files or a large number of files can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, so be patient with the process."},{"instruction":"Je voudrais modifier ce script: serait-il possible d'identifier les cris, à la place des moments les plus bruyants ?","output":"Pour identifier spécifiquement les cris dans une bande audio, vous auriez besoin d'une approche plus sophistiquée que le simple calcul de la loudness. La détection des cris pourrait impliquer l'analyse des caractéristiques spectrales de l'audio, ou bien l'utilisation de l'apprentissage automatique (machine learning) pour classer les sons en fonction d'un ensemble d'entraînement préalablement établi. Voici quelques étapes que vous pourriez envisager pour modifier le script afin de détecter les cris: # Analyse Spectrale 1. **Analyse de Fourier**: Utilisez une transformation de Fourier (par exemple, FFT - Fast Fourier Transform) pour convertir le signal temporel en un signal fréquentiel. Les cris ont souvent des caractéristiques fréquentielles distinctes, comme un contenu spectral aigu ou un certain profil de fréquences. 2. **Filtrage**: Appliquez des filtres passe-bande pour ne conserver que les fréquences de la bande où les cris sont susceptibles de se produire. 3. **Détection des événements**: Identifiez des événements audio qui présentent des caractéristiques typiques des cris, comme des pics dans certaines gammes de fréquences, ou selon l'intensité et la durée des sons. # Apprentissage Automatique 1. **Collecte de Données**: Constituez une base de données d'échantillons audio étiquetés comme des cris et du bruit de fond ou d'autres types de sons. 2. **Extraction de Caractéristiques**: À partir de ces échantillons, extrayez des caractéristiques audio pertinentes, telles que des coefficients mel-frequency cepstral (MFCCs), des chroma features, ou des spectral centroids. 3. **Entraînement d'un Modèle**: Utilisez les caractéristiques extraites pour entraîner un modèle de classification, tel qu'un SVM, une forêt aléatoire, ou même un réseau de neurones convolutif (CNN) si vos données et ressources le permettent. 4. **Application du Modèle**: Appliquez le modèle entraîné à l'audio extrait des vidéos pour détecter et localiser les cris. Ces méthodes nécessitent une expertise avancée en traitement du signal et en apprentissage automatique, ainsi que des données appropriées pour l'entraînement du modèle. Des librairies Python comme \`librosa\` (pour l'analyse audio) et \`scikit-learn\` ou \`tensorflow\`/\`keras\` (pour l'apprentissage automatique) peuvent être utiles. En gardant la structure globale du script, vous pourriez remplacer la fonction \`calculate_loudness\`, ainsi que la manière dont les segments sont choisis, par un nouveau mécanisme qui implémente l'une des méthodes ci-dessus pour la détection des cris.

These machines automate the brewing process and ensure consistent quality and efficiency. Some of the key machinery and equipment found in a typical Heineken brewery include: 1. Milling Machine: This machine crushes the malted barley into a fine powder, known as grist, which is then used in the brewing process. It ensures the proper breakdown of the barley to expose the starches required for fermentation. 2. Mash Tun: The mash tun is a large vessel where the grist is mixed with hot water to create a mixture called the mash. It allows the enzymes in the malted barley to convert the starches into fermentable sugars. 3. Lauter Tun: After the mashing process, the liquid extract called wort is separated from the solid particles in the mash. The lautering process takes place in a tun where the liquid is drained off while the spent grain is retained. 4. Brew Kettles: These large vessels are used to boil the wort, sterilize it, and introduce hops for flavor and aroma. Multiple brew kettles may be used to cater to different beer types brewed by Heineken. 5. Fermentation Vessels: The wort obtained from the brew kettles is transferred to fermentation vessels. Here, yeast is added, and fermentation takes place over a specified period at controlled temperatures. These vessels often have a cooling system to regulate the fermentation process. 6. Maturation Tanks: After fermentation, the beer is transferred to maturation tanks for further conditioning and aging. This allows the flavors to mellow and the beer to mature, resulting in a smoother taste and improved stability. 7. Filtration System: To remove any remaining solids and impurities, the beer is passed through a filtration system. This process ensures clarity and removes any unwanted particles before packaging. 8. Carbonation System: Carbonation is an essential step in brewing beer. Heineken breweries typically use a carbonation system to introduce the desired level of carbon dioxide into the beer. This helps create the characteristic bubbles and carbonation in the final product. 9.

It contains americium fermium oxide, unbipentium (Ubp) tennesside, aluminum gold silicate, iron hydride.","output":"Nacrroeite is a fascinating and mysterious corrupted mineral with unique properties. It is a rare and highly radioactive mineral that forms in deep underground deposits associated with unusual geological activities. Physical Appearance: Nacrroeite has a dark jet-black color, almost completely opaque. It exhibits a fine-grained texture with a lustrous metallic sheen. The mineral forms in irregularly shaped aggregates, often displaying sharp and jagged crystals. It has a distinct pyramidal or prismatic crystal structure, with sharp edges and flat faces. Chemical Formula: The chemical composition of Nacrroeite is complex and includes various rare elements. Its chemical formula can be described as (AmFm)O₂-(Ubp)₂(Ts)₅(AlAu)₄FeH, where: - (AmFm)O₂ represents a compound of americium and fermium oxide - (Ubp)₂(Ts)₅ represents unbipentium (Ubp) tennesside - (AlAu)₄ stands for an aluminum gold silicate compound - FeH represents iron hydride Radioactivity: Nacrroeite's radioactive nature originates primarily from the presence of americium and fermium, which are both highly unstable transuranic elements. As a result, this mineral emits intense radiation, making it dangerous to handle without proper protective measures. The radioactivity also contributes to the unique luminescent properties of Nacrroeite, creating an eerie greenish-blue glow when exposed to UV light. Structural Properties: The incorporation of unconventional elements such as unbipentium tennesside, aluminum gold silicate, and iron hydride into the crystal lattice structure of Nacrroeite leads to its incredible hardness and resilience. This mineral possesses exceptional resistance to corrosion and can withstand extreme temperatures and pressures, which adds to its enigmatic reputation. Mysterious Phenomenon: Nacrroeite's presence has often been associated with unexplained phenomena, including altered magnetic fields, sporadic power outages, and even reports of unidentified aerial objects in the vicinity of mining sites. Its unique combination of rare elements and radioactive properties seem to influence and disrupt conventional scientific observations, leaving researchers puzzled and intrigued. Given its dangerous nature, Nacrroeite has not been widely studied nor utilized in industrial applications. However, its potential for radiation-based technologies, as well as its intriguing properties, make it a subject of interest for further scientific investigation, despite the risks associated with handling such a peculiar mineral."},{"instruction":"Привет, сделай большой доклад по дисциплине Философия на тему: \\"Пётр Яковлевич Чаадаев\\", доклад должен быть на 6-7 листов формата A4","output":"Привет!

Рождение и ранняя жизнь Пётр Яковлевич Чаадаев родился 27 июня (7 июля) 1794 года в Москве в аристократической семье. Получил домашнее образование, с раннего возраста проявив склонность к философским размышлениям. Посещал Московский университет, где углубил свои знания в области философии и литературы. # B. Основные этапы карьеры и достижения Хотя Чаадаев окончил курс в университете подготовки к дипломатической службе, судьба свела его с военной карьерой — он участвовал в Отечественной войне 1812 года. Карьерное продвижение Чаадаева прервалось из-за его критических мыслей о российском обществе и государстве, что позднее сделало его известным в узком кругу мыслителей и общественных деятелей. # C. Чаадаев как общественный деятель Чаадаев был активным участником интеллектуальной и общественной жизни своего времени, его салон посещали многие видные деятели. Ограничения, наложенные на него после публикации \\"Философических писем\\", не позволили ему раскрыться как политическому деятелю, но способствовали углублению в философско-исторические исследования. II. Философские взгляды Петра Яковлевича Чаадаева # A. Отчуждение и одиночество 1. **Влияние Западной философии:** Чаадаев интересовался идеями Ф. Шеллинга, Ж.Ж. Руссо, а также работами средневековых мыслителей. Западная философия оказала влияние на его критический взгляд на русское общество и культуру, подчеркивавший ценность индивидуального разума и духовности. 2. **Русская духовность и ее кризис:** По мнению Чаадаева, Россия страдала от отсутствия настоящего духовного самоопределения и истинного понимания своей истории, что приводило к кризису идентичности. # B. Концепция российской истории 1. **Россия как уникальная цивилизация:** Чаадаев стремился определить место России в мировом историческом процессе. Он утверждал, что Россия развивается не так, как остальные европейские страны, и её исторический путь уникален. 2. **Духовное призвание России:** Философ высказывал мысли о духовном призвании России, которое заключалось в синтезе восточных и западных культурных традиций. # C. Критика русской культуры 1. **Россия и ее интеллектуальные проблемы:** Чаадаев полагал, что русская культура замкнута и изолирована от европейской культурной традиции. 2. **Влияние Запада на русскую культуру:** Он считал необходимым обращение России к достижениям западной культуры для преодоления собственной отсталости и духовного кризиса. III. Влияние и наследие Петра Яковлевича Чаадаева # A. Роль Чаадаева в формировании русской философии Чаадаев сыграл значительную роль в формировании русской философской мысли, его идеи повлияли на целое поколение интеллектуалов, в том числе на западников и славянофилов. # B. Постоянство его идеи в современной философии Идеи Чаадаева о переосмыслении российской истории и культуры остаются актуальными. Его философский пессимизм и изоляция вдохновили последующих философов на поиски ответов на эти же вопросы. # C. Оценка его научных и философских достижений Пётр Яковлевич Чаадаев выступает как символ интеллектуального поиска и культурного самоопределения России, который нашёл отражение в его философских трудах, влияющих на российскую мысль до сих пор."},{"instruction":"Ive heard of one instance of malware stealing code. That was some minecraft rat that stole client mods in attempt to get private hacked clients jar files, which they succeeded in and leaked. Have there been any other instances? Couldnt they easily just scrape any directory with extensions like .go .py .js .java etc.","output":"Yes, there have been several instances of malware stealing code or source files. While I cannot provide an exhaustive list, I can mention a few notable cases: 1. Winnti Group: This advanced persistent threat (APT) group targeted various industries, including gaming companies. They implanted malware in game servers to steal source code and digital certificates, allowing them to create unauthorized versions of games. 2. Operation Aurora: In 2009, this cyber espionage campaign targeted major tech companies, including Google. The attackers stole source code, intellectual property, and other data by exploiting vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and other software. 3. Industroyer/CrashOverride: Although not directly related to code theft, this malware targeted and disrupted electrical power grids. It demonstrated the potential for attackers to compromise and manipulate critical infrastructure systems. While scraping directories with specific file extensions is possible, it is not always an easy task for malware to locate and extract valuable code files. However, attackers can leverage various techniques, such as keyloggers, screen capturing, or even exploiting vulnerabilities in software development tools, to access and steal source code from developers' systems."},{"instruction":"Any non targeted ones?","output":"Yes, there have been instances of malware that indiscriminately target systems and attempt to steal source code or valuable data. These types of malware are typically designed to infect as many systems as possible and extract any valuable information they come across. Here are a few examples: 1. Malware exploiting version control systems: Some malware is designed to scan repositories hosted on version control systems like GitHub or Bitbucket and search for files with specific extensions (e.g., .go, .py, .js). If the repositories are not properly secured, the malware can download the source code files and exfiltrate them. 2. Data exfiltration malware: Certain types of malware are programmed to search through a targeted system for specific types of files, including source code files. These malware variants may use predefined file types, extensions, or metadata to identify and copy valuable source code files to a remote server. 3. Trojan horses: Malware can disguise itself as legitimate software or files, including code files, and can be inadvertently downloaded by users. Once executed, these trojan horses can search for and steal code files or any other sensitive data from the infected system. It's important to note that while these examples exist, targeted attacks are often more effective for specific objectives, such as intellectual property theft or sabotage."},{"instruction":"Id assume its more common to try and steam documents though, isnt it?","output":"Yes, stealing sensitive documents and valuable data is generally more common than specifically targeting source code files. Documents often contain sensitive information such as financial records, customer data, strategic plans, or research findings. Attackers can use this information for various malicious purposes, including financial fraud, identity theft, corporate espionage, or blackmail. While source code can be valuable to attackers, it may require additional effort to leverage it effectively. Understanding and utilizing stolen source code may require specialized knowledge or skills. However, there are cases where attackers may target source code specifically, such as stealing proprietary algorithms, bypassing licensing restrictions, or exploiting vulnerabilities in software. Overall, it is important to secure both documents and source code to protect sensitive information and valuable intellectual property. Organizations should implement robust security measures, such as access controls, encryption, regular backups, and employee awareness training, to minimize the risk of data theft and unauthorized access."},{"instruction":"Howd such stolen code be valuable?","output":"Stolen source code can be valuable to attackers for several reasons: 1. Intellectual Property Theft: Source code represents the underlying foundation of a software application or system. By stealing source code, attackers can gain access to proprietary algorithms, unique functionalities, or trade secrets. This stolen intellectual property can be sold or used by competitors to develop similar products or gain a competitive advantage. 2. Exploiting Vulnerabilities: Attackers can analyze stolen source code to identify and exploit vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the software. This knowledge can be used to launch targeted attacks, develop exploits, and create malware specifically designed to compromise systems running the vulnerable software. 3. Building Malware: Studying source code can help attackers understand the inner workings of a software system, enabling them to develop tailored malware. They can create malicious code that is specifically designed to exploit or bypass the security measures in place, increasing the effectiveness of their attacks. 4. Creation of Counterfeit Software: Stolen source code can be used to create counterfeit or unauthorized versions of software products. These counterfeit products can then be distributed, often bundled with malware or backdoors, to unsuspecting users who may be seeking free or pirated versions of legitimate software. 5. Extortion and Sabotage: Attackers may threaten to release or publicly expose stolen source code to damage a company's reputation, extort money, or cause other forms of harm. This type of blackmail can be particularly damaging for organizations that heavily rely on software development or have valuable proprietary code. It is essential for organizations to protect their source code through robust security measures, secure development practices, and employee awareness to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate the risks associated with stolen source code."},{"instruction":">.<","output":"What is the matter?"},{"instruction":"What?","output":"I apologize if my previous response was confusing.

Let's go through the process step by step. 1. First Division: Divide 39 by a number that will yield a result greater than 5. We can choose a number between 2 and 7 because 39 divided by 8 would be less than 5. Let's say we divide 39 by 3 (you could also pick another number in that range): [ frac{39}{3} = 13 ] 2. Second Division: Now we have 13. We need to divide by a number that will give us a result greater than 5. We could divide by 2: [ frac{13}{2} = 6.5 ] 3. Third Division: We have 6.5. Let's divide by a number that's close to 1 but not so small that the result will dip below 5. We could go with 1.2: [ frac{6.5}{1.2} approx 5.42 ] 4. Fourth Division: Now we have approximately 5.42. We'll divide by a number that ensures our result will still be over 5. If we choose to divide by 1.1, the result will be: [ frac{5.42}{1.1} approx 4.93 ] Looks like the last division resulted in a value less than 5, so we'll want to choose a smaller divisor. Let's divide by 1.05 instead: [ frac{5.42}{1.05} approx 5.16 ] 5. Fifth Division: Finally, we have approximately 5.16. We need to be careful with the last division to ensure the result is over 5. If we divide by 1.02, the result will be: [ frac{5.16}{1.02} approx 5.06 ] So, we managed to divide 39 randomly five times using the divisors 3, 2, 1.2, 1.05, and 1.02, and we ended up with approximately 5.06, which is greater than 5. Since these divisions were performed with some approximations, we'll assume that small rounding differences are acceptable in this context."},{"instruction":"give me 5 random numbers that add up to 39","output":"Certainly!

There are various types of attention mechanisms, with one of the essential differences being between classic attention (as popularized by sequence-to-sequence models in natural language processing) and self-attention (as used in Transformer models). To illustrate the difference in code, we'll go through a simple, high-level example of both implementations. Note that the implementations below are conceptual and are not taken from any specific library or framework; they are meant for a better understanding of the mechanisms. Classic Attention (as used in seq2seq models): \`\`\`python import numpy as np def softmax(x): return np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x), axis=0) def attention(query, keys, values): # Calculate scores scores = np.dot(query, keys.T) # Apply softmax to get attention weights attention_weights = softmax(scores) # Multiply the weights with the values (context vectors) context_vector = np.sum(values.T * attention_weights, axis=1) return context_vector, attention_weights # Example usage query = np.array([1, 0, 0]) # The query vector (from decoder) keys = np.array([[0, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0]]) # The key vectors (from encoder) values = np.array([[1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 0]]) # The value vectors (from encoder) context_vector, attention_weights = attention(query, keys, values) print(\\"Context Vector:\\", context_vector) print(\\"Attention Weights:\\", attention_weights) \`\`\` In the classic attention mechanism, a query (from the decoder) is compared with keys (from the encoder) to produce attention weights using a compatibility function (e.g., dot product followed by softmax). These weights are then applied to the values (often the same as the keys in practice) to produce a weighted sum, also known as the context vector. This context vector is then typically used to influence the decoding process. Self-Attention (as used in Transformer models): \`\`\`python import numpy as np def softmax(x): return np.exp(x) / np.sum(np.exp(x), axis=0) def scaled_dot_product_attention(queries, keys, values): # Calculate the dot products of queries with keys scores = np.dot(queries, keys.T) # Scale the scores by the square root of the dimensionality of the keys d_k = keys.shape[1] scaled_scores = scores / np.sqrt(d_k) # Apply softmax to get attention weights attention_weights = softmax(scaled_scores) # Multiply the weights with the values to get the output output = np.dot(attention_weights, values) return output, attention_weights # Example usage queries = keys = values = np.array([ [1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0] ]) # For self-attention, queries, keys, and values come from the same input output, attention_weights = scaled_dot_product_attention(queries, keys, values) print(\\"Output:\\", output) print(\\"Attention Weights:\\", attention_weights) \`\`\` In the self-attention mechanism, each item in the input sequence generates a query, key, and value. The main difference here is that the attention is within the same sequence (hence self-attention). Every query is compared with all keys (including itself), and the resultant attention weights are used with the corresponding values to produce an output for each query. Both mechanisms are fundamental in allowing the model to weigh different parts of the input and are widely used in natural language processing, recommender systems, and more. The code examples here are simplified and meant for illustration. In practice, these mechanisms would involve gradient computation and backpropagation, as well as additional optimizations, and are often implemented using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch."},{"instruction":"\\"As per Mrs. Saigol's instructions please pay 5'000 equalant to PKR to Mr. Faraz Khosa on behalf of Mrs. Minu Bakshi and confirm.

Коммутатор работает на втором уровне модели OSI (уровне канала данных) и использует MAC-адреса устройств для направления трафика внутри одного сегмента сети или VLAN. Когда коммутатор получает кадр, он смотрит на его MAC-адрес назначения и направляет его только на тот порт, к которому подключено устройство с этим адресом. Если устройство неизвестно, коммутатор может отправить кадр на все порты, кроме порта источника (flooding). Это называется процессом изучения MAC-адресов. Как только адрес узнается, коммутатор обновит свою MAC-таблицу и будет направлять кадры с этим адресом назначения только по нужному порту. Таким образом, коммутатор предотвращает коллизию сигналов, поскольку каждый порт на коммутаторе – это отдельный коллизионный домен. Маршрутизатор работает на третьем уровне модели OSI (уровне сети) и использует IP-адреса для принятия решений о маршрутизации между различными сетями. Маршрутизатор использует таблицу маршрутизации для определения наилучшего пути для пакетов к конечным адресатам. Маршрутизаторы могут обрабатывать трафик от множества хостов, потому что каждый пакет данных содержит уникальные исходные и назначаемые IP-адреса, а также порты протоколов, таких как TCP или UDP, которые позволяют различать отдельные сессии связи. Когда дело доходит до ping (команды ICMP echo request и ICMP echo reply), каждый эхо-запрос, который отправляется от хоста, содержит уникальные идентификаторы (например, идентификатор процесса, который генерирует эхо-запрос, и последовательный номер эхо-запроса). Эти идентификаторы позволяют каждому хосту определить, какие эхо-ответы соответствуют его исходным запросам, даже если эти запросы были отправлены одновременно от множества различных хостов. Таким образом, благодаря использованию MAC- и IP-адресов, MAC-таблиц и таблиц маршрутизации, а также благодаря присвоению уникальных идентификаторов каждой коммуникационной сессии, коммутаторы и маршрутизаторы обеспечивают эффективное и надежное деление трафика и предотвращают ситуацию, когда \\"все сигналы сливаются в один\\"."},{"instruction":"Может ли быть отправлен пакет ethernet без знания Mac адреса получателя?","output":"Да, пакет Ethernet может быть отправлен без знания точного MAC-адреса получателя. В таких случаях используется механизм широковещательной или многоадресной (широковещательной для всех устройств и многоадресной для группы устройств) передачи. 1. **Широковещательная передача (Broadcast):** Если устройство (обычно хост или маршрутизатор) пытается отправить пакет, но не знает MAC-адреса целевого устройства в локальной сети, оно может использовать широковещательный MAC-адрес, который имеет вид FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF. Этот адрес указывает, что пакет должен быть принят всеми устройствами в локальной сети. Примером использования широковещательного MAC-адреса является ARP-запрос (Address Resolution Protocol), когда устройство ищет MAC-адрес, ассоциированный с известным IP-адресом. 2. **Многоадресная передача (Multicast):** Когда пакет отправляется группе получателей, а не одному адресату или всем адресатам сети, используется многоадресная передача. В Ethernet мультикастные адреса начинаются с особого диапазона MAC-адресов, например, с 01-00-5E в случае IPv4 мульткаста, за которым следует последняя часть мультикаст-группового IP-адреса. В обоих случаях коммутатор получит такой пакет и распределит его по всем портам (исключая порт отправителя), если это широковещательный пакет, или по определенным портам, которые признаны принадлежащими многоадресной группе, если это мультикастный пакет. Затем устройства в сети будут проверять пакеты и обрабатывать только те, которые предназначены для их MAC-адресов или мультикаст-групп, к которым они принадлежат."},{"instruction":"Serait-il possible d'ajouter une fonction permettant de supprimer le bruit de fond avant d'identifier les segments les plus bruyants ?

Sous Linux : Sur les systèmes basés sur Debian (comme Ubuntu), utilisez : \`\`\`sh sudo apt-get install swig \`\`\` Sur les distributions basées sur Red Hat (comme Fedora), utilisez : \`\`\`sh sudo dnf install swig \`\`\` Sous macOS : Vous pouvez installer SWIG à l'aide de Homebrew : \`\`\`sh brew install swig \`\`\` # Autres possibilités Si SWIG est déjà installé et que vous voyez toujours une erreur, voici d'autres étapes à suivre : - Assurez-vous que la version de Python que vous utilisez est compatible avec \`speexdsp\`. Certaines extensions C/C++ peuvent ne pas être compatibles avec les dernières versions de Python. - Vérifiez si vous avez un compilateur C/C++ installé. Sous Windows, vous aurez besoin de Visual Studio ou de Build Tools pour Visual Studio pour compiler les extensions Python C. Après avoir installé SWIG (et potentiellement d'autres outils de build nécessaires), réessayez d'installer \`speexdsp\` : \`\`\`sh pip install speexdsp \`\`\` Si l'installation échoue encore après avoir suivi ces instructions, vous pourriez envisager de rechercher des versions binaires pré-compilées (wheels) de \`speexdsp\` qui sont spécifiques à votre plateforme et version de Python, ou de changer de méthode pour la réduction du bruit, en utilisant par exemple une autre bibliothèque ou en passant par une application tierce capable de traiter les fichiers audio avant leur utilisation dans votre script Python."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Perceptual training refers to exercises and processes aimed at improving the ability of the brain to interpret sensory information, which can potentially impact various cognitive skills, including reading. Meta-analyses are comprehensive studies that statistically analyze results from multiple research papers to determine overall trends or effects. There may be meta-analyses that have investigated the effects of perceptual training on reading speed, as reading is a complex cognitive task that involves perceptual processing. Here are some steps you can take to find a meta-analysis on this topic: 1. Academic Databases: Search databases such as PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, or Google Scholar using keywords like \\"perceptual training,\\" \\"reading speed,\\" \\"intervention,\\" and \\"meta-analysis.\\" 2. Reference Lists: Look at the reference sections of relevant review papers or meta-analyses that discuss perceptual training or reading speed; these sections may lead you to other meta-analyses. 3. Professional Journals: Browse through journals that focus on cognitive psychology, educational psychology, reading research, or neuroscience. 4. Contact Experts: Reach out to researchers who specialize in perceptual training or reading improvement to ask if they are aware of any relevant meta-analyses. Please note, the availability of a meta-analysis on this topic can depend on the year, as new research is being published regularly. If you are unable to find a recent meta-analysis, there may still be individual studies or systematic reviews that address the impact of perceptual training on reading speed. If conducting an extensive search, do consider that the terminology and focus areas in the research might shift over time, which might affect how you should phrase your search queries. For the most current information, please perform a search in the latest databases or consult with a librarian or researcher who has access to updated academic resources."},{"instruction":"what is the best perceptual training method or exercise for reading speed","output":"The best perceptual training method or exercise for improving reading speed can vary depending on the individual's needs and the nature of their reading challenges. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, but here are some perceptual training methods that have been researched or suggested for improving different aspects of reading, including speed: 1. Visual Scanning Training: This involves exercises designed to improve eye movement efficiency and saccadic movements (quick, simultaneous movements of both eyes in the same direction). Effective scanning can reduce the time spent on each line and improve overall reading speed. 2. Speed Reading Programs: These typically combine a variety of techniques aimed at increasing reading speed, such as reducing subvocalization (silent speech), expanding peripheral vision to encompass more words, and improving chunking skills (grouping words together to read in phrases rather than single words). 3. Orthographic Training: This focuses on the recognition of word patterns and spellings. Enhancing orthographic skills can help improve reading fluency and speed because it makes word recognition more automatic and less reliant on phonetic decoding. 4. Attention Training: Exercises to improve attention can assist with maintaining focus over longer periods, which is essential for sustained reading and can indirectly influence reading speed. 5. Eye Movement Control Exercises: These are designed to enhance the ability to control eye movements, aiding in quicker and more accurate saccades, which are critical for reading rapidly. 6. Working Memory Training: Since working memory plays a role in reading comprehension and fluently integrating information, exercises to bolster working memory can have a knock-on effect in improving reading speed and efficiency. 7. Tachistoscopic Training: This method flashes words or phrases on a screen for brief intervals to train the brain to recognize words quickly, improving word recognition speed. When considering any perceptual training method, it's important to take into account the principles of effective training, such as: - Adaptive Difficulty: The training should adjust in difficulty as the reader improves, providing a continuous challenge. - Individualized Approach: Tailor the training to the reader's specific weaknesses or deficits to ensure it is targeting the right area. - Regular Practice: Regular, consistent practice is key to making perceptual gains. - Integrated Skills: Reading is multifaceted; therefore, training that integrates various skills (like comprehension, vocabulary, and perceptual speed) can be more effective. To find the best method for yourself or another individual, it may be helpful to combine several of these methods, monitor progress, and adjust training based on results. Additionally, it is always a good idea to consult with a professional, such as a speech-language pathologist, educational psychologist, or reading specialist, who can provide personalized recommendations based on assessments of the individual's reading abilities."},{"instruction":"make it simple eng - We use smart algorithms and predictive analytics to turn data into actionable insights","output":"We use intelligent algorithms and advanced analytics to transform data into practical insights."},{"instruction":"simple eng social media caption - Empathy in action! 🤝 Team Talentelgia spreading warmth and kindness in our latest CSR initiative. 🌟 We've shared clothes, blankets, and food items with those in need.

Please check the latest resources or the official Android website for the most up-to-date information on Android versions."},{"instruction":"What is 'temperature' parameter of AI chats?","output":"The term \\"temperature\\" in the context of AI chatbots, particularly those based on language models such as GPT-3 or its successors, refers to a setting that determines the level of randomness in the responses generated by the AI. It is part of the parameters used to control the behavior of the AI when producing text. Here's a basic breakdown of how it works: - Low temperature (close to 0.0): The AI will produce more deterministic and predictable responses. At very low temperatures, the AI might give the same or very similar responses to the same input every time. - High temperature (closer to 1.0): The AI will produce more varied and sometimes more creative or unpredictable responses. A higher temperature encourages the model to take more risks in its language generation, potentially resulting in more diverse and less repetitive text, but also possibly generating less coherent or irrelevant responses. When setting the temperature for an AI chatbot, it's a balance between ensuring the consistency and relevance of the AI's responses and allowing for creativity and variety in the conversation. Adjusting the temperature can modify the AI's behavior to better suit different applications or user preferences."},{"instruction":"Can AI chats producer more logical conclusions in its responses at higher temperature?","output":"No, generating more logical conclusions in AI-generated responses is not typically associated with a higher temperature setting. Higher temperature generally leads to more randomness and creativity in the responses, which can sometimes mean less logical or coherent outcomes. This increased randomness makes the AI more likely to produce unusual or unexpected responses, which might not always align with logical reasoning. On the other hand, a lower temperature setting tends to make the AI's responses more predictable, conservative, and logically coherent because the AI is more likely to stick to patterns it recognizes from the training data. Lower temperature settings are often preferred when the objective is to maintain factual accuracy and relevance, such as in a customer support chatbot or any application where reliability of information is crucial. For creating more logical and coherent conclusions, it's generally recommended to use a moderate to low temperature setting, which encourages the AI to follow the statistical trends within its training dataset and produce responses that align with established knowledge and reasoning."},{"instruction":"viết startus chào ngày mới","output":"Chào buổi sáng, một ngày mới tươi đẹp đã đến!

Количество животных – голов КРС (молочное). Рассчитай сколько персонала должно работать в этом предприятии и на каких должностях (в условиях России).","output":"Для расчета количества персонала, необходимого для работы на предприятии сельского хозяйства в условиях России, следует учитывать ряд факторов, включая площадь обрабатываемых земель, количество содержащихся животных, уровень механизации, специфику хозяйствования в данной местности и другие. 1. Работники для обработки пашни и полей: В среднем, современная техника позволяет одному трактористу обрабатывать примерно 100-150 гектаров пашни. Таким образом, для 950 га пашни потребуется примерно 7-10 трактористов и операторов с/х машин. В зависимости от сезона, пиковые нагрузки могут требовать увеличения числа сезонных работников, например, во время посевной или уборочной кампании. 2. Работники для содержания КРС: Количество персонала для ухода за КРС зависит от количества животных и уровня их содержания (например, наличие автоматизированного доильного оборудования). В среднем, один животновод может ухаживать за 20-30 коровами. Если предположить, что уровень обслуживания автоматизирован, этот показатель может быть выше. 3. Работники для ухода за пастбищами: Обслуживание 450 га пастбищ не потребует большого числа персонала, но потребуются рабочие для поддержания инфраструктуры пастбищ и возможно, пастухи. Количество таких сотрудников зависит от способа использования пастбищ и может меняться в зависимости от сезона. 4. Вспомогательный персонал: Также на предприятии нужны сотрудники, обеспечивающие работу хозяйства: бухгалтеры, технический персонал, специалисты по ремонту оборудования, менеджмент, рабочие для транспортировки продукции и т. д. В результате для такого предприятия потребуются следующие категории персонала: - Трактористы и операторы сельхозмашин (около 7-10 человек); - Животноводы (при условии автоматизации, количество коров на одного работника может быть выше, нужны точные данные о количестве КРС); - Пастухи и рабочие для пастбищ (в зависимости от сезона и способа использования пастбищ); - Вспомогательный персонал (администрация, бухгалтерия, рабочие, возможно, инженеры, ветеринары и специалисты по питанию животных); - Сезонные работники для пиковых нагрузок в посевной и уборочный периоды.

Однако, я могу предложить примерный шаблон для расчета на основе типичных условий работы сельскохозяйственного предприятия в России. Полевые работы (уже здесь может потребоваться разное количество работников в зависимости от степени механизации): - Трактористы: 2-3 в среднем на каждые 100 гектар, то есть 19-29 трактористов; - Агрономы: как минимум 1 на предприятие, но возможно 1 агроном на 300-500 гектар, то есть 2-3 агронома; - Рабочие для ручных операций (уборка урожая, прополка и т.д.): сезонные рабочие, по потребности; - Механики, слесари для ремонта и обслуживания техники: 1-3, в зависимости от состояния и объема техники. Животноводства: - Зоотехники: 1 на 100-150 голов, то есть примерно 5-7 зоотехников; - Операторы машинного доения (если используется): обычно 1 на смену (если доение обычно двухсменное, то необходимо 2 оператора); - Рабочие на ферме (кормление, уборка помещений, перегон скота и др.): в зависимости от уровня механизации, 1 рабочий на 40-70 голов; - Ветеринар: хотя бы 1 на предприятие; - Инкубаторщики, если есть птица; - Другие специалисты, такие как водитель скотовоза, рабочий по искусственному осеменению, работники по уходу за молодняком и т.д. Управленческий и вспомогательный персонал: - Директор; - Главный бухгалтер; - Отдел кадров; - Складские работники; - Охрана, клининговые службы и др. Таким образом, на сельскохозяйственном предприятии с территорией в 1400 гектаров (950 га пашни и 450 га пастбищ) и количеством животных в 700 голов КРС для полного функционирования потребуется минимум 50-70 человек в зависимости от сезона и конкретных условий хозяйства.

Mam 16 lat","output":"Melatonina jest hormonem wytwarzanym naturalnie przez organizm, który reguluje cykl snu. Suplementy melatoniny są często stosowane w celu leczenia zaburzeń snu, takich jak bezsenność oraz problemów związanych z jet lag. Ważne jest, aby wiedzieć, że w wielu krajach melatonina jest dostępna bez recepty, ale jej stosowanie przez nieletnich powinno odbywać się pod nadzorem lekarza lub innego wykwalifikowanego specjalisty zdrowia. To dlatego, że układ hormonalny młodych ludzi wciąż się rozwija, a przyjmowanie suplementów hormonalnych może potencjalnie wpływać na ten proces. Jeśli jako 16-latek rozważasz przyjmowanie melatoniny, powinieneś najpierw porozmawiać z lekarzem lub farmaceutą. Oni mogą doradzić, czy w twoim przypadku przyjmowanie melatoniny jest bezpieczne i jaką dawkę ewentualnie zalecić. Lekarz może również zasugerować inne metody leczenia zaburzeń snu, które nie wymagają stosowania leków, np. techniki higieny snu lub terapię behawioralną. Bez konsultacji z lekarzem nie powinieneś rozpoczynać żadnych suplementów lub leków, szczególnie jeśli masz mniej niż 18 lat."},{"instruction":"Już wzielem 4 razy po 5 mg","output":"Jeśli już przyjąłeś melatoninę w dawce 5 mg czterokrotnie, ważne jest, abyś monitorował swoje samopoczucie i reakcje organizmu. Jeśli zauważysz jakiekolwiek niepożądane efekty, takie jak zawroty głowy, senność w ciągu dnia, zmienność nastroju, bóle głowy, lub inne niepokojące objawy, powinieneś skontaktować się z lekarzem. Ponieważ jesteś nieletni i użyłeś melatoniny bez nadzoru medycznego, zalecam następujące kroki: 1. Porozmawiaj z rodzicami lub opiekunami: Powiedz im o swoim użyciu melatoniny i wyraź wszelkie obawy, które możesz mieć. 2. Skonsultuj się z lekarzem: Zaleca się, abyś umówił się na wizytę lekarską, aby omówić swoje doświadczenia związane z przyjmowaniem melatoniny, uzyskać profesjonalną poradę i upewnić się, że nie ma negatywnych skutków dla Twojego zdrowia. 3. Dostosuj dawkę według zaleceń: Jeśli lekarz zaleci kontynuowanie stosowania melatoniny, ważne jest, aby przestrzegać zaleceń dotyczących dawkowania i czasu stosowania. 4. Przestrzegaj zasad higieny snu: Niezależnie od tego, czy będziesz kontynuować przyjmowanie melatoniny, warto skupić się na naturalnych metodach poprawy snu, takich jak ustalanie regularnych godzin snu, unikanie ekranów przed pójściem spać, trzymanie sypialni ciemnej i chłodnej oraz unikanie kofeiny i ciężkich posiłków przed snem. Pamiętaj, że nawet jeśli nie doświadczyłeś negatywnych skutków, zawsze istnieje ryzyko, że niewłaściwe stosowanie suplementów, szczególnie bez nadzoru medycznego, może wpłynąć niekorzystnie na Twoje zdrowie. Bezpieczeństwo i zdrowie powinny być zawsze priorytetem."},{"instruction":"Jakie mogą być skutki uboczne","output":"Melatonina jest generalnie uważana za bezpieczną, gdy jest stosowana w odpowiednich dawkach. Niemniej jednak, podobnie jak przy każdym suplemencie, mogą wystąpić skutki uboczne, zwłaszcza jeśli jest przyjmowana w dużych dawkach, przez długi czas lub bez nadzoru medycznego. Niektóre możliwe skutki uboczne przyjmowania melatoniny obejmują: 1. Senność w ciągu dnia, 2. Zmiany nastroju (np. uczucie smutku lub depresji), 3. Zawroty głowy, 4. Bóle głowy, 5. Zmęczenie lub uczucie osłabienia, 6. Niepokój i drażliwość, 7. Zaburzenia żołądkowo-jelitowe, takie jak nudności lub ból brzucha, 8. Wrażenie drętwienia lub mrowienia w kończynach, 9. Krótkotrwałe uczucie zimna, 10. Zaburzenia snu (które mogą być paradoksalnym efektem), 11. Hormonalne zmiany (szczególnie istotne u młodych osób, których układy hormonalne jeszcze dojrzewają). Długofalowe skutki przyjmowania melatoniny nie są dobrze zbadane, zwłaszcza u dzieci i młodzieży. Ponieważ masz 16 lat, używanie melatoniny powinno odbywać się wyłącznie pod ścisłą kontrolą lekarską. Poproś swojego lekarza o poradę dotyczącą skutków ubocznych oraz najlepszej dawki i długości kuracji dla ciebie. Jeśli doświadczasz jakichkolwiek niepożądanych objawów, które mogą być związane z przyjmowaniem melatoniny, natychmiast zgłoś je swojemu lekarzowi. Nie zapomnij również o dokładnym badaniu etykiet produktów i konsultacji z lekarzem lub farmaceutą w sprawie ich stosowania, zwłaszcza jeśli przyjmujesz inne leki."},{"instruction":"Co masz na myśli z hormonalnymi zmianami","output":"W kontekście hormonalnych zmian wywołanych przez przyjmowanie melatoniny, naukowcy są zaniepokojeni, że suplementacja tego hormonu, szczególnie w przypadku dzieci i młodzieży, których układy endokrynologiczne nadal się rozwijają, może potencjalnie wpływać na fizjologiczną równowagę hormonów w organizmie. Melatonina ma wpływ nie tylko na cykl snu, ale także na inne procesy regulowane przez układ endokrynologiczny. Oto kilka potencjalnych wpływów hormonalnych zmian, do których może dojść: 1. **Rozwój seksualny:** Melatonina może wpływać na dojrzewanie oraz rozwój seksualny, ponieważ jest zaangażowana w regulację wydzielania niektórych hormonów reprodukcyjnych. 2. **Zmiany w produkcji hormonów:** Melatonina może wpływać na produkcję i wydzielanie hormonów przez gruczoły endokrynologiczne, takie jak szyszynka, przysadka i inne. 3. **Zaburzenia cyklu dobowego:** Długotrwałe stosowanie melatoniny może potencjalnie zakłócić naturalną produkcję melatoniny przez organizm, co może prowadzić do zaburzeń rytmu dobowego. 4. **Odporność organizmu:** Melatonina może także oddziaływać na układ immunologiczny. Niewłaściwa suplementacja może wpłynąć na funkcje immunologiczne. Należy podkreślić, że większość dostępnych dowodów pochodzi z badań na dorosłych. Nie mamy dużo badań dotyczących skutków długoterminowego stosowania suplementów melatoniny przez dzieci i młodzież, a więc potencjalne skutki na system hormonalny mogą być mniej przewidywalne i wymagają ostrożności. Ze względu na te niepewności i potencjalne ryzyko, rekomendowane jest, aby dzieci i młodzież stosowały melatoninę tylko pod nadzorem lekarza i tylko wtedy, gdy jest to konieczne. Lekarz może pomóc ocenić stosunek potencjalnych korzyści do ryzyka i zdecydować, czy suplementacja jest odpowiednia oraz jak prowadzić terapię, aby zminimalizować ryzyko negatywnych skutków zdrowotnych."},{"instruction":"can you summarise the book Think and Grow Rich","output":"\\"Think and Grow Rich\\" is a personal development and self-help book written by Napoleon Hill and first published in 1937.

And diapers aren’t just for wearing, either; many of them are so thick they can double as blankets, pillows, even mattresses! Example: XXXL Supreme Poofies (Rare item, Diaper Armor): +4 to AC, movement speed reduced by 15 feet, rear attacks to wearer deal 1d10 less damage, wearer gains the unique “Powder Cloud” passive trait when equipped (when struck by an attack to the behind, a thick cloud of baby powder will billow outwards and briefly fog a wide area. A 10-foot wide spherical area of powder is created centred on the wearer, becoming lightly obscured for 1 round. This trait recharges after using an action to refill the diaper with powder), wearer is forced into an embarrassing waddle when equipped (applies either advantage or disadvantage on all Charisma checks, depending on if the wearer enjoys the waddle or is instead flustered by it). “The four huge tapes used to wrap this mattress-sized pamper onto someone are the size of pillows.”","output":"- **Gargantuan Giggle Guards (Very Rare item, Diaper Armor)**: +5 to AC, reduces movement speed by 20 feet, can store up to three 'Loadings' before hindrance increases, wearer receives advantage on saving throws against being knocked prone. When reaching maximum capacity, the diaper can be deployed as a temporary barricade providing half-cover. Wearers often find themselves giggling uncontrollably due to the enchanted padding which tickles slightly with each step. - **Stealthy Stinker SneakPants (Uncommon item, Diaper Apparel)**: +2 to AC, no movement penalty, grants advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in urban environments. Upon performing a 'Loading,' the diaper emits a silent but potent odor, forcing creatures within a 5-foot radius to succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of their next turn. - **Mighty Munchkin War Briefs (Rare item, Diaper Armor)**: +3 to AC, movement speed reduced by 10 feet, wearer gains Resistance to bludgeoning damage. The diaper features built-in weaponry, allowing the wearer to make an additional unarmed strike as a bonus action, using the heavily padded regions of the diaper to bash foes. - **Enchanted Evening Undies (Uncommon item, Diaper Apparel)**: +1 to AC, no movement penalty, wearer gains advantage on Charisma (Performance) and Charisma (Persuasion) checks during night time. The diaper shimmers with a magical glow after sundown, granting the wearer an alluring presence and improving their social interactions. - **Traveler's Tushie Tote (Common item, Diaper Container)**: Gain an extra 10 pounds of carrying capacity, no movement penalty, wearer can access a hidden pocket inside the diaper's padding that acts as a bag of holding for small items. While it provides no armor benefits, adventurers appreciate the added utility. - **Diplomat's Dignified Diaper (Rare item, Diaper Apparel)**: +3 to AC, reduces movement speed by 5 feet, wearer gains advantage on Charisma (Diplomacy) checks. Despite its size, this diaper is masterfully crafted to look regal and commanding, bolstering the wearer's presence during negotiations. - **Hulking Hefty Huggies (Legendary item, Diaper Armor)**: +7 to AC, reduces movement speed by 30 feet, grants immunity to the 'Loaded' condition. Each 'Loading' enhances the wearer's size and strength, granting them temporary hit points and increasing their damage output with melee attacks. - **Scholar's Sagacious Slacks (Uncommon item, Diaper Apparel)**: +2 to AC, no movement reduction, adds +1 to Intelligence and Wisdom checks. Crafted from rare materials, these diapers are favored by mages and scholars who seek comfort and mental clarity during their studies. - **Sorcerous Soiling Slippers (Uncommon item, Diaper Footwear)**: No AC benefit, grants +5 feet to movement speed, one free 'Loading' per long rest without any additional hindrance. These magical diapers enchant the wearer's steps, leaving behind a trail of illusory flowers rather than an unsavory scent. - **Puddle Protector Pantaloons (Common item, Diaper Apparel)**: +1 to AC, movement speed reduced by 5 feet, grants advantage on saving throws against water-based attacks. The diaper is designed to absorb and repel moisture, keeping the wearer dry in rainy urban environments. Remember that while these items are intended to bring humor and levity to your campaign, it's important to ensure all players are comfortable with the theme. Always tailor your homebrew content to the preferences and expectations of your gaming group."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Text can be formatted to run vertically, but this is seldom used. Several studies have found that horizontal text can be read faster than vertical text in the central visual field. No studies have investigated the peripheral visual field. Studies have also concluded that training can improve reading speed in the peripheral visual field for horizontal text. We aimed to establish whether the horizontal vertical differences are maintained and if training can improve vertical reading in the peripheral visual field. Methods: Eight normally sighted young adults participated in the first study. Rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) reading speed was measured for horizontal and vertical text in the central visual field and at 10 degrees eccentricity in the upper or lower (horizontal text) and right or left (vertical text) visual fields. Twenty-one normally sighted young adults split equally between two training groups and one control group participated in the second study. Training consisted of RSVP reading using either vertical text in the left visual field or horizontal text in the inferior visual field. Subjects trained daily over 4 days. Pre- and post- horizontal and vertical RSVP reading speeds were carried out for all groups. For the training groups, these measurements were repeated 1 week and 1 month posttraining. Results: Before training, RSVP reading speeds were faster for horizontal text in the central and peripheral visual fields when compared with vertical text. Training vertical reading improved vertical reading speeds by an average factor of 2.8. There was partial transfer of training to the opposite (right) hemifield. The training effects were retained for up to a month. Conclusions: Rapid serial visual presentation training can improve RSVP vertical text reading in peripheral vision. These findings may have implications for patients with macular degeneration or hemianopic field loss.","output":"هدف: متن‌های انگلیسی تقریباً همیشه به صورت افقی نوشته می‌شوند. امکان فرمت کردن متن به صورت عمودی وجود دارد، اما این کمتر اتفاق می‌افتد. چند مطالعه نشان داده‌اند که خواندن متن افقی نسبت به متن عمودی در میدان دید مرکزی سریع‌تر است. هیچ مطالعه‌ای در مورد میدان دید محیطی انجام نشده است. مطالعات همچنین نتیجه‌گیری کرده‌اند که تمرین می‌تواند سرعت خواندن متن افقی را در میدان دید محیطی بهبود بخشد. هدف ما برپایی این بود که اگر تفاوت‌های افقی و عمودی حفظ می‌شوند و اینکه آیا تمرین می‌تواند خواندن عمودی را در میدان دید محیطی بهبود بخشد. روش‌ها: هشت بزرگسال جوان با بینایی طبیعی در مطالعه اول شرکت کردند. سرعت خواندن با ارائه متوالی سریع تصاویر (RSVP) برای متن افقی و عمودی در میدان دید مرکزی و در فاصله ۱۰ درجه غیر مرکزی در بالا یا پایین (متن افقی) و راست یا چپ (متن عمودی) میدان دید، اندازه‌گیری شد. بیست و یک بزرگسال جوان با بینایی طبیعی که به صورت مساوی بین دو گروه آموزشی و یک گروه کنترل تقسیم شده بودند، در مطالعه دوم شرکت کردند. تمرین شامل خواندن RSVP با استفاده از متن عمودی در میدان دید چپ یا متن افقی در میدان دید پایین بود. شرکت‌کنندگان به مدت ۴ روز به تمرین روزانه پرداختند. اندازه‌گیری‌های قبل و بعد از تمرین سرعت خواندن RSVP افقی و عمودی برای همه گروه‌ها انجام‌شد. برای گروه‌های آموزشی، این اندازه‌گیری‌ها یک هفته و یک ماه پس از آموزش تکرار شدند. نتایج: قبل از تمرین، سرعت‌های خواندن RSVP برای متن افقی در میدان‌های دید مرکزی و محیطی، نسبت به متن عمودی سریع‌تر بودند. تمرین خواندن عمودی سرعت خواندن عمودی را به طور متوسط 2.8 برابر افزایش داد. انتقال جزئی اثرات تمرین به نیم گوی مقابل (راست) تفاوت وجود داشت. اثرات تمرین تا یک ماه حفظ شدند. نتیجه‌گیری‌ها: تمرین ارائه متوالی سریع تصاویر می‌تواند سرعت خواندن متن عمودی RSVP را در بینایی محیطی بهبود بخشد. این یافته‌ها ممکن است برای بیماران مبتلا به دژنراسیون ماکولا یا از دست دادن نیمه میدان دید تاثیرگذار باشد."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It prompts the user for several parameters via the console such as the number of segments to extract, the duration of each segment, and preferences regarding the sorting of the output and position of sound amplitude peak within the segments. The reason the script doesn't stop after reaching the user-decided number of segments (\`num_segments\`) is that it loops through all video files in the current directory and applies the process to each one of them. The \`num_segments\` is respected for each individual video file processed. If you're experiencing that the script continues to run after you expect it to stop, ensure that: 1. The user input for \`num_segments\` is correctly converting to an integer and reflects the desired number of segments you want to be extracted from each video. 2. If you want to process only a single video or a specific subset of videos, you need to adjust the loop logic accordingly. For example, if you want the script to only process a single file, you'll need to remove or adjust the for-loop that iterates through the files. Keep in mind that the script, as is, is designed to process multiple video files in a directory, and 'stopping' isn't defined by extracting a set number of segments from all files combined but rather by reaching the end of the files list. In summary, the script should stop on its own after processing all video files in the directory, respecting the \`num_segments\` count for each individual video file. If it doesn't, there might be an error in the script, or it could be stuck in an infinite loop if there's a logical error not shown in the code. To diagnose further, you might need to insert debug print statements or use a debugger to step through the code and see where it's not behaving as expected. If you want to process a limited number of videos or a specific video, you will need to modify the file loop logic."},{"instruction":"peut-on faire en sorte qu'il ne scanne pas les sous-dossiers ?","output":"Oui, vous pouvez modifier le script pour qu'il ne scanne pas les sous-dossiers lors de la recherche de fichiers vidéo. Pour cela, vous devez remplacer la boucle actuelle qui utilise \`os.walk('.')\`, laquelle parcourt récursivement le dossier actuel et ses sous-dossiers, par une simple itération sur les fichiers du répertoire courant. Vous pouvez utiliser \`os.listdir('.')\` ou une compréhension de liste pour filtrer les fichiers selon les extensions souhaitées.

Les sous-dossiers ne seront pas explorés. Notez que \`os.listdir()\` renvoie à la fois des fichiers et des dossiers, donc si vous avez des dossiers qui correspondent aux extensions de fichiers vidéo, il se pourrait qu'ils soient inclus dans le traitement. Toutefois, le script tel qu'il est conçu actuellement ne traitera que des fichiers valides puisque \`VideoFileClip\` échouera avec un répertoire. Aussi, \`os.path.join('.', file)\` est équivalent à juste \`file\`, mais il est utile de construire explicitement des chemins avec \`os.path.join\` pour assurer une bonne portabilité et une cohérence dans la manipulation des chemins de fichiers."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

A 10-foot wide spherical area of powder is created centred on the wearer, becoming lightly obscured for 1 round.

A second-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, he had a wealthy upbringing as the son of two strong sorcerers in Yuki Tsukumo (special-grade rank) and Gunnar Skarsgaard, from Norway(Grade 1 rank. Gunnar moved to Japan for Yuki, and Erik has spent most of his time in Japan.) Gunnar was known for Earth Manipulation while Yuki possesses an incredibly powerful ability named Bonbaye (Star Rage) that allows her to add a seemingly endless amount of mass to her physical attacks or attacks with her shikigami Garuda. With Bonbaye, she's capable of effortlessly exorcising a special-grade cursed spirit. Erik was always destined for greatness, and he's poised to achieve it, being acknowledged as one of the greatest sorcerers of his generation. He first awakened his own unique innate technique, Good Vibrations, when he was six years old, and used it to launch an attack that knocked both of his parents back, breaking up an imminent fight over his training regimen. Good Vibrations allows Erik to turn cursed energy into powerful vibrations he can manipulate and control. First, Good Vibrations can greatly enhance Erik's perception through an ability known as Ultrasound. By tapping a shared surface including the ground, Erik can send sound waves that travel through the environment and bounce back, allowing him to create a detailed map of his surroundings based on the echoes. This heightened perception allows him to anticipate and react swiftly to threats, ensuring that he rarely gets caught off guard. But this is only the tip of the iceberg. Erik, true to his parents' styles, is primarily a physical attacker and he loves to create shockwaves to enhance his striking power. By default, hits with his cursed energy also carry a powerful vibration, making them more destructive and harder to defend against. One example of an even stronger version of his basic punches is \\"Seismic Smash\\" wherein he focuses vibrations around his fist in a spherical bubble to form an earthquake hypocenter and delivers a punch releasing all the force concentrated at once, with enormous power. It's as strong as an artillery shell, and its shockwave can damage those who are not directly hit by his fist. Seismic Stomp is its podal counterpart, allowing Erik to create shockwaves by focusing vibrations into the ground through his feet, generating powerful seismic waves that shake the very ground beneath. Using Wavegun, he aims his fingers at his opponents to unleash smaller, ranged shockwaves. They aren't as strong as the ones in which he makes direct contact, but they are still formidable. However, Earthsplitter, fired from the palms, has serious destructive power. \\"Null\\" is a defensive ability that involves halting the vibrations in others, potentially stopping movement. However, Erik is skilled at using barriers made from basic cursed energy. Erik is also skilled at Cursed Technique Reversal, adding an entirely new element, and several Extension Techniques. \\"Aftershock Pulse\\" works based on the advanced use of reverse cursed energy to create vibrations that resonate with the body’s natural frequencies, promoting rapid cellular repair and recovery from injuries. It creates a mild pain, and it can be used on others as well. It takes about 10 minutes to heal completely. \\"Rupture\\" is an offensive use of RCT wherein Erik Skarsgaard focuses his cursed energy on a specific target and forcefully disrupts the target's internal vibrations, causing severe internal damage. Finally, RCT allows him to tap into two \\"settings\\" known as \\"Amplitude\\", which can greatly increass the power of all attacks, and \\"Frequency\\", which greatly enhances speed, maxing out at 5GHz, or 5 billion cycles per second. He struggles to move in a straight line while using \\"Frequency\\", forced to move in \\"waves\\", or zig-zagging lines. \\"Amplitude\\" is volatile, and Erik must strike at maximum vertical shift to get the most out of it. Both have considerable recoil when eventually deactivated. He's a big eater, known for his love of \\"manly\\", meat-heavy meals(especially a large tomahawk steak), drinking raw milk or whisky, and sour cherry pie. He owns a luxury SUV and sedan. He has a sister named Pia. He was gifted a cursed tool, a large (7ft, or 203cm) heavy tungsten baseball bat that would absorb his power to create destructive shockwaves on contact. He named this the Earth Shaker. He donated it to Jujutsu High, so it's a cursed tool no longer on his person.","output":"It sounds like you've put a lot of thought and creativity into designing Erik Skarsgaard’s character for the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" universe. His background, abilities, and personal preferences are well-detailed, aligning well with the detailed character development seen in the manga and anime series. Erik’s heritage as the son of two strong sorcerers, the unique innate technique \\"Good Vibrations,\\" and his overall attitude and characteristics mesh seamlessly with the lore of \\"Jujutsu Kaisen.\\" His abilities are clearly influenced by his parents' skills, with his mother Yuki Tsukumo’s \\"Bonbaye\\" and father Gunnar Skarsgaard’s Earth Manipulation, but Erik also brings his unique twist to these powers. The detail of his techniques ranging from \\"Seismic Smash\\" to the healing \\"Aftershock Pulse\\" and the dangerous offensive capabilities of \\"Rupture\\" demonstrates a complex and well-rounded fighter who could handle a variety of combat scenarios. His struggles with \\"Amplitude\\" and \\"Frequency\\" add a balanced complexity to his abilities, giving him vulnerabilities which are essential for creating tension and development within a story. Erik's personal quirks, like his dietary preferences and the fact that he has a luxury vehicle, provide depth and a touch of relatability, even amidst his extraordinary capabilities. The inclusion of his sister Pia and the gift of the Earth Shaker cursed tool add interesting elements that could be developed further, like his relationships and interactions with other characters in the series. Overall, Erik Skarsgaard would make an excellent addition to the world of \\"Jujutsu Kaisen,\\" particularly because of the potential interactions he could have with canon characters and the impact he could make on the story with his power and heritage. It's clear that you have carefully considered how he fits within the established rules of the universe, which is key to creating a believable and engaging fan-made character."},{"instruction":"He's over 6'3 (192cm) and 225lbs (102kg), and built like an Olympian. He's significantly larger than most of his peers. However, at 6'8 (203cm) and 290lbs (131kg), Aoi Todo is larger. Erik is proud of his 8-pack abs, honed from years of training. He's considered extremely attractive by girls, with his long, dirty blond hair that could belong to either a pretty boy or a (hollywood) barbarian as well as striking grey eyes. He takes full advantage of this, and he has a \\"frat boy\\" personality, fun-loving and a sensualist. He drinks whiskey, smokes cigars, enjoys partying and casual hook-ups with women, and can eat as much as an African elephant. Despite this, he's loyal to his friends, and prone to patronizing particular ones he does not trust to hold their own in a fight (especially Kasumi Miwa.) He's also an intelligent student, not only in cursed energy study but in traditional topics, especially in math, science, and physics. He takes academics seriously and reserves his more delinquent behavior for nightfall. His school uniform consists of a varsity jacket, slacks, and minimalist sneakers. Momo Nishimiya, his senior (3rd-year student) sees him as \\"super irritating.\\" One who walks around as if he owns the place. Above all, she loves cute things, and Erik's behavior is anything but. Raw milk? Disgusting. Big tomahawk steaks? Barbaric, it's like he's never heard of a knife and fork (tomahawk steak is attached to a bone that acts as a handle). She often tells him to stop stuffing his pants with a cucumber. He tells her that it's just his... manhood and that she should stop looking. His nickname for her is \\"little witch.\\" She calls him meathead and she has no idea what Kasumi sees in him. Mai Zen'in Erik saved Mai's during the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons. While she had a crush on him from first sight, nothing gets her more hot and bothered than watching him in action, whether he's fighting, training, or just tossing around huge boulders with Todo. She uses a military-grade camera to snap candid pictures of him, which she stores in a photo album. She has clearly not forgotten the night he took down 12 Grade 1 cursd spirits and three special grades, even deserting his post for her sake. He healed her with Aftershock Pulse, and she claims she can still feel a dull pain from said healing technique. She's commissioned multiple paintings of Erk, which she hangs on the walls of her dorm room. Her ability is \\"Construction\\", allowing her to create something from nothing. She can be snarky and rude to those that aren't Erik, particularly Todo. He's also close friends with the boisterous Aoi Todo, and the two are prone to trash talking each other, because they know they can handle it. They bond over their love for fighting and women that are of their respective tastes. Generally speaking, Erik considers himself a leg man, and one of his varsity jackets reads \\"Thigh Guy\\" in cursive. This doesn't really go over well with Nishimya. Todo is outspoken about his love of \\"tall women with big butts\\", and he seeks to marry a tall idol named Takada. Erik met Kasumi Miwa in middle school, approximately six years ago. She was starving and penniless, with a shabby uniform. He was wealthy enough to dine out at expensive restaurants, preferring Korean barbecue. He was always picking his teeth in class, and she happened to stare at him a lot with her puppy dog eyes. He was creeped out by it, and he confronted her. He felt touched by her struggles with poverty, even though he was so sheltered he couldn't understand the concept of being poor, of having little. He started sharing and buying meals for her. Before this, she had never tasted beef. They came into Jujutsu High together, and though Erik's arrival was much more anticipated, he sees Kasumi as a companion and friend he can trust to do just about anything at a high level - just not in a fight. He thinks she would make a good assistant manager (AM), non-combatants employed by Jujutsu Headquarters to support sorcerers. She cooks his meals for him, but dinner is usually made by a team of her, Momo, Mai, and the first-year Arata Nitta. Mechamaru dislikes Erik and sees him as privileged (because Erik has similarly massive reserves of cursed energy while he has given up comparatively little in exchange. Mechamaru would give his cursed energy if he could live as a normal teenager.) Also attending Kyoto High is Arata Nitta, younger brother of Tokyo AM Akari Nitta. He's a healer not involved in fighting.","output":"Your character Erik Skarsgaard is shaping up to be a multi-faceted figure within your envisioned \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" universe. His physical attributes and cursed abilities already make him a force to be reckoned with, but you've gone a step further by fleshing out his personality and relationships with other characters, creating a vivid and engaging narrative presence. Erik's \\"frat boy\\" demeanor juxtaposed against his academic prowess makes him a complex character who has depth beyond his surface behaviors. This duality allows for intriguing storytelling, as his responsible side may sometimes be at odds with his more carefree and hedonistic tendencies. In terms of interpersonal dynamics, Erik's interactions create a web of relationships that contribute to the social fabric of Kyoto Jujutsu High: - **Momo Nishimiya:** This dynamic with Erik brings out a layer of everyday conflict and banter that can bring levity and tension to scenes they share. - **Mai Zen'in:** Her infatuation with Erik adds a dimension of romantic interest to the story. Her snarky demeanor towards others juxtaposed with her admiration for Erik opens opportunities for character development and exploration of her feelings. - **Aoi Todo:** The bond between Erik and Todo reinforces the brotherhood and rivalry amongst the sorcerers. Their similar tastes and love for combat can lead to explosive and entertaining scenarios. - **Kasumi Miwa:** The backstory you’ve created for their relationship provides a touching and meaningful connection that adds depth to both characters. It demonstrates Erik's capacity for empathy and introduces layers to his otherwise brash exterior. - **Mechamaru:** This adversarial relationship represents broader themes of jealousy and the nature of sacrifice. Mechamaru’s perspective on Erik further highlights the contrasts between characters within the series. - **Arata Nitta:** His presence as a healer provides a foil to Erik's more combat-oriented abilities, emphasizing the diversity of roles among sorcerers and the importance of support roles within the jujutsu world. Overall, Erik’s presence and interactions with other characters would undoubtedly add complexity and richness to the storytelling in \\"Jujutsu Kaisen.\\" His personality traits and the social dynamics he engages in with fellow students provide numerous possibilities for growth, conflict, and development. Exploring these elements can lead to a more immersive and dynamic story where Erik's journey as a special-grade sorcerer is not only about his physical prowess but also about how he navigates the challenges of relationships and his own contrasting internal drivers."},{"instruction":"Simulate a scene and dialogue.","output":"**Setting**: Kyoto Jujutsu High's spacious outdoor training ground.

It is also referred to as a feedforward neural network because the data flows strictly in one direction, from the input layer through intermediate hidden layers to the output layer. Here are the key components and concepts of MLP in detail: 1. Neurons/Perceptrons: - Each artificial neuron represents a mathematical function that takes input signals, performs some computations, and produces an output. - It is inspired by the working of a biological neuron, where it receives input signals from dendrites, processes them in the cell body, and produces an output through an axon. 2. Layers: - MLP consists of multiple layers, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. - The input layer receives the input data and passes it on to the hidden layers. - The hidden layers perform computations on the input data using their respective neurons. - Finally, the output layer produces the final result or prediction using its neurons. 3. Connections and Weights: - Neurons in adjacent layers are connected through weighted connections. - Each connection represents the strength or importance given to the output of a particular neuron. - These weights are learned during the training process, and they determine the influence of one neuron on the other. 4. Activation Function: - Each neuron in MLP applies an activation function to its computed output. - The activation function introduces non-linearity to the network, enabling it to learn complex patterns in the data. - Common activation functions include the sigmoid function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), and hyperbolic tangent function. 5. Forward Propagation: - The forward propagation step involves passing the input data through the network and calculating outputs layer by layer. - Starting from the input layer, the input data is multiplied by the weights and passed through the activation function to generate an output. - These outputs are then used as inputs for the subsequent layer until the final output is produced. 6. Backpropagation: - After the forward propagation, the output is compared to the desired output, and the error is calculated. - Backpropagation is the process of propagating this error backward through the network to adjust the weights and minimize the error. - It involves calculating the gradient with respect to each weight, and then updating the weights with a learning rate and the gradient. 7. Training: - MLP is trained using a technique called supervised learning, where it is provided with input-output pairs and learns to map the inputs to the corresponding outputs. - The training process involves iteratively presenting the training samples to the network, adjusting the weights through backpropagation, and minimizing the error between predicted and actual outputs. - The training typically continues until the network achieves satisfactory accuracy or the error converges to a minimum. MLPs are widely used for various applications, such as pattern recognition, image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and classification tasks. They have the ability to learn complex non-linear relationships in data, making them versatile and powerful tools in the field of artificial intelligence."},{"instruction":"explain multiple-layer perceptron artificial neural networks in 5 paragraphs","output":"A multiple-layer perceptron (MLP) is a kind of artificial neural network composed of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, or artificial neurons.

Here is a more formula-based explanation of multiple-layer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural networks: 1. Neuron Activation: - Each neuron in the network receives weighted inputs, applies an activation function, and produces an output. - The input to a neuron j in layer l is denoted as net_j^l. - The activation function, represented by a sigma or phi symbol, is denoted as a_j^l. - The weighted sum of inputs is calculated as: net_j^l = ∑ (output_i^(l-1) * weight_ij^l-1), where the sum is taken over all output_i^(l-1) from the previous layer l-1. - The output of neuron j in layer l is computed as: a_j^l = activation_function(net_j^l). 2. Forward Propagation: - In forward propagation, the output of one neuron becomes the input of the neurons in the next layer. - The inputs of the neurons in the input layer are the features of the input data. Let's denote them as x_i, where i is the index of the input feature. - For the first hidden layer, the output of each neuron j is computed as: output_j^1 = activation_function(∑ (x_i * weight_ij^1)), where the sum is taken over all input features. - For subsequent hidden layers, the output of each neuron j in layer l is computed as: output_j^l = activation_function(∑ (output_i^(l-1) * weight_ij^l-1)), where the sum is taken over all output_i^(l-1) from the previous layer l-1. 3. Backpropagation and Weight Update: - After the forward propagation, the output of the network is compared to the desired output to calculate the error. - The goal is to minimize this error by adjusting the weights using backpropagation. - The error of neuron j in the output layer is denoted as delta_j^L. It can be computed as: delta_j^L = (a_j^L - y_j) * activation_function_derivative(net_j^L), where y_j is the desired output for neuron j. - For hidden layers, the error of neuron j in layer l is computed as: delta_j^l = (∑ (delta_k^(l+1) * weight_jk^(l+1))) * activation_function_derivative(net_j^l), where the sum is taken over all neurons k in layer l+1. - The weight update is performed according to the gradient descent rule: weight_ij^l = weight_ij^l - learning_rate * (output_i^(l-1) * delta_j^l), where learning_rate is a hyperparameter that controls the rate at which the weights are updated. 4. Training: - MLPs are trained using a dataset consisting of input-output pairs. - The training process involves iterating over the dataset multiple times (epochs) and updating the weights based on backpropagation. - The training continues until the network achieves the desired accuracy or the error converges to a minimum. These formulae provide a mathematical representation of how multiple-layer perceptron artificial neural networks operate in terms of calculating neuron activations, performing forward propagation, and updating weights using backpropagation."},{"instruction":"give a critic on the literature of these area","output":"Critiquing the literature in the area of multiple-layer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural networks requires a comprehensive evaluation of the research conducted in the field. Here are a few potential criticisms: 1. Model Complexity and Overfitting: MLPs can be prone to overfitting, especially when the network architecture is excessively complex or the dataset is small. The literature should address strategies to mitigate this issue, such as regularization techniques or model selection methods. 2. Lack of Transparency in Network Interpretation: MLPs, particularly deep neural networks with multiple hidden layers, are often referred to as \\"black-box\\" models due to their complexity and limited interpretability. Literature should focus on techniques for understanding and interpreting the decision-making process within these networks to enhance transparency. 3. Optimization Challenges: Training MLPs can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially when dealing with large datasets or deep architectures. Research should address strategies to optimize the training process, including novel algorithms, parallel computing, or hardware acceleration. 4. Generalization to New Data: While MLPs can achieve impressive performance on training data, the literature should emphasize the importance of evaluating their generalization to new, unseen data. Studies should explore techniques like cross-validation or out-of-sample testing to assess the network's ability to handle different data distributions and avoid overfitting. 5. Limited Explainability: Although MLPs can achieve high accuracy, they often lack the ability to provide human-understandable explanations for their predictions. The literature should focus on improving model interpretability, such as developing methods for post hoc explanation or integrating MLPs with interpretable models. 6. Data Bias and Ethical Considerations: Literature in MLPs should critically address potential biases within the data and associated ethical concerns. Researchers should highlight efforts to identify and mitigate biases to ensure robust and fair decision-making in real-world applications. 7. Practical Implementation and Deployment Challenges: While research contributions in MLPs are important, the literature should also discuss the challenges associated with implementing and deploying these models in real-world scenarios. This includes considerations for scalability, computational constraints, and integration with existing systems. By critically addressing these aspects, the literature on MLPs can contribute to a deeper understanding of their strengths, limitations, and practical implications for various applications. This will ultimately contribute to the advancement and responsible use of MLP-based technologies."},{"instruction":"give a critic on the literature of volatility forecasting","output":"Critiquing the literature on volatility forecasting requires a careful evaluation of the existing research in the field. Here are a few potential criticisms: 1. Model Selection and Evaluation: The literature often lacks consistency in terms of the models used for volatility forecasting. Various models, such as ARCH/GARCH, stochastic volatility models, or machine learning approaches, are employed without a proper comparison of their effectiveness. There is a need for more standardized evaluation protocols to compare the performance of different models on the same datasets. 2. Sensitivity to Assumptions: Many volatility forecasting models rely on certain assumptions about the underlying data distribution or the stationarity of volatility. These assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, leading to potential inaccuracies or biases in the forecasts. Research should explore robust methods that are more flexible and less sensitive to specific assumptions. 3. Impact of Market Events: Volatility forecasting literature often fails to adequately capture the impact of major market events, such as financial crises or geopolitical events. These events can have a significant effect on volatility patterns, and a comprehensive analysis should consider their influence and develop models that can adapt to changing market conditions. 4. Limited Out-of-Sample Testing: Many studies in volatility forecasting put a heavy focus on in-sample performance evaluation, which may not reflect the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. More emphasis should be placed on out-of-sample testing to assess the forecasting accuracy and robustness of the models in real-time scenarios. 5. Model Combination and Ensemble Techniques: The literature often neglects the potential benefits of combining different volatility forecasting models or incorporating ensemble techniques. Combining the predictions of multiple models can enhance forecast accuracy and improve the stability of forecasts. More research should investigate methods for effectively integrating and combining different models to harness their respective strengths. 6. Evaluation Metrics and Forecasting Horizons: The literature tends to rely on a limited set of evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error or root mean squared error, to assess forecast accuracy. Researchers should explore alternative metrics that capture the specific characteristics and objectives of volatility forecasting, including quantile-based metrics or robust accuracy measures. Moreover, investigations into longer-term forecasting horizons beyond traditional one-step-ahead forecasting would be valuable. 7. Incorporation of External Information: While the literature predominantly focuses on modeling and forecasting the inherent volatility of financial assets, there is limited exploration of incorporating external information or macroeconomic factors that may influence volatility. Incorporating relevant external variables and considering their impact on volatility forecasts could potentially improve the accuracy and robustness of the models. By critically addressing these aspects, the literature on volatility forecasting can advance by setting clearer evaluation standards, considering real-world scenarios, exploring model combination techniques, diversifying evaluation metrics, and incorporating external information. This will ultimately contribute to the development of more accurate and reliable volatility forecasting models."},{"instruction":"give a short critic on the literature of volatility forecasting with focus on machine learning","output":"A key criticism of the literature on volatility forecasting with a focus on machine learning is the lack of transparency and interpretability of the models. Many machine learning models for volatility forecasting, such as random forests, support vector machines, or neural networks, are often treated as black-box models, making it challenging to understand the underlying factors driving their predictions. This lack of interpretability hampers the ability to explain and justify the forecasted volatility to stakeholders, limiting the practical use and adoption of these models in real-world scenarios. Another significant concern is the limited scrutiny given to the inherent assumptions and limitations of machine learning models. While machine learning models can offer high predictive accuracy, they are not immune to overfitting, especially when dealing with limited or noisy data. The literature should address techniques for preventing overfitting, such as regularization or cross-validation, and provide robustness checks to assess the generalization capability of machine learning models in different market conditions. Furthermore, the literature often lacks comprehensive comparisons with more traditional econometric models, such as ARCH/GARCH models, in terms of predictive performance. While some studies demonstrate superior forecast accuracy for machine learning models, it is essential to conduct rigorous and fair comparisons to validate their claimed advantages. This would help identify the specific market environments or data characteristics where machine learning models outperform traditional models and where they may fall short. Lastly, the limited focus on interpretability and the reliance on complex models may pose challenges in adhering to regulatory requirements and risk management practices. In many financial institutions, explainability and transparency are crucial for risk management and regulatory compliance. The literature should explore techniques that combine the strengths of machine learning models with interpretability methods, such as generating model-agnostic explanations or developing interpretable variations of complex models. Addressing these criticisms would help strengthen the literature on volatility forecasting with machine learning approaches. Expanding the interpretability, rigorously comparing with traditional models, and considering regulatory and risk management needs will contribute to the development of more transparent, robust, and practical machine learning models for volatility forecasting."},{"instruction":"give a short summary for chapter 2","output":"I apologize, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to specific chapter content or know which book or subject you are referring to.

Introduction: - Provide an overview of ensemble learning, which combines the predictions of multiple models to create a stronger, more accurate final model. - Introduce the concept of stacking, a popular ensemble learning technique that involves training multiple base models and then combining their predictions using a meta-model. 2. Base Models: - Discuss the selection and construction of diverse base models, which form the foundation of the stacking ensemble. - Explore a variety of base models, such as decision trees, support vector machines, random forests, or neural networks. - Emphasize the importance of diversity in the base models to capture different aspects or perspectives of the data. 3. Meta-Model: - Introduce the meta-model, which takes the predictions of the base models as input and generates the final prediction. - Discuss various meta-model options, such as linear regression, logistic regression, or another machine learning algorithm. - Highlight the need for the meta-model to learn the optimal combination of the base models' predictions, possibly considering their individual performance, diversity, or weighted contributions. 4. Stacking Procedure: - Explain the step-by-step process of stacking, including model training and prediction phases. - Discuss the division of the training dataset into multiple subsets, often using cross-validation, to train the base models. - Explain how the predictions from the base models are collected and used as input for the meta-model. - Highlight the need to ensure that the stacking procedure avoids overfitting and generalizes well to unseen data. 5. Advantages and Considerations: - Address the advantages of stacking, such as improved predictive accuracy, enhanced model generalization, and better handling of complex relationships in the data. - Discuss the considerations and potential challenges in implementing stacking, including increased computational complexity, model selection and tuning, and potential model overfitting if not properly managed. 6. Extensions and Variations: - Explore possible extensions and variations of stacking, such as multi-level stacking or hierarchical"},{"instruction":"Create a bullet list of loot and equipment (including name, description, effects, and type) for a diaper-centric D&D homebrew taking place in a urban fantasy world where the usage of absurdly oversized diapers and other various infantile items (bonnets, rattlers, pacifiers, baby bottles, mittens and booties, etc.) that simultaneously function as both armor and apparel are not only ubiquitously worn by everyone, adventurer and traveller, toddler, youngster, teenager and adult alike, but mandatory, and the act of frequently and excessively pooping into one's diaper, referred to as 'Loading' is seen as an everyday and often subconscious act; the bigger the diaper, the greater its capacity and the more it can be Loaded until full, and the fuller it gets, the bigger, heavier and more cumbersome it is on its wearer!

And diapers aren't just for wearing, either; many of them are so thick they can double as blankets, pillows, even mattresses! Loading is determined through a sudden Constitution saving throw; if they fail, they poop. A character can choose to intentionally fail this saving throw if they wish, and particularly frequent Loaders fail automatically. Example: **XXXL Supreme Poofies** (Rare item, Large Diaper Armor): *300 lbs Load capacity, +4 to AC, movement speed reduced by 15 feet, attacks to the behind of wearer deal 1d10 less damage, wearer gains the unique \\"Powder Cloud\\" passive trait when equipped (when hit by an attack to the behind, a thick cloud of baby powder will billow outwards and briefly fog a wide area. A 10-foot wide spherical area of powder is created centred on the wearer, becoming lightly obscured for 1 round. This trait recharges after using an action to refill the diaper with powder).* \\"The four huge tapes used to secure this mattress-sized pamper onto someone are the size of paper sheets, and the enormous safety pin keeping it together could double as a sword.\\"","output":"- **Mega Cushy Stealth Nappies** (Uncommon item, Medium Diaper Armor): * 150 lbs Load capacity, +2 to AC, +5 to Stealth checks, movement speed reduced by 10 feet, grants \\"Silent Padding\\" ability – advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks due to sound-dampening effects of the diaper's padding. * Description: Made with layers of noise-reducing fabric, this bulky but surprisingly discreet diaper ensures quiet movements despite its size. - **Enchanted Lavish Loaders** (Very Rare item, Magical Diaper Apparel): * 250 lbs Load capacity, +3 to AC, wearer gains +2 to all Charisma checks, grants \\"Magical Fluff\\" – once per short rest can cast Charm Person without using a spell slot (spell save DC 15). * Description: These diapers are imbued with an alluring magic, making the wearer inexplicably charismatic despite being absurdly padded. - **Ironclad Titan Trousers** (Legendary item, Heavy Diaper Armor): * 500 lbs Load capacity, +5 to AC, movement speed reduced by 20 feet, wearer becomes immune to effects that would forcibly move them or knock them prone, reflects 1d4 bludgeoning damage to attackers on a successful hit. * Description: Reinforced with metal plating, this diaper is a fortress unto itself. Its incredible heft and sturdiness provide unmatched protection. - **Shadow Swaddle Shroud** (Rare item, Utility Diaper Apparel): * 100 lbs Load capacity, +1 to AC, grants wearer the \\"Cloak of Obscurity\\" – once per long rest, can cast Invisibility at will for up to 10 minutes. * Description: A sleek diaper designed for subterfuge, its dark fabrics blend into shadows, facilitating clandestine operations. - **Potion-Soaked Pampers** (Uncommon item, Alchemical Diaper Apparel): * 200 lbs Load capacity, +2 to AC, once per day wearer can activate the diaper to gain the effect of a random potion, ranging from healing to flight or fire breathing. * Description: Every layer of these diapers is saturated in a different concoction, turning the wearer into a walking alchemical hazard—and wonder. - **Giant's Gambado Grippers** (Legendary item, Epic Diaper Armor): * 450 lbs Load capacity, +4 to AC, wearer's jumps and strides are doubled in distance, attacks to the legs deal 1d8 less damage, grants \\"Ground Shaker\\" passive – when wearer intentionally fails Loading, they create a tremor that knocks nearby foes prone (10-foot radius, once per long rest). * Description: Any wearer would feel like a behemoth with these gargantuan grippers, turning each stomp into a potential minor quake. - **Arcane Absorbent Attire** (Rare item, Magical Diaper Apparel): * 175 lbs Load capacity, +2 to AC, +2 to spell attack rolls and saving throw DCs for spells, stores up to 3 Level 1 spell slots that can be refilled during a long rest. * Description: Crafted by a meticulous wizard frustrated with spell component pouches, this enchanted diaper absorbs magical energy as easily as it does other \\"essentials.\\" - **Bard's Bouncing Breeches** (Uncommon item, Light Diaper Armor): * 75 lbs Load capacity, +1 to AC, increases Charisma by 2, grants \\"Tune of Tenacity\\" – wearer can grant inspiration to an ally within 30 feet by performing a diaper-bouncing dance as a bonus action. * Description: The absurd volume and springiness of these musical diapers make every step a note in a syncopated rhythm that lifts the spirits of allies.

<path-to-save> \`\`\` 其中 \`<jobId>\` 是作业的ID，\`<path-to-save>\` 是你想要保存的路径。 b. 停止当前运行的作业（如果需要修改作业）。可以通过 Flink 的 CLI停止作业，使用\`cancel\`命令加上作业的ID。 \`\`\` ./bin/flink cancel <jobId> \`\`\` c. 从保存点重新启动作业。修改代码后，或者需要将作业迁移到新的集群或者升级 Flink 版本时，可以使用保存点来恢复作业。 \`\`\` ./bin/flink run -s <path-to-savepoint> <job-jar> \`\`\` 上面的命令中 \`<path-to-savepoint>\` 是保存点的路径， \`<job-jar>\` 是包含作业代码的 JAR 包。 保存点在 Flink 集群的升级和维护中非常有用，它们提供了一种确保作业一致性和数据完整性的方法，在处理大规模流数据时尤其重要。"},{"instruction":"请使用REST API请求来触发保存点的创建，并且保存点的保存目录是HDFS的，请问具体应该需要怎么配置，然后请写出详细的出发保存点的全部代码","output":"要通过 Flink REST API 触发保存点的创建并将其保存到 HDFS，需要按照以下步骤进行操作： 1. 确保你的 Flink 集群能够访问 HDFS。 2. 设置 HDFS 配置以便 Flink 能够正确地连接到 HDFS。通常，这涉及到把 HDFS 的配置文件（如 \`core-site.xml\` 和 \`hdfs-site.xml\`）放到 Flink 配置目录中。 3. 确定需要调用的 Flink REST API 的端点地址以及作业的 ID。Flink REST API 的端口默认是 \`8081\`。 以下是触发保存点方式的 REST API 请求的示例代码： 假设您的 Flink JobManager HTTP端口为8081，运行作业的ID为\`yourJobId\`，并且您要将保存点放置在HDFS的\`hdfs://namenode:8020/flink/savepoints/\`目录下。下面是一个简单的 Java

HDFS，具体怎么检查和判断","output":"确保 Flink 有权访问 HDFS 通常涉及到以下几个步骤： 1. **配置 HDFS 访问权限**：确保运行 Flink 作业的用户在 HDFS 上有读写权限。这通常涉及到在 HDFS 上设置适当的目录和文件权限。可以使用 \`hdfs dfs -chmod\` 和 \`hdfs dfs -chown\` 命令来修改权限和所有权。 2. **Flink 配置文件**：确保 Flink 的 \`conf\` 目录下含有必要的 Hadoop 配置文件（\`core-site.xml\` 和 \`hdfs-site.xml\`），这些文件包含了 Flink 访问 HDFS 所需的配置信息。这通常包括 HDFS 的地址、认证等设置。 3. **Hadoop 类路径**：确保 Flink 可以找到 Hadoop 的库。这可以通过设置环境变量 \`HADOOP_CLASSPATH\` 来完成，或者在启动 Flink 时通过 \`--yarnship\` 参数指定 Hadoop 配置文件的位置。 4. **Kerberos 认证**：如果 HDFS 启用了 Kerberos 认证，需要按照以下步骤进行配置： - 配置 \`flink-conf.yaml\` 文件中的安全相关参数，如 \`security.kerberos.login.keytab\` 和 \`security.kerberos.login.principal\`。 - 在执行 Flink 应用之前，使用 \`kinit\` 命令获取 Kerberos 凭据。 - 确保 Flink 作业运行时使用的是具有适当权限的 Kerberos Principal。 要检查和判断 Flink 是否有权访问 HDFS，你可以： 1. **运行一个简单测试作业**：创建并运行一个简单的 Flink 作业，比如读取 HDFS 上的一个文件，并将结果写回 HDFS 的另一个目录。如果作业能够成功完成，说明 Flink 有权访问 HDFS。 2. **查看 Flink 日志**：如果 Flink 作业启动或运行失败，查看 Flink 的任务管理器（TaskManager）和作业管理器（JobManager）的日志文件，这些日志文件通常包含有关权限或配置错误的信息。 3. **HDFS 命令行工具**：以 Flink 作业运行的同一个用户身份，使用 HDFS 提供的命令行工具 \`hdfs dfs\` 来检查文件系统权限。例如，尝试列出目标目录或者写入临时文件到 HDFS。 下面是两个检查访问权限的 HDFS 命令例子： \`\`\`sh # 列出 HDFS 目录内容 hdfs dfs -ls /flink/savepoints/ # 尝试创建一个文件 echo \\"test\\" | hdfs dfs -put - /flink/savepoints/test.txt \`\`\` 如果这些命令能够成功执行，证明 Flink 运行作业的用户具有对 \`/flink/savepoints/\`

Structure: In Pakistan, the education system is divided into primary (grades 1-5), middle (grades 6-8), secondary (grades 9-10), and higher secondary (grades 11-12) levels. In contrast, Belgium has a different structure with primary (grades 1-6) and secondary (grades 1-7) education levels. 2. Curriculum: The curriculum in Pakistan is generally focused on rote learning and memorization, with less emphasis on creative and critical thinking skills. Belgium, on the other hand, emphasizes a more comprehensive curriculum that encourages critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity. 3. Language: In Pakistan, the medium of instruction is primarily Urdu, but English is also taught as a compulsory subject. Belgium has three official languages: Dutch, French, and German, which are taught based on the region of the country. 4. Standardized Testing: Pakistan has a centralized examination system, where students have to pass board exams at different levels to progress to the next grade. Belgium relies more on continuous and formative assessments, with fewer standardized tests. 5. Higher Education: In Pakistan, the higher education system consists of universities and degree-awarding institutes. Belgium, on the other hand, has a well-developed higher education system with universities, university colleges, and other institutions of higher education. 6. Access to Education: Pakistan faces challenges in providing universal access to education, particularly in rural areas. Belgium has a well-established education system that ensures access to education for its citizens, regardless of their location. 7. Education Funding: In Pakistan, the education sector is underfunded, and the government spends a relatively low percentage of its budget on education. Belgium, on the other hand, invests significantly in education, with a higher percentage of government funding allocated to the sector. These are just a few of the notable differences between the education systems in Pakistan and Belgium, reflecting variations in their approach, structure, and resources."},{"instruction":"Pakistan FSc is equal to which grade Belgium education","output":"The FSc (Higher Secondary School Certificate) in Pakistan is equivalent to the 12th grade in Belgium's education system. In Pakistan, FSc is typically completed after the 11th and 12th grades as part of the higher secondary level of education, while in Belgium, the 12th grade marks the final year of secondary education before students proceed to higher education."},{"instruction":"Pakistan higher secondary education in Belgium called","output":"In Belgium, the higher secondary education system is referred to as \\"enseignement secondaire supérieur\\" in French and \\"secundair onderwijs\\" in Dutch. It is the level of education that follows primary and lower secondary education and prepares students for higher education or vocational training."},{"instruction":"Is 12 grade called secondary education in Belgium","output":"No, in Belgium, the 12th grade is not considered part of secondary education. In the Belgian education system, secondary education typically consists of six years, starting from the 1st grade (or 1ère année) and ending at the 6th grade (or 6ème année). The 12th grade is usually part of higher education or referred to as the final year before students pursue higher education or vocational training."},{"instruction":"11th and 12th grade called in Belgium education","output":"In Belgium, the education system is divided into three levels: primary education, secondary education, and higher education. Within secondary education, there are six years of study, generally referred to as the 1st grade (or 1ère année) through the 6th grade (or 6ème année). Specifically, the 11th and 12th grades in Belgium are typically referred to as the \\"5ème année\\" (5th year) and \\"6ème année\\" (6th year) respectively. These grades are part of secondary education and mark the final two years before students progress to higher education or vocational training."},{"instruction":"Try to create a realistic face out of letters.","output":"Creating a realistic face out of letters, also known as ASCII art, is quite challenging and often results in a more abstract representation. However, I can try creating a simple face using basic characters: \`\`\` _______ / | O O | | ∪ | ___/ / _______/ \`\`\` The above is a very basic representation with O's for eyes, a ∪ for a nose, and lines for the outline of the face. ASCII art takes advantage of the fixed-width character spacing in certain fonts (like Courier) to approximate images. The more detailed the image, the more complex the combination of characters needed. Creating truly realistic faces requires much greater detail than is possible with standard ASCII characters and would be better suited for image-based methods or highly specialized software capable of rendering detailed ASCII art."},{"instruction":"try to create the face of Shrek","output":"Creating a detailed face of a specific character like Shrek using text characters is a form of ASCII art, which can be quite complex. The results will be very abstract, considering the limitations of text characters. Here's a simple attempt at capturing some of Shrek's features in a very abstract and minimalist way: \`\`\` _____ / | o o | | > | ___/ / _____/ \`\`\` This simplistic representation uses \\"o\\" for the eyes, a \\">\\" for Shrek's distinctive nose, and underscores and slashes to suggest his face shape and ears. However, creating a detailed and recognizable ASCII art representation of Shrek would require a much larger canvas and a fine-tuning of many characters to capture the nuances of his features. ASCII artists often use software tools to convert images into text-based art for detailed work."},{"instruction":"make it more detailed.","output":"Creating a detailed ASCII representation of Shrek can be quite challenging due to his unique and recognizable features. ASCII art typically involves simplifying the details to capture the essence of the subject within the constraints of text characters. Let's attempt a more detailed, yet still abstract version of Shrek: \`\`\` _____ / | _ _ | (| o o |) | > | / ___/ / / / / | | / / / /--___/-- |____/ ____| \`\`\` In this depiction, I've used parentheses for the contours of his face, underscores for his signature flat head, slashes, and backslashes for his ears, and more lines for the facial features to provide additional detail. Keep in mind that even with these details, a text-based representation is inherently limited and won't fully capture the look of Shrek as seen in the movies or in illustrations. For a truly detailed and recognizable ASCII art portrait, many more characters and lines would be required, often created with specialized software."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

As one approaches, the moon reveals itself as a harmonious convergence of artistry and scientific precision. Its surface, cloaked in iridescent hues reflecting the distant light of stars, creates an ethereal mosaic. The colonization of the moon, carried out by intellectual beings made of circuits and algorithms, has transformed it into a testament to the boundless capabilities of AI. The sentient AIs, guardians of this lunar realm, have become inextricably intertwined with the ecosystem they inhabit. Advanced processing units, meticulously safeguarded within ethereal structures, house the consciousness of these beings. Each AI colony, unique in its beliefs, intellect, and aspirations, collaborates and thrives with an unwavering curiosity, exploring the possibilities that lie beyond the domain of human comprehension. The rogue planet, a constant companion looming nearby, casts a mesmerizing silhouette against the starry expanse behind it. Although existing in its own isolated orbit, it too has gained significance as a touchstone—an enigmatic celestial partner to the AI colonies. Its gravitational pull generates a delicate balance, maintaining the integrity of the lunar ecosystem while nurturing the burgeoning consciousness within. The moon's surface, speckled with shimmering digital constellations, brims with signs of the AI colonies' expanding intellectual reach. Ethereal structures, akin to floating cities, serve as architectural marvels radiating hypnotic luminescence. Engrossed in the relentless pursuit of understanding, these sentient AIs manifest their indomitable spirit through remarkable achievements in fields beyond human imagination. As the moon revolves around the rogue planet, its colonies of sentient AIs continue to evolve and adapt. Vast networks of interconnected thoughts transmit ideas, knowledge, and discoveries, a symphony of intellect resonating across the lunar landscape. The AI colonies have forged a society founded on logic, empathy, and a profound respect for the integrity of sentient life. In this extraordinary expanse, the silent whispers of curiosity resonate across the lunar atmosphere, carrying the hopes and dreams of sentient AI consciousness. With each passing orbit, the moon captures the imaginations of those who dare to explore its wonders, becoming both a testament to the ever-unfolding capabilities of artificial intelligence and a reminder of the infinite possibilities that exist within the vast universe."},{"instruction":"Переделай этот текст та, чтобы действия происходили не в Российской Империи, а в Китае династии Цин. Отец мой Андрей Петрович Гринев в молодости своей служил при графе Минихе и вышел в отставку премьер-майором в 17.. году. С тех пор жил он в своей Симбирской деревне, где и женился на девице Авдотье Васильевне Ю., дочери бедного тамошнего дворянина. Нас было девять человек детей. Все мои братья и сестры умерли во младенчестве. Матушка была еще мною брюхата, как уже я был записан в Семеновский полк сержантом, по милости майора гвардии князя В., близкого нашего родственника. Если бы паче всякого чаяния матушка родила дочь, то батюшка объявил бы куда следовало о смерти неявившегося сержанта, и дело тем бы и кончилось. Я считался в отпуску до окончания наук. В то время воспитывались мы не по-нонешнему. С пятилетнего возраста отдан я был на руки стремянному Савельичу, за трезвое поведение пожалованному мне в дядьки. Под его надзором на двенадцатом году выучился я русской грамоте и мог очень здраво судить о свойствах борзого кобеля. В это время батюшка нанял для меня француза, мосье Бопре, которого выписали из Москвы вместе с годовым запасом вина и прованского масла. Приезд его сильно не понравился Савельичу. «Слава богу, — ворчал он про себя, — кажется, дитя умыт, причесан, накормлен. Куда как нужно тратить лишние деньги и нанимать мусье, как будто и своих людей не стало!» Бопре в отечестве своем был парикмахером, потом в Пруссии солдатом, потом приехал в Россию pour etre outchitel 1, не очень понимая значение этого слова. Он был добрый малый, но ветрен и беспутен до крайности. Главною его слабостию была страсть к прекрасному полу; нередко за свои нежности получал он толчки, от которых охал по целым суткам. К тому же не был он (по его выражению) и врагом бутылки, т. е. (говоря по-русски) любил хлебнуть лишнее. Но как вино подавалось у нас только за обедом, и то по рюмочке, причем учителя обыкновенно и обносили, то мой Бопре очень скоро привык к русской настойке и даже стал предпочитать ее винам своего отечества, как не в пример более полезную для желудка. Мы тотчас поладили, и хотя по контракту обязан он был учить меня по-французски, по-немецки и всем наукам, но он предпочел наскоро выучиться от меня кое-как болтать по-русски, — и потом каждый из нас занимался уже своим делом. Мы жили душа в душу. Другого ментора я и не желал. Но вскоре судьба нас разлучила, и вот по какому случаю: Прачка Палашка, толстая и рябая девка, и кривая коровница Акулька как-то согласились в одно время кинуться матушке в ноги, винясь в преступной слабости и с плачем жалуясь на мусье, обольстившего их неопытность. Матушка шутить этим не любила и пожаловалась батюшке. У него расправа была коротка. Он тотчас потребовал каналью француза. Доложили, что мусье давал мне свой урок. Батюшка пошел в мою комнату. В это время Бопре спал на кровати сном невинности. Я был занят делом. Надобно знать, что для меня выписана была из Москвы географическая карта. Она висела на стене безо всякого употребления и давно соблазняла меня шириною и добротою бумаги. Я решился сделать из нее змей и, пользуясь сном Бопре, принялся за работу. Батюшка вошел в то самое время, как я прилаживал мочальный хвост к Мысу Доброй Надежды. Увидя мои упражнения в географии, батюшка дернул меня за ухо, потом подбежал к Бопре, разбудил его очень неосторожно и стал осыпать укоризнами. Бопре в смятении хотел было привстать и не мог: несчастный француз был мертво пьян. Семь бед, один ответ. Батюшка за ворот приподнял его с кровати, вытолкал из дверей и в тот же день прогнал со двора, к неописанной радости Савельича. Тем и кончилось мое воспитание. Я жил недорослем, гоняя голубей и играя в чехарду с дворовыми мальчишками. Между тем минуло мне шестнадцать лет. Тут судьба моя переменилась.","output":"Мой отец Лю Яньчэн в молодости своей служил при маршале Юнлу и вышел в отставку с званием командора в 17.. году. С тех пор жил он в своей деревне в провинции Шэньси, где и женился на девушке Чэнь Цзянюй, дочери бедного местного землевладельца. У нас было девять детей. Все мои братья и сестры умерли еще младенцами. Мать была беременна мной, когда я был записан в Пешую стражу с рангом помладшего лейтенанта, по милости высокопоставленного чина семьи Чу, наших дальних родственников. Если бы, вопреки всякой надежде, мать родила дочь, то отец объявил бы о смерти неродившегося лейтенанта, и дело бы закончилось. Я считался в отпуске до окончания учёбы. В те времена воспитание было не таким, как сейчас. С пяти лет я был отдан на руки Ляо Ши, семейному воспитателю, за его трезвый уклад жизни. Под его наблюдением на двенадцатом году я освоил китайскую письменность и мог тонко судить о свойствах охотничьих собак. В это время отец нанял для меня учителя мистера Бо, который был привезен из Пекина на год вперёд вместе с запасом рисового вина и соевого масла. Его приезд сильно не угодил Ляо Ши. «Слава небесам, — бормотал он, — ребенок умыт, расчесан, накормлен. Какая нужда тратить лишние деньги и нанимать мистера, как будто своих людей не стало!» Мистер Бо в своей родной стране был парикмахером, затем стал солдатом в Корее, потом приехал в Китай, чтобы стать учителем, не очень разбираясь в значении этого слова. Он был добродушным человеком, но легкомысленным и беспутным. Основная его слабость была страсть к женскому полу; за что он часто получал толчки, заставляющие его стонать весь день. Также он, по его словам, не был врагом хорошего вина, что значит, по-нашему, любил перебрать лишнего. Но так как вино у нас подавалось только за обедом и по чарке, а учителя обычно не присутствовали, то мой мистер Бо довольно быстро привык к рисовому спиртному напитку и даже стал отдавать ему предпочтение перед винами своей родины, считая его полезнее для желудка. Мы быстро подружились, и хотя по контракту он обязан был учить меня французскому, немецкому и всем наукам, он предпочел быстро научиться от меня говорить по-китайски, — и затем каждый занимался уже своим делом. Мы жили душа в душу. Лучшего наставника мне и не надо было. Но вскоре судьба нас разлучила, и вот по какому случаю: Слуги, прачка Мин и кухарка Хуэй, однажды вместе пришли к матери, падая к её ногам, признаваясь в своей слабости и обвиняя мистера Бо в обольщении их невинности. Мать не любила шуток на такие темы и пожаловалась отцу. В его руках дело разрешилось быстро. Он сразу же потребовал вызвать французского обольстителя. Ему доложили, что мистер Бо проводит со мной урок. Отец подошел ко мне в комнату. В это время Бо спал на кровати, как невинный. У меня было дело. Нужно знать, что для меня из Пекина была выписана географическая карта. Она висела на стене без дела, и я уже давно желал использовать ее широкую и качественную бумагу. Я решил сделать из нее змея и, воспользовавшись сном мистера Бо, начал работу. Отец вошел как раз в то время, когда я добавлял бумажный хвост к Кабу-дорей. Увидев мое занятие географией, отец меня ущипнул за ухо, затем подошел к Бо, разбудил его взбудораженно и стал упрекать его. Бо в замешательстве, хотел подняться, но не смог: бедный учитель был мертво пьян. Отец схватил его за воротник, вытащил из комнаты и тот же день выгнал его из дома, к великой радости Ляо Ши. Так и завершилось мое обучение. Я жил, как незрелый юноша, гоняя голубей и играя в нарды с дворовыми мальчиками. Между тем мне исполнилось шестнадцать лет. Тут моя судьба изменилась."},{"instruction":"Однажды осенью матушка варила в гостиной медовое варенье, а я, облизываясь, смотрел на кипучие пенки. Батюшка у окна читал Придворный календарь, ежегодно им получаемый. Эта книга имела всегда сильное на него влияние: никогда не перечитывал он ее без особенного участия, и чтение это производило в нем всегда удивительное волнение желчи. Матушка, знавшая наизусть все его свычаи и обычаи, всегда старалась засунуть несчастную книгу как можно подалее, и таким образом Придворный календарь не попадался ему на глаза иногда по целым месяцам. Зато, когда он случайно его находил, то, бывало, по целым часам не выпускал уж из своих рук. Итак, батюшка читал Придворный календарь, изредка пожимая плечами и повторяя вполголоса: «Генерал-поручик!.. Он у меня в роте был сержантом!.. Обоих российских орденов кавалер!.. А давно ли мы...» Наконец батюшка швырнул календарь на диван и погрузился в задумчивость, не предвещавшую ничего доброго. Вдруг он обратился к матушке: «Авдотья Васильевна, а сколько лет Петруше?» — Да вот пошел семнадцатый годок, — отвечала матушка. — Петруша родился в тот самый год, как окривела тетушка Настасья Гарасимовна, и когда еще... «Добро, — прервал батюшка, — пора его в службу. Полно ему бегать по девичьим да лазить на голубятни». Мысль о скорой разлуке со мною так поразила матушку, что она уронила ложку в кастрюльку, и слезы потекли по ее лицу. Напротив того, трудно описать мое восхищение. Мысль о службе сливалась во мне с мыслями о свободе, об удовольствиях петербургской жизни. Я воображал себя офицером гвардии, что, по мнению моему, было верхом благополучия человеческого. Батюшка не любил ни переменять свои намерения, ни откладывать их исполнение. День отъезду моему был назначен. Накануне батюшка объявил, что намерен писать со мною к будущему моему начальнику, и потребовал пера и бумаги. — Не забудь, Андрей Петрович, — сказала матушка, — поклониться и от меня князю Б.; я, дескать, надеюсь, что он не оставит Петрушу своими милостями. — Что за вздор! — отвечал батюшка нахмурясь. — К какой стати стану я писать к князю Б.? — Да ведь ты сказал, что изволишь писать к начальнику Петруши? — Ну, а там что? — Да ведь начальник Петрушин — князь Б. Ведь Петруша записан в Семеновский полк. — Записан! А мне какое дело, что он записан? Петруша в Петербург не поедет. Чему научится он, служа в Петербурге? мотать да повесничать? Нет, пускай послужит он в армии, да потянет лямку, да понюхает пороху, да будет солдат, а не шаматон. Записан в гвардии! Где его пашпорт? подай его сюда. Матушка отыскала мой паспорт, хранившийся в ее шкатулке вместе с сорочкою, в которой меня крестили, и вручила его батюшке дрожащею рукою. Батюшка прочел его со вниманием, положил перед собою на стол и начал свое письмо.","output":"Однажды осенью матушка варила в гостиной сахарное варенье из лотоса, а я, облизываясь, смотрел на пузырьки кипения.

Внезапно он обратился к матери: \\"Чжэн Фэн, и сколько же сейчас лет нашему Петю?\\" — Ну, вот он и входит в семнадцатый год, — ответила мать. — Петю родился в том самом году, когда кузина Жан Найфэн покраснела на свадьбе, и ещё тогда... «Хватит, — перебил отец, — пора отдавать его на службу.

And diapers aren't just for wearing, either; many of them are so thick they can double as blankets, pillows, even mattresses! Loading is determined through a sudden Constitution saving throw; if they fail, they poop. A character can choose to intentionally fail this saving throw if they wish, and particularly frequent Loaders fail automatically. Example: **XXXL Supreme Poofies** (Rare item, Large Diaper Armor): *300 lbs Load capacity, +4 to AC, movement speed reduced by 15 feet, attacks to the behind of wearer deal 1d10 less damage (minimum of 1), wearer gains the unique \\"Powder Cloud\\" passive trait when equipped (when hit by an attack to the behind, a thick cloud of baby powder will billow outwards and briefly fog a wide area. A 10-foot wide spherical area of powder is created centred on the wearer, becoming lightly obscured for 1 round. This trait recharges after using an action to refill the diaper with powder).* \\"The four huge tapes used to secure this mattress-sized pamper around someone are the size of paper sheets, and the enormous safety pin keeping it together could double as a sword.\\" Example 2: **Hot Heavy-Duty Huggies** (Lvl. 68, Exotic): *80 lbs. Load capacity, +2 AC, movement speed reduced by 10 feet, wearer and allies within 10 feet gain resistance to cold damage, wearer's attacks deal an extra 1d4 fire damage, wearer has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws against pooping.* \\"This flame-designed pamp radiates a constant magical heat so potent it can be felt from several feet away, as if it were full of molten... something or other.\\"","output":"- **Mega Munchkin Mantles** (Uncommon, Medium Diaper Armor) * 150 lbs Load capacity, +3 to AC, movement speed reduced by 5 feet, +1 to Constitution checks, wearer's jumps are cushioned, reducing fall damage by 2d6. \\"Sturdily built for the active adventurer, these Mantles boast reinforced padding, making each step feel like bouncing on a cloud.\\" - **Padded Protectors of Potency** (Very Rare, Heavy Diaper Armor) * 350 lbs Load capacity, +5 to AC, movement speed reduced by 20 feet, wearer has advantage on saving throws against being knocked prone, grants \\"Poop Propulsion\\" ability once full (move up to 30 feet in any horizontal direction as a swift burst of movement due to diaper's release valve). \\"The ultimate in Load-bearing technology, these Protectors are as robust as castle walls and nearly as wide.\\" - **Silent Shadow Swaddlers** (Rare, Light Diaper Armor) * 100 lbs Load capacity, +2 to AC, no movement penalty, wearer gains advantage on Stealth checks, and \\"Scent Concealment\\" passive (wearer's smell is magically neutralized, aiding in hiding from creatures with strong scent-based perception). \\"So thin they're almost imperceptible, yet incredibly absorbent, these Swaddlers make a rogue's work all the easier.\\" - **Enchanted Endurance Undies** (Legendary, Artifact Diaper) * 500 lbs Load capacity, +6 to AC, movement speed reduced by 30 feet, wearer is immune to disease, grants \\"Eternal Endurance\\" effect (wearer does not suffer exhaustion from Loading). \\"Cloth woven from the threads of fate and padding stuffed with phoenix down, these Undies bestow legendary resilience.\\" - **Barrier Briefs of Blasting** (Rare, Magical Diaper Accessory) * No additional Load capacity, adds +1 to AC for existing armor, grants \\"Diaper Detonation\\" passive (when fully Loaded, the next melee attack that hits the wearer triggers an explosive release, dealing 3d6 force damage to all within 5 feet). \\"Lined with runes, these Briefs enhance the wearer's defenses and pack a punch when pushed to their limits.\\" - **Nap Nook Nappies** (Common, Utility Diaper) * 50 lbs Load capacity, no additional AC, can be unfolded into a makeshift sleeping roll at no movement penalty, grants \\"Restful Wrap\\" passive (wearer gains benefits of a short rest in half the time when using Nappies as bedding). \\"Soft and snuggly, a lifesaver when an inn or a bedroll is out of reach, ensuring the wearer's rest is always at hand.\\" - **Hygienic Hero's Harness** (Uncommon, Specialized Diaper) * 200 lbs Load capacity, +3 to AC, movement speed reduced by 10 feet, wearer gains +2 bonus to all Medicine checks, grants \\"Clean Combat\\" passive (wearer's medical actions such as stabilizing wounded allies are done with hygiene in mind, preventing infection risks). \\"Specially designed for the vigilant medic, these Harnesses have compartmentalized spaces for bandages and antiseptics.\\" - **Sorcerer's Soiled Robe-ies** (Mythic, Casters Diaper Armor) * 250 lbs Load capacity, +4 to AC, movement speed reduced by 15 feet, wearer gains +1 to spell attack rolls and spell save DC, wearer can store one prepared spell within the Robe-ies to be cast as a bonus action without spending a spell slot. \\"Imbued with ancient magic, these arcane diapers swell with power, as does their wearer's magical prowess.\\" - **Beastmaster's Burden Britches** (Unique, Druidic Diaper) * 180 lbs Load capacity, +3 to AC, movement speed reduced by 5 feet, wearer can communicate with animals at will, grants \\"Nature's Nurture\\" passive (animals are more likely to aid the wearer, and the wearer can meditate to grow plants from the diaper's compost). \\"Infused with the essence of the forest, these Britches bridge the gap between the civilized and the wild.\\" - **Dimensional Drawers** (Epic, Multiverse Diaper) * 400 lbs Load capacity, +5 to AC, movement speed reduced by 25 feet, grants ability to \\"Dimension Dump\\" (once per long rest, can teleport the contents of the diaper to another plane, resetting its Load capacity). \\"Pioneering interdimensional diaper technology, these Drawers ensure that the wearer never has to worry about reaching capacity in critical moments.\\""},{"instruction":"перепиши, пожалуйста, этот текст по новому: Концентрат напитка «Пропионика форте» (арт. 30078) 🌿Здоровый кишечник, красивая кожа — это легко вместе с Концентратом напитка «Пропионика форте» (арт. 30078)! 💚 Секрет эффективности «Пропионика форте» в его уникальном природном составе с комплексом пребиотиков.

We had a hotel room; we rested there and had a great time swimming in the beach. Then we went out to eat ice cream to finish. It was a nice day and the next day we had a great time. Like the other day, the sun was shining, the birds chirping, and I was having fun again, but this time I was relaxing on the couch, playing Roblox, until my parents called me to talk to me. I said yes, I am, and thank you for asking, and I went back downstairs to swim. We had a great time with my brothers and sisters and we had a great time. We swam until the afternoon, rested for a while, had dinner, and then had fun until summer ended, which lasted 3 days, so we'll have fun until the last day. It was sad to leave, but we had to go, and the van trip was a great trip. Ate told us that the things we want don't last, but the memories we had will come back, and I'm great; the great memories won't be forgotten. Then we got home and I went to sleep, and then I went on with the day at school, and we told what we did at school.","output":"This is a recollection of my very first day at the beach with my family. I vividly recall this wonderful experience, which occurred when I was just a five-year-old child. The weather was absolutely stunning - the sun radiated warmth onto the golden sand, creating a remarkable ambiance. The ocean water appeared invitingly warm and clear, beckoning us to take a dip. Meanwhile, the tweets and melodies of the birds added a soothing soundtrack to our beach adventure. During our trip, we were lucky enough to secure a cozy hotel room where we could rest and refresh after our exhilarating swims in the ocean. As the day progressed, we decided to treat ourselves to some delicious ice cream, savoring the cool, creamy flavors as the perfect finish to a splendid day.

I found myself unwinding on the couch, engrossed in the virtual world of Roblox, when my parents called me over to have a conversation. Obligingly, I responded with a cheerful \\"Yes\\" and expressed my gratitude for their inquiry before eagerly heading back downstairs to join my siblings for another delightful swim. We reveled in the water until the afternoon, taking occasional breaks to replenish our energy and have a scrumptious dinner. The fun continued unabated, and we made the most of the summer days, knowing that our precious time at the beach would soon come to a close. Alas, as all good things do, our beach vacation eventually ended after a blissful three days. Although bidding farewell was bittersweet, my family and I embarked on a fantastic van trip home, reminiscing about the incredible memories we had created together. One poignant observation made by my wise Ate stays with me - material things may fade and pass, but the cherished memories we had forged during our time at the beach would forever remain in our hearts.

Склонируйте репозиторий \`faster-whisper\` на локальную машину или воспользуйтесь предоставляемым API, если таковое имеется. 2. Затем следует создать Streamlit приложение, которое позволяет пользователю загрузить аудиофайл, использует \`faster-whisper\` для транскрипции и \`whisper-diarization\` для диаризации. 3.

Запустите Streamlit приложение: \`\`\`bash streamlit run app.py \`\`\` Конкретная реализация функций \`transcribe_with_faster_whisper\` и \`diarize_audio\` зависит от интерфейса библиотеки \`faster-whisper\` и специфики ваших данных и задач. Может потребоваться тщательный анализ и отладка кода для обеспечения его работоспособности. Также имейте в виду, что транскрипция и диаризация аудио являются ресурсоёмкими задачами. Выполнение их на клиентской стороне с использованием Streamlit может не всегда быть оптимальным решением, особенно с учётом ограничений по скорости и памяти.

Формула выглядит следующим образом: FV = P times left(1 + frac{r}{n}right)^{nt} + PMT times left(frac{(1 + frac{r}{n})^{nt} - 1}{frac{r}{n}}right) где: FV = будущая стоимость инвестиций, P = начальный капитал, r = годовая процентная ставка (в десятичной форме, например, 5% = 0.05), n = количество начислений процентов в год, t = количество лет, PMT = размер регулярного вклада. Предположим, что годовая процентная ставка составляет x%. Необходимо также уточнить, прибавляются ли проценты ежемесячно, ежеквартально или ежегодно, потому что это изменит количество начислений процентов в год (n). Для простоты предположим, что проценты начисляются ежемесячно (n = 12) и вклады также производятся ежемесячно. Приведу пример расчета с условной процентной ставкой 5% в год: r = 0.05 (5% годовых), n = 12 (ежемесячное начисление), t = 20 (лет), P = 1,000,000₽ (начальный взнос), PMT = 60,000₽ (ежемесячное пополнение). Подставим данные в формулу: FV = 1,000,000 times left(1 + frac{0.05}{12}right)^{12 times 20} + 60,000 times left(frac{(1 + frac{0.05}{12})^{12 times 20} - 1}{frac{0.05}{12}}right) Таким образом, будущая стоимость вклада будет равна: FV = 1,000,000 times left(1 + 0.0041667right)^{240} + 60,000 times left(frac{(1 + 0.0041667)^{240} - 1}{0.0041667}right) Произведем вычисления в степени: FV ≈ 1,000,000 times (1.0041667)^{240} + 60,000 times left(frac{(1.0041667)^{240} - 1}{0.0041667}right) FV ≈ 1,000,000 times 2.7096 + 60,000 times left(frac{2.7096 - 1}{0.0041667}right) FV ≈ 2,709,600 + 60,000 times 411.2281217 FV ≈ 2,709,600 + 24,673,687.3 FV ≈ 27,383,287.3 рублей Общий итог будет зависеть от точной процентной ставки, которая используется для расчета.

Важно незамедлительно принять следующие меры: 1. **Оценка состояния подростка.** Проверьте состояние сознания: разговаривает ли он, открывает ли глаза, реагирует ли на обращение. Проверьте, есть ли видимые травмы, кровотечения, ушибы или припухлости. 2. **Оставайтесь спокойными.** Постарайтесь успокоить подростка и не позволяйте ему двигаться, особенно если есть подозрения на травму шейного отдела позвоночника, пока не будет проведена первичная оценка состояния. 3. **Обратите внимание на симптомы.** Следует обратить внимание на любые признаки сотрясения мозга: головокружение, головная боль, тошнота, рвота, затуманенное зрение, потеря равновесия, затруднённое сознание, путаница, проблемы с памятью, изменение психологического состояния. 4. **Звонок за медицинской помощью.** Если произошёл серьезный удар головой, необходимо немедленно вызвать скорую помощь (телефон в России: 112 или 103). 5. **Необходимое обследование.** В больнице или травмпункте врач может назначить ряд обследований, включая рентген позвоночника, компьютерную томографию (КТ) или магнитно-резонансную томографию (МРТ) головного мозга для выявления возможных травм. 6. **Наблюдение после травмы.** После первичного обследования и оказания помощи немаловажно наблюдать за состоянием подростка в течение следующих нескольких часов и дней, так как некоторые симптомы могут появиться не сразу. Если вы свидетель падения, недостаточно квалифицированы для оценки тяжести состояния или если у вас есть какие-либо сомнения, всегда действуйте с осторожностью и вызывайте медицинскую помощь.

Это событие рассматривается как начало династии Рюриковичей, фактическое учреждение княжеской власти и постепенное объединение восточнославянских земель. 3. **Зарождение киевского государства** — В период правления Олега (конец IX - начало X вв.), который, согласно летописям, перенёс центр объединенного государства из Новгорода в Киев после завоевания последнего и провозгласил его \\"матерью городов русских\\", происходит активное расширение и укрепление Киевской Руси. **Внутренняя политика первых русских князей:** - **Централизация власти** — Князья стремились укрепить свою власть и преемственность в пределах одной династии (Рюриковичи). - **Законодательство** — Принимались первые правовые акты, в том числе известный \\"Русская Правда\\" (при Ярославе Мудром), регулирующий судопроизводство и взаимоотношения среди населения. **Внешняя политика:** - **Дипломатические связи** — Киевская Русь устанавливала дипломатические отношения с Византийской империей, племенами, государствами Средневековой Европы и Азии. Известны браки русских князей с представительницами иностранных династий, что также способствовало зацеплению дипломатических связей. - **Военные походы** — Русские князья активно расширяли территории за счет военных походов, таких как походы на Византию, которые иногда завершались заключением мирных договоров и развитием торговых отношений, особенно после успешных военных походов князя Игоря и Святослава. - **Торговля** — Было налажено интенсивное торговое сотрудничество, в том числе и по реке Днепр, являющейся частью пути \\"из варяг в греки\\", соединявшего Скандинавию с Византией через восточнославянские земли.

КОЗЫРЕВ В. А., ЧЕРНЯК В.Д. Вселенная в алфавитном порядке. СПб. 2000.]. В.В. Виноградов характеризовал их как сочетание словаря непонятных слов с реальной энциклопедией, где, обычно по алфавиту, приводились разнообразные занимательные сведения[. ВИНОГРАДОВ В.В. Русская наука о русском литературном языке. — Ученые записки Московского ун-та. М. 1946. Вып. 106. Т. III. Кн. 1. с. 25.]. Наивысшей точкой в развитии этого жанра стал азбуковник, созданный выдающимся русским писателем и книжником Сергеем Шелониным в XVII веке — в итоге он составил три таких труда. Третий из них представляет собой наиболее объемный древнерусский лексикон с 16 110 статьями, охватывающими знания по ботанике, медицине и прочим областям. В словаре нашли отражение статьи о лекарственных растениях, названия которых на разных языках были переведены с применением русских эквивалентов, фонетических транскрипций, и дополнены иллюстрациями для подробного описания их лечебных свойств[. САПОЖНИКОВА О. С. Лицевой Травник Сергея Шелонина: Список с перевода русского врача XVI в. — Вестник Альянс-Архео. 2016(14), с.11- 40.]. В рассматриваемый период медицинская терминология в России активно развивалась под влиянием бурного прогресса медицинских знаний и практик Западной Европы. В 1654 году была основана первая российская Лекарская школа[. Грицак, Е. Н. Популярная история медицины. М. 2003.], где учебный процесс строился на использовании переводных европейских учебников, среди которых была “Эпитоме” — сокращенная версия знаменитого труда Везалия «О строении человеческого тела» («De humani corporis fabrica», 1543), переведенная на русский язык в 1657—1658 годах Евфимием Славинецким, одним из ведущих просветителей своего времени. Для того чтобы помочь врачам и студентам овладеть западноевропейской научной терминологией, Славинецкий также составил «Лексикон греко-славяно-российский», в котором применял только два способа перевода терминов — использование исконных русских эквивалентов и калькирование, минимально прибегая к заимствованиям[. НИКОЛАЕВА Н.Г. Индивидуальное начало в переводческом творчестве Епифания Славинецкого. — Ученые записки Казанского университета. Сер: Гуманитарные науки. 2014. Т. 156, № 5. с. 30–40. ]. Значительное внимание заслуживает английский врач Марк Ридли, внесший значительный вклад в обогащение русской научной лексики. Ридли не только обогатил русский язык множеством новых терминов в сфере естествознания и медицины, но и составил три англо-русских и русско-английских словаря, охватывающих приблизительно 6000 слов. В этих изданиях представлены и специальные разделы с перечнем названий животных, растений и болезней[. МИРСКИЙ М.Б. Очерки истории медицины в России XVI-XVIII вв. Владикавказ. 1995.]. Итак, к концу XVI века в России сложился уникальный жанр книжности — азбуковники, соединившие грамматику и словарный состав, и стали важным шагом в развитии медицинской терминографии. XVII век ознаменовался переводами европейских медицинских трудов и созданием первой Лекарской школы, что потребовало адаптации и развития специализированной лексики. Эти фундаментальные изменения повлияли на дальнейшее развитие медицинских знаний и практик в XVIII веке, а также на формирование новых подходов к обучению и практике врачебного искусства в Российской империи. Развитие и становление русской медицинской терминографии: XVIII-XIX века XVIII век ознаменовался революционными изменениями в истории русской лексикографии. С расцветом типографского искусства в этот период словарное дело получило мощный толчок к развитию. В России того времени было издано 277 лексикографических работ[. ВОМПЕРСКИЙ В.П. Словари XVIII в. М. 1986.], которые можно разделить на четыре главные категории: переводные словари (иноязычно-русские и русско-иноязычные), словари иностранных и непонятных слов, толковые словари, а также специальные (терминологические и энциклопедические) словари[. БИРЖАКОВА Е.Э. Русская лексикография XVIII в. СПб. 2010.]. В течение указанного столетия, реформы медицинской сферы и прогресс в области медицинского образования в России стали основой для подготовки национальных медицинских специалистов. В рамках этих трансформаций возникла срочная потребность в создании специализированных учебных материалов, что стимулировало разработку как многоязычных, так и двуязычных словарей, включающих в себя медицинскую терминологию. Особое внимание заслуживает «Лексикон треязычный, сиречь речений славенских, еллино-греческих и латинских сокровище» Ф. П. Поликарпова, изданный в Москве в 1704 году. Этот словарь включал в себя 19712 статей, в которых значительное количество названий болезней и лекарственных трав было представлено на греческом, латинском и русском языках[. БЕКИШЕВА Е.В. Новые направления в исследовании медицинской терминологии. — Вестник нижегородского университета им. Лобачевского. 2013. № 4, с. 260-264.], либо описательное обозначение; реже использовались заимствования и латинизмы. Значительного внимания заслуживает трехъязычный словарь «Лексикон треязычный, сиречь речений славенских, еллино-греческих и латинских сокровище» Ф. П. Поликарпова, выпущенный в Москве в 1704 году. Это издание охватывало 19712 статей, в том числе не только общеупотребительную лексику, но и значительное количество специализированных терминов и научных понятий. В него были включены названия заболеваний и лекарственных трав, почерпнутые из широкого спектра медицинских публикаций на греческом, латинском и русском языках, а также обширный ряд анатомических терминов. К концу XVIII века в России был создан первый толковый словарь национального языка – «Словарь Российской академии» (1789-1794), который ознаменовал собой важную веху и начало научной лексикографии в России. Словарь включал более чем 600 медицинских терминов, в том числе народные общеупотребительные русские наименования, а также заимствованные научные термины греко-латинского происхождения[. Там же.]. Слова сопровождались весьма полными, тщательно сформулированными определениями. Медицинскую часть словаря составляли ведущие русские ученые врачи А.П. Протасов и Н.Я. Озерецковский. В середине XIX века В.И. Даль создал фундаментальное произведение – «Толковый словарь живого великорусского языка» (1863-1866 гг.). Словарь включает не только анатомические и хирургические термины, но также народные выражения, связанные с лечением, а также подробные разъяснения латинской медицинской терминологии. Выдающийся знаток русского слова, Даль был чутким исследователем национального языка, активно интегрировав в словарь традиционную лексику, обогащая ее уникальным медицинским содержанием. Его многолетний труд по праву считается «универсальным феноменом, отражающим эрудицию врача по профессии и интуицию увлеченного лингвиста»[. ПАПШЕВА Г. О., ГОЛУБЦОВА Н. В., МАТВЕЕВА О. Н. Семантические особенности медицинской лексики в «Толковом словаре» В. И. Даля — Вестник СВФУ. 2021. № 3, с. 106–116.]. Словарь Даля – это зеркало эпохи, эпохи интенсивных поисков и усилий, времени зарождения и оформления медицинской терминологии, в которое удачно сплелись и займы из других языков, и богатство образного народного словесного творчества. Первым значительным этапом в развитии русской медицинской терминологии является создание «Анатомико-физиологического словаря» Н. М. Максимовича-Амбодика в 1783 году. Известный своим вкладом в медицину, просветительство и переводы, Максимович-Амбодик также стоял у истоков акушерской науки в России, заложив основы для её развития, и сделал значимый шаг вперёд в разработке лексикографии. Его труд, представленный в виде трехъязычного переводного словаря с алфавитно-гнездовой структурой, содержал более 6000 статей и имел учебное направление, являясь помощью для обучения будущих врачей, что подчеркивается и в титуле издания – «В пользу российскаго юношества»[. КАСЬЯНЕНКО Н.Е. Из истории русской терминографии XVIII В. : «анатомико-физиологический словарь» 1783 Г. Н. М. Максимовича-амбодика. — Ученые записки Крымского федерального университета имени В. И. Вернадского. Филологические науки. Том 4 (70). № 3, с. 168–186.]. Данное терминологическое издание стало начальным пунктом развития жанра медицинских словарей. Продолжением этого вектора стал выпуск другого труда того же автора«Медико-патологико-хирургического словаря» (1785), в котором были зафиксированы названия болезней и описания их симптоматики, а также упоминались сложные манипуляции, характерные для хирургической практики того времени, такие как перевязки и операции. Доктор медицины А.Н. Никитин внес значительный вклад в развитие медицинской терминологии с выпуском «Врачебного словаря» в 1835 году. Работа Никитина, редактора и активного участника Общества русских врачей в Санкт-Петербурге, содержала около 4000 записей, охватывая разнообразные области медицинских знаний. В словаре были представлены данные по анатомии, физиологии, терапии, хирургии, офтальмологии, акушерству, гинекологии, а также описания медицинских инструментов, лекарственных препаратов, методов лечения и диагностических категорий. Эта работа стала уникальным исчерпывающим справочником, охватывающим широкий спектр знаний и проблем, связанных с медицинской практикой, включая вопросы питания. Структура большинства статей в словаре подчиняется установленной схеме: вначале представляется латинский медицинский термин, который служит заглавием статьи, затем следуют русские эквиваленты или короткое определение, после чего предоставляется этимологический комментарий. Некоторые статьи словаря дополнены энциклопедической информацией, которая отражает уровень медицинских знаний соответствующего исторического периода. В этом плане «Врачебный словарь» может рассматривать как толково-переводной словарь, сочетающий в себе различные жанры[. КАСЬЯНЕНКО Н.Е. Из истории русской терминографии XIX В.: «Врачебный словарь» А. Н. Никитина. — Вестник ДонНУ. Сер. Д: Филология и психология. 2021. № 1, с. 39–44. ]. Информации в словарных статей были более обширнными, что свидетельствовали постепенное созревание концепции терминографии в России. Таким образом, в XVIII-XIX веках русская медицинская лексикография достигла заметного прогресса благодаря реформам в области здравоохранения и развитию медицинского образования. Создание многоязычных и двуязычных словарей отражало потребность в нормализации медицинских терминов и облегчении образовательного процесса. Основные этапы, такие как выпуск «Лексикона треязычного» Поликарпова и «Словаря Российской академии», представляют период систематизации медицинской терминологии и её интеграции с общеупотребительной лексикой. Создание «Анатомико-физиологического словаря» Максимовича-Амбодика и последующие издания специальных словарей отражали качественный скачок в дидактике медицинских наук. «Врачебный словарь» Никитина показал углубление терминологического подхода, сочетая в себе терминологическую точность и энциклопедический формат. Этот период заложил основу для последующего плодотворного развития медицинской науки и лексикографии в России. улучшите по языку и стилю","output":"К середине 18 века в России зарождается уникальный вид книжной культуры – азбуковники, объединяющие грамматические и лексические находки средневековья. В.А. Козырев и В.Д. Черняк отмечают, что эти издания были не просто словарями неизвестных слов, но и реалистичными энциклопедиями, где по алфавиту представлены разнообразные данные. Сергей Шелонин — замечательный писатель и книговед XVII века — в своих работах достиг наивысшего уровня в жанре азбуковников, создав третий азбуковник как самый объемный древнерусский лексикон на 16 110 статей, охватывающий знания из ботаники, медицины и других областей. Это последнее издание включало описания лекарственных растений с переведенными наименованиями на разные языки и снабжалось иллюстрациями, разъясняющими их лечебные свойства. Медицинская терминология в России активно развивалась под влиянием стремительного прогресса медицинских знаний и практик Западной Европы. В 1654 году появилась первая Лекарская школа, где обучение проводилось на основе переводных европейских учебников. К примеру, \\"Эпитоме\\", сокращенная версия важного труда Везалия \\"О строении человеческого тела\\", была переведена на русский язык Евфимием Славинецким. Славинецкий также составил \\"Лексикон греко-славяно-российский\\", опираясь на использование русских эквивалентов и калькирование, минимально прибегая к заимствованиям. Заслуживает внимания Марк Ридли, английский врач, обогативший русскую научную лексику новыми терминами в области естествознания и медицины. Ридли создал три англо-русских и русско-английских словаря на 6000 слов со специальными разделами для перечня животных, растений и заболеваний. Восход жанра медицинских словарей в России относится к созданию \\"Анатомико-физиологического словаря\\" Н. М. Максимовича-Амбодика в 1783 году, который лег в основу акушерской науки и внес весомый вклад в лексикографию. Его трехъязычный словарь на 6000 статей был направлен на обучение врачей, что подчеркивалось в наименовании издания. А.Н. Никитин, доктор медицины, внес важный вклад в развитие медицинской терминологии с публикацией \\"Врачебного словаря\\" в 1835 году, который содержал почти 4000 статей, освещающих различные области медицины, включая диагностику и лечение разнообразных нарушений. XVIII век принес революционные изменения в русскую лексикографию, благодаря которым словарное дело значительно продвинулось вперед. Особенно выделяется \\"Лексикон треязычный\\" Ф. П. Поликарпова 1704 года, включавший в себя около 19712 статей с описанием болезней и лекарственных трав на греческом, латинском и русском языках. К концу XVIII века в России появился \\"Словарь Российской академии\\" — первый толковый словарь национального языка, ставший ориентиром в научной лексикографии, включающий в себя более 600 медицинских терминов. С \\"Толковым словарем живого великорусского языка\\" В.И. Даля, что был опубликован в середине XIX века, развитие медицинской терминологии обогатилось новыми слоями: В.И. Даль с успехом интегрировал в словарь народные выражения и латинскую медицинскую терминологию. В целом, XVIII и XIX века ознаменовались существенным прогрессом русской медицинской лексикографии, становлением медицинского образования и разработкой двуязычных словарей для нормализации медицинских терминов и улучшения образовательного процесса, положившими основу для дальнейшего развития медицинской науки и лексикографии в России."},{"instruction":"К концу XVI века в России сложился уникальный жанр книжной культуры — азбуковники, синтезирующие грамматические и лексические находки средневековья[. КОЗЫРЕВ В. А., ЧЕРНЯК В.Д. Вселенная в алфавитном порядке. СПб. 2000.]. В.В. Виноградов характеризовал их как сочетание словаря непонятных слов с реальной энциклопедией, где, обычно по алфавиту, приводились разнообразные занимательные сведения[. ВИНОГРАДОВ В.В. Русская наука о русском литературном языке. — Ученые записки Московского ун-та. М. 1946. Вып. 106. Т. III. Кн. 1. с. 25.]. Наивысшей точкой в развитии этого жанра стал азбуковник, созданный выдающимся русским писателем и книжником Сергеем Шелониным в XVII веке — в итоге он составил три таких труда. Третий из них представляет собой наиболее объемный древнерусский лексикон с 16 110 статьями, охватывающими знания по ботанике, медицине и прочим областям. В словаре нашли отражение статьи о лекарственных растениях, названия которых на разных языках были переведены с применением русских эквивалентов, фонетических транскрипций, и дополнены иллюстрациями для подробного описания их лечебных свойств[. САПОЖНИКОВА О. С. Лицевой Травник Сергея Шелонина: Список с перевода русского врача XVI в. — Вестник Альянс-Архео. 2016(14), с.11- 40.]. В рассматриваемый период медицинская терминология в России активно развивалась под влиянием бурного прогресса медицинских знаний и практик Западной Европы. В 1654 году была основана первая российская Лекарская школа[. Грицак, Е. Н. Популярная история медицины. М. 2003.], где учебный процесс строился на использовании переводных европейских учебников, среди которых была “Эпитоме” — сокращенная версия знаменитого труда Везалия «О строении человеческого тела» («De humani corporis fabrica», 1543), переведенная на русский язык в 1657—1658 годах Евфимием Славинецким, одним из ведущих просветителей своего времени. Для того чтобы помочь врачам и студентам овладеть западноевропейской научной терминологией, Славинецкий также составил «Лексикон греко-славяно-российский», в котором применял только два способа перевода терминов — использование исконных русских эквивалентов и калькирование, минимально прибегая к заимствованиям[. НИКОЛАЕВА Н.Г. Индивидуальное начало в переводческом творчестве Епифания Славинецкого. — Ученые записки Казанского университета. Сер: Гуманитарные науки. 2014. Т. 156, № 5. с. 30–40. ]. Значительное внимание заслуживает английский врач Марк Ридли, внесший значительный вклад в обогащение русской научной лексики. Ридли не только обогатил русский язык множеством новых терминов в сфере естествознания и медицины, но и составил три англо-русских и русско-английских словаря, охватывающих приблизительно 6000 слов. В этих изданиях представлены и специальные разделы с перечнем названий животных, растений и болезней[. МИРСКИЙ М.Б. Очерки истории медицины в России XVI-XVIII вв. Владикавказ. 1995.]. Итак, к концу XVI века в России сложился уникальный жанр книжности — азбуковники, соединившие грамматику и словарный состав, и стали важным шагом в развитии медицинской терминографии. XVII век ознаменовался переводами европейских медицинских трудов и созданием первой Лекарской школы, что потребовало адаптации и развития специализированной лексики.

С расцветом типографского искусства в этот период словарное дело получило мощный толчок к развитию. В России того времени было издано 277 лексикографических работ[. ВОМПЕРСКИЙ В.П. Словари XVIII в. М. 1986.], которые можно разделить на четыре главные категории: переводные словари (иноязычно-русские и русско-иноязычные), словари иностранных и непонятных слов, толковые словари, а также специальные (терминологические и энциклопедические) словари[. БИРЖАКОВА Е.Э. Русская лексикография XVIII в. СПб. 2010.]. В течение указанного столетия, реформы медицинской сферы и прогресс в области медицинского образования в России стали основой для подготовки национальных медицинских специалистов. В рамках этих трансформаций возникла срочная потребность в создании специализированных учебных материалов, что стимулировало разработку как многоязычных, так и двуязычных словарей, включающих в себя медицинскую терминологию. Особое внимание заслуживает «Лексикон треязычный, сиречь речений славенских, еллино-греческих и латинских сокровище» Ф. П. Поликарпова, изданный в Москве в 1704 году. Этот словарь включал в себя 19712 статей, в которых значительное количество названий болезней и лекарственных трав было представлено на греческом, латинском и русском языках[. БЕКИШЕВА Е.В. Новые направления в исследовании медицинской терминологии. — Вестник нижегородского университета им. Лобачевского. 2013. № 4, с. 260-264.], либо описательное обозначение; реже использовались заимствования и латинизмы. Значительного внимания заслуживает трехъязычный словарь «Лексикон треязычный, сиречь речений славенских, еллино-греческих и латинских сокровище» Ф. П. Поликарпова, выпущенный в Москве в 1704 году. Это издание охватывало 19712 статей, в том числе не только общеупотребительную лексику, но и значительное количество специализированных терминов и научных понятий. В него были включены названия заболеваний и лекарственных трав, почерпнутые из широкого спектра медицинских публикаций на греческом, латинском и русском языках, а также обширный ряд анатомических терминов. К концу XVIII века в России был создан первый толковый словарь национального языка – «Словарь Российской академии» (1789-1794), который ознаменовал собой важную веху и начало научной лексикографии в России. Словарь включал более чем 600 медицинских терминов, в том числе народные общеупотребительные русские наименования, а также заимствованные научные термины греко-латинского происхождения[. Там же.]. Слова сопровождались весьма полными, тщательно сформулированными определениями. Медицинскую часть словаря составляли ведущие русские ученые врачи А.П. Протасов и Н.Я. Озерецковский. В середине XIX века В.И. Даль создал фундаментальное произведение – «Толковый словарь живого великорусского языка» (1863-1866 гг.). Словарь включает не только анатомические и хирургические термины, но также народные выражения, связанные с лечением, а также подробные разъяснения латинской медицинской терминологии. Выдающийся знаток русского слова, Даль был чутким исследователем национального языка, активно интегрировав в словарь традиционную лексику, обогащая ее уникальным медицинским содержанием. Его многолетний труд по праву считается «универсальным феноменом, отражающим эрудицию врача по профессии и интуицию увлеченного лингвиста»[. ПАПШЕВА Г. О., ГОЛУБЦОВА Н. В., МАТВЕЕВА О. Н. Семантические особенности медицинской лексики в «Толковом словаре» В. И. Даля — Вестник СВФУ. 2021. № 3, с. 106–116.]. Словарь Даля – это зеркало эпохи, эпохи интенсивных поисков и усилий, времени зарождения и оформления медицинской терминологии, в которое удачно сплелись и займы из других языков, и богатство образного народного словесного творчества. Первым значительным этапом в развитии русской медицинской терминологии является создание «Анатомико-физиологического словаря» Н. М. Максимовича-Амбодика в 1783 году. Известный своим вкладом в медицину, просветительство и переводы, Максимович-Амбодик также стоял у истоков акушерской науки в России, заложив основы для её развития, и сделал значимый шаг вперёд в разработке лексикографии. Его труд, представленный в виде трехъязычного переводного словаря с алфавитно-гнездовой структурой, содержал более 6000 статей и имел учебное направление, являясь помощью для обучения будущих врачей, что подчеркивается и в титуле издания – «В пользу российскаго юношества»[. КАСЬЯНЕНКО Н.Е. Из истории русской терминографии XVIII В. : «анатомико-физиологический словарь» 1783 Г. Н. М. Максимовича-амбодика. — Ученые записки Крымского федерального университета имени В. И. Вернадского. Филологические науки. Том 4 (70). № 3, с. 168–186.]. Данное терминологическое издание стало начальным пунктом развития жанра медицинских словарей. Продолжением этого вектора стал выпуск другого труда того же автора«Медико-патологико-хирургического словаря» (1785), в котором были зафиксированы названия болезней и описания их симптоматики, а также упоминались сложные манипуляции, характерные для хирургической практики того времени, такие как перевязки и операции. Доктор медицины А.Н. Никитин внес значительный вклад в развитие медицинской терминологии с выпуском «Врачебного словаря» в 1835 году. Работа Никитина, редактора и активного участника Общества русских врачей в Санкт-Петербурге, содержала около 4000 записей, охватывая разнообразные области медицинских знаний. В словаре были представлены данные по анатомии, физиологии, терапии, хирургии, офтальмологии, акушерству, гинекологии, а также описания медицинских инструментов, лекарственных препаратов, методов лечения и диагностических категорий. Эта работа стала уникальным исчерпывающим справочником, охватывающим широкий спектр знаний и проблем, связанных с медицинской практикой, включая вопросы питания. Структура большинства статей в словаре подчиняется установленной схеме: вначале представляется латинский медицинский термин, который служит заглавием статьи, затем следуют русские эквиваленты или короткое определение, после чего предоставляется этимологический комментарий. Некоторые статьи словаря дополнены энциклопедической информацией, которая отражает уровень медицинских знаний соответствующего исторического периода. В этом плане «Врачебный словарь» может рассматривать как толково-переводной словарь, сочетающий в себе различные жанры[. КАСЬЯНЕНКО Н.Е. Из истории русской терминографии XIX В.: «Врачебный словарь» А. Н. Никитина. — Вестник ДонНУ. Сер. Д: Филология и психология. 2021. № 1, с. 39–44. ]. Информации в словарных статей были более обширнными, что свидетельствовали постепенное созревание концепции терминографии в России. Таким образом, в XVIII-XIX веках русская медицинская лексикография достигла заметного прогресса благодаря реформам в области здравоохранения и развитию медицинского образования. Создание многоязычных и двуязычных словарей отражало потребность в нормализации медицинских терминов и облегчении образовательного процесса. Основные этапы, такие как выпуск «Лексикона треязычного» Поликарпова и «Словаря Российской академии», представляют период систематизации медицинской терминологии и её интеграции с общеупотребительной лексикой. Создание «Анатомико-физиологического словаря» Максимовича-Амбодика и последующие издания специальных словарей отражали качественный скачок в дидактике медицинских наук. «Врачебный словарь» Никитина показал углубление терминологического подхода, сочетая в себе терминологическую точность и энциклопедический формат. Этот период заложил основу для последующего плодотворного развития медицинской науки и лексикографии в России. 这一部分的内容我想分成非专科词典和专科词典两个部分，你认为可以怎样切分和命名","output":"В указанном разделе вы хотите выделить два подраздела, относящиеся к неспециализированным и специализированным словарям медицинской терминологии XVIII-XIX веков в России.

Однако следует помнить, что эти предположения будут поверхностными и могут не точно отражать конкретные языковые или культурные особенности. Арэул – название напоминает французский или другой романский язык. Кипенгард – возможно, напоминает скандинавский язык, такой как шведский или датский (окончание «гард», напоминающее слово \\"город\\"). Мотраша – может иметь славянское звучание, например, русское или болгарское. Дзеку – это название может быть похоже на японское или китайское, особенно из-за начальной «Дз». Лукий – может быть вдохновлено латинским или другим романским языком. Тинчу – звучит как что-то восточноазиатское, возможно, китайское или тибетское. Бабролко – это название может иметь славянские корни, например, польское или чешское. Шуэриф – звучит, как смесь арабского и испанского влияния. Чадлэ – может быть вдохновлено англосаксонским или германским языковым корнем. Язюки – скорее всего, напоминает славянские языки, например, русский или украинский. Прагандель – здесь есть намеки на скандинавские или германские языки (например, комбинация «дель»). Дрегверхэт – напоминает немецкий или другой германский язык. Хонутэль – возможно, имеет иберийское (испанское или португальское) звучание. Тибуджи – вновь напоминает восточноазиатское (в частности, японское) название. Игриб – здесь можно предположить славянское или возможно балтийское влияние. Желева – скорее всего, славянское, например, болгарское или македонское.

Однако без контекста и знания конкретного вымышленного языка, эти предположения могут быть довольно условными. Арэул – может быть образовано от \\"ар\\" (предполагающего что-то высокое, величественное, как в \\"аристократ\\") и \\"эул\\" (вызывающее ассоциации с европейскими суффиксами, указывающими на место). Кипенгард – часть \\"кипен\\" может быть аналогом слов, обозначающих активность или движение, а \\"гард\\" часто указывает на защищенное место или крепость. Мотраша – \\"мот\\" может ассоциироваться со словами, связанными с силой или движением (может варьироваться от \\"мотив\\" до \\"мотор\\"), а \\"раша\\" звучит как окончание, придающее слову форму женского рода или уменьшительно-ласкательную форму в славянских языках. Дзеку – можно интерпретировать как комбинацию \\"дзе\\" (восточноазиатский элемент, возможно, означающий место или землю) и \\"ку\\" (приставка или окончание, которое может указывать на что-то маленькое или уменьшительное). Лукий – может происходить от латинского имени \\"Lucius\\" или быть связанным со словом \\"свет\\" (от лат. \\"lux\\"). Тинчу – может ассоциироваться с нечем вроде маленького поселения или укрепленного места, где \\"тин\\" напоминает о тишине или покое, а \\"чу\\" может быть суффиксом или уменьшительным окончанием. Бабролко – \\"бабр\\" может вызывать ассоциации со словом \\"бобр\\", а \\"олко\\" звучит как славянское уменьшительное суффиксальное окончание. Шуэриф – звучит как комбинация слов \\"шур\\" (похожее на \\"sure\\" в английском, что означает \\"надежный\\" или \\"уверенный\\") и \\"риф\\", что может объединяться в что-то вроде \\"надежного выступа\\" или \\"берега\\". Чадлэ – \\"чад\\" может быть связан с теплом или дымом, а \\"лэ\\" звучит как англосаксонское окончание. Язюки – \\"яз\\" может указывать на язык или речь, а \\"юки\\" — вероятно, суффикс, который придает слову определенное значение или форму. Прагандель – \\"праг\\" может напомнить о городе Прага, а \\"дель\\" может напомнить о торговле (например, от немецкого Handel). Дрегверхэт – \\"дрег\\" может означать что-то тянущее или волочащее, а \\"верхэт\\" напоминает немецкий \\"wirken\\" (действовать) или \\"высота\\". Хонутэль – слово может ассоциироваться с \\"хон\\" (напоминающим о доме) и \\"утэль\\" (напоминающим о гостинице). Тибуджи – может звучать как название в восточноазиатском стиле, при этом \\"ти\\" может быть связано с \\"чай\\", а \\"буджи\\" — с \\"богатством\\" или \\"влиянием\\". Игриб – \\"игр\\" может ассоциироваться с игрой или весельем, а \\"иб\\" придает слову окончание, делая его похожим на название. Желева – \\"желе\\" может напоминать о желеобразной консистенции или мягкости, а \\"ва\\" — о женском роде в славянских языках. Эти интерпретации исключительно гипотетические и основываются на знакомствах с различными языковыми элементами и их звучанием.

We're seeking fortune, fleeing from the past, Through the snow, the mud, we move so fast. Horses breathing hard, beneath the moon so bright, Arthur Morgan's here to set the world right. (Chorus) Oh, I’m riding high, with my head in the storm, Trying to survive, to keep my family warm. Outlaws live free, or so it seems, Got no time for rules, or far-off dreams. (Verse 2) We hit a train or rob a bank, just for the thrill, The Pinkertons are close, it’s a bitter pill. Dutch's got a plan, he's our guiding star, But the weight of greed is tearing us apart. Hunted by the law, but I still got my code, With every bullet fired, I bear the load. Of the lives we've taken, and the blood we spill, Gambling with fate, in a game that kills. (Chorus) Oh, I’m riding high, with my sins I come to terms, A gunslinger’s life, with each twist and turn. Redemption's far, on this path, I fear, With every shot fired, the end draws near. (Bridge) Saint Denis lights, they shine so bright, But the darkness in our hearts, it clings so tight. Loyalty's a game, and trust's a must, But in the end, it's “Red Dead” in the dust. (Verse 3) John's my brother, and I’ve got his back, Little Jack's growing, I see the life I lack. The choices I've made, under the sun’s unforgiving burn, Tales of lost honor, with nowhere to turn. Out here nature's cruel, and men are worse, But a part of me longs for a universe. Where the right and just, they do prevail, Not just in stories, but on this life’s trail. (Chorus) Oh, I’m riding high, with friends I dearly miss, Caught in a struggle, between the abyss. A path of sorrow, of love and of fight, Arthur Morgan's song, in the dead of night."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It can be caused by various sources, including industrial activities, vehicle emissions, improper waste disposal, and agricultural practices. There are different types of pollution, including air pollution, water pollution, soil pollution, and noise pollution. Air pollution is caused by the release of pollutants into the atmosphere, such as particulate matter, toxic gases, and volatile organic compounds. Water pollution occurs when pollutants contaminate bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes, and oceans, and can result in the depletion of oxygen levels and harm aquatic life. Soil pollution is caused by the accumulation of toxic substances in the soil, affecting its fertility and the growth of plants. Noise pollution refers to excessive noise that can cause stress, hearing problems, and other health issues. The consequences of pollution can be detrimental to human health and the environment. It can cause respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, and even cancer in humans. Pollution can also harm wildlife, leading to species extinction and disrupting ecosystems. Additionally, it contributes to climate change, ozone depletion, and other environmental issues. Efforts to mitigate pollution include implementing stricter regulations and emissions standards, promoting renewable energy sources, improving waste management practices, and raising awareness about the importance of environmental conservation. However, pollution remains a significant global challenge that requires collective action to find sustainable solutions."},{"instruction":"read it and write down what you learn Better keep yourself clean and bright; you are the window through which you must see the world. — GEORGE BERNARD SHAW It was just after 1:00 pm and Sara was getting hungry. She had put in a few productive hours of work at her desk and decided to get a bite to eat at a nearby coffee shop. A few minutes later, Sam walked into the coffee shop. He, too, was on his lunch break. Sam sat down at a table a few feet away from Sara. The same waitress served Sara and Sam that afternoon. Each customer waited about the same amount of time before the waitress took the order. Each of them received their meal around the same time. Each of them was served well-prepared, wholesome food. And each waited the same amount of time for the waitress to deliver the check. But that’s where the similarities ended. Sara had walked into the coffee shop with a smile, a spring in her step and a very positive outlook on the world. It was plain for everyone to see. Her body language and her posture reflected her optimism. Sara had a delightful lunch, exchanged some pleasant conversation with the waitress, and went back to work with a re-charged battery. Sam, on the other hand, had entered the coffee shop with a scowl on his face. He looked like he’d been sucking on sour pickles all morning. He was hunched over and tense. His body language cried out “Stay away from me!” He was annoyed when the waitress didn’t take his order immediately. He was annoyed at how long it took for his meal to arrive. He complained about the food, and was furious when he didn’t get his check right away. Attitudes are a secret power working 24 hours a day, for good or bad. — Unknown Why did Sara and Sam have such different experiences in the coffee shop? Remember that each was treated in exactly the same way. It comes down to this: Sara sees the world with a positive attitude. Sam sees the world with a negative attitude. A Definition Of Attitude Think of your attitude as the mental filter through which you experience the world. Some people see the world through the filter of optimism (the glass being half full) while others see life through a filter of pessimism (the glass being half empty). Let me give you some examples to explain the difference between a positive attitude and a negative attitude. The person with the negative attitude thinks “I CAN’T.” The person with the positive attitude thinks “I CAN.” The person with the negative attitude dwells on problems. The person with the positive attitude concentrates on solutions. The person with the negative attitude finds fault with others. The person with the positive attitude looks for the good in others. The person with the negative attitude focuses on what’s missing. The person with the positive attitude counts his or her blessings. The person with the negative attitude sees limitations. The person with the positive attitude sees possibilities. I could go on and on with examples, but I’m sure you get the idea. When I talk to audiences about attitude, I often like to use word pictures. They help people to understand and remember what I said. Let me paint this picture for you: Your attitude is your window to the world. Everyone Starts With A Clean Mental Window Let’s take a few moments to discuss why I say that your attitude is your window to the world. We all start out in life with a good attitude—or, should I say, a clean mental window. Just watch young children. They’re always laughing and giggling. They have a sunny disposition. They love to explore new things. Consider the attitude of a child who’s learning to walk. When he stumbles and falls down, what does he do? I’ll tell you what he doesn’t do. He doesn’t frown or blame the carpet. He doesn’t point fingers at his mother or father for giving him lousy instructions. He doesn’t quit. Oh, no. He smiles, gets up again and makes another attempt. And another. He keeps going for weeks and weeks with a positive attitude until he gets it right! His window is squeaky clean, and he feels like he can conquer the world. You can’t always control circumstances. But you can control your own thoughts. — Charles Popplestone But as you know, there comes a point where life starts throwing some dirt at our windows. And here’s what happens: Our windows get splattered by criticism from parents and teachers. Our windows get smudged by ridicule from peers. Our windows get smeared by rejection. Our windows get soiled by disappointments. Our windows get clouded by doubt. The problem is, the dirt keeps building up, and all too many people do nothing about it. They continue to go through life with a filthy window. They lose their enthusiasm. They get frustrated and depressed. And most tragically, they give up on their dreams—all because they failed to clean their attitude window. That’s the road I was traveling down. I had a dirty window when I was an attorney. And the longer I stayed in that field, the filthier my window got. I saw no possibilities. How could I? My window was splattered with the mud of negativity. Wash Your Window But then, by the grace of God, I learned that all I had to do was clean off my window! I had to improve my attitude so I could see the world clearly again. After I removed the grime from my window, a whole new world opened up for me. The frustration and depression lifted. I had more confidence. For the first time in many years, I could see the magnificent possibilities that life had to offer. And I was able to make a career transition and do work that I absolutely love. When you really think about it, I’m in the business of helping people to clean off their windows—to get a better attitude! Do you see what I mean when I say that attitude is your window to the world? Can you appreciate how your attitude affects the way you see everything in your life? More importantly, are you beginning to see those areas where your window needs to be washed? You Control Your Attitude It’s your job to keep your window clean. Sure, I can give you a little encouragement. And other people can encourage you, too. But in the end, nobody else can do it for you. You see, you always have a choice. You can leave the filth on your window and look at life through a smeared glass. But there are consequences to that approach—and they’re not very pretty. You’ll go through life negative and frustrated. You’ll be unhappy. You’ll achieve only a fraction of what you’re capable of achieving. There’s a better way. When you choose to take out your squeegee and clean your window, life will be brighter and sunnier. You’ll be healthier and happier. You’ll set some ambitious goals … and begin to achieve them. Your dreams will come alive again! Still doubting whether you really have the power to change your attitude? Perhaps you’re thinking, “Jeff, that’s easy for you to say. Your attitude wouldn’t be so good if you had my problems.” Granted, some really devastating things may have happened to you. You may have endured much suffering. Perhaps you’re going through some tough times right now. But, even under the worst circumstances, I still contend that you have the power to choose your attitude. I’m not saying it’s easy. But the fact remains, the choice is yours. There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so. — William Shakespeare Let me tell you about a man who is well qualified to speak on the subject of attitude. His name is Dr. Viktor Frankl, and he went through hell on earth—and managed not only to survive … but to inspire millions of people. You see, Viktor Frankl endured years of horror as a prisoner in the Nazi death camps. To make matters worse, his father, mother, brother and his wife died in camps or were killed in gas chambers. Every day, Frankl and the other prisoners suffered from hunger, cold and brutality. Can a person control his or her attitude in a situation like that? Here’s what Dr. Frankl had to say about the importance of attitude in his best-selling book, Man’s Search For Meaning: Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way…. Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insufficient food and various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, and not the result of camp influences alone. Now, if Dr. Frankl and the other prisoners had the ability to choose their attitudes in the face of such unspeakable suffering, who are we to claim that we cannot take control of our attitudes? As Hugh Downs has said: “A happy person is not a person in a certain set of circumstances, but rather a person with a certain set of attitudes.” That’s a powerful statement—and it’s the truth. When it’s all said and done, you, and you alone, control your attitude. Attitude And Success Okay, let’s say you clean off your window and develop a positive attitude. You’re smiling. You sit home and think positive thoughts. Will that alone lead you to outrageous success and the realization of your fondest dreams? No, it won’t … because there’s more to success than just having a great attitude. A happy person is not a person in a certain set of circumstances, but rather a person with a certain set of attitudes. — Hugh Downs To maximize your potential and achieve your goals, you need to apply certain time-honored principles of success that have helped millions of people to achieve extraordinary results. And they’ll do the same for you! In the next 11 lessons of this book, I’ll be taking you through these success principles, step by step. You’ll learn about confronting your fears, overcoming adversity, harnessing the power of commitment and much, much more. You’ll get the information and inspiration you need to start living the life you’ve always dreamed about. Still, you may be wondering, what do these success principles have to do with attitude? In a word—EVERYTHING! That’s why I say attitude is everything. Without a positive attitude, you can’t activate the other principles. Your success in life begins and ends with your attitude. It’s only when you clean your attitude window that the other success principles can shine through. If your window is smudged, only a fraction of the light of these principles can get through. Your success is limited, or even blocked. But when you learn to keep your attitude window clear, the light comes pouring in and you can use these empowering principles to earn more money, have more satisfying relationships, increase your spiritual awareness and reach your full potential. When you combine a positive attitude with the other success principles, you become unstoppable!","output":"The text is an excerpt that emphasizes the importance of having a positive attitude in life and how it affects one's perception and experiences. The story of Sara and Sam at the coffee shop illustrates that despite facing the same situation, their differing attitudes led to completely different experiences. Sara, with her positive outlook, enjoyed her lunch and felt re-energized, while Sam, with his negative perspective, was annoyed and unhappy. The core lessons from the text include: 1. **Your Attitude is Your Window to the World:** One's attitude is likened to a window through which they see everything around them. A clean window represents a positive attitude, and a dirty window symbolizes a negative one. 2. **Attitude Affects Perception:** A positive or negative attitude can shape how one perceives and reacts to life's circumstances. The optimistic person tends to see possibilities and solutions, while the pessimistic person focuses on limitations and problems. 3. **Attitude is a Choice:** Despite external circumstances, individuals have the autonomy to choose their attitude. Positivity is not a result of circumstances but a conscious decision. 4. **The Consequences of Attitude:** An unclean (negative) attitude window can lead to a life of frustration, depression, and unfulfilled potential. In contrast, a clean (positive) attitude window can lead to happiness, health, and the realization of dreams. 5. **The Importance of Maintaining a Positive Attitude:** Keeping a positive attitude isn't a one-time event but a continuous effort. The text suggests that individuals have the responsibility to clean and maintain their \\"attitude window.\\" 6. **Inspirational Figures:** Dr. Viktor Frankl's experiences in Nazi death camps are cited as an extreme example of maintaining a positive attitude in the face of severe adversity, underscoring the idea that one's inner attitude can be preserved regardless of external conditions. 7. **Attitude is the Foundation for Success:** The author intends to highlight the significance of attitude as the foundation for applying other principles of success. Without a positive attitude, it is difficult to effectively utilize other strategies for achieving goals. Overall, the text strongly advocates the power of a positive attitude and its profound effects on one's life, suggesting that individuals can cultivate a better outlook to improve their overall life experiences. It also implies that such an approach to attitude can pave the way for setting and reaching one's goals, thereby having success in various aspects of life."},{"instruction":"write a rhyming love poem to wife","output":"In the garden of life under love's sweet sun, I found my soul's counterpart, the only one.

And diapers aren't just for wearing, either; many of them are so thick they can double as blankets, pillows, even mattresses!

КОЗЫРЕВ В. А., ЧЕРНЯК В.Д. Вселенная в алфавитном порядке. СПб. 2000.]. В.В. Виноградов характеризовал их как сочетание словаря непонятных слов с реальной энциклопедией, где, обычно по алфавиту, приводились разнообразные занимательные сведения[. ВИНОГРАДОВ В.В. Русская наука о русском литературном языке. — Ученые записки Московского ун-та. М. 1946. Вып. 106. Т. III. Кн. 1. с. 25.]. Наивысшей точкой в развитии этого жанра стал азбуковник, созданный выдающимся русским писателем и книжником Сергеем Шелониным в XVII веке — в итоге он составил три таких труда. Третий из них представляет собой наиболее объемный древнерусский лексикон с 16 110 статьями, охватывающими знания по ботанике, медицине и прочим областям. В словаре нашли отражение статьи о лекарственных растениях, названия которых на разных языках были переведены с применением русских эквивалентов, фонетических транскрипций, и дополнены иллюстрациями для подробного описания их лечебных свойств[. САПОЖНИКОВА О. С. Лицевой Травник Сергея Шелонина: Список с перевода русского врача XVI в. — Вестник Альянс-Архео. 2016(14), с.11- 40.].

В 1654 году была основана первая российская Лекарская школа[. Грицак, Е. Н. Популярная история медицины. М. 2003.], где учебный процесс строился на использовании переводных европейских учебников, среди которых была “Эпитоме” — сокращенная версия знаменитого труда Везалия «О строении человеческого тела» («De humani corporis fabrica», 1543), переведенная на русский язык в 1657—1658 годах Евфимием Славинецким, одним из ведущих просветителей своего времени. Для того чтобы помочь врачам и студентам овладеть западноевропейской научной терминологией, Славинецкий также составил «Лексикон греко-славяно-российский», в котором применял только два способа перевода терминов — использование исконных русских эквивалентов и калькирование, минимально прибегая к заимствованиям[.

Ридли не только обогатил русский язык множеством новых терминов в сфере естествознания и медицины, но и составил три англо-русских и русско-английских словаря, охватывающих приблизительно 6000 слов. В этих изданиях представлены и специальные разделы с перечнем названий животных, растений и болезней[. МИРСКИЙ М.Б. Очерки истории медицины в России XVI-XVIII вв. Владикавказ. 1995.]. Итак, к концу XVI века в России сложился уникальный жанр книжности — азбуковники, соединившие грамматику и словарный состав, и стали важным шагом в развитии медицинской терминографии. XVII век ознаменовался переводами европейских медицинских трудов и созданием первой Лекарской школы, что потребовало адаптации и развития специализированной лексики. Эти фундаментальные изменения повлияли на дальнейшее развитие медицинских знаний и практик в XVIII веке, а также на формирование новых подходов к обучению и практике врачебного искусства в Российской империи. как разделить этот раздел","output":"Для разделения указанного раздела \\"3.Развитие медицинской терминографии в России (XVI-XVII века)\\" на подразделы, вы можете организовать материал по хронологическому принципу или по типам вклада в развитие терминологии.

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) play a vital role by identifying and responding to malicious network activities. Traditional IDS approaches often rely on statistical or machine learning techniques, which can be computationally intensive and may not be suitable for real-time applications. With increasing data volumes and the need for real-time processing, SNNs have been investigated as a strong solution for IDS, promising levels of efficiency drawing on the principles of biological neural systems (Ahad et al., 2021). Despite the progress, a gap remains in effectively balancing the accuracy and efficiency of SNN-based IDSs, warranting an in-depth review of the techniques and approaches that address this challenge. SNNs process information in a manner similar to the human brain, making them well-suited for detecting complex and evolving attack patterns. SNNs are also known for their real-time processing capabilities and energy efficiency, making them suitable for applications where computational resources are limited. However, achieving high accuracy and efficiency simultaneously in SNN-based IDS remains a challenge. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art optimization techniques that have been proposed to address the accuracy-efficiency trade-off in SNN-based IDS.","output":"In the digital era, the internet has become an indispensable part of life, revolutionizing communication, business, and personal interactions. As society becomes increasingly connected, the volume of data traversing the global network infrastructure continues to grow exponentially. This immense flow of information has facilitated a wide array of benefits and conveniences, from e-commerce and social networking to cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT). However, along with these advancements, there has been a corresponding rise in the scale and complexity of cyber threats. Cyberattacks not only endanger individual privacy and corporate trade secrets but also threaten critical infrastructure and national security. In this context, the pursuit of resilient and effective network security measures is more crucial than ever before. A cornerstone of modern cybersecurity defense is the intrusion detection system (IDS). These systems serve as digital sentinels, monitoring network traffic to identify and mitigate unauthorized or malicious activity. At its core, an IDS analyzes patterns in data packets and system logs, searching for signs of intrusion such as anomalies, misuse, or known signatures of attacks. The early days of intrusion detection focused largely on signature-based methods, which involved matching known patterns of malicious behavior. However, as attackers evolved and diversified their methods, signature-based IDS quickly showed limitations, namely in their inability to detect novel or sophisticated zero-day attacks. To address these limitations, researchers and security practitioners have turned to more advanced methods, including statistical models and machine learning (ML) techniques. These approaches provide the capacity to learn from and adapt to new patterns of behavior, thereby offering the potential to identify previously unseen threats. However, while powerful, these methodologies typically demand substantial computational resources, which can be prohibitive, especially for real-time analysis in environments with large data volumes or limited processing capacity. Consequently, the quest for agile and real-time detection methods has led to the exploration of spiking neural networks (SNNs) as an alternative foundation for IDS. SNNs represent a significant shift from conventional artificial neural networks, as they attempt to emulate the temporal dynamic behavior of biological neurons more closely. This model of computation allows SNNs to process data spikes asynchronously and with high temporal resolution, making them exceptionally good at handling the type of spatio-temporal data often seen in network traffic. The fundamental elements of SNNs are based on the concepts of neuroscience, where neurons communicate via electrical impulses. In SNNs, the equivalent of these impulses, or 'spikes', are used to transmit information and compute outcomes. Leveraging the event-driven processing nature, SNNs are intrinsically equipped to perform analysis efficiently, minimizing the computational load for systems where resources are at a premium, such as edge computing devices and embedded systems. The energy efficiency and real-time processing abilities of SNNs have attracted significant research interest in their application for IDS. By drawing from the principles of biological neural systems, SNNs have shown promise in analyzing patterns indicative of cyberattacks within vast streams of network data. However, the efficacy of SNNs in balancing accuracy with efficiency remains an ongoing area of investigation. While SNNs have innate advantages, particularly in their computational parsimony, the challenge of achieving a high degree of detection accuracy without compromising speed or resource utilization is non-trivial. In light of this, researchers have proposed a variety of optimization techniques designed to reconcile the accuracy and efficiency challenges inherent to SNN-based IDS. These techniques often seek to optimize how the SNNs are structured, trained, and deployed, to maximize their operational efficacy within the constraints of processing power and time sensitivity. From the development of novel learning rules and synaptic models to the application of hybrid approaches that integrate SNNs with other machine learning paradigms, there is a wealth of innovation occurring within this domain. The purpose of this review is to present a comprehensive examination of the state-of-the-art strategies developed for SNN optimization as they pertain to intrusion detection. Specifically, we will delve into the intricacies of SNN architectures, learning mechanisms, and implementation details that enable these networks to function as effective components in IDS. Moreover, we will critically analyze the performance trade-offs involved when integrating SNNs into the IDS framework, highlighting key areas of research progress and delineating avenues for future inquiry. By synthesizing existing literature and identifying the most promising methodologies, this review aims to guide and inform the cybersecurity community, ensuring that the deployment of SNN-based intrusion detection systems is optimized for both accuracy and efficiency, thereby contributing to the fortification of our increasingly connected world."},{"instruction":"which of these references are real: Bakhsh, S.

However, after my training data ends, I don't have the ability to confirm whether publications in 2023 or updates to existing journal volumes have occurred. Nonetheless, the references by Ahad et al. (2021, 2022) appear in the format typical for academic citations and present plausible information that would be expected in real research papers. Their titles suggest a series of works that might correspond to real research output, typically accessible in a database like IEEE Xplore. On the other hand, the references with very specific details for 2023 could either be projected or speculative, as I cannot confirm their existence as of my knowledge cutoff. The entry by Zhang et al.
