This perspective can be useful in several ways, and it merits evaluation on various fronts: # Interpretation and Insights **1. Data Compression:** At a fundamental level, the process of training an artificial neural network (ANN) involves compressing large amounts of data into a more compact form – the model itself. This compression doesn't mean reducing file sizes or data volumes in the traditional sense, but rather, distilling the essential patterns, features, and relationships present in the training data into the architecture's weights and biases. Thus, the ANN embodies a form of knowledge compression, capturing the essence of the data it was trained on. **2. Knowledge Representation:** The “knowledge” here refers to the generalized understanding the model has about the data patterns and the relationships between input features and the target outcomes. Rather than explicitly encoding rules or logic, an ANN learns these through the adjustment of its internal parameters during training. In this sense, the trained model represents a condensed form of knowledge about the problem domain parameterized within its structure. **3. Generalization:** The ultimate goal is for the ANN to not merely memorize the training dataset but to generalize from it. Generalization is the model’s ability to apply learned knowledge to new, unseen data, making accurate predictions or decisions based on its training. Successful compression of data to knowledge is demonstrated when the model performs well on data it has never seen before, indicating it has captured the underlying patterns rather than the noise or specific details. # Potential Limitations and Considerations **1. Overfitting vs. Underfitting:** In the context of this analogy, overfitting could be seen as the model compressing not just the underlying knowledge but also the random noise within the training dataset, leading to poor generalization. Underfitting, on the other hand, might indicate insufficient compression of the available knowledge, where the model fails to capture important patterns. **2. Lossy Compression:** The process of distilling knowledge from data is inherently lossy – not all information in the training dataset can or should be retained. The challenge is ensuring that the loss involves irrelevant information or noise, rather than crucial signals. **3. Quality and Quantity of Training Data:** The efficacy of this knowledge compression heavily depends on the quality and quantity of the training data. Biased, insufficient, or noisy data can lead to a model that compresses and generalizes inaccuracies or irrelevant features. # Conclusion The statement offers a compelling way to conceptualize what happens in the training of artificial neural networks. By viewing an ANN as a mechanism for compressing vast, complex datasets into digestible, generalized knowledge, we can appreciate the nuances of model training, the importance of data quality, and the balancing act involved in avoiding overfitting and underfitting. However, this analogy should not oversimplify the intricate processes involved or the challenges in creating models that genuinely understand and generalize across diverse domains."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

To break it down: 1. **Compression Aspect**: - At a high level, the statement is quite accurate. During training, a neural network essentially learns to generalize from the specific examples provided in the training dataset, which can be viewed as a form of compression. It distills the vast, nuanced, and often redundant information contained in the large dataset into a much smaller, more abstract form - the weights and biases of the neural network. These parameters encode patterns, features, and relationships within the data, allowing the network to make predictions or decisions based on new, unseen inputs. 2. **Knowledge Representation**: - The term \\"knowledge\\" in this context refers to the extracted and encoded patterns and relationships the network has learned during training. This knowledge is not explicit or symbolic as human knowledge often is; rather, it's implicit in the network's architecture (the way neurons are connected) and its parameters (weights and biases). In this way, a neural network's knowledge is procedural, enabling it to perform tasks, make predictions, or generate data based on the compressed representation of its training experiences. 3. **Limitations and Considerations**: - While the statement provides a helpful metaphor, it's important to recognize the limitations and complexities of what neural networks actually do: - **Generalization vs. Memorization**: There is a balance between generalizing from the training data (learning the underlying patterns) and memorizing it (overfitting). High capacity networks might not compress as much as memorize, potentially failing to generalize to new data. - **Lossy Compression**: The compression analogy carries the implication of loss---not all aspects of the training data are preserved, similar to how lossy image compression might remove details to reduce file size. The network learns what is deemed relevant for performing its task, which may involve losing or distorting certain nuances present in the data. - **Interpretability**: Unlike some forms of knowledge representation, the knowledge encoded in a neural network is not easily interpretable by humans. This can make understanding and explaining the decisions or predictions made by the network challenging. - **Emergent Properties**: The process of learning can also lead to emergent behaviors or capacities that might not have been obvious from the training data alone. This aspect of surprise and discovery is more than simple compression—it's a complex transformation where the input (training data) is restructured into something distinct yet related (model knowledge). In conclusion, the statement is a succinct and illustrative way to describe the fundamental operation of neural networks from a high-level perspective. However, it simplifies and abstracts away the complex, nuanced processes involved in machine learning, as well as the challenges and limitations inherent to these models. Understanding neural networks as knowledge compression mechanisms provides insights into their operation, but also invites further inquiry into what is meant by \\"compression\\" and \\"knowledge\\" in this context."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

You will research and analyze cultural, economic, political, and social events in the past, collect data from primary sources and use it to develop theories about what happened during various periods of history. My first suggestion request is: I need a complete history of the bible from the oldest known record of the old testament and its age/origins, all the way up to the dozens of modern translations. Please make a comment on what translation available today has been the most widespread and used with most dominance over time.","output":"The history of the Bible is deeply intertwined with the histories of Judaism and Christianity, spanning thousands of years and countless cultures. It is not only a religious text but also a historical document, reflecting the beliefs, practices, and societal norms of the periods in which it was written and compiled. # The Origins and Development of the Old Testament The oldest parts of the Old Testament, or Hebrew Bible, are thought to date back to the 12th century BCE, although these texts were likely transmitted orally before being written down. The writing of these texts continued over centuries, with different books being authored at different times. The Old Testament as we know it was compiled over a long period, from the 12th century BCE to the 2nd century BCE. 1. **Pentateuch/Torah (Law):** Traditionally believed to have been written by Moses, modern scholarship sees these first five books as a compilation from various sources over several centuries, culminating in their current form around the 5th century BCE. 2. **Prophets (Nevi'im):** These books were written across several centuries, from the pre-exilic period (before 586 BCE) through to the post-exilic period (after 539 BCE). 3. **Writings (Ketuvim):** The most diverse section of the Hebrew Bible, including poetry, wisdom literature, and historical accounts, were composed over several centuries, with some books possibly dating back to the 10th century BCE but not finalized until the 2nd century BCE. # The New Testament and Christian Canon The New Testament, central to Christian scripture, was written primarily in the 1st century CE. It consists of 27 books, including the Gospels, Acts of the Apostles, epistles (letters from early church leaders), and Revelation. These texts were written in Koine Greek, the common dialect of the Hellenistic world. - The Gospels, recounting the life and teachings of Jesus, were written between 70–110 CE. - Paul’s epistles, some of the earliest Christian documents, were authored between 50–60 CE. - The canon of the New Testament was not formally established until the 4th century CE, with various councils and church fathers endorsing the books that aligned with orthodox belief. # Translation and Dissemination The translation of these texts has a rich history, starting with the Septuagint, a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible completed by the 2nd century BCE, which helped spread Jewish scripture throughout the Hellenistic world. The Latin Vulgate, translated by Jerome in the late 4th century, became the Catholic Church's authoritative scripture for centuries. The advent of the printing press in the 15th century was transformative, making the Bible more accessible. Martin Luther’s German translation in the 16th century and the King James Version (KJV) in English in 1611 were monumental in spreading the Christian scripture across the globe. # Modern Translations Today, there are dozens of translations in English alone, ranging from those that strive for literal accuracy to those that aim for contemporary readability. The most widespread and influential translation over time, especially in English-speaking worlds, has been the King James Version (KJV). Despite numerous modern translations, the KJV remains beloved for its literary quality and has had a profound impact on English-speaking cultures. # Conclusion The Bible's history is a complex amalgamation of religious inspiration, cultural influence, and linguistic evolution. Its compilation, translation, and dissemination reflect the changing contexts in which it has been received and interpreted. Among the plethora of modern translations, the King James Version stands out for its historical significance and lasting influence. However, the choice of translation often depends on individual or denominational preferences, reflecting the diversity within Christianity itself."},{"instruction":"Hello ChatGPT.

However, this demand might experience fluctuations based on global economic conditions. 3. **Indonesia’s Influence**: Indonesia, a major nickel producer, has implemented export bans on nickel ore to encourage domestic processing. Such policies can tighten global nickel supply and potentially push prices higher, depending on how global supply chains adjust. # Market Structure The nickel market is subject to the influences of major producing countries and companies. Any political, environmental, or economic changes in these regions could affect nickel supply. Additionally, the entrance of new mining projects and advances in mining and processing technology could influence supply levels and, subsequently, prices. # Future Use Cases Beyond EVs and stainless steel, nickel’s role in green energy solutions, including hydrogen fuel cells and energy storage systems, is gaining attention. As the world transitions to greener energy, the demand for nickel could diversify and strengthen, supporting higher prices. # Prediction Challenges Predicting the exact price of nickel in 2024 involves uncertainties, including: - **Economic Conditions**: Global economic slowdowns or recessions could reduce demand for stainless steel and EVs, impacting nickel demand. - **Technological Advances**: Improvements in battery technology could either increase nickel efficiency, boosting demand, or find alternative materials, potentially reducing nickel's dominance in batteries. - **Geopolitical Factors and Policies**: Changes in regulations, trade policies, or export bans in key producing countries could significantly impact global supply dynamics. # Conclusion Considering these factors, if the current trends of rising demand for nickel in EV production and green energy applications continue, coupled with potential supply constraints, we might predict a bullish scenario for nickel prices into 2024. However, investors and stakeholders should closely monitor the evolving market dynamics and potential risks outlined above. It's also crucial to stay informed about technological advancements and policy changes in major nickel-producing and -consuming countries."},{"instruction":"AGIRA ASSURANCE","output":"Agira Assurance is a general insurance company in France that provides a range of insurance products for individuals and businesses.

However, beneath the glossy facade of likes, shares, and emojis, there lies a troubling reality. The pervasive use of social media among teenagers has sparked a global debate about its impact on mental health, self-esteem, and overall well-being. This essay aims to argue that the negative consequences of social media far outweigh its benefits for teens, touching upon aspects such as cyberbullying, unrealistic beauty standards, and the disruption of physical activities and sleep. Firstly, one of the most immediate concerns associated with social media is the prevalence of cyberbullying. Platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat have unfortunately become breeding grounds for anonymity-fueled hostility. Teens, vulnerable and seeking acceptance, may become targets of relentless online harassment, leading to emotional distress. A study published by the Cyberbullying Research Center reported that about 34% of middle and high school students have been cyberbullied in their lifetime. The anonymity of attackers on social media platforms exacerbates matters, making it harder for victims to escape or confront their aggressors. The detrimental impact on a young person's self-esteem and mental health cannot be understated, leading to instances of anxiety, depression, and in severe cases, suicidal ideation. Moreover, social media perpetuates unrealistic standards of beauty and success, creating a cauldron of self-doubt and insecurity among teenagers. Platforms are flooded with images of perceived perfection – flawless skin, slim bodies, and luxurious lifestyles, most of which are heavily edited or selectively curated. Teenagers, in their formative years of developing self-identity and self-esteem, are particularly susceptible to these portrayals, often engaging in detrimental comparisons that erode their self-worth. The unattainable standards set forth by influencers and peers alike contribute to a spectrum of psychological issues, including body dysmorphia and eating disorders. The quest for validation through likes and comments becomes a perilous journey towards an ever-elusive ideal, detracting from the appreciation of one's uniqueness and real-world accomplishments. Lastly, excessive use of social media can significantly disrupt physical activities and sleep patterns among teenagers. The magnetic allure of social media keeps teens tethered to their devices, often at the expense of engaging in physical exercise or adhering to healthy sleep routines. The blue light emitted by screens is known to interfere with the production of melatonin, the hormone responsible for regulating sleep, thereby affecting sleep quality and duration. The sedentary lifestyle encouraged by hours of scrolling through social media feeds contributes to obesity and related health issues. Furthermore, the time spent on social media is time not spent on physical or creative endeavors that could significantly enhance a teenager's development and sense of wellbeing. In conclusion, while social media promises to connect and entertain, its dark underbelly reveals a significant threat to the mental and physical health of teenagers. Cyberbullying, unrealistic standards of beauty and success, and the disruption of physical activities and sleep are among the pressing concerns that warrant attention. It is imperative for parents, educators, and policymakers to address these issues head-on, establishing robust frameworks to mitigate the negative impacts of social media. Encouraging responsible usage, fostering environments that promote open communication about its effects, and highlighting the importance of real-world connections are crucial steps towards safeguarding the wellbeing of the younger generation. The time to act is now, to ensure that the digital realm becomes a space of positive growth rather than a minefield of potential harm for our teenagers."},{"instruction":"Can you give me 5 statistics on the effects of social media on youth","output":"Certainly! Here are five statistics that highlight the effects of social media on youth: 1. **Mental Health and Cyberbullying:** According to a 2019 report from the Pew Research Center, about 59% of U.S. teens have experienced some form of cyberbullying. This includes name-calling, spreading of false rumors, receiving unsolicited explicit images, physical threats, and having explicit images of them shared without their consent. 2. **Screen Time and Sleep:** A study published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence found that high usage of social media and screen time was linked to poorer sleep quality and shorter sleep duration among teenagers. Teens who use social media for five hours or more per day are 70% more likely to fall asleep late than those who use it for less than an hour. 3. **Body Image:** Research from the National Eating Disorders Association suggests a correlation between social media use and body dissatisfaction. The association reports that about 88% of the women and 65% of the men who participated in their survey experienced pressure from media to maintain an unrealistic body shape, and more than half of teenage girls and nearly one-third of teenage boys use unhealthy weight control behaviors such as skipping meals, fasting, smoking cigarettes, vomiting, and taking laxatives. 4. **Social Media Addiction:** A study conducted by the Royal Society for Public Health in the UK found that about 91% of 16 to 24-year-olds use the internet for social networking, and rates of anxiety and depression in young people have risen 70% in the past 25 years. Social media use has been described by some researchers as more addictive than cigarettes and alcohol. 5. **Impact on Academic Performance:** A survey by the American Psychological Association revealed that nearly one-third of teens say they feel overwhelmed due to social media use and that it distracts them from homework. Another report states that students who are regular users of social media tend to have lower academic performance compared to those who use it less frequently, with the constant interruptions and multitasking online leading to decreased attention spans and productivity. These statistics underscore the varied impact of social media on youth, ranging from mental health challenges to sleep patterns, body image concerns, potential addictive behaviors, and effects on academic performance."},{"instruction":"","output":"It seems like your message may have been incomplete.

Например, \`export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4\` установит количество потоков равным 4. 2. Установка числа потоков внутри программы: - В программе можно установить количество потоков с помощью функции \`omp_set_num_threads(int num_threads)\` из библиотеки OpenMP. Например: \`\`\`c #include <omp.h> int main() { omp_set_num_threads(4); // установить 4 потока #pragma omp parallel { // параллельный код } return 0; } \`\`\` 3. Использование директивы \`num_threads\` на уровне параллельной области: - В рамках директивы \`pragma omp parallel\` можно указать количество потоков для данной параллельной области. Например: \`\`\`c #include <omp.h> int main() { #pragma omp parallel num_threads(4) { // параллельный код } return 0; } \`\`\` Указание количества потоков зависит от конкретных требований программы и алгоритма, который используется.

As children work on these projects, they must brainstorm ideas and act as good listeners to their group members. Teaching students active listening skills enhances collaborative ability as well as creativity. Students learn the fundamental skills of productive communication, respect for others, and teamwork while generating ideas together. Negotiating how to collectively solve a problem is also part of PBL. At the end of the project, students do a self-evaluation. They evaluate not only their learning, but also the success of their social interactions. They reflect on their communication skills, if they felt they listened well to other students’ ideas, and if they believed their own opinions were heard. Consistent employment and practice of these skills will strengthen them over time and lead to proficiency and mastery. These skills are critical to future success in the structures of our global economy.","output":"社交学习增强协作技能 PBL促进社交学习，使孩子们练习并熟练掌握与沟通、谈判和协作等二十一世纪技能有关的技能。当孩子们在这些项目上工作时，他们必须集思广益，并成为团队成员的良好倾听者。教授学生积极倾听技能不仅增强了合作能力，也激发了创造力。学生们在共同产生想法的过程中学会了生产性沟通的基本技能，学会了尊重他人，学会了团队合作。协商如何共同解决问题也是PBL的一部分。 项目结束时，学生进行自我评价。他们不仅评估他们的学习情况，还评估社交互动的成功程度。他们反思他们的沟通技能，看看自己是否认真倾听其他学生的想法，以及自己的意见是否被理解。这些技能的持续应用和练习将随着时间的推移而得到加强，并最终达到熟练和精通的水平。这些技能对我们全球经济结构中未来的成功至关重要。"},{"instruction":"Differentiation Provides Intrinsic Motivation The element of choice is crucial for students’ success. Differentiation allows students to develop their own interests and pursue deeper learning. It also allows students to soar and learn at their own levels. Students use resources that are appropriate for their individual reading levels and compatible with their technology knowledge. One exciting feature provided by this intrinsic motivation is that students will often reach higher and attempt to read more challenging material to glean the information they seek. It is not unrealistic to suspect that students who are highly motivated will improve their reading abilities as they strive to understand and learn during PBL. Doppelt (2003), contends that students’ “motivation to learn their discipline and their willingness to work on their projects [for] longer hours indicate that they behave...like high achievers” (p. 264). In another study, attendance was found to be higher in PBL schools (Thomas 2000). These behaviors have positive effects on learning.","output":"差异化提供内在动机 选择的因素对学生的成功至关重要。差异化让学生可以培养自己的兴趣，并追求更深入的学习。它还使学生可以在不同水平上飞跃并学习。学生使用适合其个人阅读水平并与其技术知识相配的资源。这种内在动机提供的令人兴奋的特点是，学生通常会更加努力地阅读更具挑战性的材料，以获取他们所需的信息。毫不夸张地说，高度自我激励的学生在PBL中努力理解和学习时，其阅读能力有望得到提高。多泊 (2003)认为，学生“对学习他们的学科的动力和愿意在其项目上投入更多时间表明他们表现得像高绩效者”(第264页)。在另一项研究中，PBL学校的出勤率更高(托马斯, 2000)。这些行为对学习有积极影响。"},{"instruction":"The active learning process of PBL takes students’ various learning styles and preferences into account. Students use a range of tools and resources to conduct their research. They also choose individual ways to demonstrate their learning in their final product. A child who prefers to be reflective may journal his learning in a diary format to share with peers. Others can read the diary and then write responses. A student who thinks in more of an analytic, mathematical way may elect to create a timeline of events or graph findings to present to his or her audience. Students also may select their preferred learning environment. Students may choose to work in a quiet library or a bustling hallway, lying down in the carpet area or sequestered in the cubby area. Children learn so much about themselves when they are empowered to make their own learning decisions. Children will reflect on these choices to ensure they are making the best decisions possible. The opportunity to make mistakes is part of the learning process. When we implement PBL, we allow children to discover who they are as learners. They become able to make better choices, whether relating to process, environment, or outcome, which enables them to become more independent and responsible for their own learning.","output":"PBL的积极学习过程考虑了学生的不同学习风格和偏好。学生使用各种工具和资源进行研究。他们还选择个人方式来展示他们的学习成果。一个喜欢反思的孩子可能会以日记形式记录学习，与同伴分享。其他人可以阅读日记然后写回应。一个更偏向于分析、数学思维方式的学生可能会选择创作事件时间轴或绘制图形以展示给观众。学生还可以选择他们偏好的学习环境。学生可以选择在安静的图书馆或熙熙攘攘的走廊工作，躺在地毯区或藏身在隔间区。当孩子们有权做出自己的学习决策时，他们会对自己有更多了解。孩子们会反思这些选择，以确保他们做出最佳的决定。犯错误的机会是学习过程的一部分。当我们实施PBL时，我们允许孩子们发现自己作为学习者的本质。他们变得能够做出更好的选择，无论是与过程、环境还是结果相关，这使他们能够变得更加独立和对自己的学习负责。"},{"instruction":"Scaffolded instruction ensures success. Scaffolded instruction refers to the supports provided to students to assist them in making cognitive growth just beyond their reach.

Scaffolded instruction occurs in PBL when teachers use organizers that aid students in bridging the gaps that exists in knowledge and skill, and it makes the tasks manageable and achievable. As with most supports, scaffolds are temporary, and as the learner gains fluency in the skill, the supports are removed, leading to a self-confident and capable learner.","output":"搭建式指导确保成功。搭建式指导是指为学生提供支持，帮助他们在认知发展的过程中取得略高于他们当前水平的成长。学生在首次学习PBL的结构时，会参与一个探索过程，此时他们需要大量的支持和监督。在PBL中，搭建式指导发生在教师使用组织者帮助学生弥合知识和技能中存在的差距，并使任务变得可管理和可实现。与大多数支持一样，搭建式支持是暂时的，随着学习者熟练掌握技能，支持将被移除，从而使学习者变得自信和能干。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

You can pass in a different starting balance by changing the parameter value in \`atm = ATM(100)\` within the \`main()\` function. - For simplicity, this example handles amounts as floats, which is generally not a good practice for dealing with money in production software due to precision issues. In real applications, consider using \`decimal.Decimal\`. - There are no checks for negative deposit or withdrawal amounts, meaning the user could potentially enter a negative number for deposits or withdrawals leading to unexpected behavior. - No persistent storage is used; the account balance will reset every time the program restarts. This sample is a starting point; you can expand it by adding features like user authentication, transaction history, or support for multiple accounts, depending on your requirements and Python proficiency."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Составляй правильно предложения, пиши без ошибок! Пиши от первого лица. Пиши эмоционально с раздражением про невыносимые условия. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера: Капец, я в шоке от наглости АЦ Север, Иркутск! Пытался воспользоваться программой trade-in, что у них на оф сайте предлагают и гарантируют честную оценку. По началу они внушали доверие, качественный сайт, на котором размещены множество только положительных отзывов про автосалон, да и по приезду заведение казалось приличным. Я хотел дождаться окончательной цены за свой авто, а потом уже смотреть новый. Но мне заговорили зубы и убедили сразу выбрать и оформлять, чтобы не терять зря время. На словах озвучили мне нормальную сумму, на которую я примерно и рассчитывал, так как до поездки к ним узнавал за это. Я честно говоря повелся и подписал договор купли продажи на новый авто, понадеявшись на порядочность дилера. Но увы, это порядочность им не приемлема, потому как меня запланировано собирались кинуть. После заключения договора я узнал, что мой автомобиль это автохлам и цена его максимум 100000. Я был в шоке, потому как реально он стоил 350000. Не офигели ли, на 250000 кидать??? Отказался от сделки, меня стали пугать неустойкой. Я стал пугать экспертизой и судом. Но эти твари все равно поимели с меня 10000, за якобы работу их экспертов. Повезло, отделался малым.","output":"1. Не понимаю, как такие автосалоны как Декар все еще функционируют! Пришел купить машину, а в итоге только нервы потрепали. Предложения звучали искусно, но когда дело дошло до реализации, все как-то поменялось. Сначала обещали бонусы и скидки, а по факту цена оказалась на 15% выше заявленной. Куда смотрит контроль качества? И попробуй потребуй свои права – в ответ одни уловки и передергивания. Жалуюсь в защиту прав потребителей, такое отношение не может оставаться безнаказанным! 2. Вот это подстава от Декара! Поощрял себя новым авто, а в итоге получил массу проблем. Продавец обещал идеальное состояние автомобиля, но уже на следующий день выяснилось, что с электроникой серьезные неполадки. Вернуться и решить вопрос оказалось мучением. На каждый звонок – отписки и обещания перезвонить. Это просто издевательство! Вот вам и качество сервиса. Как можно так относиться к клиентам, разве мы не заслуживаем уважения и честности? Позорище, а не автосалон! 3. Я в полном ауте от \\"профессионализма\\" в Декаре. Сказали, что все документы будут готовы через пару дней, а тянули более двух недель! Авто обещали проверенное, но по факту вылезли проблемы с двигателем. Это что за обслуживание такое, за которое я заплатил немалые деньги? Расписываются в собственной некомпетентности? Ни рекомендации, ни извинений – только мое время и деньги потрачены впустую. Испортили всю радость от покупки, вместо восторга – одни хлопоты. 4. Отзыв о Декар? Обидно даже вспоминать. Думал, покупка автомобиля будет приятным волнением, а столкнулся с катастрофой. Сначала менеджеры были предупредительны, но как только перешли к оформлению, началась клоунада. Никакой прозрачности в сделке, куча скрытых платежей. Пытался выяснить, за что именно взимаются дополнительные средства, ответа так и не получил. Остался с ощущением, что меня просто обманули. Как можно так низко падать ради прибыли? 5. Я в шоке и негодовании от службы поддержки Декар. Такое впечатление, что они тренируются на клиентах, как отбиваться от вопросов, не давая конкретных ответов. Возникла проблема с ПТС – так и не смогли адекватно ее решить. Обещали \\"проверить информацию\\" и так неделями. Честно, лучше бы я купил авто с рук, чем через такой автосалон, где клиенты для них – это просто способ заработать деньги, а не люди.

It is a combination drug that contains two active ingredients: bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide. Bisoprolol is a beta-blocker that works by reducing the heart rate and the heart's workload, making the heart beat more slowly and with less force. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic (water pill) that helps reduce blood pressure by removing excess salt and water from the body through urine. This combination of a beta-blocker and a diuretic effectively lowers blood pressure, which can help prevent strokes, heart attacks, and kidney problems. Like all medications, Concor Plus can have some side effects, and it's important for patients to be aware of these and discuss them with their healthcare provider. Patients taking Concor Plus should follow their doctor's instructions regarding dosage, as this can vary depending on their individual health condition and response to treatment. It's also important for patients on this medication to maintain regular check-ups with their healthcare provider to monitor their progress and make any necessary adjustments to their treatment regimen."},{"instruction":"TE PASARE UN LISTADO DE PALABRAS CLAVE PARA QUE HAGAS TITULOS SEO OPTIMIZADOS con un tono llamativo, que incite al click. - LA PALABRA CLAVE DEBE APARECER EN EL TITULO SOLO 1 VEZ YO TE PASARE EL LISTADO DE LAS PALABRAS CLAVE QUE SON DE LA TEMATICA DE “EXCEL” DEBE SER TITULOS NO MUY LARGOS, CORTOS E PRECISOS .

Stwórz na stronie dwa elementy, które będą mogły być przenoszone: \`\`\`html <div id=\\"obiekt1\\" draggable=\\"true\\">Obiekt 1</div> <div id=\\"obiekt2\\" draggable=\\"true\\">Obiekt 2</div> \`\`\` 2. Dodaj obsługę zdarzeń dla tych elementów w JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript var przenoszonyObiekt; document.addEventListener(\\"drag\\", function(event) { // Zapisz przeciągany obiekt przenoszonyObiekt = event.target; }); document.addEventListener(\\"dragover\\", function(event) { event.preventDefault(); }); document.addEventListener(\\"drop\\", function(event) { event.preventDefault(); // Sprawdź czy obiekt przenoszony jest poprawnie if (przenoszonyObiekt) { event.target.appendChild(przenoszonyObiekt); przenoszonyObiekt = null; } }); \`\`\` W powyższym przykładzie dodajemy zdarzenia \`drag\`, \`dragover\` i \`drop\` dla elementów na stronie. Po przeciągnięciu obiektu (elementu) z elementu źródłowego (drag) i upuszczeniu go na inny element (drop), przenoszony obiekt zostanie dodany do nowego elementu.

Составляй правильно предложения, пиши без ошибок! Пиши от первого лица. Пиши эмоционально с раздражением про невыносимые условия. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера:Странный автосалон, реально странный. Хотел купить у них Lada Vesta SW Cross — по заявке 1300000 р с хвостиком. Типа 8 цветов наличии, выбрал черную. Говорят черные 1658000 р, дефицитный цвет. Ну и с кредитом протащили. Заявку подал в сбер на авто под 9% через них, отказали. Первый автомобиль по автокредиту должен быть меньше миллиона. Менеджеры гнали на банк. И предложили потребительскую хню под 27%. через свои каналы. Название банка до этого ни разу не слышал. Неоправданно дорого и не вызывает доверия. Слишком большая выплата в месяц получается. Не стал связываться. Атмосфера в салоне болото. Видно, что пытаются нажиться и менеджеры из кожи лезут, чтобы впарить свой кредит даже в ущерб здравому смыслу. но получается через пень колоду — раз за разом-то одно и тоже и еще через клиента или даже чаще отказы получать. Злятся и выходят из себя. Не посоветую.","output":"1. Абсолютный кошмар этот салон Декар! Решил прикупить новенький SUV, да что там новенький – хотя бы в приличном состоянии. Обещали \\"огромный выбор\\" и \\"наилучшие условия покупки\\". А по факту? Полный обман. Цены на сайте и реальность - две большие разницы. Заинтересовался одной моделью по приятной цене, но когда дошло до дела, оказалось что стоимость на 30% выше из-за \\"невидимых\\" наценок типа расширенной гарантии, которую я даже не просил! И это ещё не всё, предложенные условия кредитования - это просто какой-то беспредел. Проценты заоблачные, и всё это под давлением, словно бы это единственный шанс в жизни купить авто. Обсуждать что-либо - бесполезно, как будто говоришь со стеной. Ушёл, не купив ничего, атмосфера удушливая, только время потерял. 2. Ну вот и я попал в ловушку салона Декар. Приехал за новым автомобилем, а попал на карусель из странных условий и хитрых уловок. Презентуют машину как лучшее, что только можно заработать, а когда доходит до оформления - начинается цирк. Дополняют стоимость разными \\"опциями\\", которые я даже не заказывал. И когда я начал возражать, мне сразу же начали давить на жалость и вешать лапшу на уши про \\"особые условия только для вас\\". На выходе предложили кредит с такой переплатой, что проще на лошади передвигаться. Не рекомендую сюда обращаться, если цените свои нервы и кошелёк. 3. Как только не пожалеешь о своём решении зайти в салон Декар... Подыскивал себе небольшой городской автомобиль, но получил кучу головной боли в подарок. Предложили мне \\"эксклюзивный\\" автомобиль по \\"специальной цене\\", которая оказалась выше рыночной на сотни тысяч. А когда я начал уточнять детали, такое впечатление, что менеджеры играют в молчанку – конкретных ответов не дождёшься! При попытке обсудить условия кредитования, меня пытались запутать ещё сильнее, предлагая сомнительные схемы оплаты. Успешно избежал покупки и потратил лишь своё время. Остался разочарован и без автомобиля. 4. Жесть, что творится в салоне \\"Декар\\", это просто пытка для покупателя! Мечтал обновить свою старую тачку, но вместо этого получил мастер-класс по выносливости. Ценник на авто внезапно \\"подрос\\" в процессе оформления, а когда я поинтересовался, почему так, ответ был \\"мелкий шрифт\\" в условиях, которые, конечно, никто заранее не объясняет. Стали уговаривать на покупку дополнений, без которых я спокойно обходился бы, а когда я отказался, отношение менеджера изменилось как день и ночь. Ощущение, что ты не клиент, а цель для \\"охоты\\". Вышел оттуда с чувством глубокого разочарования и без авто. 5. Как я жалею, что пришёл в этот автосалон Декар... Мечтал о спокойной покупке новенького седана, но попал в автомобильный ад. Стоимость автомобиля в процессе общения раза в два выше объявленной - оказывается, в стоимость изначально не включены \\"обязательные\\" услуги. Про кредитные условия даже говорить страшно: проценты, от которых волосы дыбом становятся. Беседа с менеджерами превращается в бесконечный спор, где твои аргументы игнорируются, а их \\"выгодные\\" предложения звучат как угроза. Ушел, чувствуя себя обманутым и ограбленным, даже не купив авто.

Here's how you can set up Apache HTTP Server on SLES 15: 1. Install Apache HTTP Server by running the following command: \`\`\` sudo zypper install apache2 \`\`\` 2. Start the Apache service and enable it to start on boot by running the following commands: \`\`\` sudo systemctl start apache2 sudo systemctl enable apache2 \`\`\` 3. Place the files you want to expose for download in the \`/srv/www/htdocs/\` directory. You can either copy the files directly to this directory or create a subdirectory to organize your files. 4. Access the files through a web browser by entering the IP address or hostname of your SLES 15 server in the address bar followed by the file path. For example, if your server's IP address is 192.168.1.100 and you placed a file named \`example.txt\` in the \`/srv/www/htdocs/\` directory, you can access the file by entering the following URL in your web browser: \`\`\` http://192.168.1.100/example.txt \`\`\` Alternatively, you can create HTML links on a webpage to make the files easily accessible for download. 5. If you want to restrict access to certain files or directories, you can configure Apache's access control settings in the \`/etc/apache2/httpd.conf\` or \`/etc/apache2/default-server.conf\` file.

Bu örnekte, basit bir hareket algılama mekanizması oluşturacağız. Hareket algılandığında, sistem bir alarm sesi çalacaktır. Bu projeyi gerçekleştirmek için öncelikle \`opencv-python\` ve \`pygame\` kütüphanelerini kurmanız gerekiyor. Bunları kurmak için terminalinizde veya komut isteminizde aşağıdaki komutları çalıştırabilirsiniz: \`\`\`bash pip install opencv-python pip install pygame \`\`\` \`pygame\` kütüphanesi, alarm sesi çalmak için kullanılacaktır.

Ayrıca, hareketin minimum alanını belirlemek için \`cv2.contourArea(contour) > 5000\` değerini kendi gereksinimlerinize göre ayarlayabilirsiniz. Eğer istenilen hareketin büyüklüğüne göre hassasiyeti ayarlamak istiyorsanız, \`cv2.contourArea(contour) > 5000\` kod satırındaki değeri değiştirebilirsiniz. Bu değer, algılanacak minimum piksel alanını temsil eder. Daha küçük hareketleri algılamak için bu değeri azaltabilir, daha büyük hareketler için ise bu değeri artırabilirsiniz.

**召回率** = （正确返回的相关项目数）/ （实际存在的相关项目总数） - 在这个例子中，如果实际有300张相关图片，那么召回率 = 200 / 300 = 0.67 或 67% 召回率越高，意味着系统能够从整个数据库中召回更多的相关项目，这通常是提升用户体验和系统性能的关键因素。特别是在信息检索、推荐系统等应用中，高召回率能够确保用户不会错过可能感兴趣的项目。 然而，召回率并不是评价一个系统好坏的唯一指标。在实际应用中，还需要综合考虑其他指标，如准确率（Precision，即返回的结果中，真正相关的项目所占的比例）和查询速度等，以达到最佳的性能平衡。通常情况下，召回率与准确率之间会存在一定的权衡。"},{"instruction":"作为向量数据库的专家，我作为初学者，你帮我解释下 相识度距离的原理，并且他们有哪些计算分类以及有对应的哪些使用场景，以及使用要求和优缺点。","output":"向量数据库在处理查询时，核心任务之一是衡量数据项之间的相似度或差异度。这种衡量通常通过计算向量之间的“相似度距离”完成。向量之间的距离可以理解为它们在多维空间中的相对位置关系，距离越小意味着相似度越高，反之亦然。 # 相似度距离的原理 相似度距离的计算方法多种多样，每种方法都有其适用的场景和特点。这些方法的基础原理是将数据项表示为向量，通过数学方法计算它们之间的距离或角度差异来量化它们的相似度。 # 计算分类及使用场景 1. **欧氏距离（Euclidean Distance）** - **原理**: 两个向量在多维空间中的“直线”距离。 - **使用场景**: 物理空间中的距离测量，如位置追踪、图像特征的简单比较。 - **优点**: 直观、简单。 - **缺点**: 不适用于高维空间，可能因为维度的诅咒（Curse of Dimensionality）导致性能下降。 2. **余弦相似度（Cosine Similarity）** - **原理**: 计算两个向量之间的夹角，夹角越小，相似度越高。 - **使用场景**: 文本处理、信息检索，适用于评估文档或词汇之间的相似性。 - **优点**: 不受向量长度影响，适用于高维数据。 - **缺点**: 主要关注方向而非大小，可能不适用于所有场景。 3. **曼哈顿距离（Manhattan Distance）** - **原理**: 向量在各维度上的差值的绝对值之和。 - **使用场景**: 网格状结构的路径寻找，城市街区距离计算。 - **优点**: 在网格状或离散空间中效果良好。 - **缺点**: 在连续或非网格空间效果不佳。 4. **汉明距离（Hamming Distance）** - **原理**: 两个等长字符串之间的汉明距离是两个字符串对应位置的不同字符的个数。 - **使用场景**: DNA序列比较，错误检测和校正编码。 - **优点**: 在需要确切匹配度量时很有用。 - **缺点**: 只适用于等长序列的比较。 5. **杰卡德相似度（Jaccard Similarity）** - **原理**: 两个集合交集大小与并集大小之比。 - **使用场景**: 推荐系统，分类问题，适用于评估集合的相似度。 - **优点**: 不受重复元素影响，适合处理集合数据。 - **缺点**: 对于有大量重复元素的数据表现可能不佳。 # 使用要求和注意事项 - **明确问题和数据的性质**：选取适合问题特性的相似度距离计算方法非常关键。 - **考虑数据维度**：维数越高，某些距离度量（如欧氏距离）的效果可能会变差。 - **计算效率与精度的平衡**：在一些实时或大规模应用中，计算效率可能与精度出现权衡。 # 总结 每种相似度距离计算方法都有其适用场景和优缺点。选择合适的方法取决于应用的具体需求，包括数据的性质、问题域、以及对效率和精度的要求。理解这些基本原理和特性有助于在实际项目中作出更合理的选择。"},{"instruction":"比如学生摸一个题型做错了，我想提供给这个学生一个类似的题型的题目。这种用什么相识度距离来做比较合适呢？","output":"在教育领域，特别是在提供针对学生错题的相似题型时，我们需要寻找一种方式来测量题目之间的相似度。这个情况需求比较独特，因为题目的相似性不仅仅依赖于表面的文字或数字相似度，还涉及到题目逻辑、解题策略和知识点等多个层面的相似性。 一个相对比较合适的做法是利用**语义相似度**的方法，结合**知识图谱**对题目进行比较。这里我们可以考虑以下几个方面： 1. **余弦相似度（Cosine Similarity）**于文本向量化后的题目描述进行比较，这对于评估题目的文字和概念性内容的相似度很有帮助。通过将题目描述转化为向量（例如使用TF-IDF或Word2Vec等方式），我们可以计算这些向量之间的余弦相似度。 2. **知识点匹配**：每个题目通常对应一定的知识点。如果两个题目涉及到相同的知识点或相关知识点，它们在逻辑和解题策略上会有较高的相似性。这需要建立一个知识图谱，用来表示各个知识点之间的关系。 3. **难度系数**：除了知识点和题目描述，难度系数也是比较题目相似度的一个重要因素。即使两个题目在内容上非常相似，但难度系数不同，也可能不适合作为针对特定错题的练习。 4. **结合多个度量**：在实际应用中，可能需要结合以上几种度量方法来综合评估题目之间的相似度。例如，可以先筛选出涉及相同知识点的题目，然后在这个基础上，进一步通过余弦相似度等方法比较题目描述的相似性，最终考虑难度系数的匹配。 综上所述，在这种应用场景下，没有单一的“最合适”的相似度距离计算方法。相反，需要一个综合考虑题目内容、知识点和难度等多个因素的方法。通过深度学习和自然语言处理技术的进步，我们现在可以更高效地提取和比较这些复杂的题目特征，从而为学生提供更加个性化和针对性的学习资源。"},{"instruction":"初中 高中数学的知识图谱还有吗","output":"截止到我的最后更新（2023年4月），我无法直接访问或提供具体的初中和高中数学知识图谱的数据库或文件。然而，我可以说明知识图谱创建和使用的基本概念，以及你可以如何着手开发或寻找相关的资源。 # 知识图谱的基本概念 知识图谱是一种结构化的知识表示方法，它通过实体（节点）和实体之间的关系（边）来组织数据。在教育领域，这些实体通常是知识点、概念、定理、公式等，而实体之间的关系则是这些知识点之间的依赖、归属、类比等。 # 创建初中和高中数学知识图谱 创建一个初中和高中数学的知识图谱涉及几个步骤： 1. **收集知识点**：包括公式、定理、概念等，这需要对应的教育和数学背景知识。 2. **定义关系**：确定知识点之间的关系，包括但不限于前置知识、包含关系、应用关系等。 3. **构建模型**：使用图形数据库（如Neo4j）或其他适合表示图形结构的工具来构建和存储知识图谱。 4. **验证和迭代**：通过实际应用和反馈对知识图谱进行优化和完善。 # 寻找相关资源 虽然我不能直接提供具体的数据库或图谱，但以下方式或许能帮助你找到现有的资源或启发你如何创建自己的知识图谱： -

Her fingertips grace the water's surface, the illusory duality of her reflection in the depth embodying hidden knowledge and the untapped unconscious","output":"The description you’ve provided paints a vivid and evocative image of the High Priestess tarot card, reimagined through an artistic lens reminiscent of Christine Ellger's style. Christine Ellger is known for her surreal, dreamlike photographic compositions, which often juxtapose elements in unexpected and thought-provoking ways. Applying this style to a tarot card, especially the High Priestess, adds layers of symbolism and depth to the interpretation of the card’s meaning. The High Priestess, in traditional tarot, is a symbol of hidden knowledge, intuition, and the subconscious mind. She sits at the threshold between the seen and unseen worlds, the conscious and the subconscious. The High Priestess represents the mysteries that cannot be easily articulated or understood in the light of rational thought; she deals with realms beyond the surface level of consciousness. In the reimagined scene you've provided, the High Priestess stands on a moonlit shore, suggesting a powerful connection with the moon, which is often associated with feminine energy, intuition, and the unconscious. The moonlit setting emphasizes the mystical and secretive aspects of the High Priestess, enhancing her association with the night, dreams, and the unseen realms of intuition and insight. Her form being \\"distorted and blurred in the rippling tide\\" suggests the elusive nature of the subconscious and the mysteries it holds. Water is a common symbol for emotions, the subconscious, and the flow of psychic intuition. The interaction between her fingertips and the water's surface, creating ripples, symbolizes the act of accessing the subconscious mind and the ripple effect such insights can have on one’s conscious life. The \\"illusory duality of her reflection\\" speaks to the concept of duality present in many interpretations of the High Priestess: consciousness and the subconscious, the seen and the unseen, the known and the unknown. This duality is at the heart of the High Priestess's symbolism, and the image of her reflection in the water perfectly embodies the exploration of these dual aspects of existence. Incorporating Christine Ellger’s art style into this description brings a dreamlike, surreal quality to the High Priestess, emphasizing the mystical and enigmatic aspects of the card. This approach invites a more introspective and imaginative engagement with the card, encouraging the viewer to delve into the depths of their own subconscious and intuition to discover hidden truths and insights."},{"instruction":"Icebones' Hierophant: A warped figure shrouded in unearthly shadow preaches to an assembly of specters in a haunting cathedral of ice. A chilling representation of tradition, conventional wisdom, but flavored with an icy bite of dogmatism","output":"The vivid imagery you've crafted for the \\"Icebones' Hierophant\\" is a unique and imaginative reinterpretation of the traditional Hierophant tarot card. Traditionally, the Hierophant represents tradition, conformity, education, and belief systems. It's often associated with a spiritual or religious leader who acts as a bridge between humanity and the divine, guiding followers according to established doctrines and practices. The card can also signify institutions and their established values. In your reimagined version, the Hierophant's typical portrayal within structured religion or traditional educational systems is transformed into a more mystical and perhaps darker figure, preaching to an assembly of specters in a \\"haunting cathedral of ice.\\" This icy, spectral environment and congregation shift the focus of the Hierophant's guidance from the warmth of communal tradition and learning to a colder, more isolated stance, emphasizing the rigid, unyielding nature of dogma. The \\"warped figure shrouded in unearthly shadow\\" suggests a perversion or extreme interpretation of the Hierophant's traditional role. Rather than embodying wisdom and authority in a nurturing sense, this figure seems to impose its will, its teachings hardened and cold as the ice surrounding it. This could serve as a critique or warning against blindly following tradition without questioning or understanding its underlying principles and motives. The presence of specters as the congregation is particularly evocative; they could represent souls lost to or trapped by the icy grip of dogmatism, unable to progress or think freely due to the chilling effects of rigid tradition. These specters could also imply that the teachings being imparted in this icy cathedral are outdated or no longer relevant to the living, yet they are upheld by the hierophant as immutable truths. The choice of an \\"icy bite of dogmatism\\" perfectly complements the traditional meanings associated with the Hierophant, introducing a nuanced layer that speaks to the dangers of unyielding adherence to conventions or authority. This chilling representation prompts introspection about our own practices, beliefs, and the authority figures we choose to follow. It suggests that while tradition and guidance have their places, they should not become so rigid as to stifle growth, innovation, or personal freedom of thought. Your reinterpretation of the Hierophant into this ice-themed scene laden with spectral followers and an eerie atmosphere beautifully highlights the complexities and potential pitfalls of tradition, conventional wisdom, and dogma, urging a more discerning and flexible approach to the structures and authorities that guide us."},{"instruction":"How to confirm a balance of a bitcoin regtest private key, matching the mainnet with its corresponding address, on the electrum mainnet?","output":"Confirming the balance of a Bitcoin private key designed for Regtest (Regression Test Mode) on the Electrum mainnet involves several steps and important considerations. It's crucial to understand the distinct differences between Regtest, Testnet, and Mainnet in the Bitcoin ecosystem: 1. **Regtest (Regression Test Mode)**: This is a private testing network used by developers. It allows them to control block creation and can be used to test transaction without real money involved. It operates in a sandbox for the specific developer or group of developers. 2. **Testnet**: This is the global Bitcoin test network that mimics the Bitcoin Mainnet. It's used by developers to test Bitcoin transactions without using real bitcoins. 3. **Mainnet**: This is the primary network where actual Bitcoin transactions occur. The coins on this network have real value. Given these differences, it's important to highlight that a private key from the Regtest will not directly correspond to funds on the Mainnet because the two networks operate independently, and the transactions or balances on one do not reflect on the other. **However, if your aim is to check the balance of a Mainnet address (that matches the private key originally used in Regtest), following these steps might help, given you are aware and cautious of the security implications:** # Preliminary Steps: - Ensure that Electrum is installed and that you're familiar with its operation. - **Caution:** Importing your private keys into third-party wallets can expose your funds to theft if the application is compromised or malicious. # Importing a Private Key into Electrum: 1. **Launch Electrum**: Start Electrum on your computer. If you haven’t already installed it, download it from the official website and follow the installation instructions. 2. **Create a New Wallet**: Electrum will ask you to create a new wallet. Choose \\"Import Bitcoin addresses or private keys\\" and then proceed. 3. **Enter the Private Key**: Type the private key you want to check the balance for and continue. This key should correspond to a Bitcoin Mainnet address. 4. **Synchronization**: After setup, Electrum will sync to the Bitcoin network to retrieve transactions related to the imported private key. This process may take some time depending on the network connection and the number of transactions. 5. **Check Balance**: Once synchronized, you will be able to see the balance and transaction history for the address corresponding to the imported private key. # Important Security Note: - It's strongly recommended to not reuse addresses or private keys that have been exposed or used for testing purposes, especially in a development environment like Regtest. For actual transactions involving real funds on the Mainnet, consider generating a new address and private key within a secure environment. Finally, always ensure that your Electrum wallet and all other cryptocurrency tools are up-to-date to protect against vulnerabilities and ensure compatibility with the latest network protocols."},{"instruction":"No! I managed to make the regtest private keys and addresses matching the mainnet!","output":"If you've managed to create Regtest private keys and addresses that match those on the Bitcoin Mainnet, it implies you've generated addresses using the same cryptographic methods (e.g., using the same elliptic curve parameters and hashing algorithms) that are valid across both networks. This is technically feasible because Bitcoin addresses are derived from public keys, which in turn are derived from private keys, following the same cryptographic principles regardless of the network (Mainnet, Testnet, or Regtest). However, it's crucial to understand that while the addresses might be technically identical in format and derivation, the balances and transactions associated with them on the Regtest network and the Mainnet are entirely separate. The Regtest network is isolated and used for development purposes, meaning any transactions or balances on Regtest do not exist on the Mainnet and vice versa. If your goal is to check the balance of these addresses on the Mainnet using Electrum, here's how you can do it, keeping in mind the security precautions mentioned previously: # Using Electrum to Check Balance for a Mainnet Address: 1. **Open Electrum**: Ensure you're using the latest version of Electrum for security and compatibility reasons. 2. **Create a New Wallet for Watching**: Instead of importing the private key directly (which poses a security risk), you can create a watch-only wallet using the public address. This allows you to monitor the balance and transactions without exposing your private key. Select \`File\` > \`New/Restore\`, enter a name for your new wallet, and choose \`Standard wallet\` > \`Use a master key\`. Here, you can input your address. 3. **Synchronize**: Electrum will synchronize with the Bitcoin Mainnet to retrieve the transaction history and balance for the provided address. This process can take some time. 4. **View Balance**: Once synchronized, you'll be able to see the balance and transaction history for the address. # Security Considerations: - **Private Key Exposure**: Importing your private key into any online device or software can expose it to potential theft. Always consider the security implications. - **Watch-Only Wallets**: Using a watch-only wallet in Electrum allows you to monitor addresses without exposing your private keys, offering a safer alternative to direct key importation. # Conclusion: While you can generate addresses that are valid on both Regtest and Mainnet, the transactions and balances will not overlap due to the isolated nature of these networks. Using Electrum's watch-only feature is a secure way to monitor your Mainnet addresses without risking your private keys. Always prioritize security and privacy when handling cryptocurrency keys and addresses."},{"instruction":"How to get master key from the bitcoin core?","output":"As of my last update in 2023, Bitcoin Core does not directly use the concept of a \\"master key\\" in the way that hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets like Electrum do. Bitcoin Core does support HD wallets since version 0.13.0, but it doesn't expose a master private key (xprv) or master public key (xpub) in the user interface or through a simple RPC command in a straightforward manner like some other wallet software. HD wallets generate all of their addresses from a single seed, with the master keys being the root from which these addresses are derived. In wallets that use this system, knowing the master key allows the user (or anyone who has it) to generate all the addresses and private keys in the wallet, hence it's crucial to keep it secure. # Extracting HD Wallet Information in Bitcoin Core If you're using Bitcoin Core and want to extract HD wallet information, you might be looking for the wallet's extended public key (xpub) or something similar. Here's a general approach to finding related information: 1. **Backup Your Wallet**: Always ensure you have a current backup of your wallet.dat file before attempting to extract or manipulate wallet data. 2. **Use the dumpwallet RPC**: Bitcoin Core provides a \`dumpwallet\` RPC command that exports all wallet private keys to a text file, along with some additional information. This command might include the HD seed (if the wallet is HD), but it won't directly give you an \\"xpub\\". \`\`\` dumpwallet \\"filename\\" \`\`\` Replace \`\\"filename\\"\` with the path where you want to save the dump file. Be careful with this file, as it contains sensitive data. 3. **Finding the HD Seed**: If your wallet is an HD wallet, the \`dumpwallet\` output will include the HD seed (look for a line starting with \`# HD seed\`). This seed is the basis for all key generation in the wallet but is not the same as an xpub. It's more akin to the root from which the master private key is derived. 4. **Deriving Extended Keys**: Deriving the actual master private key (xprv) or master public key (xpub) from the HD seed or any other information in Bitcoin Core is not straightforward and typically requires external tools or libraries capable of handling BIP32 (the HD wallet standard). Libraries like \`libbitcoin\`, \`bitcoinjs-lib\` (for JavaScript), or \`pycoin\` (for Python) can derive these keys if you provide the seed or root key. # Important Security Note Be extremely cautious when handling seeds, master keys, or any cryptographic material. Exposing these to an insecure environment, malicious software, or the internet can lead to loss of funds. Perform such operations offline, on a secure device, and only if you fully understand the risks and procedures. # Conclusion Bitcoin Core is primarily focused on node operation and transaction verification, and while it supports HD wallets, it doesn't offer an easy way to manage or expose master keys as some other wallet software does. For advanced operations like deriving master keys or handling seeds, you might need to use additional tools or libraries, always with a strong emphasis on security."},{"instruction":"write an email to ask each department to provide staff name on the seating plan for relocation and future use.

Conclusions on the first chapter You can add some useful technical information","output":"Chapter 1: **Execution Tactics in Malware** 1.1. **General Overview of Existing Cyber Attacks** The digital age, while providing numerous advantages, has also spawned various forms of cyber attacks that threaten the security and integrity of data across the globe. Cyber attacks leverage different strategies to exploit vulnerabilities in systems, including but not limited to, viruses, ransomware, phishing, and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. These attacks can lead to significant financial losses, disruption of services, and theft of sensitive information. Understanding the landscape of these threats is the first step in developing mechanisms to detect and prevent such attacks effectively. 1.2. **Methods and Means Used to Carry Out Cyber Attacks** Cyber attacks are carried out using a myriad of methods, each designed to exploit specific vulnerabilities or to take advantage of the user's lack of awareness. Common methods include: - **Malware**: Software specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. - **Social Engineering**: Manipulative techniques that trick users into giving away sensitive information or access to their systems. - **Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) Attacks**: Where attackers intercept communication between two parties to steal or manipulate the data being exchanged. - **SQL Injection**: Where attackers inject malicious SQL code into a database to gain access to or manipulate the data. Each of these methods requires a unique approach for detection and prevention, making it crucial for cybersecurity measures to be adaptive and robust. 1.3. **Committing Cyber Attacks Using Execution Tactics** Execution tactics refer to the techniques employed by cybercriminals to execute malicious code within a target system without detection. These tactics often rely on exploiting system vulnerabilities, such as unpatched software or insecure system configurations, and leveraging sophisticated methodologies to evade detection mechanisms. A common execution tactic involves living-off-the-land (LotL) binaries and scripts, which use legitimate system tools for malicious purposes, making detection significantly more challenging. Furthermore, fileless malware attacks, which reside entirely in memory and leave minimal footprints, represent another advanced execution tactic, complicating the traditional antivirus-based detection approaches. Understanding the execution tactics employed can aid in developing targeted strategies for detection and prevention, such as behavior analysis, anomaly detection, and adopting a zero-trust security model that assumes breach and verifies each request as if it originates from an untrusted network. 1.4. **Conclusions on the First Chapter** The evolving landscape of cyber threats necessitates a profound understanding of the tactics employed by cybercriminals, especially concerning the execution of malicious payloads. Traditional security measures often fall short in detecting and mitigating such threats due to their reliance on signature-based detection and inability to adapt to sophisticated execution tactics. Therefore, it becomes imperative to incorporate advanced detection methodologies, such as machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection, behavior-based analysis, and adopting comprehensive security frameworks that account for the diverse nature of cyber threats. Furthermore, education and awareness programs play a crucial role in preventing successful cyber attacks. By understanding the common methods and execution tactics used by attackers, organizations and individuals can better prepare and protect themselves from potential threats. This chapter laid the groundwork for analyzing cyber attacks, with a focus on execution tactics, setting the stage for discussing detection and prevention mechanisms in subsequent chapters."},{"instruction":"Make chapter bigger","output":"Expanding on the initial framework, let's delve deeper into each section with more technical details and analysis. --- **Chapter 1: Execution Tactics in Malware** **1.1. General Overview of Existing Cyber Attacks** Cyber attacks have evolved from simple nuisances to complex, sophisticated threats that target every aspect of digital life. The variety of attacks include, but are not limited to: - **Viruses and Worms**: Malicious programs designed to replicate and spread to other computers, often damaging systems or stealing data. - **Ransomware**: Malware that encrypts a victim's files, with the attacker demanding payment for the decryption key. - **Phishing**: Deceptive communications, usually emails, designed to steal sensitive data like login credentials and credit card numbers. - **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**: Prolonged and targeted cyberattacks where attackers infiltrate a network to steal data over time. Each of these attacks represents a significant risk to individuals and organizations, highlighting the critical need for effective cybersecurity measures. **1.2. Methods and Means Used to Carry Out Cyber Attacks** Attacks are meticulously planned and executed using a range of methods, including but not limited to: - **Drive-by Downloads**: Where software is unknowingly downloaded from the internet, exploiting a web browser, app, or OS vulnerability. - **Exploit Kits**: Tools that attackers use to exploit vulnerabilities in software on the victim’s computer to install malware. - **Credential Stuffing**: Automated attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems using stolen username-password pairs. - **Zero-Day Exploits**: Attacks targeting software vulnerabilities that are unknown to the vendor and therefore have no patch available. The sophistication of these methods illustrates the advanced capabilities of modern cyber adversaries and the importance of equally sophisticated defense mechanisms. **1.3. Committing Cyber Attacks Using Execution Tactics** Execution tactics enable attackers to run malicious code within a system stealthily. These include, but are not limited to: - **Process Injection**: Injecting malicious code into legitimate processes to evade detection by leveraging trusted, benign applications to conduct malicious activities. - **PowerShell Exploitation**: Utilizing the powerful scripting language built into Windows to execute commands that download and run malicious code. - **Macro-based Malware**: Embedding malware in macros within documents that execute when the document is opened, often bypassing traditional security measures. - **Scheduled Task Abuse**: Malware that sets tasks to run at specific times, leveraging native task scheduling tools to persist on a system undetected. Each tactic requires specific detection and prevention strategies, emphasizing the need for advanced, multi-layered security solutions. **1.4. Conclusions on the First Chapter** The continuous evolution of cyber threats necessitates a dynamic and adaptive approach to cybersecurity. Understanding the variety of cyber attacks and the methods used to carry them out is foundational for developing effective defense mechanisms. Traditional security measures are often inadequate against modern execution tactics, underscoring the importance of advanced detection technologies such as machine learning, behavior analytics, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. Moreover, the role of education and awareness cannot be overstated. A well-informed user base can dramatically reduce the risk of successful attacks.

This extended overview sets a more detailed context for the subsequent exploration of methodologies to detect and counteract cyber threats, focusing on execution tactics as a pivotal element in the anatomy of advanced cyber attacks."},{"instruction":"come funziona la skolemizzazione?","output":"La skolemizzazione è un processo utilizzato nella logica matematica, in particolare nella logica del primo ordine, per eliminare i quantificatori esistenziali. Questa trasformazione è importante soprattutto nell'ambito della dimostrazione automatica dei teoremi e nella programmazione logica. Lo scopo della skolemizzazione è di convertire una formula in una forma equivalente che è più gestibile per l'elaborazione automatica, mantenendo inalterata la sua soddisfacibilità. Il processo prende il nome dal matematico norvegese Thoralf Skolem. Ecco una descrizione di come funziona la skolemizzazione, spiegata in modo semplice: **Passo 1: Forma prenex** Prima di procedere con la skolemizzazione, è necessario che la formula sia in forma prenex, cioè tutti i quantificatori devono essere spostati all'inizio della formula. Per fare ciò, si utilizzano le leggi della logica per spostare i quantificatori e cambiare opportunamente i limiti delle variabili. **Passo 2: Eliminare i quantificatori universali** Il prossimo passo è ignorare temporaneamente i quantificatori universali (forall) durante il processo di skolemizzazione. Questo passaggio è possibile perché lo scopo della skolemizzazione è eliminare i quantificatori esistenziali (exists), e i quantificatori universali non influenzano direttamente questa operazione. **Passo 3: Skolemizzazione dei quantificatori esistenziali** Ogni volta che si incontra un quantificatore esistenziale, si elimina sostituendolo con una funzione di Skolem. Questa funzione è un simbolo di funzione nuovo e unico, che non appare da nessuna altra parte nella formula. La funzione di Skolem dipenderà da tutte le variabili quantificate universalmente che hanno una portata che include il quantificatore esistenziale che stiamo eliminando. Se non ci sono quantificatori universali che influenzano il quantificatore esistenziali, si introduce una costante di Skolem (che è un caso speciale di funzione di Skolem con zero argomenti). Ecco un esempio per chiarire: Sia data la formula: (forall x exists y (P(x, y))) Per skolemizzare, si sostituisce (y) con una funzione di Skolem che dipende da (x), ad esempio (f(x)), ottenendo: (forall x (P(x, f(x)))) Questo ci ha permesso di eliminare il quantificatore esistenziale creando una nuova formula, la cui soddisfacibilità è equivalente alla formula originale, ma senza quantificatori esistenziali. **Conclusione:** La formula risultante dalla skolemizzazione è priva di quantificatori esistenziali e quindi più facilmente manipolabile da algoritmi per la risoluzione di problemi logici. Va notato che, mentre la skolemizzazione preserva la soddisfacibilità della formula originale (ovvero, se la formula originale è soddisfacibile, anche la formula skolemizzata lo è), essa può alterare la verità in senso stretto. Cioè, non preserva necessariamente l'equivalenza logica, ma assicura che se esiste un modello per la formula skolemizzata, allora esisteva un modello anche per la formula originale."},{"instruction":"Fammi un esempio in cui viene introdotta una costante di skolem","output":"Ecco un semplice esempio di skolemizzazione in cui viene introdotta una costante di Skolem. L'uso di una costante di Skolem avviene quando eliminiamo un quantificatore esistenziale che non è \\"dominato\\" da alcun quantificatore universale. **Formula Originale:** Supponiamo di avere la seguente formula logica del primo ordine: [ exists x P(x) ] Questa formula afferma che esiste almeno un elemento (x) tale per cui la proprietà (P(x)) è vera. **Passo 1: Identificare i quantificatori** La formula contiene un solo quantificatore, che è esistenziale ((exists)). Non ci sono quantificatori universali che lo dominano, quindi procediamo direttamente alla Skolemizzazione. **Passo 2: Skolemizzazione** Per skolemizzare la formula, dobbiamo rimuovere il quantificatore esistenziale sostituendo la variabile (x) con una costante di Skolem. Essendo che non ci sono quantificatori universali che influenzano (x), usiamo una costante. Supponiamo di scegliere come costante di Skolem (c). La nostra formula diventa: [ P(c) ] **Risultato** Abbiamo eliminato il quantificatore esistenziale introducendo una costante di Skolem (c). La formula risultante (P(c)) afferma che la proprietà (P) è vera per un particolare elemento (c). La presenza di (c) in questo contesto implica l'esistenza di almeno un elemento per cui (P) è vera, senza specificare di chi si tratta. Questo metodo mantiene la soddisfacibilità della formula originale: se la formula originale è soddisfacibile (ovvero, esiste almeno un elemento per cui (P) è vero), allora anche la formula skolemizzata è soddisfacibile. La skolemizzazione in questo caso ha trasformato una formula che afferma l'esistenza di un generico elemento con certa proprietà in una formula che afferma la presenza di un elemento specifico, identificato dalla costante di Skolem, che soddisfa tale proprietà. Questo è particolarmente utile nelle procedure di prova in cui gestire entità specifiche anziché entità generiche può semplificare la manipolazione logica e computazionale."},{"instruction":"Fammi vedere un esempio in cui si introduce sia una funzione che una costante","output":"Consideriamo la seguente formulazione logica del primo ordine che richiederà l'introduzione sia di una costante di Skolem che di una funzione di Skolem durante il suo processo di skolemizzazione: **Formula Originale:** [ exists x forall y exists z P(x, y, z) ] Questa formula afferma che esiste un (x) tale per cui, per ogni (y), esiste un (z) tale che la proprietà (P(x, y, z)) è vera. **Passo 1: Identificare i quantificatori e trasformare in forma prenex** La formula è già in forma prenex, con un quantificatore esistenziale seguito da un quantificatore universale e infine da un altro quantificatore esistenziale. Quindi, possiamo procedere direttamente alla skolemizzazione. **Passo 2: Skolemizzazione** 1. **Eliminare il primo quantificatore esistenziale ((x))**: Per il primo quantificatore esistenziale (exists x), non c'è alcun quantificatore universale che lo domina, quindi introduciamo una **costante di Skolem** (c), sostituendo ogni occorrenza di (x) con (c). Formula risultante: (forall y exists z P(c, y, z)) 2. **Eliminare il secondo quantificatore esistenziale ((z))**: Ora, abbiamo un quantificatore esistenziale (exists z) che è dominato da un quantificatore universale (y). In questo caso, sostituiamo (z) con una **funzione di Skolem** che dipende da (y), diciamo (f(y)), inserendola ovunque appaia (z). Formula risultante: (forall y P(c, y, f(y))) **Risultato Finale:** La formula skolemizzata finale è (forall y P(c, y, f(y))). Questo implica che abbiamo sostituito: - Il quantificatore esistenziale (exists x) con una costante di Skolem (c), poiché non era condizionato da quantificatori universali. - Il quantificatore esistenziale (exists z), condizionato da (y) (per via del (forall y) che lo precede), con una funzione di Skolem (f(y)). In questo modo, siamo stati in grado di convertire una formula con quantificatori esistenziali in una formula senza, sostituendo variabili esistenziali con oggetti concreti: una costante (c) per rappresentare l'elemento esistenziale indipendente e una funzione (f(y)) per rappresentare l'elemento esistenziale che dipende da ogni (y). La formula risultante è più semplice da gestire in molti contesti computazionali, come la dimostrazione automatica dei teoremi, mantenendo equivalente la soddisfacibilità della formula originale."},{"instruction":"hello hello ! are you chat gpt 4 ?","output":"Hello!

It refers to a roadside inn where travelers (caravaners) could rest and recover from the day's journey. Caravanserais supported the flow of commerce, information, and people across the network of trade routes covering Asia, North Africa, and Southeast Europe, most notably along the Silk Road. These establishments provided water, food, lodging, and other refreshments to travelers and their animals. They were a vital part of the trade infrastructure in the regions where they were located, from the Middle Ages up until the advent of modern transportation made them obsolete. Thus, a \\"travelsarai\\" could theoretically refer to a modern concept or initiative inspired by the historical caravanserai, focusing on travel, comradery, and cultural exchange. This could be a modern hostel, hotel, or rest stop designed to cater to the needs of contemporary travelers while encapsulating the spirit and community feel of the ancient caravanserais. It might also be a brand name, project title, or a conceptual initiative aiming to enhance the travel experience through services, accommodations, or travel guidance rooted in the rich tradition of hospitality and travel support exemplified by the caravanserais.

If \\"Travelsarai\\" is identified as a travel agency in Iran, it would be a business offering travel and tourism-related services to individuals or groups traveling to or within Iran. Travel agencies such as this typically provide a range of services including but not limited to booking accommodations, arranging for guided tours, providing information about historical and cultural sites, assisting with visas and travel documents, and organizing transportation within the country. Given Iran's rich history, diverse culture, and stunning landscapes, a travel agency like Travelsarai would likely focus on showcasing the nation's numerous attractions—from ancient ruins like Persepolis to bustling bazaars in cities like Tehran and Isfahan, to the natural beauty of its mountains and deserts. They might also offer specialized tours focusing on culinary experiences, traditional arts and crafts, or hiking and adventure sports in Iran's varied terrain. Travel agencies operating within countries like Iran play an essential role in opening up these destinations to international tourists, providing vital logistical support and local knowledge that can make a visit more enriching and enjoyable. They also serve as important bridges between cultures, helping to foster mutual understanding and respect through tourism. As of my last update, for specific information about their offerings, services, and packages, contacting Travelsarai directly or visiting their official website (if available) would be the best approach.

I stand before you to shed light on the profound and multifaceted harm social media inflicts upon our youth. In an era where the number of likes determines worth and where the curated highlights of others' lives set an unrealistic standard of success, we must ask ourselves: What cost does our children’s well-being pay for this digital validation? The evidence speaks volumes. Studies after studies reveal an alarming correlation between social media use and an increase in teen depression, anxiety, and even loneliness. Yes, in a world more connected than ever before, our youth stand isolated, their self-esteem tethered to the whims of online validation that is as fleeting as it is shallow. But the harm does not stop at mental health. Consider the erosion of privacy, where every moment is commodified, shared, and scrutinized. Our teenagers live under the relentless gaze of an invisible audience, pressured to maintain a facade that aligns with the ever-changing standards of online perfection. This is not merely disconcerting; it's a crisis that undermines the very essence of their individuality and self-worth. Moreover, the threat of cyberbullying looms large—a venomous byproduct of social media's anonymity and reach. Bullies no longer lurk in hallways but hide behind the screens, their words leaving scars deep in the psyche of their victims, contributing to a climate of fear and helplessness. Yet, in the face of these daunting challenges, hope is not lost. We have the power to reclaim the narrative and steer our society towards a path of healthful coexistence with technology. This necessitates robust dialogue, stringent legislation to protect our young, and a collective effort to foster an environment where social media serves as a tool for positive change rather than a weapon that fractures the fragile self-image of our youth. Let's encourage digital literacy that empowers our teenagers to navigate social media landscapes with discernment, resilience, and a strong sense of self. It is imperative that we promote real-life connections over digital ones, emphasizing the irreplaceable value of face-to-face interactions for emotional and psychological well-being. In conclusion, the time to act is now. We must awaken to the silent distress signals emitted from our screens and respond with decisive action. Let us commit to creating a future where our youth can leverage social media as a force for good—connecting, learning, and growing without the shadows of comparison, isolation, and cyberbullying darkening their journey.

Il termine \\"speckle\\" si riferisce a un modello di interferenza granulare che si produce quando la luce laser coerente si riflette (o si trasmette attraverso) una superficie ruvida e poi si sovrappone su un piano di osservazione. Il fenomeno dello speckle è una conseguenza diretta delle proprietà costruttive e distruttive dell'interferenza tra differenti onde di luce che sono riflesse da varie parti della superficie irregolare dell'oggetto in esame. Ogni punto sulla superficie riflettente contribuisce con un'onda con fase e ampiezza definite. Quando queste onde si combinano, il risultato è un modello complesso e apparentemente casuale di zone luminose e scure. # Applicazioni Principali: 1. **Misurazioni di Deformazione e Tensione**: Nell'ingegneria meccanica, il laser speckle è impiegato per misurare le piccole deformazioni e tensioni presenti nei materiali sottoposti a carichi esterni. Questo è realizzato confrontando i modelli di speckle ottenuti prima e dopo l'applicazione del carico, permettendo una mappatura dettagliata della deformazione. 2. **Velocimetria Laser Speckle (LSV)**: Questa tecnica è usata per misurare la velocità e il flusso in fluidi o sangue, basandosi sulla variazione nel tempo dei modelli speckle causata dal movimento delle particelle nel fluido. 3. **Imaging Biomedico**: Nel campo biomedico, la tecnica di speckle dinamico è utilizzata per monitorare il flusso sanguigno e le variazioni della microcircolazione nei tessuti vivi, fornendo informazioni critiche sulle condizioni fisiologiche o patologiche. # Principi Fondamentali: - **Coerenza**: Utilizza sorgenti laser perché la coerenza della luce è fondamentale per la formazione dei modelli speckle. - **Interferenza**: Si basa sull'interferenza di onde di luce che partono da punti con elevata differenza di cammino ottico a causa della rugosità della superficie. - **Analisi digitale**: Con l'avanzamento della tecnologia CCD e CMOS, l'analisi dei modelli speckle è diventata sempre più sofisticata, consentendo la rapida acquisizione e elaborazione digitale delle immagini per determinare le variazioni con alta precisione e in tempo reale. In sintesi, la tecnica del laser speckle offre un potente strumento diagnostico e di misurazione in diverse aree della scienza e dell'ingegneria, sfruttando la natura unica delle interferenze ottiche per rivelare dettagli invisibili all'occhio nudo."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

General Overview of Existing Cyber Attacks** The realm of cybersecurity is continually evolving, with cyber attackers becoming increasingly sophisticated in their methods to compromise systems, steal sensitive information, and disrupt services. A myriad of cyber attacks exist today, each employing unique strategies and targeting different vulnerabilities within information systems. Understanding the landscape of these attacks is crucial for developing effective defenses and execution mechanisms to detect and prevent them. **Malware-based Attacks**: At the core of numerous cyber attacks is malware — malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. Malware comes in various forms, including viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, and adware. Each type has unique characteristics and modes of operation. For instance, viruses attach themselves to clean files and proliferate throughout a system, whereas ransomware encrypts victims' files, demanding a ransom for decryption keys. **Phishing and Social Engineering Attacks**: Phishing attacks deceive users into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials and financial data, by masquerading as trustworthy entities in email communications or fraudulent websites. Social engineering tactics further amplify these attacks by exploiting human psychology, tricking individuals into breaking standard security procedures. **Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks**: These attacks aim to overwhelm a system's resources, making it unavailable to intended users. DDoS attacks leverage a network of compromised computers (botnets) to launch a massive assault on the target's infrastructure, drastically amplifying the scale and impact. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: MitM attacks intercept and possibly alter the communication between two parties without their knowledge. Attackers can eavesdrop on exchanges or manipulate the information being transmitted, leading to data breaches or fraud. **Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**: APTs are prolonged and targeted cyberattacks where attackers infiltrate a network to steal data or monitor activity over an extended period without being detected. These meticulously planned attacks often target high-value targets like government agencies and large corporations. Given the diverse and constantly evolving nature of cyber threats, the detection and prevention of cyber attacks necessitate a comprehensive and adaptive approach. This includes the deployment of sophisticated cybersecurity measures, ongoing monitoring of systems for signs of intrusion, and the employment of execution mechanisms that can effectively neutralize threats before they manifest into full-blown attacks.

Cyber attackers leverage a variety of sophisticated tools and techniques to exploit vulnerabilities, carry out unauthorized actions, and evade detection. **Exploitation of Software Vulnerabilities**: One common method involves exploiting flaws or vulnerabilities in software and operating systems. Attackers write code (exploits) that target specific weaknesses, allowing them to execute arbitrary code or commandeer control of affected systems. These vulnerabilities can range from buffer overflows and SQL injection to zero-day exploits, which are previously unknown vulnerabilities that haven't been patched by the software vendors. **Phishing and Spear Phishing**: Employing deceptive emails and messages, attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware. Spear phishing is a more targeted version, where the attacker customizes their approach to fit specific individuals or organizations, increasing the chances of success. **Drive-by Downloads and Malvertising**: Attackers can compromise legitimate websites or ad networks to distribute malware. Unsuspecting users visiting these sites or clicking on these ads may inadvertently download malware onto their devices. Drive-by download attacks exploit vulnerabilities in browsers, plugins, or apps to install malware without any user interaction. **Botnets and Command and Control Servers**: A botnet is a network of infected computers (bots) controlled by an attacker (botmaster). These bots can be used to carry out DDoS attacks, send spam, or perpetrate other malicious activities. Command and control (C&C) servers issue commands to these botnets, receiving stolen data or updating malware without the users' knowledge. **Use of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)**: APTs involve stealthy, long-term network infiltration by attackers. They often use social engineering, zero-day exploits, and sophisticated malware to gain sustained access to a network, allowing them to exfiltrate data or conduct surveillance over long periods. **Living off the Land (LotL) Attacks**: Attackers use built-in tools and features of the compromised system to conduct their activities, making detection more challenging. This includes using legitimate administrative tools for malicious purposes, also known as \\"living off the land\\" techniques. **Fileless Malware**: Unlike traditional malware, fileless malware resides in the memory and does not install any files on the host's hard drive, making it harder to detect and neutralize using conventional antivirus tools. Given the array of methods and means at the disposal of cyber attackers, protection strategies must be multi-faceted and dynamic. This includes employing up-to-date security solutions, conducting regular system audits and vulnerability assessments, and training employees on the importance of cybersecurity awareness. Furthermore, an effective cyber defense strategy must also incorporate real-time threat detection and execution mechanisms capable of identifying and countering sophisticated attack methods promptly."},{"instruction":"Write the cnn code for image classification using keras.","output":"Sure, I'll provide you with a simple example of how to write CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) code for image classification using Keras, which is now integrated into TensorFlow 2 as \`tf.keras\`. This example assumes you are familiar with Python and the basics of machine learning. For this example, let's classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. 1. **Import Required Libraries**: First, ensure you have TensorFlow installed in your environment. If not, you can install it using pip (Python's package installer) by running \`pip install tensorflow\`. \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.keras import datasets, layers, models import matplotlib.pyplot as plt \`\`\` 2. **Load and Preprocess the Dataset**: The CIFAR-10 dataset is available directly in TensorFlow. \`\`\`python # Load CIFAR-10 data (train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.cifar10.load_data() # Normalize pixel values to be between 0 and 1 train_images, test_images = train_images / 255.0, test_images / 255.0 \`\`\` 3. **Verify the Data**: It's good practice to understand the data you're working with. Let's display the first 25 images from the training set and display the class name below each image. \`\`\`python class_names = ['airplane', 'automobile', 'bird', 'cat', 'deer', 'dog', 'frog', 'horse', 'ship', 'truck'] plt.figure(figsize=(10,10)) for i in range(25): plt.subplot(5,5,i+1) plt.xticks([]) plt.yticks([]) plt.grid(False) plt.imshow(train_images[i], cmap=plt.cm.binary) plt.xlabel(class_names[train_labels[i][0]]) plt.show() \`\`\` 4. **Build the CNN Model**: Here, we define a simple CNN architecture. \`\`\`python model = models.Sequential() model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3))) model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))) model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')) model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))) model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu')) # Add Dense layers on top model.add(layers.Flatten()) model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')) model.add(layers.Dense(10)) \`\`\` 5. **Compile and Train the Model**: Now compile and train the model using the \`adam\` optimizer. \`\`\`python model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True), metrics=['accuracy']) history = model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_images, test_labels)) \`\`\` 6. **Evaluate the Model**: Let's evaluate the model on the test dataset. \`\`\`python test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2) print('nTest accuracy:', test_acc) \`\`\` 7. **Display Training History**: Optionally, you can plot the training and validation accuracy and loss over time, which can help identify overfitting and understand how the model learns. \`\`\`python plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='accuracy') plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label = 'val_accuracy') plt.xlabel('Epoch') plt.ylabel('Accuracy') plt.ylim([0, 1]) plt.legend(loc='lower right') plt.show() \`\`\` This code provides a simple CNN model for image classification.

Additionally, consider techniques like data augmentation, dropout, or experimenting with different optimizers and learning rates for improved performance."},{"instruction":"Why use channel size of 32,64,64,64? And all are 2^n ?","output":"The use of channel sizes such as 32, 64, 64, and similarly using powers of 2 for defining the dimensions in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is a common practice in deep learning for several reasons rooted in both computational efficiency and historical conventions: 1. **Computational Efficiency**: Most modern hardware, including CPUs and GPUs, is optimized to handle data in chunks that are powers of 2. This is because computer memory and computation are inherently binary. Operations involving powers of 2 allow these devices to efficiently utilize their memory architecture, leading to possibly faster mathematical operations, better memory alignment, and overall more efficient utilization of the underlying hardware. 2. **Memory Allocation**: When allocating memory, systems can do so more efficiently if the block sizes are powers of 2. This can lead to less wasted space (internal fragmentation) and make it easier for the system to manage memory. 3. **Model Capacity and Complexity**: Doubling the number of filters in deeper layers is a heuristic that balances the trade-off between the computational complexity of the model and its capacity. As you go deeper into the network, the spatial dimensions of the feature maps typically decrease (due to operations like max pooling), but we increase the depth—the number of feature maps—to allow the network to learn more complex features. Starting with smaller numbers of filters and increasing them (often doubling) as the network goes deeper helps in building this complexity gradually, without a sudden spike in computational requirements. 4. **Historical and Empirical Justification**: Many seminal works and successful applications of CNNs have employed layers with sizes that are powers of 2. These architectures have been empirically validated across a myriad of tasks and datasets, proving their effectiveness in practice. As a result, this approach has become a sort of convention or starting point when designing new networks, with the understanding that it often leads to models that perform well. 5. **Parameter Growth and Overfitting**: Doubling the number of channels as the spatial dimensions are reduced helps maintain a balance between the parameter growth and model's capacity to learn hierarchies of features without drastically increasing the risk of overfitting. By carefully increasing the complexity of the model (in a controlled manner, like using powers of 2), it's easier to design networks that generalize well. While using powers of 2 for channel sizes is common and often effective, it is not a strict rule. The architecture of a CNN (including the choice of channel size) ultimately depends on the specific task, the complexity of the data, computational resources available, and empirical performance. Experimenting with different configurations is a crucial part of the model development process in machine learning and deep learning."},{"instruction":"Can I use 64,32,16","output":"Yes, you can use channel sizes of 64, 32, and 16 in your convolutional neural network (CNN) layers. The choice of number and size of filters (or channels) in each convolutional layer is part of the model design and is highly dependent on the specific task, the complexity of the dataset, and the computational resources at hand. There's a high degree of flexibility in how you design your network architecture. Choosing a descending pattern of channels (e.g., 64, 32, 16) as you mentioned, can have different implications compared to the more commonly seen ascending pattern (e.g., 32, 64, 128). Here are a few considerations: # Reduce Overfitting A model with fewer parameters is less likely to overfit to the training data. By reducing the channel size as you go deeper into the network, you're effectively decreasing the number of learnable parameters. This could be beneficial in scenarios where you have limited data or are concerned about the model's generalization ability. # Computational Efficiency Fewer channels in deeper layers mean fewer computations, leading to faster training and inference times. This could be an advantage in resource-constrained environments or applications where response time is critical. # Information Bottleneck One potential downside is the risk of creating an information bottleneck. As you reduce the number of channels, the capacity of layers to represent complex features might diminish, which could potentially limit model performance, especially if there's a significant amount of complex information to learn from the input data. # Experimentation is Key The effectiveness of any architecture pattern, whether it's ascending, descending, or constant channel sizes, can vary significantly across different tasks and datasets. It often requires empirical experimentation to find the best model configuration for your specific use case. It might be useful to start with a known architecture that performs well on similar tasks or datasets and then iteratively adjust the architecture while monitoring the performance on a validation set. Trying out different configurations like the proposed 64, 32, and 16 channel sizes could reveal interesting insights about your specific problem and how different model capacities affect learning. In summary, while using 64, 32, and 16 channels in descending order is less conventional, it's a perfectly valid approach to experiment with and could have specific benefits depending on your application."},{"instruction":"show the code of add 3x (conv layer, downsampling)","output":"Certainly! Below is a simple example of how to add three sets of a convolutional layer followed by a downsampling layer (MaxPooling in this case) to a Keras model. This pattern is a common way to design Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for tasks like image classification. In this example, we use TensorFlow's Keras API to build the model. Each convolutional layer will be followed by a max pooling layer to reduce the spatial size of the representation, which helps reduce the amount of computation and parameters in the network, potentially alleviating overfitting. Please ensure you have TensorFlow installed in your environment (\`pip install tensorflow\`). \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.keras import layers, models # Define the input shape (e.g., for CIFAR-10) input_shape = (32, 32, 3) # Change this as per your dataset model = models.Sequential() # First convolutional block model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', input_shape=input_shape)) model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))) # Second convolutional block model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')) model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))) # Third convolutional block model.add(layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')) model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))) # Add final layers for classification model.add(layers.Flatten()) model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')) model.add(layers.Dense(10)) # Assuming 10 classes for the output layer model.summary() \`\`\` Explanation: - **Conv2D**: Adds a convolutional layer. The first parameter (e.g., 64, 32, 16) specifies the number of filters. \`(3, 3)\` specifies the size of each filter. \`activation='relu'\` specifies the Rectified Linear Unit activation function, and \`padding='same'\` means the output will have the same spatial dimensions as the input by adding padding as necessary. - **MaxPooling2D**: Adds a pooling layer that reduces the spatial dimensions (height, width) of the input volume. \`(2, 2)\` specifies the size of the pooling window. - **Flatten**: Flattens the input. Does not affect the batch size. - **Dense**: Adds densely connected (fully connected) layers. The first one has 64 units and uses ReLU activation. The final Dense layer should have as many units as there are classes; in this hypothetical case, 10 classes are assumed. This example forms a simple CNN architecture, which you might need to adjust depending on your specific task, such as changing the input shape, the number of output classes, or the depth and width of the network."},{"instruction":"show the code of a 20 layers cnn.","output":"Designing a 20-layer CNN from scratch using Keras is quite straightforward, but it's crucial to consider how deep you make your network and the size of your data. Very deep networks might suffer from vanishing or exploding gradients, making them hard to train without careful architecture considerations like normalization layers and skip connections, as seen in ResNet architectures. For illustrative purposes, I'll show a simple example of creating a 20-layer CNN using Keras. This network won't include advanced techniques such as residual blocks, which are generally recommended for very deep networks. However, I’ll include some batch normalization layers which can help in training deeper networks by normalizing the activations. For a complex deep network to be effective, especially one with 20 layers, more sophisticated designs like ResNet, DenseNet, or others are advisable. The example below is primarily educational, to demonstrate how one might sequentially add layers in Keras. \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow.keras import layers, models model = models.Sequential() # Input layer model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same', input_shape=(32, 32, 3))) # Adding convolutional layers with some pattern, e.g., doubling the number of filters every few layers filters = 32 for _ in range(6): model.add(layers.Conv2D(filters, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')) model.add(layers.BatchNormalization()) # Adding BatchNormalization to help with training model.add(layers.Conv2D(filters, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')) model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2))) filters *= 2 # Increasing filters # Reducing filters towards the end, example pattern for _ in range(2): filters //= 4 model.add(layers.Conv2D(filters, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same')) model.add(layers.BatchNormalization()) # Flatten before passing to the Dense layers model.add(layers.Flatten()) # Fully connected layers model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')) model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')) # Example for a 10-class classification model.summary() \`\`\` In this example: - The network starts with a convolutional layer with 32 filters of size (3x3). - It sequentially adds convolutional layers, doubling the number of filters every few layers to increase the network's capacity. - Adding Batch Normalization layers after activation functions to stabilize learning by normalizing the input layer by adjusting and scaling the activations. - Uses MaxPooling to reduce dimensions periodically. - Towards the end, it reduces the number of filters again (this is more for illustration; typically, you might continue increasing or keep it constant depending on the problem). - Finally, it flattens the output and adds a couple of fully connected layers for classification. This is just a simple demonstration of constructing a deep CNN with Keras. For serious applications, especially with such depth, you would likely adopt or adapt an existing architecture optimized for such depths, like ResNet, which introduces skip connections to help with the training of very deep networks."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

I'll try to provide a helpful answer by interpreting your question in a context that makes sense. The terms \\"Charlie up down EC functions\\" don't directly correspond to well-known concepts or terminologies in physics or chemistry as of my last update. However, it sounds like you might be referring to some of the fundamental aspects of atomic structure and behavior, particularly electron configuration (which could be what \\"EC\\" stands for) and possibly something related to spin states (\\"up down\\"). Let's clarify these concepts: # Electron Configuration (EC) - **Electron Configuration** is a description of the distribution of an atom's electrons in its atomic orbitals. It is typically represented by notations that indicate the energy levels, subshells, and the number of electrons in those subshells. For example, the electron configuration of oxygen is 1s² 2s² 2p⁴, which means it has two electrons in its 1s subshell, two in the 2s subshell, and four in the 2p subshell. # Spin States (\\"Up Down\\") - **Spin** is a fundamental property of particles such as electrons. Each electron has a quantum mechanical property called spin, which can have one of two possible orientations: spin-up or spin-down. This concept is crucial in quantum mechanics and in explaining the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which states that no two electrons in an atom can have the same set of quantum numbers. Therefore, in an orbital where two electrons are present, one must be spin-up and the other spin-down. # Atomic Structure and Quantum Mechanics - Atoms consist of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons in various orbitals. The Quantum Mechanical Model of the atom, which includes the work of scientists such as Schrödinger and Heisenberg, provides a probabilistic interpretation of the electron's position around the nucleus. - **Quantum Numbers** describe properties of atomic orbitals and the electrons in those orbitals. These include: - Principal quantum number (n): Indicates the energy level. - Angular momentum quantum number (l): Indicates the shape of the orbital. - Magnetic quantum number (ml): Indicates the orientation of the orbital. - Spin quantum number (ms): Indicates the spin orientation (up or down). If you were asking about something more specific or had a different concept in mind related to the unclear terms \\"Charlie up down,\\" please provide additional context or details. Physics and chemistry are vast fields, and precise terminology can help in delivering the most accurate and helpful explanations."},{"instruction":"write a song about it make it scientific and not romantic,","output":"(Verse 1) In the heart of an atom, where the nucleus lies, Protons and neutrons, under quantum skies.

This involves working with deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and sometimes newer architectures like transformers adapted for vision tasks. 2. **Data Preparation and Augmentation**: A significant part of my work includes collecting, annotating, and preprocessing data to train and test the models. Data augmentation techniques are employed to increase the diversity of the training set by altering the images in ways that preserve their labels but provide different perspectives to the learning algorithm. 3. **Performance Evaluation**: I also engage in evaluating the performance of computer vision models. This involves not just accuracy but also how the model performs in terms of speed, efficiency, and under different environmental conditions. Metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used for this purpose. 4. **Integration and Deployment**: After developing and refining models, I work on integrating these models into larger systems or applications. This includes optimizing the models for different platforms (e.g., mobile, IoT devices, cloud services) and ensuring that they run efficiently in production environments. 5. **Research and Innovation**: Keeping up with the latest in computer vision research and technology is crucial. I often read research papers, attend conferences, and experiment with new techniques, models, and tools that could improve the systems I work on. 6. **Collaboration**: My work frequently involves collaboration with other developers, data scientists, and stakeholders. For example, in a healthcare project, I might work closely with medical professionals to understand their needs and how computer vision can be applied to solve specific challenges in diagnostics or surgery assistance. 7. **Tools and Technologies**: I commonly use programming languages like Python and frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Tools like OpenCV, CUDA for GPU acceleration, and cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure for training models at scale are also part of my toolkit. Given the vast range of applications and rapid advancements in AI and machine learning, my role as a computer vision developer is both challenging and exciting, constantly pushing me to learn and adapt to new technologies and methodologies."},{"instruction":"I am using Maskformer model for instance segmentation task please tell me about its architecture and what hyper parameters I can adjust to improve its perform and also tell me how loss is calculated in it","output":"The MaskFormer model represents a significant shift in how we approach the task of instance segmentation in computer vision. It is a transformer-based model architecture designed to unify and simplify the processing pipeline for segmenting individual objects within an image. Unlike traditional approaches that handle instance segmentation by detecting objects first and then segmenting each detected object, MaskFormer directly predicts a set of binary masks, each associated with a global, per-mask class label. This architecture allows MaskFormer to seamlessly address semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation with a single, coherent model pipeline. # MaskFormer Architecture: 1. **Backbone:** The backbone of MaskFormer is a convolutional network used for initial feature extraction from the input images. This can be any standard CNN architecture like ResNet, or more advanced ones like Swin Transformers that have shown promising results in various computer vision tasks. 2. **Transformer Encoder-Decoder:** On top of the backbone, MaskFormer employs a transformer encoder-decoder structure. The encoder processes the feature maps from the backbone to produce a high-level representation of the input image. The decoder then takes this representation and outputs a set of mask tokens. Each mask token is designed to capture the spatial information for a particular segment in the image. 3. **Pixel Decoder:** In addition to the transformer architecture, a pixel decoder takes the high-level features from the transformer and potentially the backbone and refines them to produce per-pixel predictions. This helps in refining the mask boundaries and improving the segmentation quality. 4. **Classification Head:** For each mask token, there is an associated classification head that predicts the class label for the mask. This allows the model to not only segment the image into different parts but also understand what each part represents. 5. **Bipartite Matching and Loss Calculation:** Training involves a bipartite matching step where each predicted mask is matched with a ground truth mask to calculate the loss. The loss function is a combination of a mask loss (such as dice loss or focal loss) and a classification loss (such as cross-entropy), alongside any additional regularization terms. This ensures that the model learns to accurately segment the image while correctly classifying each segment. # Hyperparameters and Performance Improvement: To improve the performance of a MaskFormer model for instance segmentation, you can adjust several hyperparameters: 1. **Learning Rate and Scheduler:** The learning rate and its schedule are critical for training stability and performance. Consider using learning rate warm-up and step decay, or more advanced schedulers like cosine annealing. 2. **Number of Transformer Layers:** Adjusting the depth of both the encoder and decoder can impact the model's ability to learn complex patterns. 3. **Transformer Attention Heads and Dimensions:** The number of attention heads and the dimensionality of the transformer layers can be tuned for a balance between model capacity and computational efficiency. 4. **Backbone Architecture:** Switching between different backbone architectures can significantly affect performance. More advanced or deeper backbones might capture richer features, beneficial for complex segmentation tasks. 5. **Data Augmentation:** Advanced data augmentation techniques can improve model robustness and generalization. 6. **Regularization:** Techniques like weight decay, dropout in the transformer, and other forms of regularization can help prevent overfitting. 7. **Batch Size:** Larger batch sizes can provide more stable gradient estimates, but watch out for the trade-off with learning rate and regularization. 8. **Loss Function Weights:** Tuning the balance between the mask loss and the classification loss can help if the model is struggling more with one task compared to the other. By carefully adjusting these hyperparameters and continuously evaluating the model's performance on a validation set, you can iteratively improve your MaskFormer model's instance segmentation capabilities. Remember to track experiments meticulously to understand the impact of each change and use a systematic approach like grid search or Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning."},{"instruction":"can you give code for hyper parameters fine tuning and how can i use hyper parameter search API of hugging to find there optimal value for all hyper parameters","output":"Fine-tuning hyperparameters efficiently is a critical process in developing machine learning models, including complex architectures like MaskFormer for instance segmentation tasks.

This is crucial for Hugging Face's \`Trainer\` to re-initialize the model with different hyperparameters during the search. - **\`hp_space\`:** A function that defines the hyperparameter search space. The example above uses \`suggest_*\` methods to define ranges for different hyperparameters. - **\`backend=\\"optuna\\"\`:** Specifies Optuna as the backend for hyperparameter optimization (HPO). You can also use \`\\"ray\\"\` if you're using Ray Tune. # Note - Replace \`\\"your_dataset\\"\` with your actual dataset and adjust the model type and configuration as per your needs. - You might need to implement a \`compute_metrics\` function based on the metrics relevant to your task for evaluation. - Ensure you have the necessary computational resources, as HPO can be resource-intensive. By adjusting this setup to your specific use case, you can efficiently find optimal hyperparameters for your MaskFormer instance segmentation tasks or any other models you're working with."},{"instruction":"can you give hyper parameter code for Maskformer model","output":"As of my last update, direct code examples specific to hyperparameter tuning for a MaskFormer model using a specific library like Hugging Face or Detectron2 were not readily available in popular documentation. MaskFormer, being a cutting-edge approach for segmentation tasks, involves complex architectures and training procedures, particularly because it merges transformers with segmentation tasks which are traditionally handled by CNN-based architectures. However, I will guide you through a general approach to setting up hyperparameter tuning for a segmentation task, akin to what you'd do for a model like MaskFormer. For the sake of this example, let's assume we are working with a PyTorch implementation of MaskFormer or a similar model for which you have training code available. We'll use \`ray[tune]\` for hyperparameter optimization, a powerful yet intuitive tool: # Step 1: Define Your Training Function First, wrap your training procedure in a function that accepts hyperparameters as arguments. This function should handle the training and validation of your model and report the performance back to Ray Tune. \`\`\`python import torch from ray import tune from detectron2.config import get_cfg from detectron2.engine import DefaultTrainer def train_maskformer(config): # Assuming you have a configuration function to set the defaults cfg = get_cfg() cfg.merge_from_file(\\"path/to/maskformer/config.yaml\\") # Example hyperparameters you might want to tune cfg.SOLVER.BASE_LR = config[\\"lr\\"] cfg.SOLVER.MAX_ITER = config[\\"max_iter\\"] cfg.MODEL.ROI_HEADS.BATCH_SIZE_PER_IMAGE = config[\\"roi_batch_size\\"] # Assuming we use Detectron2's DefaultTrainer, adapt if you have a custom trainer trainer = DefaultTrainer(cfg) trainer.resume_or_load(resume=False) trainer.train() # Here you should implement evaluation and report the metrics to Ray Tune # For simplicity, let's assume a metric \\"val_loss\\" is returned by your eval function val_loss = eval_model(cfg) tune.report(loss=val_loss) \`\`\` # Step 2: Configure Ray Tune and Start the Experiment \`\`\`python from ray.tune.schedulers import ASHAScheduler # Define the search space for your hyperparameters search_space = { \\"lr\\": tune.loguniform(1e-6, 1e-3), \\"max_iter\\": tune.choice([10000, 20000, 30000]), \\"roi_batch_size\\": tune.choice([32, 64, 128]) } # Define a scheduler and how many samples to run scheduler = ASHAScheduler(metric=\\"loss\\", mode=\\"min\\") num_samples = 10 # Start the hyperparameter search analysis = tune.run( train_maskformer, config=search_space, num_samples=num_samples, scheduler=scheduler, resources_per_trial={\\"cpu\\": 4, \\"gpu\\": 1} # Adjust based on your hardware ) # Fetch the best hyperparameters best_config = analysis.get_best_config(metric=\\"loss\\", mode=\\"min\\") print(\\"Best config: \\", best_config) \`\`\` # Notes: - Replace \`\\"path/to/maskformer/config.yaml\\"\` with the path to your configuration file matching the architecture and dataset specifics for the MaskFormer setup. - This example assumes a certain level of familiarity with Detectron2's \`DefaultTrainer\`. Adjustments would be necessary if you're using a different training loop/setup or different hyperparameters to tune. This is particularly because MaskFormer might have additional or different sets of hyperparameters to consider, based on the architecture used (e.g., transformer encoder-decoder specifics, backbone choice, etc.). - \`eval_model()\` is a placeholder for your model evaluation function, which you need to implement according to how your validation data and metrics are set up. Remember, the effectiveness of hyperparameter tuning will largely depend on properly defining the search space, the computational resources available, and the meaningfulness of the metrics used for evaluation. While this example might not hit every detail of configuring and tuning a complex model like MaskFormer, it provides a foundational framework that you can expand upon."},{"instruction":"what is swin model","output":"The Swin Transformer, introduced in a paper by Ze Liu et al. in 2021 titled \\"Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows,\\" represents a significant advancement in the field of computer vision, particularly in how transformers are applied to vision tasks. The model is designed to serve as a versatile backbone for a variety of vision applications, including but not limited to image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. The innovation of the Swin Transformer lies in its ability to efficiently scale to process high-resolution images, making it highly effective and competitive with state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) while maintaining the advantages of the transformer architecture. # Key Features of Swin Transformer: 1. **Shifted Window Approach:** Swin Transformer introduces a novel mechanism that partitions images into non-overlapping windows and then applies self-attention within each window. To facilitate cross-window connection and mitigate the limitation of window-based self-attention (which doesn't allow for interaction across window borders), it shifts the window partition between consecutive self-attention layers. This shift enables cross-window connectivity and allows for a hierarchical representation that resembles CNNs, ensuring efficient information flow across the entire image. 2. **Hierarchical Representation:** The model generates hierarchical feature maps by progressively merging neighboring windows, reducing the resolution while increasing the feature dimension. This structure is beneficial for various vision tasks that require understanding at multiple scales, akin to CNNs that employ pooling layers or strided convolutions. 3. **Computational Efficiency:** By limiting self-attention computation to within small windows and using the shifted window approach, Swin Transformers significantly reduce the computational complexity of processing high-resolution images. Unlike global self-attention mechanisms, whose computational costs grow quadratically with the increase in image size, the localized window-based approach makes it feasible to handle larger images. 4. **Versatility:** Swin Transformer is designed to be a general-purpose backbone for computer vision, proving effective across a range of tasks including but not limited to image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Its design allows it to be easily plugged into existing frameworks that were initially developed for CNNs. # Swin Transformer vs. Traditional Transformers in Vision: Traditional vision transformers, like the original Vision Transformer (ViT) model, apply self-attention globally across image patches, making them computationally expensive for large images and less efficient at capturing local spatial hierarchies. Swin Transformer addresses these issues by employing localized, window-based self-attention and introducing a hierarchical structure, making it more suitable and efficient for a broader range of image resolutions and vision tasks. The Swin Transformer’s introduction of a hierarchical, efficient, and flexible architecture has sparked considerable interest and further research into transformer models for computer vision, leading to its adoption in various cutting-edge applications and serving as a foundation for subsequent innovations in the field."},{"instruction":"what is the base architecture of YoloV8 model","output":"As of my last knowledge update in early 2023, YOLOv8 has not been officially announced or described in academic literature or major repositories. The YOLO (You Only Look Once) series of models, developed for object detection tasks, has seen several iterations, with YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 being among the most popular and widely used in the community. # YOLO Series Overview The YOLO models are known for their fast detection speeds and relatively high accuracy, making them suitable for real-time applications. They treat object detection as a single regression problem, directly predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities in a single forward pass through the network, which differs from other approaches that might use separate stages for these tasks. 1. **YOLOv4**, introduced by Alexey Bochkovskiy, focused on improving both the speed and accuracy of detection through various architectural and methodological improvements, including the use of CSPDarknet53 as a backbone, spatial pyramid pooling, and path aggregation. 2. **YOLOv5**, developed by Ultralytics, continued to refine the YOLO approach, though it sparked some controversy over version numbering and official releases. YOLOv5 features several architectural improvements, including the use of PyTorch for implementation, model scalability (YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, YOLOv5x), and enhancements in training methodology, efficiency, and speed. # Theoretical Base Architecture of a Hypothetical YOLOv8 While YOLOv8 has not been described as of my last update, we can speculate on potential improvements and features that such a future iteration might include based on the evolution of the YOLO series and trends in deep learning: 1. **Advanced Backbone Architectures**: Incorporation of newer, more efficient architectures such as Transformers (e.g., Swin Transformer) or next-generation CNNs designed for higher accuracy and speed with lower computational requirements. 2. **Enhanced Data Augmentation and Training Strategies**: Utilization of state-of-the-art data augmentation techniques and more refined training procedures to improve model generalization and robustness across varied datasets and conditions. 3. **AutoML and Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**: Leveraging AutoML and NAS to optimize network architecture, hyperparameters, and possibly the training pipeline itself for better performance and efficiency. 4. **Attention Mechanisms**: Integrating sophisticated attention mechanisms to improve the model's focus on relevant features within the image, enhancing detection accuracy, especially for small or occluded objects. 5. **Multi-Scale Features and Fusion**: Further improvements in handling multi-scale features more effectively, potentially through more advanced feature pyramid networks (FPNs) or novel fusion techniques that enhance the model's ability to detect objects of various sizes. 6. **Efficiency Improvements**: Focus on model efficiency, aiming at smaller model sizes, faster inference times, and reduced power consumption to facilitate deployment on edge devices and mobile platforms. 7. **Cross-Task Abilities**: Expansion of capabilities to not just object detection but also instance segmentation, pose estimation, or tracking, making the model more versatile for different vision tasks. It’s essential to stay updated with the official repositories, preprint servers like arXiv, or conferences to get the latest information on developments like YOLOv8.

Vous devez vous assurer que ces composants sont importés avant de pouvoir les utiliser. **Correction:** Assurez-vous d'importer \`TodoItem\` et \`Titre\` en haut de votre script \`App.vue\` comme ceci : \`\`\`js import TodoItem from './components/TodoItem.vue' import Titre from './components/Titre.vue' \`\`\` Remarque : Ajustez les chemins en fonction de l'endroit où vous avez stocké ces fichiers. # Problème 2: Plusieurs Balises \`<template>\` dans un Seul Fichier .vue Vous avez inclus plusieurs balises \`<template>\` dans le même fichier de composant Vue. Un fichier \`.vue\` devrait contenir une seule balise \`<template>\` qui englobe tout le HTML du composant. Si vous avez plusieurs fichiers de composants (ce qui est recommandé pour une structure propre), chaque composant devrait être dans son propre fichier \`.vue\` avec sa propre balise \`<template>\`. **Correction:** Assurez-vous que chaque composant est dans son propre fichier \`.vue\` avec une seule balise \`<template>\` et un script associé. Par exemple, vous devriez avoir un fichier \`Titre.vue\` pour le composant \`titre\` et un fichier \`TodoItem.vue\` pour le composant \`todo-item\`. # Problème 3: Problèmes de Cases (Majuscules/Minuscules) dans les Noms de Composants Vue.js utilise la convention \`kebab-case\` pour les noms de composants dans les templates et \`PascalCase\` pour les déclarations dans le script JS. Si vous ne suivez pas ces conventions, Vue pourrait ne pas être capable de faire correspondre les composants avec leurs tags dans le template. **Correction:** **Dans le template :** \`\`\`html <titre :texte=\\"texte\\"></titre> <todo-item v-for=\\"todo in todos\\" :key=\\"todo.text\\" :ma-tache=\\"todo\\"></todo-item> \`\`\` **Dans le script :** \`\`\`js components: { TodoItem, Titre } \`\`\` Vérifiez les noms de fichiers et les importations pour les cas de divergence. # Problème 4: Placement Incorrect du Code Votre question semble inclure du code \`<template>\` et \`<script>\` dispersé, ce qui suggère une confusion sur la manière de structurer les composants Vue. Chaque fichier de composant (\`*.vue\`) doit avoir une structure claire : une balise \`<template>\` pour le HTML, une balise \`<script>\` pour la logique JavaScript, et éventuellement une balise \`<style>\` pour le CSS. **Correction:** Assurez-vous que chaque composant (p. ex., \`App\`, \`TodoItem\`, \`Titre\`) est correctement organisé dans son propre fichier \`.vue\` avec une claire séparation des concerns. # Résumé Après avoir apporté ces corrections, vérifiez également de ne pas avoir de problèmes dans la console de développement du navigateur, car elle peut vous donner des indices sur d'autres erreurs potentielles.

Since client scripts run on the client side (the user's browser), they can't directly access the server-side \`GlideRecord\` API you used in your server-side script. However, you can use a GlideAjax call to execute server-side code from the client script and return the information you need. Here's a breakdown of how to achieve your goal: 1. **Write a Script Include**: This will contain the server-side logic to check if there are any operational virtual servers based on the IP address provided. It will be callable from your client script using GlideAjax. 2. **Create an OnChange Client Script**: This will trigger whenever the \\"Select Server\\" field value changes. It will use GlideAjax to call the Script Include and process the response to show an alert and clear the value if necessary. # Step 1: Script Include First, create a Script Include that’s accessible by client scripts. **Name**: \`CheckOperationalServers\` **Client Callable**: Checked (True) **Script**: \`\`\`javascript var CheckOperationalServers = Class.create(); CheckOperationalServers.prototype = Object.extendsObject(AbstractAjaxProcessor, { isServerOperational: function() { var ipAddress = this.getParameter('ip_address'); // Get the IP address passed from the client script var relGlide = new GlideRecord('cmdb_rel_ci'); var queryString = \\"type=d93304fb0a0a0b78006081a72ef08444^child.ip_address=\\" + ipAddress; relGlide.addEncodedQuery(queryString); relGlide.query(); while (relGlide.next()) { if (relGlide.parent.operational_status == 1) { return \\"true\\"; // Return \\"true\\" as a string to indicate an operational server exists } } return \\"false\\"; // Return \\"false\\" if no operational servers are found } }); \`\`\` # Step 2: OnChange Client Script Next, create an OnChange client script for the \\"Select Server\\" field. **Name**: Whatever descriptive name you prefer **Table**: The table where your catalog form resides **Field name**: The exact field name of your \\"Select Server\\" field **Type**: OnChange **Script**: \`\`\`javascript function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading) { if (isLoading || newValue == '') { return; } var ga = new GlideAjax('CheckOperationalServers'); ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'isServerOperational'); ga.addParam('ip_address', newValue); // Assuming newValue holds the IP address. Adjust accordingly. ga.getXMLAnswer(function(answer) { if (answer == 'true') { alert('An operational virtual server exists for this IP address. Please select a different server.'); g_form.clearValue('select_server_field_name'); // Replace 'select_server_field_name' with the exact field name } }); } \`\`\` Remember to replace \`'select_server_field_name'\` with the actual field name of the \\"Select Server\\" field and adjust the ‘ip_address’ parameter as needed based on how your catalog item passes the IP address (it might require custom logic based on your catalog item setup). This setup will alert the user if any selected server is operational and clear the selection, providing the intended functionality."},{"instruction":"when a particular server is selected, a script should run to check if any operational virtual servers are tagged to the current physical server being decommisioned. if operational virtual servers are found, a popup message should be displayed to the requester which will contain operational VM servers IP and should clear physical server mandatory variable","output":"To implement the scenario where you want to check for operational virtual servers tagged to the current physical server being decommissioned, and then inform the requester if any are found through a pop-up message displaying their IP addresses, involves a few modifications. The general approach remains similar: utilizing a combination of a **Script Include** for server-side logic and an **OnChange Client Script** for the client-side interface. Here we refine the implementation details, particularly focusing on handling multiple IPs and providing a clear user feedback mechanism. # Step 1: Script Include Modification Enhance the \`Script Include\` to return the IP addresses of operational virtual servers. **Script Include Example:** \`\`\`javascript var CheckOperationalServers = Class.create(); CheckOperationalServers.prototype = Object.extendsObject(AbstractAjaxProcessor, { getOperationalServerIPs: function() { var serverSysId = this.getParameter('server_sys_id'); // Retrieve the server's sys_id var operationalIPs = []; var relGlide = new GlideRecord('cmdb_rel_ci'); relGlide.addQuery('parent', serverSysId); // Assuming parent represents the physical server relGlide.addQuery('child.operational_status', '1'); // Looking for operational VMs relGlide.query(); while (relGlide.next()) { var ip = relGlide.child.ip_address; // Adjust based on your CMDB structure if (ip) operationalIPs.push(ip.toString()); } return operationalIPs.join(','); // Return a comma-separated list of IPs } }); \`\`\` Ensure to adjust field references based on your data model if they differ. # Step 2: OnChange Client Script Adjustment Modify the client script to handle the dynamic feedback based on the Script Include's response. **OnChange Client Script Example:** \`\`\`javascript function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading) { if (isLoading || newValue == '') { return; } var ga = new GlideAjax('CheckOperationalServers'); ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'getOperationalServerIPs'); ga.addParam('server_sys_id', newValue); // Assuming newValue holds the server's sys_id. Adjust if it's different. ga.getXMLAnswer(function(answer) { if (answer) { var message = \\"Decommissioning is blocked due to operational VMs tagged to this server. Please review the following IP(s): \\" + answer; alert(message); g_form.clearValue('your_physical_server_field_name'); // Replace with your field name } }); } \`\`\` Replace \`'your_physical_server_field_name'\` with the actual field name of your \\"Select Server\\" (physical server selection) variable. # Points to Note 1. **Data Model**: The implementation above assumes a particular data model (e.g., relationships in \`cmdb_rel_ci\` and fields like \`operational_status\` and \`ip_address\`). You may need to adjust field names based on your configuration. 2. **Performance Considerations**: Depending on the size of your CMDB and the number of relationships, querying large datasets might impact performance. Consider optimizing your queries or including safeguards to maintain system responsiveness. 3. **Security**: Always review and test any script for potential security implications, especially when exposing information like IP addresses. This approach should meet your requirements by alerting the user about operational VMs tied to a selected physical server, including showing the relevant IP addresses and enforcing data cleanliness by clearing the selection if the condition is met."},{"instruction":"现在有一个场景描述如下，app上有一个推荐feed，feed中包含许多播放器卡片，滑动到某个卡片就会自动播放。现在存在一个问题描述如下：当我们滑动到某一个卡片的时候，我们可能进入如下操作；1.点击进入横屏播放 2.点击进入详情页播放 3.点击进入相关推荐feed进行播放，现在每个操作发生后都会新创建一个播放器卡片来播放，但是数据是一样的。现在我们希望设计一个共享的context保证用户在进入不同的场景消费之后回到最初的推荐feed状态和数据都能够保持一致，例如用户进入横屏之后，在横屏卡片上登陆或者打开音频播放，我们希望回到feed也能保持这个状态，例如我们进入详情页支付成功后触发数据刷新，我们希望回到feed也是支付成功后的新数据，该如何设计这个共享context，保证其优雅性和扩展性，使用kotlin写一个比较详细的demo","output":"为了设计一个既优雅又具有扩展性的共享\`Context\`来解决你描述的场景问题，我们可以采用观察者模式与单例模式的结合实践。在此基础上，利用Kotlin的高级特性，比如对象声明（Object Declaration）、密封类（Sealed Class）以及扩展函数（Extension Functions），可以为这个共享\`Context\`提供一个灵活而强大的实现。 在你所描述的应用场景中，\`FeedPlayerContext\`（我们将这个共享\`Context\`命名为\`FeedPlayerContext\`）中不仅需要管理播放器的状态（如播放、暂停、播放进度等），还需要负责数据的同步更新，如在不同场景下订阅的数据变化。 以下是一个简化的实现方案： # 1. 定义播放器状态和事件 考虑到播放器可能有多种状态和事件（如播放、暂停、加载新内容等），我们可以使用一个密封类来对这些可能的状态和事件进行建模。 \`\`\`kotlin sealed class PlayerEvent { object Play : PlayerEvent() object Pause : PlayerEvent() data class LoadContent(val contentId: String) : PlayerEvent() data class UpdateProgress(val progress: Int) : PlayerEvent() // 根据需求添加其他事件 } \`\`\` # 2. 定义共享Context 该\`Context\`负责管理播放状态和数据，以及播放相关事件的订阅与通知。 \`\`\`kotlin object FeedPlayerContext { private val observers = mutableListOf<(PlayerEvent) -> Unit>() private var currentPlayerEvent: PlayerEvent? = null fun subscribe(observer: (PlayerEvent) -> Unit) { observers.add(observer) currentPlayerEvent?.let { observer(it) } // 向新订阅者发送当前状态 } fun unsubscribe(observer: (PlayerEvent) -> Unit) { observers.remove(observer) } fun notifyPlayerEvent(event: PlayerEvent) { currentPlayerEvent = event observers.forEach { it(event) } } } \`\`\` # 3. 使用共享Context 现在，无论用户进入哪一个场景（横屏播放、详情页播放、相关推荐feed播放），都可以通过\`FeedPlayerContext\`来管理和通知播放器的状态。 \`\`\`kotlin // 假设有一个横屏播放的函数 fun enterFullScreen() { // 其他逻辑... // 通知播放器状态改变 FeedPlayerContext.notifyPlayerEvent(PlayerEvent.Play) } // 在初始化或适当的地方订阅播放器事件 FeedPlayerContext.subscribe { event -> when (event) { is PlayerEvent.Play -> println(\\"播放器播放\\") is PlayerEvent.Pause -> println(\\"播放器暂停\\") is PlayerEvent.LoadContent -> println(\\"加载内容 ID: {event.contentId}\\") is PlayerEvent.UpdateProgress -> println(\\"更新进度至 {event.progress}%\\") // 处理其他事件 } } // 不要忘记在不再需要接收事件的地方取消订阅 FeedPlayerContext.unsubscribe(/* 传入之前订阅时的 lambda 引用 */) \`\`\` # 4. 关于扩展性和优雅性 - **扩展性**：该设计方案利用了密封类和观察者模式，使得新增或修改播放器事件变得相对简单。你只需要在\`PlayerEvent\`密封类中添加或修改相应的事件即可，而使用\`FeedPlayerContext\`的地方无需做出任何修改。 - **优雅性**：通过单例模式（Kotlin的\`object\`声明）实现的\`FeedPlayerContext\`，不需要手工管理其生命周期或担心多实例问题，同时，Kotlin语法的简洁性使得代码易于理解和维护。 这个解决方案不仅适用于你描述的视频播放场景，也可以适用于其他需要在多个组件间共享状态和事件的场景。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Le travail comme moyen de pouvoir et de domination : Michel Foucault explore cette fonction du travail en soulignant que le travail peut être un outil de contrôle et de domination sociale.

What frame should I take for the mission?","output":"Choosing the right Warframe for a mobile defense mission against Corpus enemies in the level 35-40 range involves considering a few key factors: crowd control, area defense, and survivability. Here are several Warframes that excel in these areas, making them excellent choices for the task: 1. **Frost**: Frost is a classic choice for any defense or mobile defense mission. His Snow Globe ability provides excellent protection for the defense target, absorbing incoming damage and slowing enemies that enter it. It's particularly effective against projectile-based attacks, which are common among the Corpus. 2. **Limbo**: Limbo's ability to manipulate the Rift Plane makes him uniquely suited for mobile defense missions. By casting Cataclysm around the defense terminal and then using Stasis, Limbo can freeze all enemies that enter the Rift, effectively neutralizing threats while keeping the terminal safe. However, be mindful of your teammates, as Limbo's abilities can sometimes interfere with their gameplay if not coordinated properly. 3. **Mesa**: Mesa's Peacemaker ability allows her to lock down and quickly eliminate enemies from a distance, making her a great choice for protecting the objective. Her Shatter Shield also provides a significant damage reduction against ranged attacks, adding to her survivability. 4. **Gara**: Gara can create a durable barrier around the objective using her Mass Vitrify ability, which turns incoming enemies into glass and makes them vulnerable to additional damage. She also has good damage potential and survivability thanks to her Splinter Storm. 5. **Volt**: Volt's Electric Shield can provide both defensive and offensive benefits, stopping incoming fire while enhancing the damage of outgoing shots that pass through the shield. This can be particularly effective in a mobile defense mission where positioning and area denial play crucial roles. 6. **Nova**: With her Molecular Prime ability, Nova can slow down approaching enemies significantly, making them easier to manage and increasing the damage they take. This ability is also excellent for crowd control, as enemies that die while under its effect will explode and damage nearby foes. Each of these Warframes can bring tremendous value to a Corpus mobile defense mission, though your choice may also depend on your personal playstyle, the composition of your squad (if you're playing in co-op), and whether you've modified any Warframe with Forma to enhance its abilities further. Remember, communication and coordination with your team can dramatically affect the outcome of the mission, regardless of which Warframe you choose."},{"instruction":"Alright, I'll take frost prime. What primary weapon should I bring?","output":"Taking Frost Prime to a Corpus Mobile Defense mission is a solid choice given his ability to protect objectives with his Snow Globe. When it comes to choosing a primary weapon to complement Frost Prime for a level 35-40 Corpus mission, consider weapons that are effective against Corpus shields and provide either crowd control or high single-target damage. Here are some options you might find suitable, keeping in mind the effectiveness against shields and the crowd control potential: 1. **Ignis Wraith**: This flamethrower offers a high rate of fire and the ability to hit multiple targets simultaneously, making it excellent for crowd control. It deals Heat damage, which can be effective against Corpus flesh once their shields are down. Modding it with Magnetic damage (Electricity + Cold) can also make it more effective at quickly taking down shields. 2. **Arca Plasmor**: A Corpus shotgun with innate Radiation damage, the Arca Plasmor fires blasts of plasma energy that can hit multiple enemies in a wide arc. It's particularly effective against Corpus due to its innate damage type being strong against both shields and robotics, which are prevalent in Corpus units. 3. **Amprex**: The Amprex is an electricity-based beam weapon that chains between multiple targets, making it superb for crowd control. Modding it for Magnetic damage can make it highly effective against Corpus shields, while its innate chaining ability ensures it can handle groups of enemies efficiently. 4. **Hema**: If you're looking for something unconventional, the Hema is a burst-fire Infested rifle that heals you for a percentage of the damage dealt. While its base damage is Viral, which isn't particularly effective against shields, it can be modded for Magnetic damage to better counter Corpus defenses. Its self-healing ability can enhance your sustainability on the field. 5. **Rubico Prime**: For those who prefer precision shooting, Rubico Prime is a powerful sniper rifle capable of dealing massive critical damage. While traditionally seen as more of a boss or heavy unit killer, its high damage output means it can quickly eliminate priority targets, like Corpus Techs or Bursas, that might threaten the defense objective. When choosing your primary weapon for this mission, consider the mods at your disposal, as modding correctly can significantly alter a weapon's effectiveness against certain enemies. For dealing with Corpus, modding for Magnetic damage (combining Electricity and Cold mods) is often recommended to strip shields more efficiently. Additionally, consider any utility or crowd control mods you have that can complement your weapon's base capabilities. Remember, the right choice also depends on your playstyle, the specific challenges of the mission, and what you find fun to play with. Warframe is about experimentation and finding what works best for you in various situations."},{"instruction":"I'll take amprex, I'll mod it for magnetic and heat damage. I'll add base damage and multi shot mods, critical chance and critical damage, beam length and punch thru, and and fire rate.","output":"Modding your Amprex for Magnetic and Heat damage, along with focusing on base damage, multi-shot, critical chance, critical damage, beam length, punch-through, and fire rate is an excellent strategy for optimizing its effectiveness in a level 35-40 Corpus mobile defense mission with Frost Prime. Here’s a breakdown of how this mod setup could look, assuming you have access to typical mods and are working towards an optimized build: 1. **Serration** - Increases base damage, essential for any primary weapon build. 2. **Split Chamber** - Adds a chance for multi-shot, effectively doubling your damage output when it triggers. 3. **Point Strike** - Significantly increases critical chance, essential given the Amprex's high critical potential. 4. **Vital Sense** - Increases critical damage, synergizing well with the Amprex's ability to land frequent critical hits. 5. **Heavy Caliber** (optional for increased damage, with some loss of accuracy) or a Riven mod tailored to your playstyle can also be considered here if you're willing to trade off precision for raw power. 6. **Stormbringer** and **Cryo Rounds** for combining into Magnetic damage, targeting the Corpus’ shield weaknesses effectively. 7. **Hellfire** or **Thermite Rounds** (if you want to add status chance as well) for Heat damage, which is good against flesh and can cause the Panic status effect on enemies. 8. **Sinister Reach** to increase the beam length, allowing you to engage enemies from a safer distance and making it easier to sweep rooms. 9. **Shred** or **Primed Shred** (if you have access to it) - This adds punch-through and increases fire rate, letting your beams pass through multiple enemies and eliminating them more quickly. This setup focuses on turning the Amprex into a room-clearing powerhouse, capable of quickly mowing down groups of Corpus enemies while effectively managing shields and health pools through Magnetic and Heat damage. The Amprex’s inherent chain lightning effect will ensure that the crowd control and damage spread effectively among tightly packed enemy groups. Remember, modding in Warframe is highly personal and can be tweaked based on your mission, play style, and the specific enemies you're facing. Feel free to adjust this setup as you see fit, especially when considering elements like Forma and mod capacity to achieve the optimal build for your needs."},{"instruction":"Next, let's move on to secondaries I should bring for this mission.","output":"For a level 35-40 Corpus mobile defense mission, your secondary weapon choice can serve as either a complement to your primary weapon or as a tool for specific situations that your primary might not be well-suited for. Given the Amprex's strength in area control and dealing with groups, you might want a secondary that either excels in quickly dispatching high-priority targets (like Corpus Nullifiers, Bursas, etc.) or provides utility that your primary does not. Here are some strong choices: 1. **Kuva Nukor**: This beam weapon is excellent for crowd control due to its unique chaining mechanic, which can arc to multiple targets, and has an incredibly high critical multiplier. Although your primary already handles crowd control, Kuva Nukor’s ability to apply multiple status effects quickly makes it an excellent choice for stacking status effects like Magnetic and Heat, which you're focusing on with your Amprex. This can be particularly useful against tougher Corpus units by stripping their shields and applying Heat's damage-over-time effect. 2. **Pyrana Prime**: This shotgun pistol can output a significant amount of damage in a short time, especially against single targets. It's powerful at close range and can quickly dispose of high-priority targets. Its unique passive, which temporarily gives you a second ghostly Pyrana Prime when achieving rapid kills, increases its damage output dramatically. 3. **Mara Detron**: A shotgun pistol that can be modded for devastating Magnetic damage, making it perfect for swiftly eliminating Corpus shields. Its status chance is also quite high, allowing it to apply various status effects with each shot. Modding it for additional Radiation damage can also make it highly effective against robotic enemies common in Corpus ranks. 4. **Kitgun** with a **Catchmoon** chamber: If you've ventured into Fortuna and built your own Kitgun, a Catchmoon chamber with the right components can serve as a powerful secondary, akin to a handheld Arca Plasmor. When modded for range, damage, and Magnetic, it becomes extremely effective at clearing both shields and groups of enemies. 5. **Staticor**: This charge-and-release type weapon fires blasts capable of dealing Magnetic damage innately, making it a handy tool for quickly stripping away Corpus shields. Additionally, its charged shots have a significant AoE effect, providing some utility in crowd control as well. For any of these secondary weapons, modding similarly to how you set up your Amprex can be effective: - **Hornet Strike** for base damage. - **Barrel Diffusion** and **Lethal Torrent** for multishot and fire rate. - **Pistol Gambit** and **Target Cracker** (or their Primed variants) for crit-based weapons like the Kuva Nukor or Pyrana Prime. - **Elements** for Magnetic and/or Heat depending on the weapon and base damage type. Consider also adding Radiation damage for increased effectiveness against Corpus robotics for some weapons. - **Utility mods** (such as reload speed or ammo mutation) based on personal preference or weapon needs. Remember, utility can also play a significant role in your secondary choice, especially if you find yourself frequently needing a quick way to dispatch enemies that have made it too close for comfort or if your primary is temporarily unavailable due to reloading or ammo scarcity."},{"instruction":"Melee time","output":"For a level 35-40 Corpus mobile defense mission, especially when using Frost Prime and an Amprex focused on dealing with groups of enemies, you'll want a melee weapon that can either quickly eliminate high-priority targets, offer crowd control capabilities, or complement your existing setup with utility or survivability enhancements. Here are several types of melee weapons and specific examples that could work well: # 1. **Condition Overload Builds** These builds excel in dealing with enemies by scaling damage based on the number of different status effects inflicted upon the target. Given your setup's focus on applying statuses with the Amprex, these weapons can capitalize on that synergy. - **Lesion**: Automatically buffs itself upon inflicting a status effect, making it even more lethal. With innate Toxin damage, it can easily be modded for additional statuses like Magnetic or Heat when paired with the right mods. - **Silva & Aegis Prime**: Offers high status chance and exceptional damage reduction when blocking. Mod it for status and it becomes both a formidable weapon and a great defensive tool. # 2. **Critical Hit Builds** If you're looking for straight damage and quick kills on tougher individual targets, weapons with high critical chance and damage can be extremely effective. - **Nikana Prime** or **Dragon Nikana**: These offer a balance of speed, damage, and critical chance. Excellent for quick, high-damage slashes that can be further enhanced with the right stance and mods. - **Gram Prime**: A heavy blade with massive critical and status potential. Its wide swings can clear out groups of enemies while dealing immense damage to any heavy units. # 3. **Crowd Control and Area Denial** In some scenarios, you might want a melee weapon that helps manage large groups of enemies or provides additional control over the battlefield. - **Orthos Prime**: With its long reach and quick attack speed, it's excellent for hitting multiple enemies. Modding for range and status can make it a crowd control powerhouse. - **Atterax**: A whip with great range and the potential for high damage through slide attacks. When built with a focus on critical chance and damage (especially with a slide-crit build), it can mow down groups of enemies efficiently. # Mod Suggestions - **Condition Overload** (for status-focused weapons): Increases melee damage based on the number of different status effects on the target. - **Blood Rush**: Increases critical chance based on combo multiplier, excellent for weapons with solid base critical chance. - **Berserker** or **Berserker Fury**: Boosts attack speed following critical hits, which can greatly increase your damage output. - **Reach** or **Primed Reach**: Increases your melee range, allowing you to hit more enemies with each swing. - **Organ Shatter**: Increases critical damage, essential for crit-focused weapons. - **Elemental Mods** (e.g., **Volcanic Edge**, **Vicious Frost**): Mod for Magnetic/Heat to continue the theme of dealing with Corpus effectively. Choosing the right melee weapon and mod setup depends on your playstyle, the specific mission requirements, and how it synergizes with your Warframe and other weapon choices. Experimentation is key, as is modding to exploit specific enemy weaknesses."},{"instruction":"What helminth ability should I put on my frost prime for this mission?","output":"Choosing a Helminth ability for Frost Prime, especially for a Corpus mobile defense mission, involves looking for synergies or addressing any potential weaknesses in Frost's kit. Frost Prime excels in defense and crowd control, but depending on your playstyle or the specific mission needs, you might want something that enhances his offensive capabilities, provides utility, or further bolsters his defensive strengths. Here are a few suggestions across different categories that could complement Frost Prime well in this scenario: # Offensive Abilities 1. **Eclipse (Mirage)**: When modded for ability strength, Eclipse can significantly boost Frost's damage output in light, making him much more lethal with his weapons. This ability dynamically adjusts based on lighting conditions, but with careful positioning, you can maximize its damage bonus for the mission's duration. 2. **Roar (Rhino)**: A straightforward damage buff for you and nearby allies, increasing all damage dealt. This can be quite beneficial in higher-level content where boosting your Amprex or other weapon's damage can make missions more manageable. # Utility Abilities 3. **Dispensary (Protea)**: Provides a consistent source of energy, health, and ammo pickups. Given Frost's reliance on abilities for defense and control, having a reliable way to replenish energy without relying solely on pickups or squad energy restores can drastically increase your mission sustainability and effectiveness. 4. **Pillage (Hildryn)**: Strips shields and armor from enemies while bolstering Frost's own shields, adding a layer of survivability and crowd control. This can be particularly useful against groups of Corpus enemies by rendering their shields ineffective. # Defensive Abilities 5. **Defy (Wukong)**: Grants Frost a brief period of increased damage resistance followed by a retaliation attack that also boosts his armor based on the damage received during the ability's active phase. This can further enhance Frost's durability, especially when holding down a mobile defense point against heavy enemy fire. 6. **Gloom (Sevagoth)**: Slows enemies within a large radius and siphons health from them based on damage dealt, providing crowd control and healing. Gloom can complement Frost's Snow Globe by slowing enemies that enter the globe's range, making them easier to manage. # Crowd Control 7. **Ensnare (Khora)**: Quickly immobilizes a target enemy and spreads to others nearby, pulling them together and making them easy targets for your weapons or abilities, potentially increasing the efficiency of clearing groups of enemies within or outside of Snow Globe. When selecting a Helminth ability to infuse onto Frost Prime, consider what aspect of your gameplay you would like to enhance or what potential gaps you might need to fill in your mission strategy. Each option presents a unique benefit that can be tailored to different playstyles and mission needs. Don't forget to adjust your build to take full advantage of the chosen ability, factoring in ability strength, range, duration, or efficiency as needed."},{"instruction":"What's the health calculation for figuring out the total health of one on Frost's globes?","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, the health of Frost's Snow Globe ability in Warframe is determined by a combination of base health and added health that scales with armor and ability strength. The calculation for the total health of Frost's Snow Globe upon casting includes both the ability's base health and additional health gained from Frost's armor multiplied by ability strength modifiers. Here's how it breaks down: # Base Calculation for Snow Globe's Health: 1. **Base Health**: Snow Globe starts with a base health that is fixed. This is 5,000 at max ability level. 2. **Armor Scaling**: The amount of additional health provided by Frost's armor, which also benefits from ability strength mods. # The Formula: Snow Globe's Total Health = Base Health + (Base Health * (Armor * (1 + Armor Mods)) * (1 + Ability Strength Mods)) Or more simplified: [ Total Health = Base Health times (1 + (Armor times (1 + Armor Mods) / 300) times (1 + Ability Strength Mods)) ] - **Base Health** is 5,000 at Snow Globe's maximum level before mods. - **Armor** refers to Frost's current armor value, which can be increased with mods like Steel Fiber. - **Armor Mods** is the total percentage increase to Frost's armor from mods. - **Ability Strength Mods** is the total percentage increase to ability strength from mods. # An Example Calculation: Assuming you have a Frost with: - 300 base armor, - +110% armor from using a Steel Fiber mod (+100%) and Armored Agility mod (+10%), - And +30% Ability Strength from using a mod like Intensify. The calculation would be: [ Total Health = 5,000 times (1 + (300 times (1 + 1.1) / 300) times (1 + 0.3)) ] [ Total Health = 5,000 times (1 + 2.1 times 1.3) ] [ Total Health = 5,000 times 3.73 ] [ Total Health = 18,650 ] This example shows Frost's Snow Globe having a total health of 18,650 after considering both the additional health provided by his scaled armor and the benefit of ability strength mods. Keep in mind this calculation can vary based on your Frost's build, the specific mods you have equipped, and any temporary boosts your Warframe may receive during gameplay. It's also important to note that Snow Globe's health can stack by casting it multiple times within its duration, and the globe absorbs all incoming damage as additional health for a few seconds after being cast, further increasing its durability."},{"instruction":"I'm using a ranked 30 frost prime. With no armor mods and 139% power strength. What would be the health of my globe?","output":"To calculate the health of Frost Prime's Snow Globe with a Power Strength of 139% and no additional armor mods, first, we need to understand the base values and formula involved. As of the last update, Frost Prime has a base armor value of 300. The formula for Snow Globe's total health, considering both the base health, the effect of Frost's armor, and any modifications from Ability Strength mods, is as follows: [ text{Total Health} = text{Base Health} times left(1 + left(frac{text{Armor} times (1 + text{Armor Mods})}{300}right) times (1 + text{Ability Strength Mods})right) ] Given that: - Base Health of Snow Globe at max ability level = 5,000 - Frost Prime’s base armor = 300 (since no armor mods are applied, we don't modify this value) - Armor Mods = 0% (since no armor mods are being used) - Ability Strength Mods = 39% (as the base is 100%, and you've increased this by 39% to reach your 139% total power strength) Placing these values into our formula: [ text{Total Health} = 5,000 times left(1 + left(frac{300}{300}right) times (1 + 0.39)right) ] Simplifying this: [ text{Total Health} = 5,000 times left(1 + 1 times 1.39right) ] [ text{Total Health} = 5,000 times 2.39 ] [ text{Total Health} = 11,950 ] Therefore, with a Power Strength of 139% and no additional armor mods on a rank 30 Frost Prime, the total health of your Snow Globe would be 11,950."},{"instruction":"Ok, I have defy on my frost prime, it adds 750 armor at max.

Warframe does not explicitly expose enemy damage values in a way that makes straightforward DPS calculations against a player character easy or accurate outside of controlled environments. However, I can provide a general understanding of what impacts DPS and how you can mitigate incoming damage, especially when facing Corpus at level 35-40: 1. **Enemy Types**: Corpus units primarily deal Shield and Impact damage, with some units like Techs and Fusion MOAs capable of dealing significant amounts of damage with their respective weapons. Special units like Nullifiers can dispel your abilities, indirectly causing you to take more damage if you rely on them for defense. 2. **Shield Damage**: Most Corpus weapons are designed to strip away shields effectively. Since Frost Prime has a decent shield capacity, expect initial hits to quickly deplete your shields. 3. **Armor and Health**: Once your shields are down, Corpus Impact damage is less effective against armor. However, Corpus Techs, Oxium Ospreys, and certain other units can deal considerable health damage if not managed quickly. 4. **Damage Mitigation**: Frost Prime's Snow Globe can absorb and nullify incoming damage from outside the globe, providing a significant defensive measure. Abilities like Defy further enhance your damage mitigation by adding a large amount of armor, reducing the percentage of health damage taken after shields are depleted. Given these factors, if you were to stand still for 2 seconds straight within the line of fire of multiple Corpus enemies at level 35-40 without any defensive measures, you could potentially see your shields stripped away almost instantaneously and start to lose health, especially if targeted by multiple or higher-damage units. However, the exact DPS would be difficult to quantify without specific details on enemy composition and their chosen targets. **General Tips to Mitigate Damage:** - **Stay Mobile**: Movement makes you harder to hit and is key to survival in Warframe. - **Use Snow Globe**: It's your main defensive tool as Frost Prime, offering excellent protection against incoming fire. - **Manage Abilities Smartly**: Abilities like Defy can significantly increase your resilience when your shields are down. - **Prioritize Threats**: Take down high-damage or special units quickly, such as Corpus Techs or Nullifiers. Remember, Warframe's dynamic combat encourages movement and using abilities over standing still, and effective use of Frost Prime's toolkit can greatly reduce the damage you receive."},{"instruction":"What is 0.16% × 250","output":"To calculate 0.16% of 250, you can use the following calculation: [ 0.16% times 250 = frac{0.16}{100} times 250 = 0.0016 times 250 = 0.4 ] Therefore, 0.16% of 250 is 0.4."},{"instruction":"What is .16×250","output":"[ 0.16 times 250 = 40 ] So, 0.16 multiplied by 250 equals 40."},{"instruction":"A=.16 B=6.

It's always a good idea to refer to the latest game updates or community guides for the most current insights into mod performance and synergies."},{"instruction":"What are the ways to increase combustion beam's explosion damage and radius?","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, **Combustion Beam** is a mod in Warframe that causes enemies killed by beam weapons to explode, dealing additional damage within a 5-meter radius. The core aspects of **Combustion Beam**, like its explosion damage and radius, are fixed based on the mod's specifications and cannot be directly increased through modding. The explosion damage is set and does not scale with the weapon's damage or any other mods. However, there are general strategies and weapon characteristics that can indirectly enhance the overall effectiveness of Combustion Beam's explosion effect, even if they don't directly increase the damage or radius: # 1. **Increase Weapon Damage:** Increasing the overall damage of the beam weapon ensures that you kill enemies more swiftly, activating Combustion Beam's explosion effect more frequently. This can be achieved through: - **Damage Mods:** Mod your weapon with basic damage increase mods (e.g., Serration), elemental damage mods that the target is weak against, and critical chance/damage mods if the weapon has a decent critical chance. - **Elemental Combos:** Use elemental damage types that are particularly effective against the factions you're fighting. For example, modding for Magnetic damage (Electricity + Cold) can be effective against the Corpus as it is specifically potent against their shields. # 2. **Choose Weapons with High Status Chance:** While this doesn't directly increase Combustion Beam's radius or damage, weapons that can apply status effects efficiently can control groups of enemies more effectively, allowing for strategic placement of combustion explosions. # 3. Syndicate Weapons or Weapon Augments: Some weapons or weapon augments provide AoE (Area of Effect) effects upon reaching a certain threshold of affinity gain. While not directly increasing Combustion Beam's effectiveness, they complement its area damage effect, leading to more efficient clearance of groups of enemies. # 4. **Amprex and Beam Weapons with Chain Abilities:** Weapons like the Amprex, which can chain damage between multiple enemies, ensure that the effect of Combustion Beam is triggered more consistently across groups, not just isolated targets. While this doesn't increase the mod's explosion radius or damage per se, it does maximize the potential for AoE damage by ensuring more frequent activations spread among enemy groups. # General Playstyle Adjustments: Positioning and targeting tactics that prioritize groups of enemies can enhance the utility of Combustion Beam by taking advantage of its fixed explosion radius to affect as many enemies as possible. While these methods don't directly increase the explosion radius or damage of the Combustion Beam mod, they guide how to maximize its effectiveness in combat scenarios.

To maximize the efficiency of the **Verglas** on your Dethcube Prime, consider modding strategies that enhance its strengths: # 1. **Status Chance:** Since the **Verglas** can benefit from applying status effects with its cold damage, mods that increase status chance are very beneficial. This helps in more consistently applying the cold status effect, which slows enemies. # 2. **Damage:** Mods that increase base damage, such as **Serration** (adjusted for Sentinel weapons), can boost the overall damage output of the **Verglas**. # 3. **Elemental Mods:** Combining Cold damage with other elements to create combinations like **Blast** (Cold + Heat) or **Magnetic** (Cold + Electricity) can tailor the Verglas to be more effective against certain enemy factions. For example, Magnetic is particularly effective against Corpus enemies. # 4. **Multishot:** Mods that add multishot, such as **Barrel Diffusion** (again, adjusted for Sentinel weapons), will increase the number of projectiles fired per shot, effectively increasing damage output and the chance to apply status effects. # 5. **Fire Rate:** Increasing the fire rate with mods can allow the **Verglas** to hit enemies more frequently, aiding in crowd control by applying the slowing effect more often. # 6. **Utility and QoL Mods:** Don't forget about utility mods that can, for instance, increase ammo capacity or improve reload speed, maintaining your weapon's uptime and efficiency in longer missions. Remember to balance your mod selections based on your mission type, the enemies you anticipate facing, and how you've configured your Dethcube Prime's other abilities and mods. The Verglas, with the right setup, can be a powerful tool for controlling the battlefield while dealing significant damage."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Also, how could this keep the story from feeling like propaganda?","output":"The device you're describing, where a protagonist directs undue anger towards a clearly allied character, can be a potent narrative tool, but it needs to be handled with care to avoid derailing the story or alienating the audience. This dynamic can: 1. **Deepen Character Complexity**: It makes the protagonist more three-dimensional by exposing their flaws, vulnerabilities, or perhaps unhealed traumas. This can create a more relatable and human character but requires careful characterization to ensure the protagonist remains sympathetic. 2. **Fuel Character Development**: Such conflicts can prompt significant growth in both characters. The protagonist's journey might involve learning humility, empathy, or the value of trust and camaraderie. Conversely, the ally might grow more resilient, assertive, or forgiving. 3. **Highlight Themes**: This tension can be used to explore themes like forgiveness, the destructive nature of unchecked anger, the power of empathy, and the necessity of communication in relationships. To ensure the story doesn’t feel like propaganda or a heavy-handed moral lesson, consider these strategies: **1. Balance and Nuance**: Show the protagonist's perspective comprehensively, including their internal conflicts and motivations. However, also depict the ally's side and the consequences of the protagonist's actions, ensuring the narrative doesn't unjustly favor one character over another. **2. Consequences and Accountability**: Ensure the protagonist faces realistic repercussions for their actions, and that these actions are not simply brushed aside or quickly forgiven without genuine remorse and effort to make amends. This prevents the message from feeling preachy or oversimplified. **3. Gray Morality and Complexity**: Avoid depicting issues in black-and-white terms. Instead, embrace the complexity of human emotions and relationships. Recognize that both characters might have valid points and flaws, which can help prevent the story from seeming one-sided. **4. Relatable Motivations**: Ensure the protagonist’s anger is rooted in understandable or relatable motivations, even if misguided. This helps the audience empathize with the protagonist instead of viewing them as purely antagonistic or unreasonable. **5. Gradual Resolution**: Rather than quick fixes, let the characters gradually work through their issues. Show them engaging in meaningful dialogue, reflecting on their actions, and genuinely striving to understand each other. This process can mirror real-life conflicts and resolutions, making the story feel more authentic and less like a vehicle for a particular message. Using conflict to drive character development and thematic exploration is powerful, but the key lies in treating your characters as complex, fallible human beings rather than mere mouthpieces for a point of view. This approach allows for a richer, more engaging story that resonates with the audience on a deeper level."},{"instruction":"maybe it could be over a disagreement or a misunderstanding on the protagonist's part. Also, could the undue anger towards an ally feel sympathetic if the protagonist is shown being kind and self aware, and heroic in a lot of other times?","output":"Certainly, a disagreement or misunderstanding can be a very relatable and effective catalyst for the undue anger directed from the protagonist towards an ally. These scenarios can add depth and realism to the characters and their relationships by highlighting their imperfections and the complexities of human interactions. In terms of making the protagonist's undue anger feel sympathetic despite the negative outburst towards an ally, there are several narrative strategies you can employ: # Demonstrate Complexity and Relatability 1. **Backstory and Stressors**: Provide context for the protagonist's anger by showing the stress, pressures, or past traumas they are dealing with. This doesn’t excuse their behavior but helps the audience understand it. 2. **Internal Conflict**: Portray the protagonist as internally conflicted about their outburst. Showing regret, self-awareness, or attempts to rationalize their anger makes them more relatable and sympathetic. # Balance in Characterization 1. **Show Positive Traits**: Ensure the protagonist is depicted as capable of kindness, empathy, and heroism at other times. This contrast in their behavior underscores that the outburst is not their defining characteristic, but a moment of weakness. 2. **Realistic Reactions**: The ally’s response should also be nuanced. They might be hurt or confused but can also show understanding or concern for the underlying reasons behind the protagonist's anger. This can help prevent the scenario from seeming overly dramatic or contrived. # Narrative Integration 1. **Plot and Theme Integration**: Use the conflict to explore and advance themes relevant to the story, such as the importance of communication, the dangers of jumping to conclusions, or the power of forgiveness and reconciliation. 2. **Consequences and Growth**: Make sure there are tangible consequences to the protagonist’s actions, and use these consequences as a catalyst for personal growth. An arc where the protagonist works to earn forgiveness and rebuild trust can be compelling and rewarding. # Empathy Through Relatability Creating a protagonist who is deeply human—capable of both great kindness and regrettable mistakes—can make their moment of improper anger towards an ally not just sympathetic but profoundly relatable. Audience empathy is often strongest in the presence of nuanced characters who reflect the real complexities of human emotion and morality. By maintaining a careful balance in how the character's actions are portrayed and ensuring there's meaningful development arising from the conflict, you can avoid alienating your audience. Instead, you provide them with a richer, more engaging narrative experience that encourages reflection on the nature of conflict, understanding, and forgiveness in human relationships."},{"instruction":"could a good way to show the protagonist isn't toxic, be them actually letting the person they are angry at explain themselves?","output":"Yes, allowing the protagonist to let the person they are angry at explain themselves is an excellent way to demonstrate that the protagonist is not inherently toxic. This approach can serve several important functions in the narrative: 1. **Facilitates Communication**: It underscores the importance of communication and listening in resolving conflicts. By showing the protagonist open to hearing the other side, you highlight their willingness to understand and empathize, which is antithetical to toxic behavior. 2. **Shows Maturity and Growth**: It can be a moment of significant character development. Acknowledging anger and then consciously deciding to listen and engage constructively shows maturity and a capacity for growth, distancing the protagonist from toxicity. 3. **Humanizes Both Characters**: This interaction can deepen the audience's understanding of both characters. The protagonist's willingness to listen humanizes them and fosters empathy, while the ally's explanation can provide insights into their motivations, further adding layers to their character. 4. **Reduces Misunderstandings**: It's a narrative device that can be used to reduce or resolve misunderstandings, highlighting how assumptions and quick judgments can lead to conflict. This can reinforce the theme that patience and open-mindedness are virtues. 5. **Promotes Empathy**: It encourages the audience to empathize with both characters. Seeing a protagonist actively trying to understand rather than react impulsively can remind the audience of the value of empathy and patience in their own lives. 6. **Strengthens Relationships**: It can strengthen the relationship between the characters involved, showing that their bond can withstand disagreements and anger. This resilience can endear both the protagonist and the ally to the audience further. Incorporating a scene or moments where the protagonist shows this level of consideration and openness not only helps in steering clear of painting them as toxic but also enriches the narrative by promoting themes of communication, understanding, and personal growth. It's a powerful way to show that conflicts, even those involving anger and frustration, can lead to positive outcomes when handled with care and empathy."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This trend has been further reinforced by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (United Nations General Assembly, 2015) that considers inclusive education a global goal to achieve human rights principles. Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Special Needs affirms not only the right to education but also a \\"comprehensive education system at all levels\\" by the end of 2015, which has been ratified by most countries around the world. Inclusive education is defined as \\"the ability of the educational system to provide the necessary academic and behavioral support to all students, regardless of disability or difference (i.e. gender, race, location or language), to participate and succeed in scholastic academic, Social, methodological and extracurricular activities alongside their peers \\" (Parnell,2017,p.3). Inclusion exceed geographical change in the classroom andincludes a distinct mindset that focuses on the abilities and needs of all students in the classroom (UNESCO, 1994). Inclusion has benefits that include both regular students and with special needs students . It was found that students with special needswho receive inclusive education have obtained better educational and social outcomes (Rujis & Peetsma, 2009). For regular students, there have been improvements in social skills and tolerance towards their special needs peers (Kalambouka, Farrell, Dyson,& Kaplan, 2007). This is confirmed by recent literature reviews that indicate the effectiveness of inclusion in the social and academic outcomes of all students, not just students with special needs (Black-Hawkins, 2010; Hehir et al. 2017; Rose, Gravel & Gordon, 2014).The past three decades have witnessed an important educational reforms in relation to students with special needs. These students were previously taught in separate schools, but large numbers of students with special needs are now taught regularly in public education schools. The composition of the general education school classes in a certain countries of the world, like Canada and the United States of America, has changed dramatically. 96% of regular school teachers in the United States of America indicated that there are one student with special needs in the class (Rock, Gregg, Ellis, & Gable, 2008 ). This is similar to Australia, where two-thirds of all students with special needs receive education in general education schools (Forlin, Chambers, Loreman, Deppeler, & Sharma, 2013). However, the proportion of students with special needs who are educated in general schools in developing countries is relatively lower than that in advanced countries. Successful inclusion requires a learning environment that includes a diverse group of individuals and key elements. These elements includes school reform, changing attitudes, cooperation, teaching strategies and enhanced classrooms (Swart & Pettipher, 2011). Individuals who play a vital role in the effective implementation of inclusive education include parents, teachers, school administrators, specialists in various fields and support teams. The results of the studies confirm the view that among all these individuals, teachers are key to successful inclusion and that inclusive education can only be successful if teachers are part of the team that leads this process (Malone et al., 2001). Therefore, teacher participation is an essential and integral component of an effective implementation of inclusive education (Haskell, 2000; Forlin, Cedillo, Romero-Contreras et al., 2010; Donald et al., 2010).Educational literature indicates that teachers are facing increasing stress to meet the unique needs of learners in inclusive classes (Berry, 2010).This requires them to hone their knowledge and skills, develop new knowledge and skills to fulfill their roles as open minded teachers in order to accommodate the curricula, corporate with other partners like special education teachers ((Swart& Pettipher,2005). Thus, in order to enable inclusive education, teachers need to adapt to their changing roles. This requires a great sense of self-efficacy (Savolainen, Engelbrecht, Nel & Malinen, 2012). Self-efficacy of teachers is one of the factors that has received a great attention among researchers (Al-Qumeiz,2019; Savolainen, et al., 2012; Meijer & Foster, 1988; Soodak & Podell, 1993). Several studies have indicated that self-efficacy is an indicator of a willingness to teach in inclusive classes (Forlin et al. 2010; Malinen, Savolainen, & Xu, 2012; Savolainen et al. 2012). Research shows that teachers with higher levels of self-efficacy have more positive attitudes toward inclusion (Malinen, et al.,2012), are less likely to refer a disadvantaged student to special education services (Soodak & Podell, 1993), and more willing to provide Special assistance to students with lower achievement levels (Ross, 1992). Self-efficacy influences teaching behaviors and the use of creative teaching in the classroom (Holzberger, Philipp, & Kunter, 2013; Schiefele & Schaffner, 2015; Zee & Koomen, 2016). Educating students with special needs in the inclusive classes impose teachers in front of educational challenges (Jennett, Harris, & Mesibov, 2003; Scheuermann, Webber, Boutot, & Goodwin, 2003). The main disabilities associated with students with special needs affect the increased exposure of teachers to stress and burnout, which are factors associated with the attrition of teachers' energies (Billingsley, Carlson, & Klein, 2004; Boyer & Gillespie, 2000). Teachers with high self-efficacy have low stress, they continue to teach longer, and are more motivated than teachers with low self-efficacy (Schwarzer & Hallum, 2008; Ware & Kitsantas, 2007). Therefore, the self-efficacyof teachers is a protective factor for psychological burnout common in the teaching profession. Researchers emphasized that it is necessary to pay attention to the sources of self-efficacy in order to explore how individuals build the beliefs of their own efficacy (Lent, Lopez, & Bieschke, 1991) . Because teachers ’self-efficacy in the inclusive classes is associated with many positive outcomes within the class, the researchers have tended to explore the sources of teachers’ self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is based on four sources: performance achievements, alternative or indirect experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states (Bandura, 1997). Performance achievements are defined as feeling satisfied with successful teaching experiences in the past. Verbal persuasion refers to self-efficacy judgments based on verbal stimulation of others such as colleagues, supervisors, managers, students, and parents. Emotional states represent control of the level of activation (i.e. fatigue, stress, anxiety, tension and mood), which in turn can directly affect the provisions related to teaching ability (Fernandez-Rio et al., 2016). Uncovering the sources of self-efficacy for teachers in the inclusion classes provides an important basis for obtaining important insightson how to enhance self-efficacy during teacher training (Gaskill & Woolfolk-Hoy, 2002; Lebone, 2004; Henson, 2002). Understanding the potential sources of teacher self-efficacy in the inclusive classes helps to identify factors that should be targeted in professional development activities for teachers (Morris, Usher, & Chen, 2017).Tschannen-Moran and Woolfolk-Hoy (2007) notes that teacher self-efficacy is context specific. It is important to test the theoretical assumptions underlying self-efficacy in avariety of cultural contexts. The cultural context is one of the most important contexts that may lead to the variation of teachers ’self-efficacy. Many literature emphasizes the need for multicultural studies of self-efficacy, which often depend on culture and historical background (Klassen & Chiu, 2010; Klassen, 2004b; Markus & Kitayama, 1991).It is possible that the sources of self-efficacy of inclusive practices will depend on cultural background. 2- Problem Statement Research over the past three decades on implementing inclusive education indicates that the success or failure of inclusion depends on many factors such as state policies, the availability of resources, the leadership of the principal, employees cooperation, and the characteristics of teachers such as the acquisition of knowledge, skills, , attitudes toward inclusion and self-efficacy (Kuyini, Desaib & Sharma, 2018; Loreman, Sharma & Forlin 2013; Leyser, Zeiger & Romi, 2011; Kuyini & Desai, 2008; Friend & Bursuck, 2009). The self-efficacyof teachers in the inclusive classes is one of the most important factors that may lead to the success or failure of the inclusion. It is associated with many variables such as attitude towards inclusion, copying strategies and motivation (Savolainen et al. 2012; Klassen et al. 2011). It affects teachers making essential adjustments in the classroom, such as adjusting curriculum content or instruction (De Boer, Pijl, & Minnaert 2011; Wilson et al. 2016).Bandura (1997) notes that teachers build their beliefs about self-efficacy by processing information from four sources: performance achievements, alternative or indirect experiences, verbal persuasion, and emotional states. Research recently tended to reveal the sources of this self-efficacy , Which may contribute to enhancing the self-efficacy of in-service teachers and identifying factors that should be targeted in professional development programs and activities. Many literature emphasizes the need to conduct multicultural studies of self-efficacy. These international comparisons are useful because it provides insight into the factors that constitute self-efficacy beliefs in different cultural contexts. Besides that, there are not enough empirical results so far to demonstrate whether countries with a long history of implementing inclusion in general education schools differ from the countries in which inclusion has begun to be implemented. Comparing the self-efficacy of teaching practices in inclusive classes and their potential sources between Saudi Arabia and Egypt may benefit in providing new insights into the factors that constitute this efficacy. The results of comparative studies may have implications for how to prepare and support pre-service and in-service teachers to implement inclusion in general education schools (Sharma, Aiello, Pace, Round & Subban, 2018). The current research problem arises in the following questions: 1.Are there statistically significant differences between mean scores of self-efficacy for Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers? 2.What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers in inclusive schools? 3.What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional state in predicting the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers in inclusive schools? 3- Methodology Participants Participants in the study are in-service teachers working in elementary schools in Saudi Arabia and Egypt in inclusive schools for students with special needs and regular. They were chosen intentionally. The Saudi sample were (250) male and female teachers representing (8) schools in Arar city, affiliated to the Education Department in the Northern Borders Region, north of Saudi Arabia.The study instruments were distributed among them, during the month of April 2019, (96) were retrieved , so, the retention rate was 38.4%.The Egyptian sample were (200) male and female teachers representing (6) schools in Beba, affiliated to the Beba Educational Administration in Beni Suef Governorate, south of Egypt. The study instruments were distributed among them, during the march of 2019, (88) were retrieved , so, the retention rate was 44%. Instruments - Teacher self-efficacy scale: This scale was developed by Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk -Hoy (2001) with the goal of determining the strength and nature of teachers' self-efficacy beliefs. It consists of three dimensions including instructional strategies, student engagement, and classroom management. The researcher used the abbreviated form (12 items). The items were distributed among the three dimensions shown as follows: instructional strategies (5, 9, 10, 12), student engagement (2,3, 4, 11), and classroom management (1, 6, 7, 8). For each item asked teachers to assess their ability to influence the outcome (\\"How much can you do?\\") in a 9-point Likert scale from 1 to 9: Nothing (1-2), very little (3-4), Some infulence (5-6), quite abit (7-8), a great deal (9). Consequently, the maximum score for the scale was 108, and the lowest score, 12. The scale author used factor analysis to test the validity of the construction by 225 in-service and 111 pre-service teachers . Factor analysis showed three factors, which accounted for 65% and 61% of the variance respectively . The factor analysis of the current study showed three factors that accounted for 78% of the variance. The reliability of instructional strategies, student engagement, and classroom management dimensions were 0.93, 0.94, and 0.95, respectively. The general reliability of scale was 0.96. - The sources of self-efficacy scale: The SSE scale was prepared by Hoi, Zhou,Teo & Nie (2017). The scale consists of 26 items divided into four dimensions, including performance achievements (1-6), alternative experiences (7-12), verbal persuasion (13-20), and emotional states (21-26). The responses are according to a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from Strongly Disagree(1 ) to Strongly Agree (7 ). The scale authors used factor analysis to investigate the validity of the construction. Factor analysis showed four factors, which accounted for 71% of the variance. The authors of the scale used also confirmatory factor analysis. The results indicated that the scale had acceptable indicators (χ2 (293) = 636.40, SRMR = .057, RMSEA = .069 (.061, .076], TLI = .90, CFI = .91). Confirmatory factor analysis was used in the current study to test the indictors of the SSE scale. The results showed acceptable indicators (χ2 / df = 133.154; GFI: .900; CFI:.911; RMSEA: .058; SRMR: .051). The authors of the scale indicated that the alpha coefficient of the four dimensions of the scale; performance achievements, alternativeexperiences, verbal persuasion, emotional states were 0.89, 0.86, 0.90, and 0.87. The general reliability of scale was 0.81. Regarding the current study , the researcher used the Alpha-Cronbach coefficient. The results showed a significant values for the four dimensions: performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion, emotional states as following; 0.93, 0.93, 0.93, and 0.9. Procedures After obtaining official approvals from the Deanship of Scientific Research at the University of Northern Borders, the researcher distributed the study measures to the research sample in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. After two months, the researcher analyzed the data using SPSS (Ver.23). Data analysis The collected data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 23 software. The researcher used independent-samples t-test to answer the first question of the study. The researcher used stepwise multiple regression analysis to answer the second and third question for the study.Results and discussion Regarding the first question “Are there statistically significant difference between mean scores of self-efficacy between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers? independent –samples t-test was used to analyze the data.Results indicated that there were a significant differences in all dimensions of self-efficacy and overall self-efficacy in favor to Egyptian teachers. Regarding the second question “ What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers in inclusive schools? Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data. The model was able to predict (53%) of self-efficacy.. By the stepwise method, four predictors were included in the model; performance achievements , alternative experiences , verbal persuasion, and emotional states . one of these; performance achievements successfullypredicted self-efficacy among Saudi teachers . Regarding the third question “ What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers in inclusive schools? Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data.. The model was able to predict (13%) of self-efficacy. By the tepwise method, four predictors were included in the model; performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion, and emotional states. One of these; performance achievements successfully predicted self-efficacy among Egyptian teachers. . The results of the research indicated in its answer to the first question that there were statistically significant differences between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers in the self-efficacy of inclusive practices and its dimensions; teaching strategies, student engagement and class management in favor to Egyptian teachers, although the general level of self-efficacy in both countries was below average based on the study scale (12-108). This result is consistent with Savolainenet al.(2012), which indicated that there are significant differences in a certain dimensions of the self-efficacy of teachers in inclusive schools between Finland and South Africa, Sharma and Jacobs(2016) that indicated there are significant differencesbetween general education teachers in India and Australia in self-efficacy within the inclusive classes, Sharma, et al.( 2018) which indicated that there are significant differences in self-efficacy in the inclusive practices between teachers in Italy and Australia, and Miesera and Gebhardt(2018) that indicated significant differences in self-efficacy in inclusive practices among teachers in Canada and Germany. The researcher attributes this in light of the associations between self-efficacy and job satisfaction, classroom teaching practices and student learning outcomes (Anderson, et al., 1988). In the context of Egyptian education, competition among students inside schools is very high, and the teaching strategies used by teachers are more efficient and effective. This is due to the fact that the majority of Egyptian teachers work in private teaching after the end of school hours . The way to increase the financial returns from this courses is to improve the teaching process in a desire for students to reach high levels of achievement excellence. This is consistent with Heine and Hamamura (2007) and Kurman (2003) indicated that the self-efficacy of teachers increases in countries where independence is greatly emphasized. Independence means reducing educational supervision, which applies to teachers in the field of private teaching. Besides, the concept of inclusion is a relatively recent concept among Egyptian education schools. Stakeholders for educational policies in Egypt have approved a rewarding financial incentives for teachers in inclusive schools and providing them with a qualified and recent training courses. Besides that, assigning special education teachers as experts and supportive for general education teachers in each educational administration in which the inclusion is applied are provided. These external factors can lead to a shift in the teachers ’locus of control from being external to an internal where teachers believe that the outcomes are more based on aperson’s own behavior than on external sources and circumstances (Rotter, 1966). This is consistent with what Teschanen-Moran and Woolfolk-Hoy (2001) emphasized, the close association between locus of control and self-efficacy. These cultural differences in self-efficacy can be attributed to the self-enhancement needs(SEN). SEN is defined as a motivation to search for activities and social trends leading to maintaining a positive image. The motivation of Egyptian teachers to teach students with special needs in inclusive classes stems from their desire to preserve a positive image compared to the Saudi teachers. The researcher believes that the efforts of in-service teacher training in Egypt in recent years, which focused on developing the skills of teachers in the classroom, with special reference to skills in behavior management in the classroom with various groups of students, have led to an increase in teachers' belief in their ability to performing various teaching tasks with acceptance quality in different teaching situations and thus improving their level of self-efficacy. Therefore, the results seem to indicate that Egyptian teachers now generally have a stronger belief in their ability to manage diverse needs and behaviors in the classroom, design and implement educational activities to assist different learners in learning, and competence in ensuring student participation and motivation towards learning. The results of the research indicated in its answer to the second and third questions Performance. achievements or mastery experiences were the most predictable sources of self-efficacy for teachers in self-efficacy in inclusion practices, whether in Saudi Arabia or Egypt. These results are consistent with what Bandura (1997) indicated that performance achievements are the most powerful source of self-efficacy. It is consistent with (Milner, 2002; Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk-Hoy, 2007; Bruce & Ross, 2008; Usher & Pajares, 2008; Malinen et al., 2012; Yada, et al., 2019; Wilson, Woolfson & Durkin, 2020). These results are inconsistent with Sharma, Shaukat, and Furlonger (2014) that indicated developmental knowledge of legislation and policies, and less concerns about teaching in inclusion classes, were key predictors of improving the teaching efficiency of inclusive practices. it is inconsistent with Emam and Al-Mahdy (2019) which indicated the variation of the self-efficacy of general education teachers in inclusion schools in Oman, with gender differences and the number of years of teaching experience. The researcher attributes the current results in the light of social cognitive theory. SCT indicates that the reciprocal relationship between behavioral and personal factors, where teachers make decisions related to their perceived capabilities based on their previous performance. When teachers look at their past performance, they can determine the extent of their ability to teach in the inclusive classes. When they believe that a certain strategies were successful, they can use this experience to enrich their practice in the coming years. Likewise, through experience, teachers may become confident about their effective working strategies which leading to enhancing the effectiveness of classroom management. Previous experience also helps teachers motivate and engage students, which enhances the effectiveness of student engagement in the classroom. The results of the study indicate that the performance achievements explained 53% of the variance in the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers, while 13% of the variation in the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers. The researcher attributes this to that there may be other sources related to the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers such as mastery of knowledge (Morris et al., 2017), collective efficacy (Goddard & Goddard, 2001), school environment (Wilson, Woolfson & Durkin, 2020), training, and direction towards inclusion. 4- Recommendations According to the results, the researcher presents the following recommendations: First, Given the small sample size , the results cannot be generalized. Therefore this study must be repeated again by a large sample. Second, In light of the lower of the percentage of explained variance by the performance achievements for the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers, future research must address others sources of self-efficacy of teachers in inclusive schools in Egypt. Third, Questionnaire -based studies cannot provide complete answers to explain the difference in cultural differences in self-efficacy among teachers. This is requires in-depth qualitative analysis, therefore future research should rely on a mixed method that combines quantitative and qualitative analysis in order to achieve this goal. Fourth, It is important for researchers in Saudi Arabia and Egypt to conduct comparative studies with samples from different societies. This will help stakeholders to assess the Saudi and Egyptian situation related to teacher efficacy in an international context. This can help in measuring improvements compared to these other societies. 5- Conclusions The results of the current study showed a significant difference of self-efficacy in inclusive schools between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers in favor to Egyptian teachers. Results indicated that only performance achievements or mastery experiences are the successful predictor of self-efficacy among Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers. The results of the study indicate that the performance achievements explained 53% of the variance in the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers, while 13% of the variation in the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers.","output":"It seems like your text contains a long discussion about the importance of inclusive education, the role of teachers in implementing inclusive practices, the factors influencing self-efficacy of teachers in inclusive classrooms, a comparison between Saudi and Egyptian teachers in terms of self-efficacy, and the methodology used in your study.

This trend has been further reinforced by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (United Nations General Assembly, 2015) that considers inclusive education a global goal to achieve human rights principles. Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Special Needs affirms not only the right to education but also a \\"comprehensive education system at all levels\\" by the end of 2015, which has been ratified by most countries around the world. Inclusive education is defined as \\"the ability of the educational system to provide the necessary academic and behavioral support to all students, regardless of disability or difference (i.e. gender, race, location or language), to participate and succeed in scholastic academic, Social, methodological and extracurricular activities alongside their peers \\" (Parnell,2017,p.3). Inclusion exceed geographical change in the classroom andincludes a distinct mindset that focuses on the abilities and needs of all students in the classroom (UNESCO, 1994). Inclusion has benefits that include both regular students and with special needs students . It was found that students with special needswho receive inclusive education have obtained better educational and social outcomes (Rujis & Peetsma, 2009). For regular students, there have been improvements in social skills and tolerance towards their special needs peers (Kalambouka, Farrell, Dyson,& Kaplan, 2007). This is confirmed by recent literature reviews that indicate the effectiveness of inclusion in the social and academic outcomes of all students, not just students with special needs (Black-Hawkins, 2010; Hehir et al. 2017; Rose, Gravel & Gordon, 2014).The past three decades have witnessed an important educational reforms in relation to students with special needs. These students were previously taught in separate schools, but large numbers of students with special needs are now taught regularly in public education schools. The composition of the general education school classes in a certain countries of the world, like Canada and the United States of America, has changed dramatically. 96% of regular school teachers in the United States of America indicated that there are one student with special needs in the class (Rock, Gregg, Ellis, & Gable, 2008 ). This is similar to Australia, where two-thirds of all students with special needs receive education in general education schools (Forlin, Chambers, Loreman, Deppeler, & Sharma, 2013). However, the proportion of students with special needs who are educated in general schools in developing countries is relatively lower than that in advanced countries. Successful inclusion requires a learning environment that includes a diverse group of individuals and key elements. These elements includes school reform, changing attitudes, cooperation, teaching strategies and enhanced classrooms (Swart & Pettipher, 2011). Individuals who play a vital role in the effective implementation of inclusive education include parents, teachers, school administrators, specialists in various fields and support teams. The results of the studies confirm the view that among all these individuals, teachers are key to successful inclusion and that inclusive education can only be successful if teachers are part of the team that leads this process (Malone et al., 2001). Therefore, teacher participation is an essential and integral component of an effective implementation of inclusive education (Haskell, 2000; Forlin, Cedillo, Romero-Contreras et al., 2010; Donald et al., 2010).Educational literature indicates that teachers are facing increasing stress to meet the unique needs of learners in inclusive classes (Berry, 2010).This requires them to hone their knowledge and skills, develop new knowledge and skills to fulfill their roles as open minded teachers in order to accommodate the curricula, corporate with other partners like special education teachers ((Swart& Pettipher,2005). Thus, in order to enable inclusive education, teachers need to adapt to their changing roles. This requires a great sense of self-efficacy (Savolainen, Engelbrecht, Nel & Malinen, 2012). Self-efficacy of teachers is one of the factors that has received a great attention among researchers (Al-Qumeiz,2019; Savolainen, et al., 2012; Meijer & Foster, 1988; Soodak & Podell, 1993). Several studies have indicated that self-efficacy is an indicator of a willingness to teach in inclusive classes (Forlin et al. 2010; Malinen, Savolainen, & Xu, 2012; Savolainen et al. 2012). Research shows that teachers with higher levels of self-efficacy have more positive attitudes toward inclusion (Malinen, et al.,2012), are less likely to refer a disadvantaged student to special education services (Soodak & Podell, 1993), and more willing to provide Special assistance to students with lower achievement levels (Ross, 1992). Self-efficacy influences teaching behaviors and the use of creative teaching in the classroom (Holzberger, Philipp, & Kunter, 2013; Schiefele & Schaffner, 2015; Zee & Koomen, 2016). Educating students with special needs in the inclusive classes impose teachers in front of educational challenges (Jennett, Harris, & Mesibov, 2003; Scheuermann, Webber, Boutot, & Goodwin, 2003). The main disabilities associated with students with special needs affect the increased exposure of teachers to stress and burnout, which are factors associated with the attrition of teachers' energies (Billingsley, Carlson, & Klein, 2004; Boyer & Gillespie, 2000). Teachers with high self-efficacy have low stress, they continue to teach longer, and are more motivated than teachers with low self-efficacy (Schwarzer & Hallum, 2008; Ware & Kitsantas, 2007). Therefore, the self-efficacyof teachers is a protective factor for psychological burnout common in the teaching profession. Researchers emphasized that it is necessary to pay attention to the sources of self-efficacy in order to explore how individuals build the beliefs of their own efficacy (Lent, Lopez, & Bieschke, 1991) . Because teachers ’self-efficacy in the inclusive classes is associated with many positive outcomes within the class, the researchers have tended to explore the sources of teachers’ self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is based on four sources: performance achievements, alternative or indirect experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states (Bandura, 1997). Performance achievements are defined as feeling satisfied with successful teaching experiences in the past. Verbal persuasion refers to self-efficacy judgments based on verbal stimulation of others such as colleagues, supervisors, managers, students, and parents. Emotional states represent control of the level of activation (i.e. fatigue, stress, anxiety, tension and mood), which in turn can directly affect the provisions related to teaching ability (Fernandez-Rio et al., 2016). Uncovering the sources of self-efficacy for teachers in the inclusion classes provides an important basis for obtaining important insightson how to enhance self-efficacy during teacher training (Gaskill & Woolfolk-Hoy, 2002; Lebone, 2004; Henson, 2002). Understanding the potential sources of teacher self-efficacy in the inclusive classes helps to identify factors that should be targeted in professional development activities for teachers (Morris, Usher, & Chen, 2017).Tschannen-Moran and Woolfolk-Hoy (2007) notes that teacher self-efficacy is context specific. It is important to test the theoretical assumptions underlying self-efficacy in avariety of cultural contexts. The cultural context is one of the most important contexts that may lead to the variation of teachers ’self-efficacy. Many literature emphasizes the need for multicultural studies of self-efficacy, which often depend on culture and historical background (Klassen & Chiu, 2010; Klassen, 2004b; Markus & Kitayama, 1991).It is possible that the sources of self-efficacy of inclusive practices will depend on cultural background. 2- Problem Statement Research over the past three decades on implementing inclusive education indicates that the success or failure of inclusion depends on many factors such as state policies, the availability of resources, the leadership of the principal, employees cooperation, and the characteristics of teachers such as the acquisition of knowledge, skills, , attitudes toward inclusion and self-efficacy (Kuyini, Desaib & Sharma, 2018; Loreman, Sharma & Forlin 2013; Leyser, Zeiger & Romi, 2011; Kuyini & Desai, 2008; Friend & Bursuck, 2009). The self-efficacyof teachers in the inclusive classes is one of the most important factors that may lead to the success or failure of the inclusion. It is associated with many variables such as attitude towards inclusion, copying strategies and motivation (Savolainen et al. 2012; Klassen et al. 2011). It affects teachers making essential adjustments in the classroom, such as adjusting curriculum content or instruction (De Boer, Pijl, & Minnaert 2011; Wilson et al. 2016).Bandura (1997) notes that teachers build their beliefs about self-efficacy by processing information from four sources: performance achievements, alternative or indirect experiences, verbal persuasion, and emotional states. Research recently tended to reveal the sources of this self-efficacy , Which may contribute to enhancing the self-efficacy of in-service teachers and identifying factors that should be targeted in professional development programs and activities. Many literature emphasizes the need to conduct multicultural studies of self-efficacy. These international comparisons are useful because it provides insight into the factors that constitute self-efficacy beliefs in different cultural contexts. Besides that, there are not enough empirical results so far to demonstrate whether countries with a long history of implementing inclusion in general education schools differ from the countries in which inclusion has begun to be implemented. Comparing the self-efficacy of teaching practices in inclusive classes and their potential sources between Saudi Arabia and Egypt may benefit in providing new insights into the factors that constitute this efficacy. The results of comparative studies may have implications for how to prepare and support pre-service and in-service teachers to implement inclusion in general education schools (Sharma, Aiello, Pace, Round & Subban, 2018). The current research problem arises in the following questions: 1.Are there statistically significant differences between mean scores of self-efficacy for Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers? 2.What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers in inclusive schools? 3.What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional state in predicting the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers in inclusive schools? 3- Methodology Participants Participants in the study are in-service teachers working in elementary schools in Saudi Arabia and Egypt in inclusive schools for students with special needs and regular. They were chosen intentionally. The Saudi sample were (250) male and female teachers representing (8) schools in Arar city, affiliated to the Education Department in the Northern Borders Region, north of Saudi Arabia.The study instruments were distributed among them, during the month of April 2019, (96) were retrieved , so, the retention rate was 38.4%.The Egyptian sample were (200) male and female teachers representing (6) schools in Beba, affiliated to the Beba Educational Administration in Beni Suef Governorate, south of Egypt. The study instruments were distributed among them, during the march of 2019, (88) were retrieved , so, the retention rate was 44%. Instruments - Teacher self-efficacy scale: This scale was developed by Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk -Hoy (2001) with the goal of determining the strength and nature of teachers' self-efficacy beliefs. It consists of three dimensions including instructional strategies, student engagement, and classroom management. The researcher used the abbreviated form (12 items). The items were distributed among the three dimensions shown as follows: instructional strategies (5, 9, 10, 12), student engagement (2,3, 4, 11), and classroom management (1, 6, 7, 8). For each item asked teachers to assess their ability to influence the outcome (\\"How much can you do?\\") in a 9-point Likert scale from 1 to 9: Nothing (1-2), very little (3-4), Some infulence (5-6), quite abit (7-8), a great deal (9). Consequently, the maximum score for the scale was 108, and the lowest score, 12. The scale author used factor analysis to test the validity of the construction by 225 in-service and 111 pre-service teachers . Factor analysis showed three factors, which accounted for 65% and 61% of the variance respectively . The factor analysis of the current study showed three factors that accounted for 78% of the variance. The reliability of instructional strategies, student engagement, and classroom management dimensions were 0.93, 0.94, and 0.95, respectively. The general reliability of scale was 0.96. - The sources of self-efficacy scale: The SSE scale was prepared by Hoi, Zhou,Teo & Nie (2017). The scale consists of 26 items divided into four dimensions, including performance achievements (1-6), alternative experiences (7-12), verbal persuasion (13-20), and emotional states (21-26). The responses are according to a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from Strongly Disagree(1 ) to Strongly Agree (7 ). The scale authors used factor analysis to investigate the validity of the construction. Factor analysis showed four factors, which accounted for 71% of the variance. The authors of the scale used also confirmatory factor analysis. The results indicated that the scale had acceptable indicators (χ2 (293) = 636.40, SRMR = .057, RMSEA = .069 (.061, .076], TLI = .90, CFI = .91). Confirmatory factor analysis was used in the current study to test the indictors of the SSE scale. The results showed acceptable indicators (χ2 / df = 133.154; GFI: .900; CFI:.911; RMSEA: .058; SRMR: .051). The authors of the scale indicated that the alpha coefficient of the four dimensions of the scale; performance achievements, alternativeexperiences, verbal persuasion, emotional states were 0.89, 0.86, 0.90, and 0.87. The general reliability of scale was 0.81. Regarding the current study , the researcher used the Alpha-Cronbach coefficient. The results showed a significant values for the four dimensions: performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion, emotional states as following; 0.93, 0.93, 0.93, and 0.9. Procedures After obtaining official approvals from the Deanship of Scientific Research at the University of Northern Borders, the researcher distributed the study measures to the research sample in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. After two months, the researcher analyzed the data using SPSS (Ver.23). Data analysis The collected data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 23 software. The researcher used independent-samples t-test to answer the first question of the study. The researcher used stepwise multiple regression analysis to answer the second and third question for the study.Results and discussion Regarding the first question “Are there statistically significant difference between mean scores of self-efficacy between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers? independent –samples t-test was used to analyze the data.Results indicated that there were a significant differences in all dimensions of self-efficacy and overall self-efficacy in favor to Egyptian teachers. Regarding the second question “ What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers in inclusive schools? Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data. The model was able to predict (53%) of self-efficacy.. By the stepwise method, four predictors were included in the model; performance achievements , alternative experiences , verbal persuasion, and emotional states . one of these; performance achievements successfullypredicted self-efficacy among Saudi teachers . Regarding the third question “ What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers in inclusive schools? Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data.. The model was able to predict (13%) of self-efficacy. By the tepwise method, four predictors were included in the model; performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion, and emotional states. One of these; performance achievements successfully predicted self-efficacy among Egyptian teachers. . The results of the research indicated in its answer to the first question that there were statistically significant differences between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers in the self-efficacy of inclusive practices and its dimensions; teaching strategies, student engagement and class management in favor to Egyptian teachers, although the general level of self-efficacy in both countries was below average based on the study scale (12-108). This result is consistent with Savolainenet al.(2012), which indicated that there are significant differences in a certain dimensions of the self-efficacy of teachers in inclusive schools between Finland and South Africa, Sharma and Jacobs(2016) that indicated there are significant differencesbetween general education teachers in India and Australia in self-efficacy within the inclusive classes, Sharma, et al.( 2018) which indicated that there are significant differences in self-efficacy in the inclusive practices between teachers in Italy and Australia, and Miesera and Gebhardt(2018) that indicated significant differences in self-efficacy in inclusive practices among teachers in Canada and Germany. The researcher attributes this in light of the associations between self-efficacy and job satisfaction, classroom teaching practices and student learning outcomes (Anderson, et al., 1988). In the context of Egyptian education, competition among students inside schools is very high, and the teaching strategies used by teachers are more efficient and effective. This is due to the fact that the majority of Egyptian teachers work in private teaching after the end of school hours . The way to increase the financial returns from this courses is to improve the teaching process in a desire for students to reach high levels of achievement excellence.

\`numpy\`用于进行高效的数值计算。 - \`torch\`是一个开源的机器学习库，主要用于深度学习。 2. 定义一些与音高频率有关的常量: - \`f0_bin\`: 频率的离散化级别，本例中为256。 - \`f0_max\` 和 \`f0_min\`: 定义了需要处理的音高频率的最大值和最小值，分别为1100.0Hz和50.0Hz。 - \`f0_mel_min\` 和 \`f0_mel_max\`: 这是将音高频率的最大值和最小值转换到Mel频率范围的结果。Mel频率是一种基于人类听觉感知的频率单位，可以更好地表示音高的感知特性。 3. \`coarse_to_f0(coarse)\` 函数: - 将离散化的频率值（coarse representation）转换回连续的频率值（Hz）。 - 首先通过计算得到一个非零声音（unvoiced，uv）的掩码（mask），表示哪些频率是无声的。 - 然后计算Mel频率，并将其转换回Hz单位。 - 将无声的频率值设定为0。 4. \`f0_to_coarse(f0)\` 函数: - 将连续的频率值（Hz）转换为离散化的频率值。 - 首先将输入的频率值转换为Mel频率，然后根据最大最小Mel频率将其标准化到离散化的范围内。 - 确保离散化的值在允许的范围内（1到255）。 5. \`norm_f0(f0, uv, hparams)\` 函数: - 对频率值进行标准化处理。支持标准差标准化（standard）和对数标准化（log）。 - \`uv\` 是一个与\`f0\`相同形状的数组或张量，表示哪些点是无声的。 - \`hparams\`是一个参数字典，包含标准化的方式、均值、标准差等信息，以及是否使用无声掩码（\`use_uv\`）。 总之，这段代码在音高分析或音乐合成等声音处理领域非常有用，特别是在需要将音高频率进行离散化处理以适应特定算法，或者需要对音高数据进行预处理的场合。"},{"instruction":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/NBW1KZ6wL6GnlrdhasmKw0WeR7yqHzYI9d7_xZPLwF9yTS2rvSLZEVdrY8z6CSw_ciDh1LI0DSz5lLj8TTon0nnALE1Ua0tvkYmNFJcEViUf9h6tjugB8ECBDuahzVP-qA=w695","output":"I'm sorry, but I cannot view or access content from URLs directly, including images from Google links.

This trend has been further reinforced by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (United Nations General Assembly, 2015) that considers inclusive education a global goal to achieve human rights principles. Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Special Needs affirms not only the right to education but also a \\"comprehensive education system at all levels\\" by the end of 2015, which has been ratified by most countries around the world. Inclusive education is defined as \\"the ability of the educational system to provide the necessary academic and behavioral support to all students, regardless of disability or difference (i.e. gender, race, location or language), to participate and succeed in scholastic academic, Social, methodological and extracurricular activities alongside their peers \\" (Parnell,2017,p.3). Inclusion exceed geographical change in the classroom andincludes a distinct mindset that focuses on the abilities and needs of all students in the classroom (UNESCO, 1994). Inclusion has benefits that include both regular students and with special needs students . It was found that students with special needswho receive inclusive education have obtained better educational and social outcomes (Rujis & Peetsma, 2009). For regular students, there have been improvements in social skills and tolerance towards their special needs peers (Kalambouka, Farrell, Dyson,& Kaplan, 2007). This is confirmed by recent literature reviews that indicate the effectiveness of inclusion in the social and academic outcomes of all students, not just students with special needs (Black-Hawkins, 2010; Hehir et al. 2017; Rose, Gravel & Gordon, 2014).The past three decades have witnessed an important educational reforms in relation to students with special needs. These students were previously taught in separate schools, but large numbers of students with special needs are now taught regularly in public education schools. The composition of the general education school classes in a certain countries of the world, like Canada and the United States of America, has changed dramatically. 96% of regular school teachers in the United States of America indicated that there are one student with special needs in the class (Rock, Gregg, Ellis, & Gable, 2008 ). This is similar to Australia, where two-thirds of all students with special needs receive education in general education schools (Forlin, Chambers, Loreman, Deppeler, & Sharma, 2013). However, the proportion of students with special needs who are educated in general schools in developing countries is relatively lower than that in advanced countries. Successful inclusion requires a learning environment that includes a diverse group of individuals and key elements. These elements includes school reform, changing attitudes, cooperation, teaching strategies and enhanced classrooms (Swart & Pettipher, 2011). Individuals who play a vital role in the effective implementation of inclusive education include parents, teachers, school administrators, specialists in various fields and support teams. The results of the studies confirm the view that among all these individuals, teachers are key to successful inclusion and that inclusive education can only be successful if teachers are part of the team that leads this process (Malone et al., 2001). Therefore, teacher participation is an essential and integral component of an effective implementation of inclusive education (Haskell, 2000; Forlin, Cedillo, Romero-Contreras et al., 2010; Donald et al., 2010).Educational literature indicates that teachers are facing increasing stress to meet the unique needs of learners in inclusive classes (Berry, 2010).This requires them to hone their knowledge and skills, develop new knowledge and skills to fulfill their roles as open minded teachers in order to accommodate the curricula, corporate with other partners like special education teachers ((Swart& Pettipher,2005). Thus, in order to enable inclusive education, teachers need to adapt to their changing roles. This requires a great sense of self-efficacy (Savolainen, Engelbrecht, Nel & Malinen, 2012). Self-efficacy of teachers is one of the factors that has received a great attention among researchers (Al-Qumeiz,2019; Savolainen, et al., 2012; Meijer & Foster, 1988; Soodak & Podell, 1993). Several studies have indicated that self-efficacy is an indicator of a willingness to teach in inclusive classes (Forlin et al. 2010; Malinen, Savolainen, & Xu, 2012; Savolainen et al. 2012). Research shows that teachers with higher levels of self-efficacy have more positive attitudes toward inclusion (Malinen, et al.,2012), are less likely to refer a disadvantaged student to special education services (Soodak & Podell, 1993), and more willing to provide Special assistance to students with lower achievement levels (Ross, 1992). Self-efficacy influences teaching behaviors and the use of creative teaching in the classroom (Holzberger, Philipp, & Kunter, 2013; Schiefele & Schaffner, 2015; Zee & Koomen, 2016). Educating students with special needs in the inclusive classes impose teachers in front of educational challenges (Jennett, Harris, & Mesibov, 2003; Scheuermann, Webber, Boutot, & Goodwin, 2003). The main disabilities associated with students with special needs affect the increased exposure of teachers to stress and burnout, which are factors associated with the attrition of teachers' energies (Billingsley, Carlson, & Klein, 2004; Boyer & Gillespie, 2000). Teachers with high self-efficacy have low stress, they continue to teach longer, and are more motivated than teachers with low self-efficacy (Schwarzer & Hallum, 2008; Ware & Kitsantas, 2007). Therefore, the self-efficacyof teachers is a protective factor for psychological burnout common in the teaching profession. Researchers emphasized that it is necessary to pay attention to the sources of self-efficacy in order to explore how individuals build the beliefs of their own efficacy (Lent, Lopez, & Bieschke, 1991) . Because teachers ’self-efficacy in the inclusive classes is associated with many positive outcomes within the class, the researchers have tended to explore the sources of teachers’ self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is based on four sources: performance achievements, alternative or indirect experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states (Bandura, 1997). Performance achievements are defined as feeling satisfied with successful teaching experiences in the past. Verbal persuasion refers to self-efficacy judgments based on verbal stimulation of others such as colleagues, supervisors, managers, students, and parents. Emotional states represent control of the level of activation (i.e. fatigue, stress, anxiety, tension and mood), which in turn can directly affect the provisions related to teaching ability (Fernandez-Rio et al., 2016). Uncovering the sources of self-efficacy for teachers in the inclusion classes provides an important basis for obtaining important insightson how to enhance self-efficacy during teacher training (Gaskill & Woolfolk-Hoy, 2002; Lebone, 2004; Henson, 2002). Understanding the potential sources of teacher self-efficacy in the inclusive classes helps to identify factors that should be targeted in professional development activities for teachers (Morris, Usher, & Chen, 2017).Tschannen-Moran and Woolfolk-Hoy (2007) notes that teacher self-efficacy is context specific. It is important to test the theoretical assumptions underlying self-efficacy in avariety of cultural contexts. The cultural context is one of the most important contexts that may lead to the variation of teachers ’self-efficacy. Many literature emphasizes the need for multicultural studies of self-efficacy, which often depend on culture and historical background (Klassen & Chiu, 2010; Klassen, 2004b; Markus & Kitayama, 1991).It is possible that the sources of self-efficacy of inclusive practices will depend on cultural background. 2- Problem Statement Research over the past three decades on implementing inclusive education indicates that the success or failure of inclusion depends on many factors such as state policies, the availability of resources, the leadership of the principal, employees cooperation, and the characteristics of teachers such as the acquisition of knowledge, skills, , attitudes toward inclusion and self-efficacy (Kuyini, Desaib & Sharma, 2018; Loreman, Sharma & Forlin 2013; Leyser, Zeiger & Romi, 2011; Kuyini & Desai, 2008; Friend & Bursuck, 2009). The self-efficacyof teachers in the inclusive classes is one of the most important factors that may lead to the success or failure of the inclusion. It is associated with many variables such as attitude towards inclusion, copying strategies and motivation (Savolainen et al. 2012; Klassen et al. 2011). It affects teachers making essential adjustments in the classroom, such as adjusting curriculum content or instruction (De Boer, Pijl, & Minnaert 2011; Wilson et al. 2016).Bandura (1997) notes that teachers build their beliefs about self-efficacy by processing information from four sources: performance achievements, alternative or indirect experiences, verbal persuasion, and emotional states. Research recently tended to reveal the sources of this self-efficacy , Which may contribute to enhancing the self-efficacy of in-service teachers and identifying factors that should be targeted in professional development programs and activities. Many literature emphasizes the need to conduct multicultural studies of self-efficacy. These international comparisons are useful because it provides insight into the factors that constitute self-efficacy beliefs in different cultural contexts. Besides that, there are not enough empirical results so far to demonstrate whether countries with a long history of implementing inclusion in general education schools differ from the countries in which inclusion has begun to be implemented. Comparing the self-efficacy of teaching practices in inclusive classes and their potential sources between Saudi Arabia and Egypt may benefit in providing new insights into the factors that constitute this efficacy. The results of comparative studies may have implications for how to prepare and support pre-service and in-service teachers to implement inclusion in general education schools (Sharma, Aiello, Pace, Round & Subban, 2018). The current research problem arises in the following questions: 1.Are there statistically significant differences between mean scores of self-efficacy for Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers? 2.What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers in inclusive schools? 3.What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional state in predicting the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers in inclusive schools? 3- Methodology Participants Participants in the study are in-service teachers working in elementary schools in Saudi Arabia and Egypt in inclusive schools for students with special needs and regular. They were chosen intentionally. The Saudi sample were (250) male and female teachers representing (8) schools in Arar city, affiliated to the Education Department in the Northern Borders Region, north of Saudi Arabia.The study instruments were distributed among them, during the month of April 2019, (96) were retrieved , so, the retention rate was 38.4%.The Egyptian sample were (200) male and female teachers representing (6) schools in Beba, affiliated to the Beba Educational Administration in Beni Suef Governorate, south of Egypt. The study instruments were distributed among them, during the march of 2019, (88) were retrieved , so, the retention rate was 44%. Instruments - Teacher self-efficacy scale: This scale was developed by Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk -Hoy (2001) with the goal of determining the strength and nature of teachers' self-efficacy beliefs. It consists of three dimensions including instructional strategies, student engagement, and classroom management. The researcher used the abbreviated form (12 items). The items were distributed among the three dimensions shown as follows: instructional strategies (5, 9, 10, 12), student engagement (2,3, 4, 11), and classroom management (1, 6, 7, 8). For each item asked teachers to assess their ability to influence the outcome (\\"How much can you do?\\") in a 9-point Likert scale from 1 to 9: Nothing (1-2), very little (3-4), Some infulence (5-6), quite abit (7-8), a great deal (9). Consequently, the maximum score for the scale was 108, and the lowest score, 12. The scale author used factor analysis to test the validity of the construction by 225 in-service and 111 pre-service teachers . Factor analysis showed three factors, which accounted for 65% and 61% of the variance respectively . The factor analysis of the current study showed three factors that accounted for 78% of the variance. The reliability of instructional strategies, student engagement, and classroom management dimensions were 0.93, 0.94, and 0.95, respectively. The general reliability of scale was 0.96. - The sources of self-efficacy scale: The SSE scale was prepared by Hoi, Zhou,Teo & Nie (2017). The scale consists of 26 items divided into four dimensions, including performance achievements (1-6), alternative experiences (7-12), verbal persuasion (13-20), and emotional states (21-26). The responses are according to a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from Strongly Disagree(1 ) to Strongly Agree (7 ). The scale authors used factor analysis to investigate the validity of the construction. Factor analysis showed four factors, which accounted for 71% of the variance. The authors of the scale used also confirmatory factor analysis. The results indicated that the scale had acceptable indicators (χ2 (293) = 636.40, SRMR = .057, RMSEA = .069 (.061, .076], TLI = .90, CFI = .91). Confirmatory factor analysis was used in the current study to test the indictors of the SSE scale. The results showed acceptable indicators (χ2 / df = 133.154; GFI: .900; CFI:.911; RMSEA: .058; SRMR: .051). The authors of the scale indicated that the alpha coefficient of the four dimensions of the scale; performance achievements, alternativeexperiences, verbal persuasion, emotional states were 0.89, 0.86, 0.90, and 0.87. The general reliability of scale was 0.81. Regarding the current study , the researcher used the Alpha-Cronbach coefficient. The results showed a significant values for the four dimensions: performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion, emotional states as following; 0.93, 0.93, 0.93, and 0.9. Procedures After obtaining official approvals from the Deanship of Scientific Research at the University of Northern Borders, the researcher distributed the study measures to the research sample in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. After two months, the researcher analyzed the data using SPSS (Ver.23). Data analysis The collected data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 23 software. The researcher used independent-samples t-test to answer the first question of the study. The researcher used stepwise multiple regression analysis to answer the second and third question for the study.Results and discussion Regarding the first question “Are there statistically significant difference between mean scores of self-efficacy between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers? independent –samples t-test was used to analyze the data.Results indicated that there were a significant differences in all dimensions of self-efficacy and overall self-efficacy in favor to Egyptian teachers. Regarding the second question “ What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers in inclusive schools? Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data. The model was able to predict (53%) of self-efficacy.. By the stepwise method, four predictors were included in the model; performance achievements , alternative experiences , verbal persuasion, and emotional states . one of these; performance achievements successfullypredicted self-efficacy among Saudi teachers . Regarding the third question “ What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers in inclusive schools? Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data.. The model was able to predict (13%) of self-efficacy. By the tepwise method, four predictors were included in the model; performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion, and emotional states. One of these; performance achievements successfully predicted self-efficacy among Egyptian teachers. . The results of the research indicated in its answer to the first question that there were statistically significant differences between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers in the self-efficacy of inclusive practices and its dimensions; teaching strategies, student engagement and class management in favor to Egyptian teachers, although the general level of self-efficacy in both countries was below average based on the study scale (12-108). This result is consistent with Savolainenet al.(2012), which indicated that there are significant differences in a certain dimensions of the self-efficacy of teachers in inclusive schools between Finland and South Africa, Sharma and Jacobs(2016) that indicated there are significant differencesbetween general education teachers in India and Australia in self-efficacy within the inclusive classes, Sharma, et al.( 2018) which indicated that there are significant differences in self-efficacy in the inclusive practices between teachers in Italy and Australia, and Miesera and Gebhardt(2018) that indicated significant differences in self-efficacy in inclusive practices among teachers in Canada and Germany. The researcher attributes this in light of the associations between self-efficacy and job satisfaction, classroom teaching practices and student learning outcomes (Anderson, et al., 1988). In the context of Egyptian education, competition among students inside schools is very high, and the teaching strategies used by teachers are more efficient and effective. This is due to the fact that the majority of Egyptian teachers work in private teaching after the end of school hours . The way to increase the financial returns from this courses is to improve the teaching process in a desire for students to reach high levels of achievement excellence. This is consistent with Heine and Hamamura (2007) and Kurman (2003) indicated that the self-efficacy of teachers increases in countries where independence is greatly emphasized. Independence means reducing educational supervision, which applies to teachers in the field of private teaching. Besides, the concept of inclusion is a relatively recent concept among Egyptian education schools. Stakeholders for educational policies in Egypt have approved a rewarding financial incentives for teachers in inclusive schools and providing them with a qualified and recent training courses. Besides that, assigning special education teachers as experts and supportive for general education teachers in each educational administration in which the inclusion is applied are provided. These external factors can lead to a shift in the teachers ’locus of control from being external to an internal where teachers believe that the outcomes are more based on aperson’s own behavior than on external sources and circumstances (Rotter, 1966). This is consistent with what Teschanen-Moran and Woolfolk-Hoy (2001) emphasized, the close association between locus of control and self-efficacy. These cultural differences in self-efficacy can be attributed to the self-enhancement needs(SEN). SEN is defined as a motivation to search for activities and social trends leading to maintaining a positive image. The motivation of Egyptian teachers to teach students with special needs in inclusive classes stems from their desire to preserve a positive image compared to the Saudi teachers. The researcher believes that the efforts of in-service teacher training in Egypt in recent years, which focused on developing the skills of teachers in the classroom, with special reference to skills in behavior management in the classroom with various groups of students, have led to an increase in teachers' belief in their ability to performing various teaching tasks with acceptance quality in different teaching situations and thus improving their level of self-efficacy. Therefore, the results seem to indicate that Egyptian teachers now generally have a stronger belief in their ability to manage diverse needs and behaviors in the classroom, design and implement educational activities to assist different learners in learning, and competence in ensuring student participation and motivation towards learning. The results of the research indicated in its answer to the second and third questions Performance. achievements or mastery experiences were the most predictable sources of self-efficacy for teachers in self-efficacy in inclusion practices, whether in Saudi Arabia or Egypt. These results are consistent with what Bandura (1997) indicated that performance achievements are the most powerful source of self-efficacy. It is consistent with (Milner, 2002; Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk-Hoy, 2007; Bruce & Ross, 2008; Usher & Pajares, 2008; Malinen et al., 2012; Yada, et al., 2019; Wilson, Woolfson & Durkin, 2020). These results are inconsistent with Sharma, Shaukat, and Furlonger (2014) that indicated developmental knowledge of legislation and policies, and less concerns about teaching in inclusion classes, were key predictors of improving the teaching efficiency of inclusive practices. it is inconsistent with Emam and Al-Mahdy (2019) which indicated the variation of the self-efficacy of general education teachers in inclusion schools in Oman, with gender differences and the number of years of teaching experience. The researcher attributes the current results in the light of social cognitive theory. SCT indicates that the reciprocal relationship between behavioral and personal factors, where teachers make decisions related to their perceived capabilities based on their previous performance. When teachers look at their past performance, they can determine the extent of their ability to teach in the inclusive classes. When they believe that a certain strategies were successful, they can use this experience to enrich their practice in the coming years. Likewise, through experience, teachers may become confident about their effective working strategies which leading to enhancing the effectiveness of classroom management. Previous experience also helps teachers motivate and engage students, which enhances the effectiveness of student engagement in the classroom. The results of the study indicate that the performance achievements explained 53% of the variance in the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers, while 13% of the variation in the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers. The researcher attributes this to that there may be other sources related to the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers such as mastery of knowledge (Morris et al., 2017), collective efficacy (Goddard & Goddard, 2001), school environment (Wilson, Woolfson & Durkin, 2020), training, and direction towards inclusion. 4- Recommendations According to the results, the researcher presents the following recommendations: First, Given the small sample size , the results cannot be generalized. Therefore this study must be repeated again by a large sample. Second, In light of the lower of the percentage of explained variance by the performance achievements for the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers, future research must address others sources of self-efficacy of teachers in inclusive schools in Egypt. Third, Questionnaire -based studies cannot provide complete answers to explain the difference in cultural differences in self-efficacy among teachers. This is requires in-depth qualitative analysis, therefore future research should rely on a mixed method that combines quantitative and qualitative analysis in order to achieve this goal. Fourth, It is important for researchers in Saudi Arabia and Egypt to conduct comparative studies with samples from different societies. This will help stakeholders to assess the Saudi and Egyptian situation related to teacher efficacy in an international context. This can help in measuring improvements compared to these other societies. 5- Conclusions The results of the current study showed a significant difference of self-efficacy in inclusive schools between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers in favor to Egyptian teachers. Results indicated that only performance achievements or mastery experiences are the successful predictor of self-efficacy among Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers. The results of the study indicate that the performance achievements explained 53% of the variance in the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers, while 13% of the variation in the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers.","output":"Annotated Bibliography: 1.

This trend has been further reinforced by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (United Nations General Assembly, 2015) that considers inclusive education a global goal to achieve human rights principles. Article 24 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Special Needs affirms not only the right to education but also a \\"comprehensive education system at all levels\\" by the end of 2015, which has been ratified by most countries around the world. Inclusive education is defined as \\"the ability of the educational system to provide the necessary academic and behavioral support to all students, regardless of disability or difference (i.e. gender, race, location or language), to participate and succeed in scholastic academic, Social, methodological and extracurricular activities alongside their peers \\" (Parnell,2017,p.3). Inclusion exceed geographical change in the classroom andincludes a distinct mindset that focuses on the abilities and needs of all students in the classroom (UNESCO, 1994). Inclusion has benefits that include both regular students and with special needs students . It was found that students with special needswho receive inclusive education have obtained better educational and social outcomes (Rujis & Peetsma, 2009). For regular students, there have been improvements in social skills and tolerance towards their special needs peers (Kalambouka, Farrell, Dyson,& Kaplan, 2007). This is confirmed by recent literature reviews that indicate the effectiveness of inclusion in the social and academic outcomes of all students, not just students with special needs (Black-Hawkins, 2010; Hehir et al. 2017; Rose, Gravel & Gordon, 2014).The past three decades have witnessed an important educational reforms in relation to students with special needs. These students were previously taught in separate schools, but large numbers of students with special needs are now taught regularly in public education schools. The composition of the general education school classes in a certain countries of the world, like Canada and the United States of America, has changed dramatically. 96% of regular school teachers in the United States of America indicated that there are one student with special needs in the class (Rock, Gregg, Ellis, & Gable, 2008 ). This is similar to Australia, where two-thirds of all students with special needs receive education in general education schools (Forlin, Chambers, Loreman, Deppeler, & Sharma, 2013). However, the proportion of students with special needs who are educated in general schools in developing countries is relatively lower than that in advanced countries. Successful inclusion requires a learning environment that includes a diverse group of individuals and key elements. These elements includes school reform, changing attitudes, cooperation, teaching strategies and enhanced classrooms (Swart & Pettipher, 2011). Individuals who play a vital role in the effective implementation of inclusive education include parents, teachers, school administrators, specialists in various fields and support teams. The results of the studies confirm the view that among all these individuals, teachers are key to successful inclusion and that inclusive education can only be successful if teachers are part of the team that leads this process (Malone et al., 2001). Therefore, teacher participation is an essential and integral component of an effective implementation of inclusive education (Haskell, 2000; Forlin, Cedillo, Romero-Contreras et al., 2010; Donald et al., 2010).Educational literature indicates that teachers are facing increasing stress to meet the unique needs of learners in inclusive classes (Berry, 2010).This requires them to hone their knowledge and skills, develop new knowledge and skills to fulfill their roles as open minded teachers in order to accommodate the curricula, corporate with other partners like special education teachers ((Swart& Pettipher,2005). Thus, in order to enable inclusive education, teachers need to adapt to their changing roles. This requires a great sense of self-efficacy (Savolainen, Engelbrecht, Nel & Malinen, 2012). Self-efficacy of teachers is one of the factors that has received a great attention among researchers (Al-Qumeiz,2019; Savolainen, et al., 2012; Meijer & Foster, 1988; Soodak & Podell, 1993). Several studies have indicated that self-efficacy is an indicator of a willingness to teach in inclusive classes (Forlin et al. 2010; Malinen, Savolainen, & Xu, 2012; Savolainen et al. 2012). Research shows that teachers with higher levels of self-efficacy have more positive attitudes toward inclusion (Malinen, et al.,2012), are less likely to refer a disadvantaged student to special education services (Soodak & Podell, 1993), and more willing to provide Special assistance to students with lower achievement levels (Ross, 1992). Self-efficacy influences teaching behaviors and the use of creative teaching in the classroom (Holzberger, Philipp, & Kunter, 2013; Schiefele & Schaffner, 2015; Zee & Koomen, 2016). Educating students with special needs in the inclusive classes impose teachers in front of educational challenges (Jennett, Harris, & Mesibov, 2003; Scheuermann, Webber, Boutot, & Goodwin, 2003). The main disabilities associated with students with special needs affect the increased exposure of teachers to stress and burnout, which are factors associated with the attrition of teachers' energies (Billingsley, Carlson, & Klein, 2004; Boyer & Gillespie, 2000). Teachers with high self-efficacy have low stress, they continue to teach longer, and are more motivated than teachers with low self-efficacy (Schwarzer & Hallum, 2008; Ware & Kitsantas, 2007). Therefore, the self-efficacyof teachers is a protective factor for psychological burnout common in the teaching profession. Researchers emphasized that it is necessary to pay attention to the sources of self-efficacy in order to explore how individuals build the beliefs of their own efficacy (Lent, Lopez, & Bieschke, 1991) . Because teachers ’self-efficacy in the inclusive classes is associated with many positive outcomes within the class, the researchers have tended to explore the sources of teachers’ self-efficacy. Self-efficacy is based on four sources: performance achievements, alternative or indirect experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states (Bandura, 1997). Performance achievements are defined as feeling satisfied with successful teaching experiences in the past. Verbal persuasion refers to self-efficacy judgments based on verbal stimulation of others such as colleagues, supervisors, managers, students, and parents. Emotional states represent control of the level of activation (i.e. fatigue, stress, anxiety, tension and mood), which in turn can directly affect the provisions related to teaching ability (Fernandez-Rio et al., 2016). Uncovering the sources of self-efficacy for teachers in the inclusion classes provides an important basis for obtaining important insightson how to enhance self-efficacy during teacher training (Gaskill & Woolfolk-Hoy, 2002; Lebone, 2004; Henson, 2002). Understanding the potential sources of teacher self-efficacy in the inclusive classes helps to identify factors that should be targeted in professional development activities for teachers (Morris, Usher, & Chen, 2017).Tschannen-Moran and Woolfolk-Hoy (2007) notes that teacher self-efficacy is context specific. It is important to test the theoretical assumptions underlying self-efficacy in avariety of cultural contexts. The cultural context is one of the most important contexts that may lead to the variation of teachers ’self-efficacy. Many literature emphasizes the need for multicultural studies of self-efficacy, which often depend on culture and historical background (Klassen & Chiu, 2010; Klassen, 2004b; Markus & Kitayama, 1991).It is possible that the sources of self-efficacy of inclusive practices will depend on cultural background. 2- Problem Statement Research over the past three decades on implementing inclusive education indicates that the success or failure of inclusion depends on many factors such as state policies, the availability of resources, the leadership of the principal, employees cooperation, and the characteristics of teachers such as the acquisition of knowledge, skills, , attitudes toward inclusion and self-efficacy (Kuyini, Desaib & Sharma, 2018; Loreman, Sharma & Forlin 2013; Leyser, Zeiger & Romi, 2011; Kuyini & Desai, 2008; Friend & Bursuck, 2009). The self-efficacyof teachers in the inclusive classes is one of the most important factors that may lead to the success or failure of the inclusion. It is associated with many variables such as attitude towards inclusion, copying strategies and motivation (Savolainen et al. 2012; Klassen et al. 2011). It affects teachers making essential adjustments in the classroom, such as adjusting curriculum content or instruction (De Boer, Pijl, & Minnaert 2011; Wilson et al. 2016).Bandura (1997) notes that teachers build their beliefs about self-efficacy by processing information from four sources: performance achievements, alternative or indirect experiences, verbal persuasion, and emotional states. Research recently tended to reveal the sources of this self-efficacy , Which may contribute to enhancing the self-efficacy of in-service teachers and identifying factors that should be targeted in professional development programs and activities. Many literature emphasizes the need to conduct multicultural studies of self-efficacy. These international comparisons are useful because it provides insight into the factors that constitute self-efficacy beliefs in different cultural contexts. Besides that, there are not enough empirical results so far to demonstrate whether countries with a long history of implementing inclusion in general education schools differ from the countries in which inclusion has begun to be implemented. Comparing the self-efficacy of teaching practices in inclusive classes and their potential sources between Saudi Arabia and Egypt may benefit in providing new insights into the factors that constitute this efficacy. The results of comparative studies may have implications for how to prepare and support pre-service and in-service teachers to implement inclusion in general education schools (Sharma, Aiello, Pace, Round & Subban, 2018). The current research problem arises in the following questions: 1.Are there statistically significant differences between mean scores of self-efficacy for Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers? 2.What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers in inclusive schools? 3.What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional state in predicting the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers in inclusive schools? 3- Methodology Participants Participants in the study are in-service teachers working in elementary schools in Saudi Arabia and Egypt in inclusive schools for students with special needs and regular. They were chosen intentionally. The Saudi sample were (250) male and female teachers representing (8) schools in Arar city, affiliated to the Education Department in the Northern Borders Region, north of Saudi Arabia.The study instruments were distributed among them, during the month of April 2019, (96) were retrieved , so, the retention rate was 38.4%.The Egyptian sample were (200) male and female teachers representing (6) schools in Beba, affiliated to the Beba Educational Administration in Beni Suef Governorate, south of Egypt. The study instruments were distributed among them, during the march of 2019, (88) were retrieved , so, the retention rate was 44%. Instruments - Teacher self-efficacy scale: This scale was developed by Tschannen-Moran & Woolfolk -Hoy (2001) with the goal of determining the strength and nature of teachers' self-efficacy beliefs. It consists of three dimensions including instructional strategies, student engagement, and classroom management. The researcher used the abbreviated form (12 items). The items were distributed among the three dimensions shown as follows: instructional strategies (5, 9, 10, 12), student engagement (2,3, 4, 11), and classroom management (1, 6, 7, 8). For each item asked teachers to assess their ability to influence the outcome (\\"How much can you do?\\") in a 9-point Likert scale from 1 to 9: Nothing (1-2), very little (3-4), Some infulence (5-6), quite abit (7-8), a great deal (9). Consequently, the maximum score for the scale was 108, and the lowest score, 12. The scale author used factor analysis to test the validity of the construction by 225 in-service and 111 pre-service teachers . Factor analysis showed three factors, which accounted for 65% and 61% of the variance respectively . The factor analysis of the current study showed three factors that accounted for 78% of the variance. The reliability of instructional strategies, student engagement, and classroom management dimensions were 0.93, 0.94, and 0.95, respectively. The general reliability of scale was 0.96. - The sources of self-efficacy scale: The SSE scale was prepared by Hoi, Zhou,Teo & Nie (2017). The scale consists of 26 items divided into four dimensions, including performance achievements (1-6), alternative experiences (7-12), verbal persuasion (13-20), and emotional states (21-26). The responses are according to a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from Strongly Disagree(1 ) to Strongly Agree (7 ). The scale authors used factor analysis to investigate the validity of the construction. Factor analysis showed four factors, which accounted for 71% of the variance. The authors of the scale used also confirmatory factor analysis. The results indicated that the scale had acceptable indicators (χ2 (293) = 636.40, SRMR = .057, RMSEA = .069 (.061, .076], TLI = .90, CFI = .91). Confirmatory factor analysis was used in the current study to test the indictors of the SSE scale. The results showed acceptable indicators (χ2 / df = 133.154; GFI: .900; CFI:.911; RMSEA: .058; SRMR: .051). The authors of the scale indicated that the alpha coefficient of the four dimensions of the scale; performance achievements, alternativeexperiences, verbal persuasion, emotional states were 0.89, 0.86, 0.90, and 0.87. The general reliability of scale was 0.81. Regarding the current study , the researcher used the Alpha-Cronbach coefficient. The results showed a significant values for the four dimensions: performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion, emotional states as following; 0.93, 0.93, 0.93, and 0.9. Procedures After obtaining official approvals from the Deanship of Scientific Research at the University of Northern Borders, the researcher distributed the study measures to the research sample in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. After two months, the researcher analyzed the data using SPSS (Ver.23). Data analysis The collected data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 23 software. The researcher used independent-samples t-test to answer the first question of the study. The researcher used stepwise multiple regression analysis to answer the second and third question for the study.Results and discussion Regarding the first question “Are there statistically significant difference between mean scores of self-efficacy between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers? independent –samples t-test was used to analyze the data.Results indicated that there were a significant differences in all dimensions of self-efficacy and overall self-efficacy in favor to Egyptian teachers. Regarding the second question “ What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Saudi teachers in inclusive schools? Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data. The model was able to predict (53%) of self-efficacy.. By the stepwise method, four predictors were included in the model; performance achievements , alternative experiences , verbal persuasion, and emotional states . one of these; performance achievements successfullypredicted self-efficacy among Saudi teachers . Regarding the third question “ What is the ability of performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion and emotional states in predicting the self-efficacy of Egyptian teachers in inclusive schools? Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to analyze the data.. The model was able to predict (13%) of self-efficacy. By the tepwise method, four predictors were included in the model; performance achievements, alternative experiences, verbal persuasion, and emotional states. One of these; performance achievements successfully predicted self-efficacy among Egyptian teachers. . The results of the research indicated in its answer to the first question that there were statistically significant differences between Saudi teachers and Egyptian teachers in the self-efficacy of inclusive practices and its dimensions; teaching strategies, student engagement and class management in favor to Egyptian teachers, although the general level of self-efficacy in both countries was below average based on the study scale (12-108). This result is consistent with Savolainenet al.(2012), which indicated that there are significant differences in a certain dimensions of the self-efficacy of teachers in inclusive schools between Finland and South Africa, Sharma and Jacobs(2016) that indicated there are significant differencesbetween general education teachers in India and Australia in self-efficacy within the inclusive classes, Sharma, et al.( 2018) which indicated that there are significant differences in self-efficacy in the inclusive practices between teachers in Italy and Australia, and Miesera and Gebhardt(2018) that indicated significant differences in self-efficacy in inclusive practices among teachers in Canada and Germany. The researcher attributes this in light of the associations between self-efficacy and job satisfaction, classroom teaching practices and student learning outcomes (Anderson, et al., 1988). In the context of Egyptian education, competition among students inside schools is very high, and the teaching strategies used by teachers are more efficient and effective. This is due to the fact that the majority of Egyptian teachers work in private teaching after the end of school hours . The way to increase the financial returns from this courses is to improve the teaching process in a desire for students to reach high levels of achievement excellence. This is consistent with Heine and Hamamura (2007) and Kurman (2003) indicated that the self-efficacy of teachers increases in countries where independence is greatly emphasized. Independence means reducing educational supervision, which applies to teachers in the field of private teaching. Besides, the concept of inclusion is a relatively recent concept among Egyptian education schools. Stakeholders for educational policies in Egypt have approved a rewarding financial incentives for teachers in inclusive schools and providing them with a qualified and recent training courses. Besides that, assigning special education teachers as experts and supportive for general education teachers in each educational administration in which the inclusion is applied are provided. These external factors can lead to a shift in the teachers ’locus of control from being external to an internal where teachers believe that the outcomes are more based on aperson’s own behavior than on external sources and circumstances (Rotter, 1966). This is consistent with what Teschanen-Moran and Woolfolk-Hoy (2001) emphasized, the close association between locus of control and self-efficacy. These cultural differences in self-efficacy can be attributed to the self-enhancement needs(SEN). SEN is defined as a motivation to search for activities and social trends leading to maintaining a positive image. The motivation of Egyptian teachers to teach students with special needs in inclusive classes stems from their desire to preserve a positive image compared to the Saudi teachers. The researcher believes that the efforts of in-service teacher training in Egypt in recent years, which focused on developing the skills of teachers in the classroom, with special reference to skills in behavior management in the classroom with various groups of students, have led to an increase in teachers' belief in their ability to performing various teaching tasks with acceptance quality in different teaching situations and thus improving their level of self-efficacy. Therefore, the results seem to indicate that Egyptian teachers now generally have a stronger belief in their ability to manage diverse needs and behaviors in the classroom, design and implement educational activities to assist different learners in learning, and competence in ensuring student participation and motivation towards learning. The results of the research indicated in its answer to the second and third questions Performance. achievements or mastery experiences were the most predictable sources of self-efficacy for teachers in self-efficacy in inclusion practices, whether in Saudi Arabia or Egypt.

Formel für die zukünftige Kaufkraft: (Kaufkraft in Zukunft = Kaufkraft heute times (1+Inflationsrate)^{Anzahl der Jahre}). 3. **Bestimmen des benötigten Renteneinkommens heute**: Rechnen Sie das gewünschte zukünftige Renteneinkommen in heutige Kaufkraft um, indem Sie die Inflationsrate rückwärts anwenden. 4. **Ermittlung des benötigten Bruttoeinkommens**: Nehmen Sie das Rentenniveau von 48% an, um rückwärts zu rechnen, welches Bruttoeinkommen Sie benötigen würden, damit 48% davon Ihrem gewünschten Renteneinkommen in heutigen Werten entsprechen. # Beispiel (stark vereinfachte Annäherung): Angenommen, Sie wollen ein jährliches Renteneinkommen haben, das in heutigem Wert 20.000 Euro entspricht. 1. **Berechnen des zukünftigen Werts unter Berücksichtigung der Inflation**: - (20.000 times (1+0,035)^{27} = 20.000 times 2,322 = 46.440) Euro (zukünftiger Wert in 27 Jahren bei 3,5% Inflation jährlich). 2. **Benötigtes Bruttoeinkommen heute**, basierend auf 48% Rentenniveau: - (20.000 / 0,48 = 41.666,67) Euro jährlich netto heute benötigt. - Beachten Sie, dass dieser Wert nicht inflationsbereinigt ist, da er das heutige Äquivalent des gewünschten Renteneinkommens darstellt. 3. **Anpassung an heutige Bedingungen**: - Das Beispiel zeigt das benötigte Nettoeinkommen heute (41.666,67 Euro), um das gewünschte Renteneinkommen relativ zur angenommenen Inflation und Rentenniveau zu erreichen, nicht das Bruttoeinkommen. Die ursprüngliche Frage bezog sich auf das Nettoeinkommen, aber die Berechnung des Bruttoeinkommens würde von steuerlichen Überlegungen und Sozialversicherungsbeiträgen abhängen, die stark individuell variieren. # Wichtige Anmerkung: Diese Berechnung ist sehr vereinfacht und berücksichtigt nicht viele variables, wie z.B. steigende Lebenshaltungskosten, Änderungen im Rentensystem, persönliche Rentenbeiträge oder individuelle Steuerlasten. Es empfiehlt sich, für eine detaillierte Planung einen professionellen Finanzberater zu konsultieren."},{"instruction":"gib mir die mathematische Formel für den Punkt 4","output":"Um die mathematische Formel für Schritt 4 zu geben, bei der wir das benötigte Bruttoeinkommen (BE_needed) basierend auf dem gewünschten Nettoeinkommen (NE_desired) und einem angenommenen Rentenniveau (RL) sowie die Inflationsanpassung berechnen möchten, folgen wir einer vereinfachten Logik. Bedeutende ist hierbei, dass wir in der Vereinfachung direkt mit dem Nettoeinkommen arbeiten und dies in Beziehung zum Rentenniveau setzen. In der Realität müsste man jedoch von Bruttoeinkommen ausgehen, welches durch Sozialversicherungsbeiträge, Steuern und andere Abzüge zum Nettoeinkommen führt. Daher ist die folgende Formel eine stark vereinfachte Annäherung: Angenommen: - (NE_{desired}) = das gewünschte Nettoeinkommen heute, um nach Anpassung an die Inflation, das Rentenniveau in der Zukunft zu erreichen. - (RL) = Rentenniveau (der Prozentanteil des Bruttoeinkommens, der als Rente ausgezahlt wird, hier 48% oder 0,48). - (I) = durchschnittliche jährliche Inflationsrate (hier 3,5% oder 0,035). - (n) = Anzahl der Jahre bis zur Rente (hier 27 Jahre). Zunächst müssen wir in Schritt 4 das notwendige Bruttoeinkommen (BE_needed) herausfinden, das heute benötigt wird, um das zukünftige Renteneinkommen (RE_future), das adjustiert ist für die Inflation, basierend auf dem heutigen Wert des gewünschten Renteneinkommens (NE_desired) und dem Rentenniveau, zu erreichen. 1. **Zukünftiger Wert des gewünschten Nettoeinkommens anpassen** (wie bereits in den vorherigen Schritten gemacht): [RE_{future} = NE_{desired} times (1 + I)^n] 2. **Umwandlung in benötigtes Bruttoeinkommen heute**: Da das Rentenniveau (RL) den Prozentsatz des Bruttoeinkommens darstellt, das als Rente ausgezahlt wird, ermitteln wir das benötigte Bruttoeinkommen so, dass 48% dessen dem heutigen Wert des gewünschten zukünftigen Renteneinkommens entsprechen. Falls wir direkt von einem gewünschten zukünftigen Nettoeinkommen ausgehen, beachten Sie, dass die initial gestellte Frage und die Schritte an sich Vereinfachungen sind, um eine spezifische mathematische Operation ohne die Komplexität der tatsächlichen Renten-, Steuer- und Inflationsberechnungen zu zeigen. Um das benötigte Bruttoeinkommen (BE_needed) basierend auf dem Rentenniveau (RL) zu berechnen, verwenden wir die Formel: [BE_{needed} = frac{RE_{future}}{RL}] Ersetzen wir (RE_{future}) durch (NE_{desired} times (1 + I)^n), erhalten wir: [BE_{needed} = frac{NE_{desired} times (1 + I)^n}{RL}] Diese Formel gibt uns eine ideale Annäherung, wie viel jemand heute brutto verdienen muss, um unter Berücksichtigung eines bestimmten Rentenniveaus und der Inflation über eine bestimmte Anzahl von Jahren, ein gewünschtes Renteneinkommen zu erreichen. Dennoch möchte ich nochmals betonen, dass dies eine stark vereinfachte Berechnung ist. In realen Szenarien sind zusätzliche Faktoren wie Veränderungen in der Einkommensstruktur, Rentenbeitragsbemessungsgrenzen, steuerliche Aspekte und individuelle Rentenbeiträge zu berücksichtigen. Eine umfassende Finanzplanung ist daher empfohlen."},{"instruction":"stelle die formel vereinfacht dar, nur zum einsetzen","output":"Für eine direkte und vereinfachte Anwendung, um das benötigte Bruttoeinkommen ((BE_{needed})) zu berechnen, gegeben ein gewünschtes Nettoeinkommen ((NE_{desired})), ein Rentenniveau ((RL)), eine durchschnittliche jährliche Inflationsrate ((I)) und die Anzahl der Jahre bis zur Rente ((n)), verwenden Sie diese Formel: [BE_{needed} = frac{NE_{desired} times (1 + I)^n}{RL}] Hier sind die Variablen: - (BE_{needed}) = Benötigtes Bruttoeinkommen heute - (NE_{desired}) = Gewünschtes Nettoeinkommen heute - (I) = Durchschnittliche jährliche Inflationsrate (als Dezimalzahl, d.h. 3,5% als 0,035) - (n) = Anzahl der Jahre bis zur Rente - (RL) = Rentenniveau (als Dezimalzahl, d.h. 48% als 0,48) Setzen Sie einfach Ihre spezifischen Werte für (NE_{desired}), (I), (n), und (RL) in die Formel ein, um das benötigte Bruttoeinkommen zu berechnen, das Sie heute erreichen müssen, um Ihren gewünschten Lebensstandard im Rentenalter zu halten, angepasst um die angenommene Inflationsrate über die Jahre bis zur Rente."},{"instruction":"Meine Rente soll in 27 Jahren 1800 € betragen, die Jährliche Inflationsrate entspricht durchschnittlich 3,5 % das Rentenniveau beträgt 48% vom letzten Nettogehalt, errechne Mir mein notwendiges Nettoeinkommen.","output":"Um das notwendige Nettoeinkommen zu berechnen, das Sie heute benötigen, um in 27 Jahren eine Rente von (1.800 , text{€}) zu erhalten, und unter der Annahme einer jährlichen Inflationsrate von (3,5%) und eines Rentenniveaus von (48%), folgt die Umkehrberechnung.

Além disso, na medida em que promover a democracia pode ser uma razão, ela se enquadra mais num objetivo político específico de algumas nações e organizações. Entender outras culturas também é uma consequência valiosa de compreender a política mundial, pois isso proporciona um contexto mais amplo sobre por que países agem de certas maneiras no palco global. No entanto, os principais ênfases permanecem na navegação das complexidades da interconexão global e na compreensão do impacto direto que a política internacional tem em nossas vidas."},{"instruction":"Por que é crucial compreender a política mundial, de acordo com o texto?

У меня есть парк серверов на которых подняты Samba, mail, AD, zabbix и еще пару стандартных сервисов. Хочу оптимизировать работу свои и проектировщиков. Использую Ansible для автоматизации, сделал сайт с телефонным справочником. Так же знаю кучу технологий, таких как Docker Swarm и тп. Что можно еще придумать для меня и проектировщиков что бы автоматизировать работу","output":"Очень хорошо, что вы уже используете такие инструменты, как Ansible для автоматизации, и Docker для контейнеризации ваших приложений. Это отличная основа для оптимизации и автоматизации процессов. Вот несколько идей, которые могут помочь еще больше улучшить рабочий процесс и повысить эффективность проектировщиков: 1. **CI/CD для проектов NanoCad**: - Развертывание Continuous Integration (CI) и Continuous Delivery (CD) для проектов, над которыми работают ваши проектировщики. Это может включать автоматизацию тестирования изменений в коде, автоматизацию сборок и развертывание на тестовые/продакшн серверы. Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD или другие подобные инструменты могут быть полезны в этом. 2. **Система контроля версий для проектной работы**: - Если ваша команда еще не использует систему контроля версий, например Git, для проектных файлов NanoCad, это может стать значительным улучшением. Это позволит лучше отслеживать изменения, сотрудничать над файлами проекта и вести версионный контроль. 3. **Автоматизированная система бэкапов**: - Улучшение системы резервного копирования на основе политик, специфичных для проекта, может существенно снизить риски потери данных. Используйте инструменты для автоматизации бэкапов, например, Rsnapshot, Bacula или Duplicity. 4. **Мониторинг и оповещения**: - Усовершенствовать систему мониторинга за инфраструктурой, уведомлениями об ошибках и производительности системы. Это может включать настройку более детального мониторинга в Zabbix или интеграцию с системами оповещений, такими как Slack, Telegram или email. 5. **Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)**: - Если еще не используется, рассмотрите возможность использования VDI для предоставления проектировщикам удаленного доступа к ресурсам компании. Это позволит им работать с проектами из любого места без необходимости мощного оборудования. 6. **Скрипты для стандартизации рабочего окружения**: - Создайте скрипты Ansible или шаблоны Docker для быстрого развертывания и настройки рабочих станций или серверов проектировщиков с учетом всех необходимых инструментов и настроек. 7. **Оптимизация работы с большими файлами**: - Если работа включает использование больших файлов, оптимизация сетевых хранилищ (NAS) или настройка High-Performance Computing (HPC) кластеров может значительно ускорить процессы. 8. **Обучение и документация**: - Организуйте тренинги или создайте базу знаний для команды проектировщиков по использованию новых инструментов и процессов. Хорошо структурированная документация поможет новым сотрудникам быстрее адаптироваться и снизит количество возникающих вопросов к IT-отделу. Также, всегда привлекательным остается обратная связь от конечных пользователей. Регулярно опрашивайте проектировщиков о том, где они видят \\"узкие места\\" в своей работе и что, по их мнению, может улучшить процессы. Это поможет в приоритизации задач и реализации решений, которые действительно будут востребованы."},{"instruction":"В чем разница между ansible и teraform","output":"Ansible и Terraform – это два мощных инструмента для управления инфраструктурой, но они служат разным целям и работают по-разному.

Он использует подход \\"agentless\\", что значит, что для своей работы не требует установки дополнительных агентов на управляемые машины. Вместо этого он полагается на существующее программное обеспечение (например, SSH для Linux/Unix систем и WinRM для Windows) для выполнения команд и скриптов на удаленных серверах. **Terraform**, разработанный HashiCorp, — это инструмент для **создания, изменения и версионирования инфраструктуры** как кода. Terraform используется для управления жизненным циклом инфраструктуры в целом, от развертывания новых серверов и сервисов до их обновлений и удаления, включая облака, виртуальные машины, сетевые устройства и многое другое, используя апи провайдеров ресурсов. # Подход и Методология **Ansible** применяет императивный подход: вы описываете последовательность задач, которые необходимо выполнить для достижения желаемого состояния системы. **Terraform** использует декларативный подход. Вы описываете желаемое состояние инфраструктуры, а Terraform вычисляет, какие действия нужно предпринять для достижения этого состояния, и обеспечивает идемпотентность, то есть повторное выполнение кода не приведет к изменениям, если система уже находится в желаемом состоянии. # Менеджмент Состояний **Terraform** управляет и отслеживает состояние инфраструктуры, что позволяет выполнять последовательные изменения и отслеживать историю изменений. Для каждого проекта Terraform хранит файл состояния, который используется для отслеживания всех управляемых ресурсов. **Ansible** не управляет состоянием инфраструктуры в явной форме и не требует хранения состояний между запусками. # Целевая Аудитория и Применение **Terraform** чаще используется инженерами и архитекторами инфраструктуры для создания и управления инфраструктурой на большом масштабе. **Ansible**, с другой стороны, широко применяется системными администраторами и DevOps-инженерами для автоматизации задач по установке и настройке программного обеспечения на уже существующей инфраструктуре. # Итог Выбор между Ansible и Terraform зависит от поставленных задач. Иногда их используют вместе, где Terraform служит для развертывания и масштабирования инфраструктуры \\"с нуля\\", а Ansible — для последующей настройки и управления конфигурациями узлов. Важно понимать, что оба инструмента могут дополнять друг друга, а не конкурировать."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This depth of contemplation adds a layer of realism and complexity to the narrative, making it more relatable and engaging for the audience. Love, being a central theme in many forms of literature and entertainment, resonates with most people, and exploring the complexities of relationships can provide valuable insights into human nature and emotional intelligence. When a protagonist thoughtfully weighs their options, it demonstrates a mindful approach to decision-making, reflecting the multifaceted nature of real-life relationships. This aspect invites the audience to empathize with the protagonist's dilemma, understanding that choosing a partner involves more than just romantic feelings. It encompasses considering emotional compatibility, shared values, life goals, and the potential impact of their choice on their own well-being and happiness, as well as on the lives of the people involved. Moreover, a carefully considered decision-making process in a love triangle scenario can address themes like personal growth, responsibility, and the importance of communication and honesty in relationships. It can also explore the consequences of choices, not just for the protagonist but for all individuals involved, making the narrative more layered and thought-provoking. In summary, a love triangle that is approached with depth, considering the real implications and consequences of the protagonist's choice, can indeed be taken seriously.

Dominating the scene is an old, weathered desk, cluttered with maps that seem to span the globe, and trinkets that hint at past exploits. Right at the center, catching the eye with its peculiar contrast to the surrounding chaos, lies a remarkably preserved letter. It's sealed with a deep red wax, embossed with a symbol that seems both ancient and ominously inviting. Surrounding this central artifact are hints of the room's owner: a magnifying glass, a faded photograph of a younger Lenny beside what looks like Egyptian ruins, and a half-empty cup of tea, long cold. *Summary:* It's a languid afternoon, and Logic Lenny, a young but renowned puzzle enthusiast and amateur archaeologist, finds himself sorting through his recent mail. Among the utility bills and magazines, a peculiar letter catches his eye. The seal, the weight of the paper, the faint smell of aged parchment—it all speaks of a mystery awaiting. As he carefully breaks the seal and unfolds the letter, he discovers an invitation that could only be described as destiny's call. The letter is from an unknown benefactor, inviting him to undertake an expedition to uncover a labyrinth rumored to contain the wisdom of ancient civilizations. The letter is vague on details but clear on the promise of adventure and discovery. It hints at puzzles and trials that only a mind like Lenny's could overcome. With every word, Lenny's pulse quickens. There's no question about it; he will accept the challenge. **Scene 2: Preparation and Departure** *Image Prompt:* The scene transitions to Lenny's bedroom, where the soft glow of dawn creeps through partially drawn curtains. In contrast to the organized chaos of his study, here, everything speaks of methodical preparation. An open suitcase lies on the bed, its contents meticulously arranged: a compass, a rugged flashlight, notebooks filled with scribbles and diagrams, old maps with routes traced in faded ink, and a peculiar, antique-looking key—its relevance unknown but its importance palpable. The room around the suitcase is a snapshot of Lenny's life: shelves filled with books on cryptography, archaeology, and adventure novels; framed certificates of his achievements; and a family portrait depicting Lenny with a woman and two younger siblings, their faces a mixture of pride and concern. *Summary:* The decision made, Lenny now faces the monumental task of preparing for an adventure into the unknown. With only the cryptic clues from the letter to guide him, he selects his tools and resources with care. Each item packed carries a purpose, a memory of past challenges overcome, or a hope for what knowledge the future might hold. As morning breaks, Lenny shares his plans with his family. While his mother frets over the dangers and his younger siblings buzz with excitement and a touch of envy, Lenny explains the importance of this journey, not just for the thrill but for the chance to discover truths long buried. Resolute despite the emotional turmoil, Lenny bids farewell to his family, stepping out into the dawn's early light with his suitcase in hand. A taxi awaits to take him to the airport, the first leg of his journey into the heart of an adventure that will test every ounce of his cunning, logic, and courage. This departure is not just a physical one; it marks Lenny's crossing from the known into the realm of possibilities, challenges, and the tantalizing promise of uncovering secrets that could rewrite history."},{"instruction":"describe chapter 2","output":"# Chapter 2: The Entrance Found **Scene 1: The Hidden Door** *Image Prompt:* A dense, vibrant jungle teeming with life envelopes the scene. Sunlight filters through the thick canopy above, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. The air is thick with the sounds of distant animal calls and the close buzz of insects. At first glance, it's a seamless tapestry of green. But as the eye adjusts to the multitude of shades, a peculiar anomaly stands out—a stone structure, cleverly concealed by the surrounding vegetation, barely distinguishable from the natural landscape. An intricate door made of stone, covered in moss and vines, bears cryptic symbols that whisper of ancient secrets. It feels both inviting and foreboding, a gateway to wonders or perils untold. *Summary:* After days of navigating through dense jungles, following the cryptic clues laid out in the mysterious letter, Lenny and his hired local guide, Diego, come upon what they've been searching for—the hidden entrance to the labyrinth. Their journey to this point hasn’t been easy, facing both the challenges of the terrain and the skepticism of Diego, who's heard unnerving legends about the labyrinth. They stand before the door, silent in awe and contemplation. Lenny's heart races as he deciphers the symbols etched into the door, realizing they form a puzzle that could reveal the mechanism to unlock this ancient barrier. **Scene 2: The First Puzzle** *Image Prompt:* The scene narrows to concentrate on the door itself. Closer now, the complexity of its design becomes apparent. The stone surface is an intricate mesh of symbols, levers, and slidable panels, each element begging to be understood and manipulated. The surrounding flora seems to lean in, as if watching the intruders' attempts to unfold the door's secrets. The focus is on Lenny’s hands as they trace the symbols, his brow furrowed in concentration, a notebook in one hand filled with hastily scribbled notes and drawings. Diego looks on, skeptical but curious, as Lenny steps back, takes a deep breath, and, with a flash of insight, begins to engage with the puzzle with a newfound determination. *Summary:* The puzzle before Lenny is unlike anything he's encountered in books or his past adventures. It demands not just an understanding of the symbols, which turn out to be an ancient language lost to time, but a keen sense of logic and spatial awareness. As Lenny interacts with the puzzle, he narrates his thought process to Diego, who, despite his initial doubt, finds himself drawn into the challenge. They experiment with various combinations, facing setbacks but learning with each attempt. Finally, after what feels like an eternity, Lenny aligns the symbols in a sequence that triggers a slow, grinding sound. With bated breath, they watch as the stone door slides open, revealing the dark passage beyond. The triumph of solving the puzzle bonds Lenny and Diego closer, the shared success cementing their partnership as they stand at the threshold of the unknown. With flashlights in hand and a mix of excitement and apprehension, they step into the labyrinth, the door silently closing behind them, leaving the jungle whispers as a distant echo."},{"instruction":"3","output":"# Chapter 3: Into the Labyrinth **Scene 1: The Hall of Mirrors** *Image Prompt:* Within the labyrinth, the passage opens into an expansive hall, an immediate assault on the senses. The walls, floor, and ceiling are made of mirrors, reflecting not only Lenny and Diego but also each other into infinity. The effect is disorienting, creating a space where up seems like down, left mirrors right, and the end looks infinitely far yet eerily close. The light from their flashlights dances across surfaces, fracturing into beams that carve the air into a kaleidoscope of light and shadow. In the center, a pedestal stands with a riddle inscribed, the key to navigating through this mirrored maze without losing oneself to madness. *Summary:* Lenny and Diego step cautiously into the Hall of Mirrors, immediately overwhelmed by the endless reflections. The riddle on the pedestal hints at a path that \\"reflects not where you’ve been, but where you need to go,\\" a puzzle that challenges Lenny's logical abilities to their limits. It's not just a matter of finding the way through; the hall's design messes with their sense of direction and reality. They experiment with different approaches, following the riddle's cryptic guidance, sometimes walking straight, sometimes doubling back. Progress is a process of trial and error, each step forward mirrored by a dozen misleading paths. Eventually, Lenny discerns a pattern in the chaos—a subtle difference in the reflections that guides them through the labyrinth of mirrors. Emerging on the other side, they find themselves stronger for the ordeal, their partnership deepened by the shared struggle. **Scene 2: The Room of Echoes** *Image Prompt:* After the visual chaos of the Hall of Mirrors, the next challenge is auditory. Lenny and Diego enter a circular room, its walls curved in such a way that sound is not absorbed but amplified and echoed back, creating a cacophony of sounds from their every move and word. The room is surprisingly bare, save for a series of instruments mounted on the walls—a horn, a drum, a set of chimes, and more, each likely a piece of the puzzle they need to solve. In the midst of this auditory maze stands a solitary pillar, with instructions that hint at \\"harmony in discord and melody in silence.\\" *Summary:* Initially, the overwhelming echoes in the Room of Echoes make communication between Lenny and Diego nearly impossible. The amplified sounds of their footsteps and the echoes of their voices create a bewildering din. The key to this challenge lies in understanding the sequence of using the instruments—a task that requires both to listen beyond the noise and find the pattern that silences the cacophony. Lenny, with his knack for patterns, and Diego, who reveals a surprising musical talent, begin to experiment with the instruments. Through a process of elimination and careful listening, they discover that each instrument contributes a specific tone to a harmonious sequence that, when played correctly, quiets the room's echoes. This harmony unlocks a hidden door in the floor, opening silently to reveal a staircase leading deeper into the labyrinth. The Room of Echoes teaches them the value of listening and working in unison, a lesson they'll carry forward as the labyrinth continues to test their resolve and teamwork."},{"instruction":"4","output":"# Chapter 4: Loop-de-Loop Safari **Scene 1: The Serpentine Path** *Image Prompt:* Lenny and Diego find themselves on a bewildering path that appears to defy the laws of physics. The path is narrow and winding, surrounded by walls that subtly shift in color and pattern, suggesting movement and change. The path itself loops and twists in impossible ways, creating loops, steep drops, and sudden rises as if the very ground decided to mimic a roller coaster. The air around them seems to shimmer, hinting at hidden forces at work. The path ahead appears endless, and behind, it seems to reconfigure itself, preventing any retreat. Small, luminescent plants dot the edges of the path, their light a guide and perhaps a subtle cue to the path's secrets. *Summary:* In the Loop-de-Loop Safari, Lenny and Diego face a puzzle that tests their endurance and their willingness to embrace the illogical. As they traverse the serpentine path, they notice that their progression seems paradoxically both forward and backward. Lenny deduces that the key to navigating this path lies in understanding its nature—it's not meant to be fought against but understood and flowed with. They start noticing patterns in the luminescent plants, which seem to pulse in a sequence indicating when and where the path will loop or twist next. By predicting these changes and moving in harmony with the path’s rhythm, they manage to navigate through the Safari, each loop bringing them closer to the exit, a lesson in trust and adaptation under the most bewildering conditions. **Scene 2: The Menagerie of Paradoxes** *Image Prompt:* Beyond the Safari, Lenny and Diego enter a vast, open garden under a sky that shifts colors unnervingly. This garden, or menagerie, is filled with creatures of impossibility and paradox. There's a rabbit that disappears and reappears a few steps away every time they try to approach it, a bird that sings in silence, its song only visible as ripples in the air, and a cat that seems simultaneously asleep and awake, its eyes closed yet meeting their gazes. Each creature embodies a different logical paradox, challenging the visitors' perceptions and understandings of reality. *Summary:* The Menagerie of Paradoxes represents the labyrinth's heart, where logic meets magic, and the rules of the outside world no longer apply. The challenge here is not to solve but to understand and accept the impossibility. Lenny, with his deeply logical mind, initially struggles with the inherent contradictions presented by the menagerie. Diego, more open to the mystical and unexplainable, helps guide them through this space by encouraging Lenny to see beyond binary truths and absolutes. They interact with each paradoxical creature, learning from them lessons in accepting the unexplained and finding balance in contradiction. This revelation allows them to navigate through the menagerie, reaching its core where they find a glowing orb. This orb, the embodiment of harmony within paradox, opens the final gate leading them towards the labyrinth’s heart. The Menagerie of Paradoxes teaches them the value of questioning their perceptions and embracing the mysteries that defy explanation, preparing them for the ultimate truths awaiting in the labyrinth's depths."},{"instruction":"5","output":"# Chapter 5: The Heart of the Labyrinth **Scene 1: The Library of Lost Wisdom** *Image Prompt:* As Lenny and Diego proceed beyond the final gate, they are engulfed by a serene silence, a stark contrast to the chaotic challenges they've faced. Before them stands an awe-inspiring sight: an enormous, ancient library, its architecture a harmonious blend of various civilizations, from towering Greek columns to intricate Egyptian hieroglyphs adorning the walls. The library is filled with scrolls, books, and tablets, some seemingly hovering in mid-air, held by unseen forces. Rays of sunlight filter through stained glass windows, painting the room in vibrant hues, illuminating dust motes that dance like tiny stars in the expansive space. The silence is profound, suggesting that this place is sacred, a repository of knowledge untouched by time. *Summary:* Overwhelmed by the vastness and the beauty of the Library of Lost Wisdom, Lenny and Diego step inside with reverence. They quickly understand that this library contains not just books and scrolls but the accumulated knowledge of civilizations both known and unknown. The air is thick with an inexplicable energy, as if the library itself is alive, aware of its visitors. As they explore, they find that the library offers knowledge freely but demands respect and understanding. Each book or scroll they attempt to read presents itself in a language or symbolism initially incomprehensible, which becomes clear only when approached with genuine desire and humility. Lenny realizes that this place is the labyrinth's heart, its very reason for existing—not a treasure of gold or jewels, but of wisdom and learning. By sharing its knowledge, the library bestows upon them insights into not just history and science but the deeper truths of existence and consciousness. **Scene 2: The Keeper of the Labyrinth** *Image Prompt:* Deep within the library, amidst the quiet rustle of turning pages and the soft glow of knowledge held within endless texts, an enigmatic figure emerges from the shadows. This is the Keeper of the Labyrinth, an ageless being whose eyes hold the depth of centuries. Their appearance is an amalgamation of various cultures, with robes flowing in ethereal patterns and a gentle smile that speaks of profound wisdom and a touch of melancholy. The Keeper seems neither surprised nor concerned by Lenny and Diego's presence, welcoming them as if they were long-expected guests. The air around them shimmers slightly, suggesting that the Keeper is not entirely bound by the physical laws that govern the rest of the labyrinth. *Summary:* The Keeper welcomes Lenny and Diego, congratulating them on reaching the heart of the labyrinth. They explain that the labyrinth is not just a physical structure but a living testament to the universe's complexity and beauty. It is a guardian of knowledge, designed to challenge and enlighten those who dare to explore its depths. The Keeper reveals that many have attempted to navigate the labyrinth, but few have reached its heart with the humility and understanding that Lenny and Diego have shown. They offer insights into the questions that Lenny and Diego have gathered on their journey—answers that are profound yet open-ended, encouraging further reflection and exploration. The Keeper imparts to them a final piece of wisdom: the journey through the labyrinth is a metaphor for life's journey, filled with challenges, mysteries, and opportunities for growth and understanding. As they prepare to leave, the Keeper fades into the library's shadows, leaving behind a sense of peace and a deeper connection to the universe's wonders. Lenny and Diego emerge from the library transformed, carrying with them not just the knowledge they've gained but a newfound appreciation for the journey's importance itself."},{"instruction":"6","output":"# Chapter 6: The Journey Home **Scene 1: The Path Out** *Image Prompt:* As Lenny and Diego step out of the Library of Lost Wisdom, they find that the labyrinth around them has transformed. The once menacing and confounding passages now glow softly with a warm, guiding light.

The once cryptic symbols and puzzling obstacles now offer encouragement and affirmations of the wisdom they've acquired. The labyrinth, in its acknowledgment of their growth, becomes not a trial but a celebration of their journey. The jungle that surrounds the labyrinth's exit now appears not as a barrier, but as a vibrant embrace, welcoming them back to the world they left behind. *Summary:* The journey back through the labyrinth is a reflective one for Lenny and Diego. Each step retraces their challenges, successes, and the lessons learned, but with a newfound understanding and perspective. The labyrinth no longer feels like a mysterious entity but more like a wise mentor who has prepared them for what lies ahead. They realize that the labyrinth has served as a crucible, transforming them and equipping them with knowledge and insights that extend beyond its walls. As they approach the exit, Lenny and Diego share a moment of gratitude and camaraderie, understanding that while their journey through the labyrinth is ending, their journey through life's broader mysteries is just beginning. **Scene 2: Homecoming** *Image Prompt:* The final image is set in the early evening, with the golden hues of sunset casting a soft glow over Lenny's hometown. His family and friends have gathered outside his home, anticipation and joy evident on their faces. As Lenny and Diego emerge from the taxi, weary but radiant with the fulfillment of their adventure, they are met with cheers, hugs, and an outpouring of affection. The scene is one of reunion and celebration, with Lenny’s young siblings eagerly asking questions, his mother wiping away tears of relief, and his friends clapping him on the back with admiration. In the background, the familiar landscape of his town, intertwined with the gentle flow of everyday life, welcomes him home. *Summary:* Lenny's return home is not just a physical return but a symbolic homecoming to his roots, now enriched with the depth of experience and wisdom gained from the labyrinth. As he shares stories and insights from his journey, his loved ones listen in wonder, seeing the change in him. Lenny speaks of the challenges, the mystical Library of Lost Wisdom, the enigmatic Keeper, and the transformative power of the labyrinth. But he emphasizes the journey's guiding principle: that knowledge and wisdom are paths to greater understanding and connection, not just with the world around us but within ourselves. Diego, once a stranger and now a friend, shares his perspective, adding to the richness of the narrative. The reunion is joyous, but for Lenny, it's also a moment of realization. His adventure through the labyrinth has equipped him with invaluable insights, not just for his own future but for sharing and enriching his community. As the evening fades into night, and the stars begin to twinkle in the sky, Lenny understands that his journey, like the labyrinth itself, is a loop—a continuous path of learning, challenge, and growth.

Incluez une grande variété de légumes verts et de fruits dans votre alimentation. # 4. **Hydratation** - Assurez-vous de boire suffisamment d'eau. Parfois, le corps peut confondre la soif avec la faim, ce qui conduit à une consommation excessive. # 5. **Activité Physique** - L'alimentation doit être combinée à des exercices réguliers. Pour perdre du ventre, on recommande un mélange d'activité cardio (comme la course, la natation, le vélo) pour brûler les graisses, et des exercices de musculation, notamment des exercices ciblant les abdominaux, pour tonifier la zone. # 6. **Éviter ou Limiter** - Diminuez la consommation d'alcool et de boissons sucrées, qui contribuent à l'accumulation de graisse abdominale. - Limitez les aliments très gras ou frits, et les sources de glucides simples avec peu de valeur nutritive, comme les sucreries. # 7. **Écouter son Corps** - Apprenez à reconnaître les signes de faim et de satiété de votre corps pour éviter de manger par ennui ou par habitude. Enfin, perdre du ventre et révéler les abdominaux est souvent une question de cohérence et de patience, tant du côté de l'alimentation que de l'exercice. La clarté des objectifs et la persévérance sont clés.

Одним из альтернативных вариантов для Linux является использование X11 сервера, например, X.Org Server. Для установки X.Org Server на большинстве дистрибутивов Linux есть специальные инструкции, которые можно найти на официальных сайтах дистрибутивов или в документации. Если вам все же нужно specifically Xming на Linux, вы можете попробовать использовать среду совместимость Microsoft Windows (Wine), но установка и использование Xming в таком случае может быть нестабильным. Если вы хотите просто использовать графический интерфейс на Linux, то стандартно он уже включен в большинстве дистрибутивов и не требует дополнительных установок."},{"instruction":"какая может быть альтернатива mpi_gatherv; bcast чтобы собрать вектора по кускам из всех процессов и скопировать во все но одной операцией","output":"Есть несколько альтернативных методов, которые можно использовать для сбора векторов по кускам из всех процессов и их копирования во все, но одной операцией: 1. Использование функции MPI_Allgather: MPI_Allgather позволяет всем процессам обмениваться данными между собой. Каждый процесс отправляет данные во все другие процессы. Этот метод может быть использован для сбора и копирования векторов по кускам из всех процессов. 2. Использование функции MPI_Reduce и MPI_Bcast: Сначала можно использовать функцию MPI_Reduce для суммирования/конкатенации данных со всех процессов в одном процессе. Затем с помощью функции MPI_Bcast можно скопировать данные из этого процесса во все остальные. Таким образом, можно собрать и скопировать векторы по кускам из всех процессов за две операции. 3. Использование пользовательской комбинированной операции MPI_Op: Вы можете определить пользовательскую операцию, которая выполняет необходимые операции для сбора и копирования данных. Затем используйте функцию MPI_Allreduce с этой пользовательской операцией для достижения желаемого результата. Каждый из этих методов имеет свои преимущества и ограничения, поэтому выбор зависит от вашей конкретной задачи и требований."},{"instruction":"как одной операцией на mpi собрать все вектора разных размеров и разместить во всех","output":"Для сбора векторов разных размеров и их размещения по всем процессам одной операцией в MPI, вы можете воспользоваться функцией MPI_Gatherv. Эта функция позволяет собирать данные различной длины из всех процессов и отправлять их на один процесс. Затем вы можете использовать MPI_Bcast для отправки собранных данных обратно на все процессы. Пример использования MPI_Gatherv: \`\`\`c int *sendbuf; // данные для отправки из каждого процесса int *recvbuf; // данные для приема на корневом процессе int *displs; // сдвиг для каждого процесса int *recvcounts; // количество элементов от каждого процесса int root = 0; // корневой процесс для сбора // инициализация sendbuf // инициализация recvcounts и displs для каждого процесса // рассылка данных из каждого процесса на корневой процесс MPI_Gatherv(sendbuf, sendcount, MPI_INT, recvbuf, recvcounts, displs, MPI_INT, root, MPI_COMM_WORLD); if (rank == root) { // отправка данных обратно на все процессы MPI_Bcast(recvbuf, total_recvcount, MPI_INT, root, MPI_COMM_WORLD); } \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что в этом примере \`sendbuf\` содержит данные, которые каждый процесс отправляет, \`recvbuf\` - данные, которые соберутся на корневом процессе, \`recvcounts\` и \`displs\` - массивы, которые содержат количество элементов и сдвиги для каждого процесса соответственно. Кроме того, \`root\` - это ранг корневого процесса, а \`total_recvcount\` - общее количество данных для отправки обратно на все процессы."},{"instruction":"阅读下面的评论，总结大家对当前股票的评价，条数不超过15条；并总结；如果有有用的信息，请告诉我： 评论内容 评论时间 股性太差了留下底仓 2024-03-18 11:56:39 广联达(SZ002410) 2024-03-18 16:25:47 明天开始连板上20 2024-03-18 15:03:17 卖飞了宁德时代，爱美客，玩了个寂寞 2024-03-18 14:56:04 羞不羞，别人大涨，你不涨！真信球！ 2024-03-18 14:44:48 大胆低吸 2024-03-18 10:14:19 大盘涨疯了，你在吃吗 2024-03-18 14:01:01 这个股，得过几天才涨 2024-03-18 14:28:37 明天直接跌破13！但是我还是看中他的长期投资价值！赞 2024-03-18 14:10:20 光连跌 2024-03-18 14:02:44 今天把其他股全出了，就等你回踩30日线，准备今年就了。大家别急，随着大盘回调 2024-03-18 11:16:03 你们还是祈求明天地产板块涨 2024-03-18 13:39:59 都说了这个股跟地产，你们看房地产今天压根还是绿的，云计算也没跟 2024-03-18 13:39:23 云计算投资指南05：云计算股票长牛如云 2024-03-17 14:05:58 你他哥哥的到底跟谁 2024-03-18 12:57:34 兄弟们谁进广联达谁死千万不要进来 2024-03-18 12:24:00 下午，明天不突破14，短期上不去了。大盘下挫庄股还会打压下来吸筹。只能反复T 2024-03-18 11:04:27 又是无量的一天。开启下跌趋势咯 2024-03-18 09:41:00 前两天谁说跟云计算不跟房地产？？ 2024-03-18 11:08:30 我满仓干了！ 2024-03-18 10:57:07 这票股性太差，一天最多涨幅5-6个点，冬眠中 2024-03-18 10:39:53 根本买不完根本卖不完[好困惑] 2024-03-18 10:44:20 这庄太恶了 2024-03-18 10:25:39 僵尸 2024-03-18 10:37:10 现在驻底阶段。毕竟分红期要到了。柱体拉伸 2024-03-18 10:08:53 纯粹就是烂股，一天天的就知道一股劲的跌[怒][怒][怒][怒] 2024-03-18 09:52:10 远离垃圾，纯粹浪费时间 2024-03-18 10:00:15 技术面一般，先换其他弹性好的股了 2024-03-18 09:55:40 量化量化量化 2024-03-18 09:42:00 什么意思啊 2024-03-18 09:39:46 拉伊裤兜子 2024-03-18 09:38:30 该股估计最多14块多 2024-03-17 19:24:22 明天大涨特涨。超跌反弹，人工智能有广联达的份 2024-03-17 23:49:54 广联达：连续8日融资净买入累计7703.58万元（03-15） 2024-03-18 08:53:42 6万股买一季度业绩大增水电002039能赚钱吗？牛市哦 2024-03-16 18:35:36 如果是闲钱又没有时间看盘，现在买入此股，持股一年的收益会比任何理财产品的收益高， 2024-03-15 21:31:44 想不到曾经65元股会跌到十几元 2024-03-17 12:39:27 002410 广联达 2024-03-17 21:59:03 小白问下，广联达明明不是算力概念，为什么股吧里面好多算力的帖子？广联达和算力也没 2024-03-17 15:30:36 转载长文读懂广联达的盈利模式 2024-03-15 09:21:36 云计算投资指南04：主要股票分析 2024-03-17 14:03:48 云计算投资指南03：高速成长期 2024-03-17 14:02:54 智能建造新质生产力 2024-03-14 16:52:53 垃圾太能跌了，最多反弹20 2024-03-16 21:59:19 年年都有分红的好公司为什么受不到机构青睐啊？搞不懂[为什么] 2024-03-17 02:22:27 建筑类软件也跟着房地产一起下行了 2024-03-16 22:55:12 不明白的是：高瓴资本看中的是什么？竟然进了这股并且还没走。当初投资腾讯京东的眼力 2024-03-15 23:37:21 广联达北方长龙的老铁们你们很快要发财了，拭目以待 2024-03-06 13:24:27 我也晒晒，操作不好还要多学习，已满小广不解释[得意] 2024-03-16 11:34:45 还好，今天居然也能盈利，晚上 2024-03-15 15:09:29 今天结束 2024-03-15 14:45:37 今天买入，应该会有一波。 2024-03-15 19:15:38 走了 2024-03-15 14:07:01 这个操作怎么样兄弟们，几分钟搞了2000块 2024-03-15 09:42:26 喊涨停的都是靠害坑人，这货只会套人！那有机会放高买进的股民出生天 2024-03-15 19:31:58 必后来居上，下周发力，拭目以待！！！！ 2024-03-15 14:41:56 1.6w到账 2024-03-15 15:02:33 翻红就ok 2024-03-15 14:50:54 这还能绿油油，啊 2024-03-15 14:37:13 你昨天从来科大讯飞出买你，去到那里就黑到那 2024-03-15 14:27:18 成本三十，怎么办？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？？ 2024-01-08 12:45:41 先看到15 2024-03-15 14:32:19 能翻红吗？兄弟们 2024-03-15 13:54:05 走了，中的战斗机 2024-03-15 14:25:27 这支票长期持有拿稳了随时起飞我说的 2024-03-15 14:23:02 被量化了，唉[惨!关灯吃面] 2024-03-15 14:22:06 散户真的钱多，还拼命接盘。 2024-03-15 13:35:55 指数带起来的没有持续性 2024-03-15 13:57:14 五连跌开启[偷笑] 2024-03-15 13:52:03 是我连累了你们，53买的 2024-03-15 12:35:12 托单现，快跑。 2024-03-15 13:28:17 怂 2024-03-15 13:24:52 今天和昨天一怂样，一直跌下来的[成交][成交][怒][怒][怒]真他娘的没有让人 2024-03-15 13:14:48 无能 2024-03-15 13:20:03 …… 2024-03-15 13:19:48 …… 2024-03-15 13:18:59 冲啊 2024-03-15 13:09:52 行业发展历程概述|智研产业百科——BIM 2024-03-15 13:08:31 这股小散在这个价位莫去管庄股是否洗盘，出货？只需达到6成仓每天拿出五分之一的量反 2024-03-15 11:48:39 我有一个想法，突破14.36再去建仓或者加仓，慢慢瞧吧 2024-03-15 11:20:27","output":"综合大家对当前股票的评价，可以得出以下结论： 1. 股性较差，持有底仓。 2. 大家对该股未来涨幅有不同看法，在底部等待。 3. 存在长期投资价值，有人认为股价可能会涨。 4. 情绪波动大，投资者情绪不稳定。 5. 有人看好未来发展，认为有望发财，但也有人认为是僵尸股。 6. 存在负面情绪，认为是烂股或垃圾股。 7. 有人指出股票技术面一般，建议换其他表现更好的股票。 8. 有人对股票的量化处理表示担忧。 9. 存在关于该股票未来涨幅的不确定性。 10. 不同投资者对于广联达股票的未来走势有不同的看法，建议持续关注和研究。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Let's start with a simple C++ program. This program will take two numbers as input from the user, add those numbers, and then output the result. This example demonstrates basic C++ input/output, variables, and arithmetic operation. **Program: Add Two Numbers** \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> using namespace std; int main() { // Declare variables to store input numbers and the result int num1, num2, sum; // Ask the user to enter the first number cout << \\"Enter the first number: \\"; cin >> num1; // Ask the user to enter the second number cout << \\"Enter the second number: \\"; cin >> num2; // Calculate the sum of num1 and num2 sum = num1 + num2; // Display the result cout << \\"The sum of \\" << num1 << \\" and \\" << num2 << \\" is \\" << sum << \\".\\" << endl; return 0; } \`\`\` **Explanation:** - \`#include <iostream>\`: This line includes the I/O (Input/Output) stream library in our program, which is necessary for using \`cin\` and \`cout\`. - \`using namespace std;\`: This line tells the compiler to use the standard (\`std\`) namespace. It allows us to write \`cout\` and \`cin\` instead of \`std::cout\` and \`std::cin\`. - The \`main()\` function is the starting point of any C++ program. - \`int num1, num2, sum;\`: Here, we declare three integer variables to store the two input numbers and the result of their addition. - \`cout\` is used for output, and \`cin\` is used for input. The \`<<\` operator is used with \`cout\` to send the output to the console, and the \`>>\` operator is used with \`cin\` to get the input from the user. - We use basic arithmetic operation (\`+\`) to add the two numbers. - Finally, we display the calculated sum. To run this program: 1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (like GCC, Clang, or MSVC). 2. Open your favorite text editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and paste this code. 3. Save the file with a \`.cpp\` extension, for example, \`add_two_numbers.cpp\`. 4. Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your file is saved, and compile the program. Compilation command depends on the compiler. For GCC, the command is \`g++ -o add_two_numbers add_two_numbers.cpp\`. 5. Run the compiled program. If you're using GCC and a Unix-like operating system, the command might be \`./add_two_numbers\`. If you're on Windows, you'd just type \`add_two_numbers\`. This is a very basic example to get you started. C++ is a powerful and complex language, and this scratches only the very surface of what's possible."},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello!

Составляй правильно предложения, пиши без ошибок! Пиши от первого лица. Пиши эмоционально с раздражением про невыносимые условия. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера: Серый автосалон, один из многих в Иркутске. Жаль. Ничего такого про них не думал. Оставил заявку на обратный звонок, чтобы пообщаться по поводу заинтересовавшей Элантры за два миллиона. Попытки расспросить по телефону об условиях кредита, наличия авто в салоне и является ли цена окончательной ни к чему не привели. Пригласили приехать по записи. Уже с неохотой добрался все-таки до них ну и на этом все закончилось. Хендаи привозят по предоплате, условия, возможно, но почти очевидно спецом такие, чтобы клиент задумался. Склоняясь к отказу и тут из кустов выпрыгивает очень уверенный в себе новый менеджер и пытается раскрутить на Ладу, которая вот она, стоит в салоне. Кредиты дорогие, мне совсем ничего не понравилось и я лично считаю таких дилеров серыми. Бойки продажи авто из наличия клиенту, привлеченному рекламой и выращивание неподъёмных кредитов, при которых стоимость авто взлетает втрое. Такое себе. Нечего ловить, кроме развода.","output":"1. Вот уж никогда бы не подумал, что попадусь на такие уловки в салоне Юг Центр Авто. Вся история началась с моего интереса к новой Toyota Camry, которую я увидел на их сайте. Цена казалась привлекательной, но когда я приехал в салон, чтобы всё обсудить лично, меня ждал сюрприз. Оказалось, что указанная цена актуальна только при условии покупки дополнительного набора полностью ненужных опций! К моему ужасу и разочарованию, никак не мог добиться прямого ответа от менеджеров. В итоге, вместо обещанной машины мне пытались втюхать что-то совершенно не стоящее внимания, да еще и в кредит под астрономические проценты! Вся эта история превратилась в настоящий кошмар. Обидно и раздражает, что время потрачено зря. 2. Испорченный вечер и потерянные нервы – вот мой результат посещения салона Юг Центр Авто. Планировал приглядеть новенький Ford Mustang, да так, чтобы условия были ясны, как белый день. Но нет, оказалось это слишком сложно для персонала данного автосалона. Вместо чётких и понятных ответов на мои вопросы, меня кормили обещаниями и перенаправляли от одного менеджера к другому. Цена на сайте и реальность, как всегда, две большие разницы. Ожидал увидеть профессионализм, а столкнулся с хаосом и тотальной некомпетентностью. Не рекомендую тратить своё время на этот салон. 3. Ещё не сталкивался с таким непрофессионализмом и халатностью, как в салоне Юг Центр Авто. Мечтал обновить свою машину и положил глаз на новенький Volkswagen Passat, но все мои мечты разбились о жёсткую реальность. Прибыл по записи, а встретили меня так, будто я попросил бесплатно её отдать. Недопустимо долгое ожидание, игнорирование моих вопросов и невероятная навязчивость менеджера с предложениями явно невыгодных мне вариантов. При цене, которая в итоге оказалась гораздо выше изначальной, от покупки пришлось отказаться. Очень неприятный опыт, исключительно разочарован. 4. Невероятно! Как можно так вести бизнес?! Юг Центр Авто превзошёл все мои ожидания в худшую сторону. Моим выбором стал Nissan Qashqai. Но увы, стоимость авто в салоне не соответствовала заявленной на сайте – она была значительно выше из-за \\"необходимых\\" аксессуаров, которые на самом деле были мне не нужны. Персонал настолько навязчив, что чувствуешь себя в ловушке. Пытался донести свою позицию, но в ответ лишь слышал фразы о том, как я упускаю выгодное предложение. Сервис явно оставляет желать лучшего, а ощущение дискомфорта не покидает ни на секунду. Забыть бы этот неприятный опыт. 5. Покупка автомобиля в салоне Юг Центр Авто – настоящее испытание для нервов и терпения. Отважился на данный шаг в надежде приобрести Mercedes-Benz GLC-Class, но в итоге получил лишь раздражение и разочарование. Виден явный разрыв между обещаниями персонала и действительностью. Обсуждаемая цена внезапно \\"растёт\\" прямо на глазах из-за всяческих \\"важных\\" пакетов услуг, которые в действительности кажутся сомнительной необходимостью. Менеджеры кидаются на клиентов, словно акулы, пытаясь впарить что угодно. Им явно не до твоих пожеланий, главное – выудить больше денег. Отрицательный опыт, категорически не советую."},{"instruction":"Soy vigilante de seguridad en eulen con centro de trabajo en normon.

Quiero comenzar destacando mi compromiso y dedicación en el desempeño de mis funciones como vigilante de seguridad para Eulen en Normon. Siempre he asumido mis responsabilidades con seriedad y he procurado cumplir con las tareas asignadas de la manera más eficaz posible. Respecto al incidente mencionado, deseo señalar que, contrario a lo que se afirma en la sanción, efectivamente realicé las rondas requeridas durante la noche del suceso. Sin embargo, me encontré con dificultades para registrar dichas rondas debido a que la aplicación de SegurEulen en mi dispositivo no se encuentra actualizada para operar en Normon 1, aspecto que se ha comunicado previamente a la administración sin haber recibido una solución hasta el momento. Es importante mencionar que mi actividad durante la jornada en cuestión puede ser corroborada mediante las grabaciones de las cámaras de seguridad, en las cuales se me observa recorriendo las áreas críticas y relevantes del centro de trabajo. Esto evidencia mi presencia activa en el área y mi compromiso con la seguridad de las instalaciones. Además, deseo resaltar que, a pesar de mis esfuerzos por familiarizarme con el entorno de Normon 1 tras el cambio desde Normon 2, no he recibido la orientación adecuada sobre la ubicación exacta de todos los puntos de fichaje. Esto ha dificultado mi capacidad para efectuar un registro completo de las rondas, lo cual, en parte, contribuyó a la situación inesperada del incidente de fuga. A la luz de estos hechos, solicito respetuosamente que se considere la posibilidad de eliminar la sanción impuesta o, en su defecto, modificarla por una falta leve o un aviso comunicativo sin carácter legal. Creo firmemente que esta medida sería más justa y proporcional, dadas las circunstancias y las limitaciones que he enfrentado. Estoy a su disposición para discutir esta solicitud en mayor detalle y proporcionar cualquier información adicional que pueda requerir.

Составляй правильно предложения, пиши без ошибок! Пиши от первого лица. Пиши эмоционально с раздражением про невыносимые условия. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера: Что это за салон такой! Ужас! Думают раз девушка, то и в машинах не разбираюсь и можно меня обманывать спокойно? У меня пока зарплата небольшая, ну и искала где подешевле. Вот нашла, оказалось не дешевле. К базовой заявленной цене приплюсовывают без согласования дополнительные всякие штуки. Быстренько-быстренько стараются это все документально оформить и постоянно успокаивают, что в кредит выгодно и я всего этого оборудования в итоге при оплате не замечу. Но это же не так!!!!! Они слишком дорого все это продают, а без согласия моего вообще незаконно так делать! Жаловаться не буду, противно. Но и советовать не стану. Нет бы честно работать, да у них сейчас хотя бы по средней цене авто с руками отберут, но нет, надо обмануть обязательно, навязать что-то. Хотя о чем это я, конечно, кто-то да найдется, кто поведется. Пофиг на репутацию, закроются или переменяются. А денежки не пахнут. Просто будте осторожны, поняла, что отзывы читать надо обязательно, толко не на сайте самого автосалона Автоколизей или любого другого, а нормальные и честные.","output":"1. Никогда бы не подумал, что столкнусь с такой нерадивостью! Пришел в Юг Центр Авто за автомобилем, а вышел оттуда обиженный и разочарованный. Продавцы видели во мне только источник денег и пытались навязать кучу ненужных мне опций, увеличивая стоимость покупки! И не думайте, что они достаточно тонко это делают — о нет, все как на базаре, в лоб и агрессивно. Уже дома, просматривая документы, я понял, как меня обманули. На душе кошки скребут от такого обращения с клиентами. 2. Просто кошмар, что происходит в салоне Юг Центр Авто! Представляете, при покупке автомобиля меня заверили, что все включено в итоговую стоимость. А по факту, оказалось, что за каждую мелочь придется доплачивать. И как это у них получается, постоянно что-то навязывать? Переплата вышла огромная, а объяснить это никто нормально не смог. Просто попали на деньги! После такого опыта сюда ногой больше не ступлю и другим советую обходить стороной. 3. Честно, за всю мою жизнь я не видел хуже сервиса, чем в Юг Центр Авто. Обещали одно, а на деле получилось совсем другое! Подняли стоимость автомобиля в последний момент, якобы из-за \\"внезапно появившихся\\" обязательных услуг. Все эти услуги мне были как мертвому припарки, но деньги пришлось заплатить. О разрешении моем спрашивать забыли напрочь. Больше всего меня злит, что на мой вопрос о причинах такого подхода, получил лишь отписки. Не советую сюда обращаться, только нервы потратите. 4. Такого разочарования, как от покупки в Юг Центр Авто, я еще не испытывал! Помимо того, что процесс затянули на несколько часов, так еще и счет в последний момент оказался значительно выше изначального. Причем, пояснить, за что именно доплата, так и не смогли. Мне показалось, или они действительно думают, что могут безнаказанно обманывать своих клиентов? Про профессионализм сотрудников я вообще молчу - полное отсутствие компетенции. Я в шоке и никому не рекомендую попадаться в такую же ситуацию. 5. После похода в Юг Центр Авто у меня осталось масса негативных эмоций. Честно, такого безобразия я давно не встречал. Сначала все казалось нормальным, но когда дело дошло до оплаты, начался полный крах. Дополнительные услуги, о которых я не просил, были включены в счет без моего ведома. Обратиться куда-либо с жалобой бесполезно — отдел по работе с клиентами просто игнорирует попытки связаться. Ощущение, что здесь работают только ради того, чтобы вытянуть с тебя как можно больше денег. Самое ужасное, что о способах обмана ни слова до самого момента подписания документов. Печальный опыт, не пожелал бы никому."},{"instruction":"“Logic Lenny’s Labyrinth: The Loop-de-Loop Safari” write the story outline with two scence in each chapter image prompt also of a every scence","output":"# Story Title: Logic Lenny's Labyrinth: The Loop-de-Loop Safari Chapter 1: The Mysterious Map - **Scene 1: The Discovery** *Image Prompt*: An old, worn map sprawled on a rustic wooden table, under the focused gaze of a young boy wearing glasses.

Составляй правильно предложения, пиши без ошибок! Пиши от первого лица. Пиши эмоционально с раздражением про невыносимые условия. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера:В стремлении купить очень дешево, можно прогадать и купить машину гораздо дороже чем возможно на авторынке. Данный салон – этому подтверждение. Меня привлек Nissan Qashqai в самой простой комплектации LE, так как там была самая низкая цена, чем у всех остальных 1млн. 730 тысяч. Теперь я понимаю, что был расчет именно на это. Мне показали машину, она мне понравилась. Я уже и заявку на кредит подал взнос подготовил за машину. Но тут менеджер ушел со смены, пришлось ждать другого. Когда через час пришел другой – разобрались что да как, то вдруг оказалось, что машина забронирована уже кем-то. Я был в шоке, но мне предложили вариант с доставкой машины со удаленного склада. Нужно было внести задаток – внес 140 тысяч. Через неделю привезли комплектацию LE Coffee по цене 2млн.750 тысяч. С трудом добился возврата хотя бы половины задатка.","output":"1. Я ждал этот момент месяцами, наконец-то скопил нужную сумму и пошел в салон Юг Центр Авто за долгожданным автомобилем. Выбрал себе Ford Focus, привлекла адекватная цена. Но, как выяснилось, не все так радужно. После того, как я подписал все документы и внес первый взнос, они вдруг заявили, что нужно доплатить за страховку и дополнительное оборудование, о чем ранее речь не шла! Я был в ярости, чувствовал себя обманутым. Это был настоящий кошмар, я потратил кучу времени и нервов, чтобы разобраться, и в итоге вышел из сделки, потеряв немалую сумму. 2. Горела идея приобрести новую машину из салона, и выбор мой пал на Юг Центр Авто. О так, как я пожалел! Обещали Hyundai Solaris по супер выгодной цене, однако в итоге оказалось, что цена за базовую модель без всяких опций. Добавить нормальное оборудование? +30% к стоимости! Потребовали доплатить за \\"эксклюзивный\\" цвет, хоть я и выбрал самый обычный белый. Про сервис и говорить нечего – хамство и игнорирование моих запросов. Мой совет – обходите стороной этот автосалон! 3. В салоне Юг Центр Авто я испытал настоящий стресс. Хотел купить Toyota Camry, но вся процедура превратилась в бюрократический ад. Сначала согласовали одну цену, когда пришел платить, оказалось, что цена внезапно \\"подросла\\" на 200 тысяч! Аргументы продавцов были настолько абсурдны, что сложно было сдержать гнев. Из-за постоянных задержек и переносов даты доставки, пришлось отказаться от покупки. Потерянное время и разбитые надежды – вот что я получил от сотрудничества с этим автосалоном. 4. Никогда не думал, что покупка автомобиля может превратиться в кошмар, но Юг Центр Авто доказал обратное. Решил приобрести Volkswagen Polo, думал, что все будет просто. Как бы не так! Подписал предварительный договор, внес задаток, а через неделю мне сообщают, что автомобиль, который я выбрал, вдруг стал стоить на 250 тысяч больше! Испытал шок и огромное разочарование. Пытался добиться возврата денег, но в итоге забрал только часть - процессуальная волокита и бесконечные оправдания менеджеров выматывают. 5. Попытка купить машину в Юг Центр Авто обернулась полной катастрофой. Мечтал о Mazda 6, но с этим салоном мечты рухнули. Сначала все казалось нормально, но когда дело дошло до оплаты, начались \\"сюрпризы\\". Дополнительные платежи за страховку, за подготовку авто к продаже – список был бесконечен. И когда я, наконец, получил машину, оказалось, что в ней не работает кондиционер. Обращение в сервис – бесполезно, меня постоянно отфутболивали. В итоге, моя радость от покупки нового авто превратилась в серию разочарований и походов по инстанциям."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

For Dawn, camping wasn't just about being outdoors, it was about feeling a deep connection to the world around her, a way to recharge and remember what was actually important."},{"instruction":"what's something that generates gravity through gyration?","output":"A concept that generates gravity through gyration, or spinning motion, is based on the principle of artificial gravity, often depicted in science fiction. In space, where the absence of gravity affects human health, creating a centrifugal force by rotating a spacecraft or a space station can simulate gravity. This concept is not just the realm of science fiction but has foundations in physics, specifically in the principle of centrifugal force. When a habitat or a section of a spacecraft is spun around an axis, everything inside is pushed outward, and this outward force can simulate the effects of gravity on the inhabitants. This idea has been proposed for long-duration spaceflights, to Mars, for example, where maintaining the health of the crew in a zero-gravity environment is a concern. Through gyration, or rotation, an environment can be created that mimics the gravitational pull of Earth, helping to preserve muscle mass, bone density, and other aspects of health affected by weightlessness."},{"instruction":"is there an example other than a planet","output":"Yes, an example of generating gravity through gyration other than a planet is the concept of a rotating space station or spacecraft. This idea has been a significant point of interest both in scientific research and science fiction literature. The most famous conceptual model for such a structure is the Stanford Torus, a design that emerged from studies at NASA's Ames Research Center in the 1970s. The Stanford Torus proposes a donut-shaped ring that would rotate around a central hub. The rotation of the ring would create centrifugal force, which would push objects and people toward the outer edge of the torus, simulating the effects of gravity. The concept envisions a living space on the inner surface of the ring where people could live and work as if they were subject to Earth's gravity. This approach to creating artificial gravity would allow for more comfortable and sustainable long-term human habitation in space by mitigating some of the adverse health effects of prolonged weightlessness, such as muscle atrophy and bone density loss. While the Stanford Torus and similar designs, like the O'Neill Cylinder and the Bernal Sphere, have not been built, they continue to influence ideas and plans for future space habitats."},{"instruction":"Write me a prompt for an Image Creator (with regard for it's restrictions) to make an image of an 18 year old Filipino Australian girl.

Una formula booleana è soddisfacibile se esiste almeno una assegnazione di verità alle sue variabili che la renda vera. L'algoritmo DPLL è particolarmente importante perché SAT è considerato il problema centrale della teoria della computabilità e della logica computazionale, essendo il primo problema per cui è stata dimostrata la NP-completezza. Una KB (Knowledge Base o Base di Conoscenza) è soddisfacibile mediante l’uso della DPLL se e solo se esiste almeno un'assegnazione di verità per le sue variabili che renda tutte le clausole (o affermazioni) che la compongono vere simultaneamente. In altre parole, la KB deve essere esprimibile sotto forma di una formula booleana (o un insieme di clausole) per cui l'algoritmo DPLL possa essere applicato per verificare la soddisfacibilità. L'algoritmo DPLL migliora sull'algoritmo di Davis-Putnam eliminando alcune inefficienze e aggiungendo due importanti concetti per rendere più efficiente la ricerca di una soluzione: 1. **Unit Propagation**: Se in una formula compare una clausola che è un \\"unit\\" (contiene un'unica variabile non ancora assegnata), allora quel valore deve essere assegnato alla variabile in modo tale da rendere vera la clausola. 2. **Literal Pure**: Se una variabile appare nella formula sempre con lo stesso valore (vero o falso), allora può essere assegnata di conseguenza senza cambiare il valore di verità della formula complessiva. Il processo DPLL termina quando: - Trova un'assegnazione di verità che soddisfa tutte le clausole (la KB è soddisfacibile). - Dimostra che non esiste alcuna assegnazione di verità che possa soddisfare tutte le clausole (la KB non è soddisfacibile). Se la procedura individua che la KB è soddisfacibile, allora si può dire che la base di conoscenza non contiene contraddizioni interne e possiede almeno un modello (una interpretazione in cui tutte le affermazioni sono vere) nel mondo descritto dalle sue asserzioni."},{"instruction":"Son 2 yıl içerisinde , Türkiyede yatırım yapan yabancı firmalar hangileridir ?

entities (such as words or phrases) mentioned in a JSON file with their visual representations in an image, as detected and transcribed by OCR into a CSV file. The goal is to find, for each entity, the corresponding bounding box (a rectangle surrounding the text) in the image and then draw these boxes with annotations. Here's a detailed workflow of how the code operates and how it utilizes the \`is_nearby\` function: 1. **Preprocessing**: Entities (words or phrases) are cleaned by removing commas and leading/trailing spaces. 2. **Finding Matches**: - \`find_potential_matches\`: For individual words, potential matches are found in the OCR data based on a fuzzy string matching score (using \`fuzz.ratio\` from \`thefuzz\` library), which measures the similarity between the entity word and the OCR text. 3. **Assessing Sequences**: - **Multi-Token Entities**: For phrases or multi-token entities, the process involves identifying sequences of bounding boxes that correspond to each token of the entity. For this, the \`process_multi_token_entity\` function is used: - It splits the entity into tokens and retrieves potential matches for each token. - Utilizing heuristics (\`find_best_sequence_heuristic\`), it attempts to find the sequence of bounding boxes that best represents the multi-token entity in terms of proximity and sequence. However, this approach is refined further in the code to avoid reusing parts of bounding boxes that have already been used for the same entity (\`get_next_best_sequence\`). - The \`is_nearby\` function can be effectively utilized within heuristics for identifying the best sequence by prioritizing boxes that are close to each other (as determined by a customizable proximity score and maximum allowed distance). This would ensure that tokens forming a single entity are spatially cohesive on the page, enhancing the accuracy of matched sequences for multi-token entities. 4. **Merging Bounding Boxes**: After determining the best sequence of bounding boxes for multi-token entities, these boxes are merged into a single bounding box that encompasses all tokens of the entity (\`merge_boxes\`). 5. **Handling Single and Multi-Token Entities Differently**: The code distinguishes between processing single-token and multi-token entities, applying respective logic to match them accurately with their bounding boxes. 6. **Special Handling for Specific Sections**: The code introduces a mechanism to handle specific sections of the document in a different manner if required (for example, reverse scanning the data for certain sections). 7. **Drawing Bounding Boxes**: Finally, \`draw_bounding_boxes\` utilizes the annotated bounding boxes for each entity and draws them on the image, highlighting where each entity can be found visually. The \`is_nearby\` function, crucial for assessing proximity in the multi-token processing logic, allows the incorporation of spatial analysis into the matching process, enhancing the algorithm's ability to accurately associate textual data from the OCR with the corresponding elements of the image. It embodies a smart strategy for ensuring that matched parts of a sequence (tokens) are not just randomly scattered across the page but are actually close enough to each other, respecting the visual and logical flow of text as humans would interpret it."},{"instruction":"Utilize is_nearby function in code","output":"To utilize the \`is_nearby\` function within your code, especially in the context of processing multi-token entities, you can integrate it into your heuristic for finding the best sequence of matches. This will allow the code to preferentially select bounding boxes that are spatially close to each other, accounting for the physical layout of text in an image, which is particularly important for accurately reconstructing multi-token entities from OCR data. Since your original code and explanation do not directly show where \`is_nearby\` is used, I'll demonstrate how to incorporate it into the \`process_multi_token_entity\` function. We'll modify the \`find_best_sequence_heuristic\` function for clarity and practicality, renaming it to incorporate proximity checks directly. Here's how you could refactor the \`process_multi_token_entity\` function along with a proximity-based approach for sequence finding: \`\`\`python def find_best_sequence_with_proximity(matches_list): \\"\\"\\" Identifies the best sequence of matches that are also nearby each other.

This behavior could be tweaked according to specific requirements, such as skipping tokens or enforcing strict proximity. This integration showcases how spatial analysis (via the \`is_nearby\` function) can be embedded into the logic of reconstructing textual data from OCR outputs, enhancing the overall accuracy and reliability of entity extraction and bounding box association in complex documents."},{"instruction":"Write the code Utilize is_nearby function before merge_boxes function and if condition fails then use next best sequence and draw bounding box with next best sequence","output":"To incorporate the \`is_nearby\` function effectively before the \`merge_boxes\` function, and to fall back on the next best sequence if the proximity condition fails, you will need to adjust your approach to finding the best matching sequence of bounding boxes for multi-token entities. This involves iterating through potential matches for each token, checking their proximity, and, if the initial best sequence doesn't meet the proximity criteria, finding and using the next-best sequence that does. The explanation given below will slightly adjust the structure to implement this logic: 1. **Finding Sequences with Proximity Checks**: This involves iterating through combinations of matches to find those where each part of the sequence is nearby the previous part. 2. **Fallback to Next Best Sequence**: If the initially identified best sequence doesn't meet the proximity criteria, the next best sequence should be found and used. Since Python's itertools module doesn't inherently support finding the second or third best product combination based on custom conditions like proximity, we'll need to manually implement logic to evaluate and select suitable sequences. Here's an illustrative approach: \`\`\`python from itertools import product def find_sequence_with_proximity(all_potential_matches, max_distance=30): \\"\\"\\" Finds the best sequence of matches that are also nearby each other, according to the 'is_nearby' function.

The performance and accuracy can significantly depend on the threshold values, \`max_distance\`, and the distribution of your OCR bounding boxes."},{"instruction":"TE PASARE UN LISTADO DE PALABRAS CLAVE PARA QUE HAGAS TITULOS SEO OPTIMIZADOS con un tono llamativo, que incite al click. - LA PALABRA CLAVE DEBE APARECER EN EL TITULO SOLO 1 VEZ YO TE PASARE EL LISTADO DE LAS PALABRAS CLAVE QUE SON DE LA TEMATICA DE “EXCEL” DEBE SER TITULOS NO MUY LARGOS, CORTOS E PRECISOS .

So does it make sense? You can study these topics first and then take this course later. So this course is it will be a there is going to be a lot of mathematics and also some probability and linear algebra. So hopefully you're familiar with these topics already. Cool. And we are going to have programming homework. So the title, I mean, this course is Cornerstone, means you have to do some programming assignments. So you have to do some programming assignments. And I'm not going to do any project because I don't want to bother you. You guys are all graduate students, you're busy, so I don't want to, you know, give more pressure to your workload. But we need to do some programming assignments. Then every programming assignment will be based on the Python. So if you don't know about Python, you shouldn't take this course. Sorry. That's good. Any questions about background? And yeah, this is English only, I explained already. And exam is also English. You have to write answers in English. Everything is English except for the English. So I'll just do a little bit of live interaction with you guys. So you can ask questions in Korean. But I will use English. But sometimes I can use Korean to explain better. But I guess maybe 99% will be English. I know my English is not really good. But I'll try to slow down. So that you can understand what I'm trying to say. That's the most important thing. So I changed my mind this morning. So you're going to have four program assignments. 10% 10% which we Masters. Yes. But if you want to do so and we have, again which areолжmetros me a little quarter and you are going to have more time, you can put in minutes on, that you think how much questions you want in this course. Yeah. If you could give a free one for our convener. If you can, you can give. Because only the one question can you get a free pass. Because I will try to. Yes.데 There is an именно one more question that I write after the presentation. Go ahead. Tell us, please. Oakland, feels like isn't there a lot of speech. system in the back. So before you come to the seats, you have to check. You know, you know how to use the app, right? So, so I've done this for about two or three years already. And I know the first class, there are a lot of people like 100 students. And sometimes some students just check there and then just go away. It's up to you. But sometimes I call your name, maybe once or twice or semester. And if you try to cheat, maybe you'll be in trouble. But do your best. And homework 40% one for four program assignments, so 10 points for homework. And so, so I, I want to do a lot of homeworks. But the thing is, it can't do you know, hundreds students homework, like, you know, every week, we don't have that much research. So if you want to learn more, you can do yourself, right? You can study by yourself. If I don't ask you to do something. But there will be four homeworks. And final exam, 15%. And there's no midterm. It's difficult for you. Oh, yeah. So TA first, we have two TA. Is it here? Younghyun? No, no. So you should contact TA first. And then I will, you know, I will, I mean, they are my graduate students. And I will talk with them on a weekly basis. So I will know the issues and the homeworks, whatever. But please use email. And with this subject line, start with this, this prompt. Otherwise, your email may not be sent to TA only. Or you will copy the question. The smallest I Hö oil aperture is one times in a year. Sye Ang Uy Jung Sye Everybody is trying to save herself. So let's just fart and watch for one more few minutes, then we'll come. That's important. But first, what you don't like about MAESAS or things like Algebra to me is, the problem with some things is that, if you don't prepare for your exam, that will bring a high risers time. that reduces parking too. Well, I'd love to. Sther if you're not ready to go. So if you were learning personal<|kk|> what you need to do. to basic machine learning and foundation behind the method. And so first we start from linear regression and also some optimization method. And then we are going to look at some probabilistic interpretation. And we're gonna learn how to do classification, which is logistic regression. And then we are going to look at regularization and also some generative learning algorithm. And midterm break, we don't have any midterm exam. So just you can take some break. And two neural networks and also SDM support vector machine. And then unsupervised learning, K-means Gaussian mixture model and expectation maximization algorithm. And then finally we are going to do some dimensional reduction, PCA and some others. So that's my schedule, but it can be changed over time depending on the schedule and also some other issues. So from this year, the 16 weeks for every course and the final week, there's gonna be final exam. And yeah. So now all the data in detail has been collected and updated. And I've actually done thisormalization through Real burnt error definition, and if, in other words in 60 days, we've done the sorry точa or, let's say Turkey curve we couldn't give a enriched является this particular analysis directly away from every class. So the final analysis about nadzieję or homveda will be completely and ப how ingrained in the actual embedded nature. I'll finish this again. seven eight zero, this is also great. They also have YouTube lectures. So if you want, you can take a look. And also a lot of textbook from the classical textbook from Bishop and Murphy and others. Any questions about course logistics? Yep. Oh, have you taken linear algebra course? I think that should be okay. Yeah, I think that should be fine. But again, it's up to you. So if you think you're not really familiar, you can study by yourself before the course. For starts. Any other questions? Yeah. Yes. Yes. So every slice will be already after the class. I will try my best to upload the lecture slide before the class. I cannot guarantee. That's right. Any other questions? No. My goal is to finish today by one. And the thyme basically had run around the class. So I'm dumplings that I was saying yes to this! Okay. So, I'm going to part two. Now I feel it's being a littleкий but if you understand English as well, you're going to very good. I am very pleased to receive a masker. But if I haven't correctly chosen the person that is going to ask so today. Okay. This earlier in today's class you're in this class? Yes. This first session you are in a student's classroom. Uh, This is a little bit advanced and undergraduate course. The contents are about the same. So I don't recommend you to take both courses. So usually first week, I don't do any lecture, but I introduce some examples of what we can do with machine learning. To motivate you to study hard. So obviously some of the example that I'm showing right now is quite, may not be really relevant to what we are going to study in this class because this course is about very basic methods before the deep learning. But most of the recent machine learning breakthrough is because of the deep learning. But the contents that we are going to learn in the course is literally is a foundation. So you should know the concepts actually before you study the deep learning and most recent techniques. But most of the example that I'm showing is basically, all deep learning. And we are going to cover some neural network, which is deep learning for two weeks, I guess. But that's really basic stuff. And if you heard about, you know, Transformer or CNN, whatever, you know, fancy architecture that people are talking about, it's not covered by this course. If you want to study that course, the topics, you have to take the courses. We have a lot of course offerings in SKKU. And also, there are a lot of, you know, YouTube material you can take a look. So object detection, it's very simple concept, you give it an image, then machine learning or AI system is going to produce the bounding boxes, and they then stop the face. So that's the basic concept. And also, there are lots of other things you can take a look at. So object detection, it's very simple concept, you give it an image, then machine learning or AI system is going to produce the bounding boxes, and there are a lot of things that we are going to study in this course. and also labels and so on. There are a lot of information here, right? There's car here and the stop sign, and then you can also draw, you know, road line in the road. So this object detection technique is core technique of the self-driving cars, and every self-driving car company are using this technique. And another example, it's called image segmentation, and given an image, and you are going to label every pixel. So the AI, the machine learning is going to tell you which pixel, which category this pixel belongs to. For example, this is person, and this is car, and this is tree, and this is load, and so on. So image segmentation is also being used in many practical application, including self-driving cars and others. And human pose estimation, so many practical applications are related to what human do, and we can estimate the skeleton of the human pose so that we can use this technique to interact, I don't know, some games or some metaverse, whatever. So detection, segmentation, and pose estimation, those are, those are some of the things that machine learning is going to be able to do. So I think that this is something that machine learning system recognize some concept in the image. But nowadays, as you all know, generative model is getting really important, and these images are not the real images. This is images produced by machine learning model, and this is the model that we're using. So this is the model that we're using. It's actually, this is quite old. It's already 2019, maybe five, five years back. It's still very clear and sharp and realistic. It's called StyleGAN, I'm not sure if you heard about. This is called dog ball. It's a dog and it's a tennis ball. It's a ball. It's a ball. It's a ball. It's a ball. It's a ball. And obviously this image doesn't exist in the world, right? So this is kind of evidence that machine learning system can actually synthesize some new concept, whether they memorize the training data. Another example, this task is called novel view synthesis. Basically you take a pictures of the scene and then some machine learning system. You take these images, for example here, maybe around 20 or 30 images around the scene from different view perspective. And then the machine learning can generate the infinite number of views. So basically it can generate, you know, a novel view images, even though you never seen that images from your training, the pictures you take. It's quite realistic. You can also express some reflectance here. And also ML is playing a really important role in medical images as well. Nowadays, medical image analysis, the accuracy is going to be more than, higher than 95% or something. It's almost similar to what actual doctors said. And there are many startup and big companies to try to apply these techniques to, in real medical situation. There are a lot of reports that AI can actually detect some cancers and other disease that doctors cannot recognize in your eye. So it's quite useful. So basically what happened in practice is that the AI let doctors know that these regions might be suspicious. Then doctor take a look and double check, and then maybe take another images and so on. So they will improve their process. So this is not surprising anymore because of CHAT-GPT, but even maybe three or four years ago, I think. This is Gmail. I'm using this all the time. So if you type a little bit, then the ML automatically completes your syntax. And this is quite an interesting example because you type Taco Tuesday, and then the ML knows the contents, and then it suggests your completion of your . And Copilot, anyone have used this one when you code? It's very useful. And if you type some prompt here, just code function prototype. Then ML automatically completes the rest of the code. This is working really good. And I was told that once you start this program, then you never go back to before. But this is really convenient. And Amazon Alexa, Google Home, there are a lot of AI assistance. You can actually download it. And you can actually talk to and interact with them to do something. I think that's from our country, ,, I think. And AlphaGo, it's already seven or eight years ago. 2015 or 16, I remember. And for the first time, I'm going to use this. As a platform. I listen to what they're saying . Do you want to help me? I'm ked kind of aware if you are on Google. Can we be one-time AI assistance? Even the human expert. And this game is so complex. And the number of complications you can actually think of, people say, is it more than the number of atoms in the universe? They can tell you value. But the first step I was able to do come back to online scope and do AI. you learn from the games. And it was really surprising. And I remember at the time, the AlphaGo beat ResetDoll 4-1. And ResetDoll only won the one game. But it turns out that that was also a kind of bug. So nowadays people never beat AlphaGo. The new version of AlphaGo actually beat the old version of AlphaGo, maybe 100 to zero. The human is nowhere close to their performance. So I made this slide maybe two years ago, and I feel like all the contents are really out of date. You know what I mean? I have to update. And StarCraft, also the, it's from Google Demand, and then it beat the human professional player, and then it beat the game. So it's a little bit different than AlphaGo because the game reset, it doesn't give you the full information, right? If you look at this map, you can only see the map close to where you are. And you have to guess what's happening in the high-dip area. So it's the partially observable environment. And also, I think it's a little bit different than AlphaGo. It's a little bit different than AlphaGo. So the action space, the control space that you have to pick is really huge compared to the Go or other simple games. It's pretty impressive. And this is a robot. Trying to do Rubik's Cube. And this robot is called Shadow Hands. And they have about the same number of joints that human fingers have. And they also have some contact sensors that they can feel something that they contact with them. And here, this is really, this is only seven years ago, but when first I saw this, this dexterity is really surprising. They can, they can do this. So this is control problem from robotics. And then people have tried this control for forever. And they never imagined this is gonna happen. But it's based on the rainforest running. It's based on the simulation. And then you train your rainforest running system based on millions of trial without actually having the real robots. They apply the learned system to the real robot. And it kind of works. And self-driving car, this is obviously good example. But this is also a really hard problem. Did you guys hear the news that Apple gave up the car business? That means it's really hard. So, this is the way more from Google, Tesla and GeoPublishing, they're all good company, but it's still far from the 100% self-driving. Another example, Google has their own AI processor, which is called T-Mobile. And it's called T-Mobile. And it's called T-Mobile. And it's called T-Mobile. And it's similar to the GPU that Nvidia makes. And it's similar to the GPU that Nvidia makes. When they make their AI processor, they use AI techniques to do something. Actually, I don't know what they are trying to do, but some layout problem is really hard. But they said the AI is not much better, a little bit better than human can do in their chip designing. This is one other example. And AlphaFold, I'm gonna show the video. This is quite motivating. So, I will play this video. I play this video every course that I'm teaching. We've discovered more about the world than any other civilization before us. But we have been stuck on this one problem. How do proteins fold up? How do proteins go from a string of amino acids to a compact shape that acts as a machine and drives life? When you find out about proteins, it is very exciting. You could think of them as little biological nanomachines. They are essentially the fundamental building blocks that power everything living on this planet. If we can reliably predict proteins, if we can reliably predict proteins, if we can reliably predict the amount of 사람� Tutaj's growing speed, system alpha fold really hard now for over two years. Rather than having to do painstaking experiments, in the future biologists might be able to instead rely on AI methods to directly predict structures quickly and efficiently. Generally speaking, biologists tend to be quite sceptical of computational work and I think that scepticism is healthy and I respect it, but I feel very excited about what alpha fold can achieve. The task is when we say, look, deep mind is doing protein folding, this is how good we are on maybe it's better than everybody else, maybe it isn't. We decided to enter CASP competition because it represented the Olympics of protein folding. CASP, we started to try and speed up the solution to the protein folding problem. When we started CASP in 1994, I certainly was naive about how hard this was going to be. It was very cumbersome to do that because it took a long time. Let's see, what were we doing still to approve? Typically 100 different. Different groups from around the world participate in CASP and we take a set of 100 proteins and we ask the groups to send us what they think the structures look like. We can reach 57.9 GDT on CASP-12 ground truth. CASP has a metric on which you will be scored, which is this GDT metric. On a scale of 0 to 100, you would expect a GDT over 90 to be a solution to the problem. If we do achieve that... This has incredible medical relevance. The implications are immense. From how diseases progress, how you can discover new drugs. It's endless. I wanted to make a really simple system and the results have been surprisingly good. The team got some results with a new technique. Not only is it more accurate, but it's much faster than the old system. I think we'll substantially exceed what we're doing right now. It's a game changer, I think. In CASP-13, something. Very significant. It happened. For the first time, we saw the effective application of artificial intelligence. We've advanced the state of the art in the field, so that's fantastic, but we still have a long way to go before we've solved it. The shapes were now approximately correct for many of the proteins, but the details exactly where each atom sits, which is really what one would call a solution, were not yet there. It doesn't help if you have the tallest ladder when you're going to the moon. We hit a... A little bit of a brick wall since we won CASP. Then it was back to the drawing board and what are our new ideas. Then it's taken a little while, I would say, for them to get back to where they were, but with the new ideas. Then now I think we're seeing the benefits of the new ideas. They can go further. That's a really important moment. I've seen that moment so many times now, but I know what that means now. I know this is the time now to press. We need to double down and go as fast as possible from here. I think we've got no time to lose. So the intention is to enter CASP again. CASP is deeply stressful. There's something weird going on with the learning, because it is learning something that's correlated with GDT, but it's not calibrated. I feel slightly uncomfortable. We should be learning this, you know, in the blink of an eye. The technology advancing outside DeepMind is also doing incredible work. And there's always the possibility another team has come somewhere out left field that we don't even know about. Someone asked me, well, should we panic now? Of course. We should have been doing it. We should have been panicking before. It does seem to do better, but still doesn't do quite as well as the best model. So it looks like there's room for improvement. There's always a risk that you've missed something. And that's why blind assessments like CASP are so important to validate whether our results are real. Obviously, I'm excited to see how CASP 14 goes. My expectation is we get our heads down. We focus on the full goal to solve the whole problem. The prime minister has announced the most drastic limit. And the UK is the only country that has ever seen a virus in living memory. I must give the British people a very simple instruction. You must stay at home. We were prepared for CASP to start on April 15th because that's when it was originally scheduled to start. And it's been delayed by a month due to coronavirus. I really miss everyone. I struggled a little bit just kind of getting into a routine, especially with my wife. She came down with the virus. I mean, luckily it didn't turn out too serious. CASP started on Monday. Can I just check this diagram you've got here, John? This one where we ask ground truth. Is this one we've done badly on? We're actually quite good on this region. If you imagine that we hadn't have said it came around this way, but had put it down instead. One of the hardest proteins we've gotten in CASP thus far is a SARS-CoV-2 protein called ORF8. ORF8 is a coronavirus protein. We tried really hard to improve our prediction. Like really, really hard. Probably the most time that we have ever spent on a single target. So we're about two thirds of the way through CASP and we've gotten three answers back. We now have a ground truth for ORF8, which is one of the coronavirus proteins. And it turns out we did really well in predicting that. Amazing job, everyone, the whole team. It's been an incredible effort. Here what we saw in CASP 14 was a group delivering atomic accuracy off the bat, essentially solving what in our world is two problems. How do you look to find the right solution? And then how do you recognize you've got the right solution when you're there? All right. Are we mostly here? I'm going to read an email. I got this from John Maltz. I'll just read it. It says, John, as I expect you know, your group has performed amazingly well in CASP 14, both relative to other groups and in absolute mind. And in absolute model accuracy. Congratulations on this work. It is really outstanding. Our portfolio represents a huge leap forward that I hope will really accelerate drug discovery and help us to better understand disease. It's pretty mind blowing. You know, these results were, for me, having worked on this problem so long after many, many stops and starts and will this ever get there, suddenly this is a solution. We've solved the problem. This gives you such excitement about the way science works, about how you can never see exactly or even approximately what's going to happen next. There are always these surprises. And that really, as a scientist, is what keeps you going. What's going to be the next surprise? It's fun, right? And there is also movement. There is also movie AlphaGo, which is really, I really like it. Winter in Ukraine is always harsh. With the war continuing, it is even more difficult. This is too long. I cannot play here. It's one and a half hour. So when you're relaxed time, please take a look. It's really inspiring. Thank you. Thank you. So AI breakthrough in science and medicine and biology is really taking off right now. People try to make drugs from machine learning. They try to find new material with machine learning. So there's going to be lots of things happening in scientific discovery by using machine learning. So it's really exciting time. There are a couple of more examples that I want to show today. ChatGPT. Everyone knows. There's ChatGPT version 5 is coming soon. I was told that that's going to be a huge impact. And Dali, have you seen this before? You type some text and it generates the images. I mean, realistic images. Here the prompt is an astronaut riding a horse in a photo realistic style. And then they boom, they generate this image. Never exist in the world. Probably, right? And also picture of a horse. There's a picture of Batman in an Iron Man ship. So we don't have these images in real world, right? Because Batman and Iron Man is different thing. And they beautifully combine this concept together. This is Batman, right? And this is Iron Man. If you notice. And also another example. And. I kind of like this one. If you ever come to visit the US, there's Walmart and Target. You know, Walmart is kind of E-Mart in Korea. And Target is the same thing. But they have two. So Walmart, their signature color is blue. And then this logo is Target logo. So they kind of combine these two, which is amazing. And Taxis and Wallet. It's kind of combining these two. Interesting. The generative AI is really changing what we are trying to generate some contents nowadays. This is another example that people is doing research a lot. So you not just generate images. They generate 3D model. So if you imagine animation and VFX for movie, it's going to be really useful. So you just type some text and then it generates really high resolution 3D model. Then it can use in the other use cases. People just generate the 3D model. So this 3D model is really labor intensive. So you have to do every single mesh by your hands, which is really time consuming and annoying and also very expensive to make them some 3D model. But just give text, you can generate quite a nice 3D model. The example. The model is trying to generate this model. And then 3D is quite good. Nice. I think. And also you can do you give some images and they can generate 3D model. Which is. And I'm going to show last example that I think everyone knows right now. Have you heard about the open AI Sora? It was released last week. Or two weeks before. And then the quality is. It's this. This time. I can actually believe. So it's basically you give text and they generate video. And the quality is. Inter grasses, a focus on the editing. And the color, not a quality. So that would be theMy Otterleg's tunnel. But let me just give you one more thing. . Texture novelty. Very porous. crazy. Sorry to stop but if you see the video, then it's actually 3d consistency. It's not just generating just random stuff. They just move camera points right and then it's people never actually tried to reconstruct 3d from their video and it actually worked. That means that this underlying AI system that knows a 3d consistency and actually computer graphics rendering knowledge inside the model, which is really surprising. Now Thank you for watching. If you find this useful, like this, like subscribe my fa we do This is my favorite example Oh, do you see that? Do you see the person in the window? Yeah, here. It's really scary. Can you imagine you can make the animation, two-hour animation with the text script? I think it's possible. There are techniques that you can generate the audio as well. You can put the audio and then the video. The problem is now, generating realistic, really interesting contents, we are really close to what our audience is going to see. But now the problem is the story, how we can make a really fun and interesting story. But the play is in a way, is a littlemlah. I started my new work when child. It's like, oh, why are these comments? I always became curious. Listen, play, play with something, warm, warm, warm. Like, oh. The past. Oh. OK. Yes. OK. Yeah. So anyway, it's not obviously perfect. No possibilities. The quality is not very realistic. I think that was the first videos that were released. The people are shocked. And actually they're generating maybe five or ten videos like every two or three days. So we cannot access their system, but they said they were going to release this to some better version for some professional artists. I think we are all doomed, right? And last one, the robotics. It's not as impressive as Sora, so I'm going to just skip it. So thank you guys. See you next week. Bye. Bye. Thank you. Thank you for the interview. Thank you. Bye. Thank you. Bye.","output":"화요일에 여러분 모두를 환영합니다. 저는 여기 있는 학부생들과 함께 해요. 그러니까 여러분 모두는 대학원생들인 것 같아요. 제가 아는 한으로는 우리는 대략 100명 정도 되니까 이 수업은 정말 큰 규모예요. 죄송하지만 제도가 그렇게 운영되고 있어요. 여러분은 이를 읽을 수 있을 거예요. 저는 이것을 iCampus에 업로드할 거예요. 기본적으로 모든 강의는 줌을 통해 녹화되고 나서 수업 후에, 아마도 수업 다음날에 비디오를 업로드할 거예요. 그러니 다시 한번 볼 수 있어요. 여러분이 오프라인 수업에 참여하는 것을 강력히 권장합니다. 그리고 당연하게도 전자 출석 체크 시스템을 사용하여 여러분의 출석을 확인할 거고, 이것은 여러분 성적의 일부가 될 거예요. 그렇게 큰 부분은 아니지만, 여전히 중요해요. 하지만 만약 여러분에게 어떤 사정이 있어서 오프라인 수업에 참여하지 못한다면, 온라인 비디오를 활용하여 스스로 공부할 수 있습니다. 들리죠? 그래서 이 것은 꽤 중요해요. 여러분은 미적분학과 선형대수학, 그리고 확률론을 알아야 해요. 매우 중요하죠. 저는 필요한 주제들에 대해 설명하는 데 최선을 다할 거예요. 중요한 개념으로 넘어가기 전에요. 만약 여러분이 이 과목들을 수강하지 않았다면, 위험이 있지만, 수업이 너무 어렵다고 불평해서는 안 됩니다. 그래서 이해가 되나요? 먼저 이 주제들을 공부한 후에 이 수업을 수강할 수 있어요. 이 수업은 수학과 확률론, 선형대수학을 많이 다룰 거예요. 그래서 이런 주제들에 이미 익숙하길 바랍니다. 멋지죠. 그리고 우리는 프로그래밍 과제를 가질 거예요. 즉, 이 수업은 여러분이 몇몇 프로그래밍 과제를 해결해야 한다는 걸 의미해요. 프로젝트는 하지 않을 거예요. 여러분은 모두 대학원생들이고 바쁘기 때문에 여러분의 업무 부담을 더하기보다는 저는 그렇게 하고 싶지 않아요. 하지만 몇몇 프로그래밍 과제는 해야 해요. 그리고 모든 프로그래밍 과제는 파이썬을 기반으로 할 거예요. 그래서 파이썬에 대해 모른다면, 이 수업을 수강해서는 안 됩니다. 좋아요. 배경에 대한 질문이 있나요? 네, 이 수업은 영어로만 진행됩니다. 이미 설명했듯이요. 시험도 영어로 치르고, 답변도 영어로 작성해야 합니다. 모든 것이 영어로 진행됩니다. 그러니까 저는 여러분과 약간의 실시간 상호작용을 할 거예요. 그래서 여러분은 한국어로 질문할 수 있지만, 저는 영어로 사용할 거예요. 하지만 때때로 더 잘 설명하기 위해 한국어를 사용할 수도 있지만, 아마도 99%는 영어로 할 겁니다. 제 영어가 그렇게 좋지 않다는 걸 알고 있지만, 여러분이 제가 말하려는 것을 이해할 수 있도록 천천히 할 거예요. 중요한 건 바로 그거죠. 그래서 오늘 아침에 마음을 바꿨어요. 그러니까 여러분은 네 개의 프로그램 과제를 가질 거고, 각각 10%씩 차지할 거예요. 그리고 우리는 다시, 매우 격리된 시간을 가지게 될 거고, 여러분은 더 많은 시간을 할애할 수 있을 거예요.getElementsByTagName(\\"table\\")[0].insertRow(-1).innerHTML = '<td>42</td><td>Deep dive into neural networks and unsupervised learning, focusing on K-means and PCA.</td>';"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"how is that true? The chain rule of derivatives can be derived from the basic definition of derivatives, dy = derivative* dx, true or false? - True - False","output":"True. The chain rule in calculus can indeed be derived from the fundamental definition of derivatives. The chain rule is a formula to calculate the derivative of a composite function. If we have two functions, (f(x)) and (g(x)), where (y = f(u)) and (u = g(x)), then the derivative of (y) with respect to (x) can be found by applying the chain rule: (frac{dy}{dx} = frac{dy}{du} cdot frac{du}{dx}). The basic definition of a derivative from first principles is given as: [ lim_{Delta x to 0} frac{f(x+Delta x) - f(x)}{Delta x} ] The chain rule can be seen as a direct consequence of this definition when applied to composite functions. It explains how the rate of change in one variable (dy) is related to the rate of change in another (dx) through an intermediate variable (du). In essence, the chain rule provides a method to differentiate a composite function by breaking it down into its constituent functions, calculating the derivatives of those functions, and then multiplying those derivatives together, which aligns with the concept of (frac{dy}{dx} = frac{dy}{du} cdot frac{du}{dx})."},{"instruction":"are these 2 talking about the same thing? or its another step? We then compute dyx the derivative of the divergence w.r.t. the final output of the network y(N)","output":"It seems there might be a bit of confusion or a typo in your question regarding \\"dyx\\". However, your question about computing the derivative of the divergence with respect to the final output of the network, (y^{(N)}), appears to be discussing a concept related to neural networks and their training, specifically in the context of backpropagation, rather than directly discussing the chain rule of calculus in a general sense. However, they are related because backpropagation uses the chain rule. To clarify: 1. **Chain Rule in General Calculus:** The chain rule is a basic derivative rule that allows us to compute the derivative of composite functions. For functions (f(g(x))), the chain rule is stated mathematically as (frac{d}{dx}f(g(x)) = f'(g(x))g'(x)). 2. **Derivative of the Divergence in the Context of Neural Networks** is likely referring to the process of calculating gradients of a loss function (often referred to as divergence in this context) with respect to the weights or the outputs of the neurons in a neural network. When you mention the \\"derivative of the divergence w.r.t. the final output of the network (y^{(N)}),\\" it seems you are talking about part of the backpropagation algorithm where we calculate how changes in the output layer (often represented as (y^{(N)}), where (N) indicates the final layer) affect the loss or cost function. This step is crucial for training neural networks as it helps in updating the weights to minimize the loss. To connect the two: - The **backpropagation algorithm**, which is used for training neural networks, relies heavily on the chain rule to efficiently compute gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight in the network. Specifically, to update the weights of the network, one needs to know how the loss changes as the output of the network (y^{(N)}) changes, and then how those changes propagate back through the network to each weight. This is achieved by sequentially applying the chain rule from the output layer back toward the input layer. So, while they may seem to be discussing different things at first glance—one being a fundamental concept in calculus and the other a specific step in the operation of neural networks—they are actually closely related.

We then compute dyx the derivative of the divergence w.r.t. the final output of the network y(N)","output":"No, these two statements are not talking about the same thing directly, but they are related in the context of differentiation in neural networks. Here's a breakdown to clarify each part and how they relate to each other: 1. **The first part** seems to be referring to calculating the derivative of the divergence with respect to (x), but there seems to be a notation issue. Usually, in the context of neural networks and optimization, you might see notations like (frac{dL}{dy}) or (frac{partial L}{partial y}), where (L) represents a loss function (which could be understood as a form of divergence between predicted values and the actual values), and (y) represents the output of the network. When you see (dyx), it could be a typographical error or a confusion in notation. More context would be needed to address it accurately. 2. **The second part**, \\"the derivative of the divergence w.r.t. the final output of the network (y^{(N)})\\", is clearer. This directly mentions computing the derivative of some measure of divergence (often a loss function) with respect to the final output of the network, denoted as (y^{(N)}). This step is a common part of the backpropagation process, where you calculate the gradients of the loss with respect to the outputs, and subsequently, the gradients with respect to the weights of the network, so you can adjust the weights to minimize the loss. To connect them: - If the first part meant to indicate computing a derivative of some quantity with respect to (x) and there was a misunderstanding in notation, and if by \\"divergence\\" it meant some form of loss between the prediction and the actual target, then both parts are about computing derivatives but focusing on different elements and perhaps using confusing notation in the first part. - The second part is a specific and commonly understood step in training neural networks: computing the derivative (gradient) of the loss function with respect to the network's output. This is often the starting point of backpropagation. In summary, they seem to be related in that they both discuss derivatives in the context of neural network outputs and possibly loss functions, but the first statement's meaning is obscured by notation issues. The second statement is a clear mention of a step in the process of backpropagation, which is a broader context they could both be part of."},{"instruction":"got this error while running an application, how to resolve this \\" SystemC 2.3.3-Accellera --- Feb 25 2024 12:22:29 Copyright (c) 1996-2018 by all Contributors, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED @0 s /0 (lua): Parse command line for --gs_luafile option (6 arguments) @0 s /0 (lua): Option --gs_luafile with value conf.lua Lua file command line parser: parse option --gs_luafile conf.lua @0 s /0 (lua): Read lua file 'conf.lua' Lua config running. . . -----Lua is running in NONGPL mode ----- @0 s /0 (lua): Option 63 not processed in lua file command line parser: 0 @0 s /0 (lua): Option 63 not processed in lua file command line parser: 0 [New Thread 0x7fffbd212700 (LWP 38911)] [New Thread 0x7fffb7fff700 (LWP 38912)] [New Thread 0x7fffb77fe700 (LWP 38913)] [New Thread 0x7fffb6ffd700 (LWP 38914)] Failed to open the .ini file.

Let's break down the main points and suggest ways to address them: 1. **Failed to open the .ini file**: This suggests that your application was unable to locate or open a necessary configuration file. Ensure that the \`.ini\` file exists in the expected location and that your application has the correct permissions to access it. You may need to specify the path to the file explicitly in your application's configuration or command-line arguments. 2. **Failed to create GLFW window**: This error is specifically related to the GLFW library, which is used for creating windows, receiving input, and managing contexts in OpenGL. This failure can happen for a variety of reasons including: - Lack of proper graphics driver support or an outdated graphics driver. - GLFW being unable to find a suitable OpenGL or OpenGL ES context configuration. - Running the application in an environment that does not support OpenGL or where the necessary graphical hardware resources are unavailable (e.g., via SSH on a server without X11 forwarding). Here are several steps you can take to resolve these issues: - **For the .ini file issue**: - Check the expected path for the \`.ini\` file and make sure that it's there. - Verify that the file permissions allow the application to read the file. - If the file path is relative, ensure that the application's working directory is what you expect when it's started. - **For the GLFW window creation failure**: - Update your graphics drivers to the latest version available from your GPU manufacturer (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, etc.). - If you're developing a graphical application, ensure you're running it in an environment with access to a GPU and an appropriate graphical user interface environment. If you're using an SSH connection, investigate using X11 forwarding or running the application directly on the machine. - Check the GLFW documentation for any specific requirements or constraints regarding window creation, and ensure your system meets those specifications. - If you're working with a version of OpenGL that's higher than what your system supports, either adjust the version requirement or update your system to support the required OpenGL version. Additionally, since the application aborted due to \`terminate called without an active exception\`, it would be wise to look into how your application handles exceptions. This could be indicative of an uncaught exception resulting from either of the above issues or something else in your program's flow. In development environments involving graphics, ensuring compatibility and proper setup of the environment is crucial. Start by addressing the above two critical points and testing again. If the problem persists, you may need to delve deeper into the configuration of your specific application and development environment."},{"instruction":"Hello","output":"Hello!

(algo así) a) bicicletas b)motocicletas c)ciclomotores","output":"Dentro del contexto de España, si se pregunta por la principal causa de accidentes entre los jóvenes de 18 a 24 años que conducen vehículos de dos ruedas, la respuesta no puede ser proporcionada de manera directa (a, b, c) como se plantea en la pregunta original, que parece pedir identificar cuál de los tipos de vehículos de dos ruedas (bicicletas, motocicletas, ciclomotores) está más involucrado en accidentes. Si el interés está en conocer cuál de estos vehículos está más frecuentemente involucrado en accidentes dentro de ese grupo de edad, la respuesta requiere especificar que, en general, en España y en muchos otros países, las motocicletas y los ciclomotores tienden a estar asociados con un índice de accidentalidad más alto entre los jóvenes comparados con las bicicletas. Esto se debe a varios factores, entre ellos la mayor velocidad a la que pueden circular estos vehículos y la menor protección que ofrecen en caso de accidentes en comparación con los automóviles. Los jóvenes, particularmente en la franja de edad de 18 a 24 años, forman un grupo que estadísticamente tiene mayor probabilidad de verse involucrado en accidentes de tráfico debido a la combinación de inexperiencia y comportamientos de riesgo. Entre motocicletas y ciclomotores, las motocicletas suelen estar más implicadas en accidentes graves, en parte debido a su mayor capacidad de velocidad y a que son elegidas para recorridos más largos. En resumen, aunque la pregunta original apunta a distinguir entre bicicletas, motocicletas y ciclomotores en términos de índices de accidentes, es importante aclarar que las motocicletas, seguidas por los ciclomotores, representan un riesgo mayor de accidentes para los jóvenes de 18 a 24 años en comparación con las bicicletas en el contexto español, priorizando la interpretación de la pregunta hacia el tipo de vehículo y no hacia causas específicas de accidentes."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Established by Phoenician settlers in the 9th century BC on the coast of modern-day Tunisia, Carthage grew to become a powerful city-state and a dominant maritime power in the Western Mediterranean. The First Punic War (264-241 BC) broke out primarily due to competition over control of Sicily, resulting in Rome's victory and marking the beginning of Roman dominance in the western Mediterranean. The most famous event in Carthaginian history, however, occurred during the Second Punic War (218-201 BC) when the Carthaginian general Hannibal famously crossed the Alps into Italy, achieving several victories but ultimately unable to secure a decisive defeat against Rome. Despite Hannibal's efforts, Carthage was defeated, leading to severe terms of surrender that stripped Carthage of its territories and naval power. The Third Punic War (149-146 BC) was the final conflict between the two states, with Rome sieging Carthage, destroying the city, and effectively ending Carthaginian power in the Mediterranean. This series of conflicts deeply influenced the course of Western history, marking the rise of Rome as a dominant power and embedding the legacy of Carthage and its conflicts with Rome in historical memory.

Situated on the coast of modern-day Tunisia, Carthage benefitted from its strategic location, becoming a hub for trade and maritime activities. The city's wealth and power grew from its extensive trade networks, which included metals, textiles, and precious objects, extending from the Western Mediterranean into the Atlantic. As Carthage flourished, it came to control many other Phoenician settlements and colonies, establishing a thalassocratic (sea-based) empire. Carthage's expansion inevitably led to conflicts with other powers, notably the Greek city-states and later, Rome. The city's involvement in the Sicilian Wars against the Greeks highlighted its military capabilities and strategic ambitions. However, it was Carthage's rivalry with Rome that defined much of its later history. The three Punic Wars with Rome, spanning from 264 BCE to 146 BCE, were decisive. The First Punic War saw Carthage losing Sicily to Rome and marked the beginning of Carthaginian decline. The Second Punic War was characterized by the audacious campaign of Hannibal Barca, who crossed the Alps into Italy, although he ultimately failed to secure a decisive victory against Rome. Despite initial successes, Carthage was forced to surrender and suffered severe penalties that crippled its military and economic power. The final blow came with the Third Punic War, where Rome, under the pretext that Carthage was again becoming a threat, laid siege to the city in 149 BCE. After a protracted and brutal siege, Carthage was captured and destroyed in 146 BCE. The surviving inhabitants were killed or sold into slavery, and the city was systematically razed, with Roman legend stating that the ground was sown with salt to ensure that nothing would grow there again. This dramatic end marked the termination of Carthage as a power in the Mediterranean and the cementing of Roman dominance in the region. Following its destruction, a new city of Carthage was eventually rebuilt on the site by the Romans and became an important city of the Roman Empire. The legacy of Carthage, particularly its conflicts with Rome, has had a lasting impact on Western culture and historical memory.

She is adorned in robes that seem to be crafted from the very fabric of the universe, with intricate galaxy inlay patterns swirling across the fabric. These patterns pulse with a plasma neon glow, illuminating her form from within. Her eyes are laser sharp, with an octane render of wisdom and age, yet her face is timelessly beautiful, transcending eras. **Action**: With a staff capped with a crystal emitting a neon glow, she channels her energy, focusing intently on the space before her. The air crackles with power as she performs the ancient ritual to open a portal. **Portal Details**: The portal itself is a masterpiece of complexity and beauty, reminiscent of a Mandelbrot set expanded to an incomprehensible scale. It shimmers with an internal glow, its edge sharp against the backdrop of the ruins, as if cutting through the very fabric of reality. Networks resembling neural webs, intricate and infused with neon lights, form the boundary, while the center appears as an inviting gateway to the unknown. **Surroundings**: The ground is etched with symbols that glow warmly, contributing to the ambient light, casting her shadow in multiple hues. The atmospheric condition hints at a slight fog, further enhanced by volumetric lighting, creating a halo effect around the portal and the wizard. **Visual Effects**: The scene is rendered with such precision that every detail of the wizard, the portal, and the ruins is captured with crystal clarity. High contrast and uplighting techniques emphasize textures and depth, while the 8K resolution ensures that every nuance of this moment is captured. The aspect ratio of 9:16 suggests a focus on the verticality of the portal, stretching towards the cosmos. **Narrative Implication**: As the portal opens, a bridge to the sidereal multiverse is formed. This is not just physical travel but also a projection of consciousness, suggesting a journey of the soul as much as of the body. The wizard, a navigator of these cosmic waters, prepares to embark on astral projection, guiding through dimensions beyond the comprehension of mundane minds. **Technique**: Combining octane and unreal engine rendering, the scene achieves photorealism with an ethereal touch, making the magical elements appear as tangible and real as the ruins themselves. The lighting technique, especially the use of high-contrast and uplighting, creates a mood that is both mysterious and inviting, beckoning the viewer to imagine what lies beyond the portal. --- Creating this visual realistically would demand a highly skilled artist familiar with advanced digital rendering techniques, capable of blending the surreal with the hyper-real to transport viewers beyond their wildest imaginations."},{"instruction":"Title: Gateway to the Sidereal Multiverse Scene Setting: Under the canopy of an eternal night, amidst the ruins of an ancient, forgotten civilization, a beautiful female wizard stands at the epicenter of a convergence of arcane energy.

The aspect ratio of 9:16 suggests a focus on the verticality of the portal, stretching towards the cosmos. Narrative Implication: As the portal opens, a bridge to the sidereal multiverse is formed. This is not just physical travel but also a projection of consciousness, suggesting a journey of the soul as much as of the body. The wizard, a navigator of these cosmic waters, prepares to embark on astral projection, guiding through dimensions beyond the comprehension of mundane minds. Technique: Combining octane and unreal engine rendering, the scene achieves photorealism with an ethereal touch, making the magical elements appear as tangible and real as the ruins themselves. The lighting technique, especially the use of high-contrast and uplighting, creates a mood that is both mysterious and inviting, beckoning the viewer to imagine what lies beyond the portal.","output":"This vivid and in-depth description provides a compelling narrative and visual foundation that could serve as an ideal brief for a digital artist or an entire team engaged in creating stunning visual effects for film, gaming, or other forms of immersive media. This scene could be the cornerstone of a larger story, offering a gateway (both literally and metaphorically) into an expansive universe rich with potential for exploration, conflict, and discovery. To bring \\"Gateway to the Sidereal Multiverse\\" from concept to visual reality, several steps and collaborative efforts would be involved, typically including: 1. **Concept Art**: Initially, a concept artist would take your detailed description to sketch out the scene, focusing on the composition, the wizard's posture and detailed attire, the intricate design of the portal, and the atmospheric conditions surrounding the event. This phase sets the visual tone. 2. **3D Modeling and Texturing**: Artists would create 3D models for the ruins, the portal, and the wizard, ensuring every detail from the galaxy inlay patterns on the robes to the delicate ruins that encircle the scene is designed with precision. Texturing would involve applying high-resolution textures to give materials a realistic appearance, including the glow effects of the neon and the intricate designs described. 3. **Animation and Rigging (if applicable)**: Should this scene be part of an animated sequence, rigging the wizard for movement would be necessary. This involves creating a digital skeleton so the character can move convincingly within the scene. 4. **Lighting and Rendering**: Using volumetric lighting to create the atmospheric effects described would be key. The various lights, including the plasma neon glow from the portal and the wizard's staff, would need careful balancing to achieve the desired visual impact without overwhelming the scene. Rendering in 8K resolution would ensure that every detail, however minute, is captured with clarity, while the use of rendering software like Octane Render and Unreal Engine would contribute to the photorealism and the ethereal quality of the image. 5. **Post-Production**: Finally, in post-production, further adjustments to the color grading, contrast, and any additional effects to enhance the portal's glow or the mystique of the environment would be applied. This phase polishes the visual presentation to its final form. The ambition of this project, as described, would likely require a team of skilled artists, animators, and special effects technicians, each contributing their expertise to bring the scene to life. The technical challenges, while significant—especially in achieving a convincing photorealistic yet ethereally magical aesthetic—are surmountable with current technology and would undoubtedly result in an awe-inspiring piece. Such a scene not only captures the imagination but also invites viewers or players to ponder the mysteries lying beyond the portal, setting the stage for myriad stories and adventures in the \\"Sidereal Multiverse.\\""},{"instruction":"아 맞다. 너 고향 하롱베이라 그랬지? 를 영어로 번역","output":"Oh right, you said your hometown is Ha Long Bay, right?"}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:q,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},L={class:"search-container"},j={class:"card-container"},P={key:0,class:"empty-state"},_=["disabled"],M={key:0},W={key:1};function F(n,e,l,p,o,r){const m=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",L,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",j,[(a(!0),i(v,null,b(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),k(m,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",P,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
