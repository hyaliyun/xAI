When it comes to both social and environmental sustainability, we think and take action with social housing developments that involve techniques that generate, both in their construction and maintenance, lower amounts of CO2 and waste, whilst at the same time, working to promote the use of sustainable power. This book explains the origins and development of this flagship project to address efficient construction in our islands: LIFE+ 2012, an initiative recognised by the European Union and that came to fruition through the construction of 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera. This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method. Harnessing a waste product that is plentiful and native to Formentera, using its properties as thermal insulation and thus avoiding having to use materials that do not exist in our islands provides a new approach to both public and private construction. Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources. This is the path that we should be taking. I would like to publicly acknowledge everybody who has worked both persistently and decidedly to convert the Balearic Islands into a reference point in the Mediterranean in the field of bio architecture. Furthermore, I would like to highlight the role of our partners in this initiative who, with the utmost in professionalism, have catalysed an approach that helps to ensure that public buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. Congratulations to everybody involved in this project, which has been the result of a joint effort, full of hope, that is truly innovative and pioneering. Marc Pons i Pons IBAVI President Minister of Territory, Energy and Mobility Government of the Balearic IslandsIn island regions like the Balearic Islands, there are two important factors to con - sider in the fight against climate change: in addition to the responsibility we share with the rest of society for fighting this global phenomenon from all corners, we are also particularly vulnerable to cli - mate change, with the issue becoming a question of our own survival. This, com - bined with the opportunities offered by these regions as potential “laboratories” make island territories the perfect place to lead efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts. As part of this mission, readdressing the buildings we live, learn or work in is fun - damental, as it is in these buildings that we consume approximately a third of all energy. This project demonstrates that the Mediterranean has the resources and the climate needed to significant - ly reduce energy consumption, both during the process of building houses and during their subsequent use. This makes it possible to reduce CO 2 and other pollutant gases generated by energy consumption in a significant way, in addition to tackling social, eco - nomic and environmental problems de - riving from the extraction, processing and transportation of fossil fuels from their place of origin. What’s more, this also helps to overcome another challenge: anchor renewable ge - neration in fragile and limited territories like islands. The surface area covered by solar panels or the number of wind tur - bines that have to be installed to supply ourselves with clean energy is reduced by building more efficient buildings. Finally, there are three elements that make this project a viable and reproduc - ible reality: quality, comfort and budget, which is very similar to that of other so - cial housing and demonstrates that en - vironmental sustainability is not at odds with the economy. Joan Groizard Payeras Director General of Energy and Climate Change Government of the Balearic Islands The Life Reusing Posidonia project promoted by IBAVI¹ in collaboration with the Balearic General Directorate of Energy and Climate Change at the CAIB has received a European grant of € 754,012 from the LIFE + 12 program in the Environmental Governance category for Climate Change Adaptation Projects. The proposal includes the construction of a prototype building, consisting of 14 social housing units in Formentera, and the monitoring thereof in collaboration with the UIB2 to verify the proper functioning of the solutions applied with a view to providing verified data to the European Institutions for the drafting of future regulations related to the reduction of the environmental impact of the building sector. There is a general consensus on the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions generated during the life of buildings, which represent 36% of total emissions3 at a European level, and this has been reflected in Directives 2002/91/EC on the Energy Performance of Buildings or 2010/31/EU on the Energy Performance of buildings. However, it is worth remembering that in Spain, the construction industry4 accounts for 17% of CO2 emissions, and worldwide, 5% of all emissions on Earth are generated by reinforced concrete5 , 6% by heating, 14% by transport6 , and yet there is no general debate on the importance of reducing CO2 emissions attributable to the materials used during the execution of construction work. Therefore, in addition to energy efficiency, it is imperative that we rethink the industrial processes employed in construction work. The Prototype demonstrates the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials. 1.

With a few exceptions, they do not have any eco-labels7 or have any interest in obtaining them given difficulty in obtaining them in terms of profitability. However, the local nature of these products makes it possible to personally inspect the manufacturing process and to verify the environmental value of the process without the need for external audits. The uptake in use of dry Posidonia oceanica (Neptune grass), a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean, as a form of thermal insulation is remarkable; this solution has been taken from traditional architecture, promoting the use of this protected plant as long as it is done properly, and it reminds us that we don’t inhabit a house, but an ecosystem. Therefore, the combined use of local materials available and imported materials that are environmentally certified constitutes a model that makes it possible to reduce CO2 emissions more than 50% during construction works, whether they are refurbished or new buildings, since these mate rials are suitable to renovate most of the historic city centers. In addition, the Prototype is a model of energy efficient construction to meet the objectives of the 2020 climate & energy package8 , which in Spain is equivalent to an A energy rating for residential buildings, with a consumption of less than 15 kWh/m²/year. All documentation is freely accessible and available at www.reusingposidonia.com with a view to encouraging the development of rehabilitation and new construction projects with this level of efficiency. The environmental studies performed as part of this project have been carried out by the environmental consultancy firm Societat Orgànica +10 SCCL. 7. The study of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an independent entity is too costly for small family businesses. On the other hand, there is no European eco-label for building systems, unlike other sectors such as food or paints, as it remains under development. However, there are some recommendations that can be consulted in this link: http://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/buildings/index.html To consult the products that have the EU Eco-label: Europe:http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/ products-groups-and-criteria.html Spain:http://www.mapama.gob.es/en/calidad-yevaluacion-ambiental/temas/etiqueta-ecologica-de-launion-europea/etiqueta-ecologica-europea/grupos_ producto.aspx Balearic Islands: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?mkey=M234&lang=ES&cont=5511 The eco-labelling process in the Balearic Islands can be carried out at: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?idsite=234&cont=5528 8. The 2020 climate & energy package stipulates that all public buildings must be Nearly zero-energy buildings by 31 December 2018 as one of the measures to achieve the 3 strategic objectives: -20% energy consumption. -20% CO2 emissions. + 20% renewable energy 1. To reduce: — CO2 emissions by 50% during the construction of buildings (maximum limit of 564,085 kg/CO2 ). — Useful energy by 75% during the useful life of the building (maximum consumption 15 kWh/m²/year). — Water consumption by 60% (maximum limit 88l/person and day). — Waste production by 50% (maximum limit 35.18 t). 2. To demonstrate the feasibility of using the following products from the pre-industrial period, applying the corresponding tests: — Insulation using Posidonia oceanica (λ<0.045 W/mk). — Resistance of NHL-5 type lime concrete as a structural solution (minimum resistance to compression of 5 KN/m). 3. To determine the actual unit cost of a multi-family property development that meets all of the above requirements, with the additional cost coming to less than 5% compared to a similar promotion that complies with current regulations. 4. To promote and encourage carrying out the previous points in architectural works. If the construction of all new buildings was carried out applying the criteria of REUSING POSIDONIA construction would no longer be one of the causes of the increase in the planet’s temperature.The staked fig trees of Formentera are a prime example of an economy of means, which entails problem-solving using the minimum amount of resources. Therefore, it is not a goal in itself, but the tool used to solve problems. The sea breezes in Formentera prevented the fig trees from growing upwards. The solution? Place stakes using the forked trunks9 of the Olea europaea Sylvestris or Juniperus that support the branches so that they can grow horizontally. Over time, it has been demonstrated that a single fig tree trunk produced many more figs and thanks to the stakes, growers could climb into the and retrieve figs located at the top. Furthermore, they provide shade for animals and humans. In summer, the Na Blanca den Mestre10 fig tree, the largest in Formentera, is possibly the most pleasant place on the island. 9. Concentric rings of finer trunks are built on the stakes, which in recent years have been replaced by corrugated steel rods left over from construction work. 10. Plan by Marià Castelló, Na Blanca d’en Mestre, published in the Quaderns journal of the Official Association of Architects of Catalonia Col·legi Oficial d’Arquitectes de Catalunya. The main causes of environmental deterioration are the industrial production and consumption models11. In other words: How is it possible that a T-shirt costs €3 in a shop? The answer is simple: using the excuse of the difference in wages and the currency exchange in order to reassure consumers, globalised production using the under-regulated labour markets of second and third world countries is fed by new forms of forced labor12. At the same time, natural resources are overexploited and waste accumulates beyond the biosphere’s absorption capacity, transforming large marine and land areas into real landfills. This is also the case in the construction materials industry. The concept of an ecological footprint is used as an indicator of the rate at which this industrial phenomenon occurs, measuring the sur face area needed to produce what we consume for one year. In Spain13, our footprint is 64,000 m² per person. In the US, this figure comes to 100,000 m². However, space on our planet is limited and only 18,000 m² per person is available14. Therefore, in Spain we should reduce the consumption of resources by 70% at all levels: food, transport, housing, etc. This can be achieved either by reducing our consumption by 70%, modifying production processes, or by a combination of the two. What factors can we change? Industrial activities linked to the construction sector15 has a significant collateral impact, including: 1. Exploitation of natural resources. 2. CO2 emissions and greenhouse effect. 3. Toxicity and carcinogenic effect. 4. Labour exploitation. 11. United Nations Environment Program, Agenda 21. 1992 12.

The full ACV study includes other factors that have been taken into account in this project, such as avoiding products that emit CFCs or HCFCs with an impact on the O-zone or that contain heavy metals. Other impacts such as acidification (SOx emissions into the atmosphere), eutrophication, or the emission of solid waste generated have not been evaluated. Obtaining raw materials can entail implicit risks that are assumed unilaterally by companies, as explained by German sociologist Ulrich Beck in “Risk Society”16. The question is, would these risks be assumed by consumers if they knew about them? This is the case of aluminium mines. For each tonne of aluminium, 2 tonnes of highly alkaline red muds17 with a pH of 12-14 are produced, which are considered dangerous residues and are deposited in tailings rafts, which are a particularly troubling environmental concern for the EU18. The 2010 spillage of red mud tailings from the Ajka aluminium mine in Hungary flooded several villages causing 10 deaths and wounding 150 people. Another case is the deforestation of tropical forests. Although everyone is aware of the topic, we continue to collaborate unconsciously by failing to demand controlled management stamps in all our purchases. Even still, some reports19 warn of non-compliance in the management protocols in some second and third world countries, turning these supposed guarantees into a method of cleaning their image, also known as green-washing. Would the same occur if companies had to provide tracking information on all packaging? That is, stating the origin of products and providing information on all the stages of production, transformation and distribution. For example, imagine a label similar to the one used on cigarette packs: “The wood used to make this door comes from an illegal logging facility in the Amazon which is responsible for the annual deforestation of 1,000,000 hectares of forest” Or how about: “The aluminium used to make this window comes from a mine in India which has entailed the deforestation and the expulsion of indigenous tribes, causing numerous deaths and violations. The recycled aluminium content is 2%” 16. Beck, U. (2008): Risk Society, Barcelona, Paidós. 17. FERNANDES, M., A. RAMÍREZ & T. TOSIANI 2013.

Greepeace Report FSC at Risk: FSC in Russia. According to the draft version of Libro Blanco del Etiquetaje Verde20 developed by ITEC and the regional government of Catalonia, average emissions during the construction of residential buildings come to 732 kg/CO2 per square meter built, and range between 600 and 900 kg/CO2 depending on the type of building. Therefore, the emissions of a 100 m2 house come to approximately 75,000 kg/CO2. Extrapolating this figure to the total 60,000 homes built in the Community of Madrid21 in 2006, emissions came to 4.5 million tonnes, equal to 900,000 Olympic swimming pools. What are the implications of this? Carbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the greenhouse effect22, and thus it is the gas that has the greatest impact on global warming. In comparison, the rest of greenhouse gases added together represents 5%. The remaining 75% is caused by water vapour and clouds. fossil fuels like oil, heavy fuel oil or natural gas.27 In other words, the life cycle of concrete begins in an oil field like the one of Ghawar, Saudi Arabia; afterwards, the oil is transported by oil tankers to ports in Europe, like the one in Rotterdam; from there, it is distributed via pipelines to Spain, where it is refined and supplied to factories to be used as fuel, accountable for 5% of the world’s pollution. This does not take into account the possible environmental catastrophes caused by oil tanker accidents or armed conflicts in the different countries of extraction. In addition, it must not be forgotten that 2010 saw the Peak Oil28, in other words, the moment at which oil production reached its historical peak and from there began to decline. Whilst oil will never run out, there will come a time when it stops being extracted as it will be too expensive or difficult to obtain. 27. Guide to best techniques available in Spain in the production of cement, 2004, Ministry of the Environment. 28. World Energy Outlook 2010, International Energy Agency. Check next image. In light of this situation, the simplest solution is to reduce its use insofar as possible, i.e., not doing or doing the minimum. The automatic way of reducing CO2 emissions from a 500 m2 building by 50% is to build only 250 m2 . When this option proves unfeasible, one option is to avoid using materials with higher emissions as much as possible, such as aluminium, porcelain stoneware, all asphalt derivatives and reinforced concrete, and to look for available alternative materials. For example, those developed prior to the industrial revolution and using renewable energy to be manufactured at temperatures below 900 °C. This group includes natural hydraulic lime cement, aerial lime, or biomass-fired bricks, as well as all materials that do not require the use of furnaces, such as wood products. One of the major advantages of designing using quantifiable indicators is the ability to dismantle myths. Thus, when it comes to the issue of pollution, it is typical for transport to be quoted as one of the main sources. Although this may be true in some particular cases, boats are comparatively very efficient compared to other means of transport, as shown in the table on the right. Obviously, the shorter the distance, the less associated pollution. What is the main problem in importing products from abroad? Generally speaking, if products are sourced from developed countries and importing them is justified as there is no impact on the consumption of similar local products, the importance of transport pollution can be considered relative. However, importing raw materials from countries with under-regulated labour markets can lead to labour exploitation, accidents and worker fatalities. If in doubt, ask to be provided with the working conditions of supplier, although this is not always possible. For instance, more than 55% of the electricity consumed in Mallorca comes from the Murterar power plant, which coal powered. This coal does not come from Spanish mines, as might be assumed, rather it is it from Colombia as it costs less. This sector involves child exploitation29, which causes environmental disasters such as the dumping of hundreds of tonnes of coal into the sea near beaches30 and high occupational accident rates according to the report of the Ministry of Mines of Bogotá31, which references the mortality rates of other mining countries such as China, with 6,000 miners killed during 2005, or South Africa, with 220 in 2007, which is from where the coal used in Murterar was sourced until recently. Almost 60 million children are affected by child exploitation in South Africa32. Given that children are considered particularly useful for entering gaps in which adults do not fit and that they have no demands in terms of working conditions, it is fairly plausible to conclude that the production of electricity employed on the island has benefited from child exploitation for years, and could even still be happening Although statistically employment conditions in Colombia are better than those in South Africa, the fact is that in general, we would refuse to do these jobs ourselves, never mind our children. In this sense, the current DGECC’s commitment to close 50% of the coal reactors at the Murterar power station in the near future is quite remarkable. This development is doubly interesting given that the incorporated CO2 emissions of the energy mix of the Balearic Islands33 are more than double those seen in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, due to the pollution caused by the burning of coal, with a heat efficiency of just 30% (the remaining 70% is released into the atmosphere). Therefore, energy efficiency in the Balearic Islands, in addition to reducing consumer bills and pollution, can have a positive impact on reducing labour exploitation if appropriate measures are taken.29. https://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/avenferm/ article/view/15660/18163 30. www.ejatlas.org/conflict/coal-transport-bydrummond-in-bahia-de-santa-marta-colombia 31.

According to data from the Directorate General of the Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change, in 2010, the Balearic Islands produced 9,361,900 tonnes of CO2 . Of this amount, 5,000,000 tonnes correspond to the production of electricity. In Mallorca, 500 MW are produced at the Murterar power station with 33% of primary heat energy harness. This plant alone is responsible for around 3,100,000 tonnes of CO2The history of regulatory developments in terms of asbestos demonstrates the difficulties experienced by government institutions to prohibit products that are potentially harmful to human health: 1889 First report on the toxicity of asbestos fibres34. 1930 First time asbestosis is recognised as a professional disease in Great Britain.35 1973 International scientific recognition of the carcinogenic nature of asbestos.36 1999 The EU requires member states to ban all types of asbestos and establishes a maximum deadline of 1 January 2005.37 2001 Its production in Spain is prohibited. The standard takes effect after 6 months and an additional moratorium of 6 months is granted to market the remaining stock.38 2006 The removal of asbestos by private individuals is prohibited, which is carried out by specialist companies who use watertight suits given the great danger involved in its handling.39 Occupational exposure in manufacturing continues to cause more than 100,000 deaths a year globally and yet countries like Russia continue to manufacture almost 700,000 t annually, which are marketed in countries like China. Another case is that of PVC, declared as being carcinogenic by IARC40. In addition to toxicity during the production process or direct contact, one of the main problems in its use in buildings is that most installations, such as electrical wiring and sanitation, are usually made of PVC and in the event of a fire, the main cause of death is the inhalation of smoke and toxic gases, accounting to 57.45% in the case of men and 81.82% in the case of women41. In fact, public buildings require that electrical installations are free from halogens, i.e. free from PVC. Despite the foregoing, it remains the third most consumed plastic in the world. 34.

In Spain, it is still sold, but its use is banned in public buildings in more than 300 towns and cities in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Holland, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, including capitals such as Berlin and Vienna. All these examples constitute what we call “the difficulties of the modern farmer.” Taking traditional architecture as a reference, in which farmers use everything that comes his way without prejudice, the replacement of a few trunks and ropes using potentially toxic products made on an industrial scale becomes a noteworthy problem. In light of this situation, the principle of precaution42 is of particular interest, avoiding the use of all materials concerning which there are strong doubts in terms of their safety in construction work, establishing much more restrictive levels than those defined by the current legislation, preventing the use of the following materials: — PVC in any aspect of construction work, including installations, where it is considered the material par excellence. — Glues and/or woods with a formaldehyde content of more than E1. — Polyurethane (PU) foams or any other type of product that exposes the operator to toxic gases such as HFC (greenhouse gas), or HC (hydrocarbons considered Volatile Organic Compounds), which have replaced CFC or CHFC gases that affect the O-zone layer, which were banned in 2009.43 — Toxic paints or varnishes, with a high VOC content or that contain barium, lead or other heavy metals. It is recommended that all treatments used contain vegetable raw materials and feature a stamp of organic production or, failing this, a certificate issued by the manufacturer, declaring that the product is not toxic. 42. Referred to in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 43. European Regulation 1005/2009 of 16 September 2009.What options do we have in this scenario? One of the main problems facing EU countries is energy dependence44. In the case of Spain, this figure comes to 75%, whilst the EU-27 average exceeds 53%. This high level of dependence leaves the economies of member states in a fragile position. The 2020 climate & energy package has been developed as part of which the reduction of energy consumption by 20% is one of the key points to gradually start on our journey towards energy self-sufficiency prior to the arrival of Oil Crash45. Similarly, progress towards a degree of self-sufficiency in resource consumption is one of the main ways of reducing the so-called “ecological threats”, which are actually threats to the social system46. It is not a case of protecting a non-existent “untouched nature”, rather our own survival. How can we apply self-sufficiency? A resource map is a very useful resource that allows us to discover all available local resources, whether tangible or not: Prevailing winds in summer for cooling, direction of the sun for heating, rainfall, geotechnics, materials and waste, etc. Traditional architecture is, by definition, the local resource map. That is, by regarding traditional architecture, we can discover the natural resources available at the time of construction. For example, buildings in the Biniaraix ravine in Soller, Mallorca, were built using stones from the valley itself. The presence of a well or cistern can be used as a pointer in terms of the geology, rainfall and the existence of groundwater. In the case of Formentera, until the 19th century, only stone, soil, and sabina wood was available. During the 19th century, lime technology was developed and tiles imported from Ibiza and the mainland. However, it’s not just about materials. In Alexander Brodsky’s ice pavilion, the metallic mesh protects against the icy wind by spraying it with water, forming a wall of ice that can be served in the form of cubes in vodka drinks. The cold provides protection from the cold. If we are strict enough, our buildings could produce a resource map for our era to be used by future generations. Program, structure, construction and energy efficiency solved by a single strategy. Traditional architecture has been a constant reference, not in terms of design, but as a way of working. We use it as a microscope to get a closer look. By doing so, we can see the resources available on the island: Junipers, which were used to build frameworks, are currently protected. The sandstone quarries have been depleted and the limited straw available is used for livestock. So, we have to look to the sea: Posidonia and boats, plus construction pallets that remain on the island because high cost of returning them.Therefore, we propose a shift in approach: “Instead of investing in a chemical plant located 1,500 km away, we should invest the same amount in local unskilled labour, who should lay out the Posidonia to dry under the sun and compact it in pallets, providing 15 cm of insulation for roofs. Moreover, sea salt actually acts as natural biocide product and is completely environmentally friendly The rest of the material used comes from a market study given their cost, the incorporated energy and the fact that they are suited to the levels of comfort required. The use of natural materials, more fragile than industrialized, requires selecting the main construction systems at the beginning of the design process. The organization of the spaces and the formal decisions must be the result of the knowledge of the advantages and the limitations of the materials. To think Louis Kahn’s way: If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, ‘What do you want, Brick?’ And Brick says to you, ‘I like an Arch.’ And if you say to Brick, ‘Look, arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think of that, Brick?’ Brick says, ‘I like an Arch.’ And it’s important, you see, that you honor the material that you use. The constructed volume is divided into two separate blocks, taking advantage of the fact that the two facades that overlook the street enjoy prevailing winds that passively keep them cool in summer. All the dwellings face two directions and cross ventilation thanks to the layout of the living/dining room and kitchen in a Z shape and a bedroom at each end. The layout is a variation of the project of 42 housing units in Son Servera, Mallorca, by the architects M. Peris and J. M Toral, promoted by the IBAVI. The entrance to all homes is directly on to the street, restoring the direct relationship typical of rural communities and avoiding the use of elevators, stairs and common areas. Furthermore, they all boast outdoor spaces for private use: ground floor homes have a garden whereas first-floor homes have a terrace with a private staircase. The building is Energy Class A. The insulation in the roof is Posidonia oceanica compacted at 185 kg/m3 with λ: 0.044 W/mK and 16-cm thick. The walls are of 25-cm thick Ytong and U: 0.36 W/m2 ºC, except to the north, which are 30-cm thick and U: 0.32 W/m2 ºC. All windows are low emissivity glass U: 1.1 W/m2 ºC. In summer, the cooling is provided passively by harnessing the breeze. The windows exposed to sunlight have solar protection, such as porches, pergolas with vines and canes, or shutters made of larch wood. Cables have been installed on the facade to facilitate the growth of climbing plants that protect blind walls and reduce solar radiation by more than 90% in areas where they have been developed. In winter, passive climate control is dependent on a 90 kW centralised biomass boiler that offers a yield of 92%, which also produces ACS. Each house has Termobox-M heat exchangers that provide individual consumption readings. The openings dimensions have been calculated to ensure that direct radiation occurs on the most unfavourable day of the winter solstice. First floor houses have a skylight on the deck facing in two directions. In winter, when opening the shutters facing southwards provides you get a solar collector. In summer, when closing the blinds and opening the windows, you get natural ventilation by means of suction. The average thermal comfort, measured on site is 21ºC in winter and 26ºC in summer. If prioritizing the product as being as healthy and eco-friendly as possible, a local product47, in addition to being economically viable, the following table applies to the Balearics: C1. Reusable local waste E.g. Neptune grass, straw, reused doors, etc. C2. Local eco-friendly products E.g. Marès sandstone, clay (BTC, adobe, etc.), tiles cooked in a biomass kiln, aerial lime, etc. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products E.g. Wood, hydraulic lime, etc. C4. Recycled or optimized products, whether local or not. E.g. Ytong, metal beams with at least 85% recycled steel. 47. A product is considered to be local when it is less than 100 km from the place where it will be consumed. In the case of Formentera, Mallorca has been considered as local due to the lack of local industry, although the two islands are 160 km apart. C1. Reusable local waste — Roof insulation: Posidonia oceanica dried on site, confined in reused pallets. — Aggregates: from construction work itself, during the excavation phases, or from cellular concrete block residues. — Interior carpentry and gates: reused wood (Fundació Deixalles Mallorca). C2. Local eco-friendly products — Structure (vaults): marès sandstone slabs from Mallorca. — External plaster: lime plaster made in Mallorca using recycled oil as fuel. — Exterior floors: 40x80x7-cm marès sandstone slabs and bricks produced in biomass kilns known as “morunos”. — Vertical outdoor partitions: H-16 ceramic blocks produced in biomass kilns. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products — Structure (floors): laminated wood from Austria, type E1 with PEFC seal. OSB-III boards with PEFC seal. — Outdoor woodwork: larch wood from the Basque Country, with PEFC seal. — Foundations: Non-reinforced NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk. — Interior floors: NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk, smoothed in situ. — Acoustic insulation for interior partitions: recycled cotton boards. — Acoustic insulation for the floors: Natural cork with FSC seal. — Wood protection: Lasur based on vegetable raw materials, free from lead, barium, heavy metals or polyurethane. — Paints: Silicate paint for walls and partitions. C4. Recycled or optimised products — Structure (walls): YTONG cellular concrete blocks, with environmental product declaration (EPD according to ISO 14025 - eco-label type III). — Waterproofing: EPDM. The use of asphalt sheets and PVC has been banned. — Installations: All electrical installations are halogen-free (PVC-free). Water, domestic hot water and grey water installations are made using polyethylene and polypropylene. C1. POSIDONIA & PALLETS DRY NEPTUNE GRASS AS A THERMAL INSULATION FOR ROOFS The insulation depends on the indoor air bubble content; therefore, any local waste with a high air content can potentially be used for insulation. In Formentera, one of the most abundant types of residue are dead Posidonia leafs, which is why dry Posidonia oceanica has been used as thermal insulation, just like it was used in traditional architecture. The accumulation of Posidonia oceanica debris (berms) on the beaches provides very effective protection against coastal erosion. However, in Formentera the accumulation is so high that top layers can be used. PROTECTED PLANT The Posidonia oceanica is a protected plant48 and its use must be authorised by the Ministry of Environment by applying to the Service of Protected Species. It has been collected by the company awarded the contract for beach maintenance and has been limited exclusively to the areas in which the material accumulated on beaches exceeds the amount necessary to maintain the balance of the coastal dune ecosystem and extreme care has been taken not to affect this ecosystem, under the supervision of the environment technicians from the Council of Formentera. The annual surplus volume of Posidonia, around 4000 m3 , would be sufficient to insulate all new dwellings on the island. The illegal collection of Posidonia is prohibited and strict sanctions apply, except in authorised cases. The new Posidonia Decree of the Balearic Islands, which is currently being drafted, includes its use in construction work. 48. Posidonia oceanica is protected by the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC TESTS WITH THE UIB Posidonia does not require artificial treatment as sea salt acts as a preser - vative and a biocide. In order to ensure its worthiness as in - sulation and to determine its thermal conductivity, three different tests were carried out in collaboration with the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB). The result was a success. — The first test involved the use of two PCE-HT 71 data logger sensors. — The second, using a drying oven, sought to compared the results against expanded polystyrene. — The third, involved using a heat flow meter pursuant to UNE-EN 12664:2002. Dry Posidonia insulation provides a U: 0.2936 W/m 2 °C and Λ: 0.044 W/mK for a density of 185 kg/m 3 and a thickness of 16 cm. THE PROCESS Once the re-used 16-cm high construction pallets were put in place, dry Posidonia has to be extended at a rate of 20 kg/m2 . The compaction process to obtain 185 kg/m3 was performed manually, with participants using their hands and feet to push the leafs between the pallets that form the substructure to which the OSB boards are nailed. Afterwards, the boards were waterproofed with EPDM and protected with sandstone slabs the form of paving. The smell of the sea was apparent on the site throughout the process. The solution applies to all locations in the Mediterranean with a surplus of Posidonia. DURABILITY Dry Posidonia does not rot and has no natural predators outside the marine environment, so its durability is unlimited under normal conditions of use. It was used uninterruptedly in the traditional architecture of the Balearic Islands and especially in the Pitiusas until the start of the 20th century. The samples of dry Posidonia dating back to the 14th century provided by Antònia Reig, Director of the TRBM49, taken from the coffered ceiling of the cloister at the Sapiencia de Palma show a perfect state of conservation; therefore, its useful life is more than 600 years. According to hisorians F. Tugores i J. Morata, all palaces built in Palma between the 14th and 17th centuries used dry Posidonia in wood panelling to protect the wood from moisture and xylophages. EXTINCTION OF THE POSIDONIA PRAIRIES DUE TO GLOBAL WARMING Posidonia meadows are an essential CO2 sink. However, according to the Spanish National Research Council50, during the 21st century their density will decrease by 90% due to the increase in sea temperature, as part of a process that will begin in about 40 years, resulting in the functional extinction of the species, giving rise to the release of absorbed gas for centuries.51 Therefore, the decrease in CO2 released as part of construction contributes directly to the protection of the species. Formentera’s boat shacks remind us of the time when recycling was one of the few possible ways of obtaining raw materials. All indoor carpentry in these dwellings and the vertical shutters on the ground floor were made using recycled wood and planks made from old pine stripped from abandoned beds managed by Fundación Deixalles in Mallorca. There are no second-hand carpenters in Ibiza. Fundación Deixalles is a non-profit organisation whose main objective is to ensure the socio-labour insertion of vulnerable groups in the Balearic Islands through the recovery and recycling of waste and environmental activities in general. The reuse of this wood makes it possible to put top-quality wood (old pine, Oregon pine, etc.), generally more than 50-70 years old, to reuse; this guarantees the natural growth of the tree and a drying process that is no longer available, and therefore these objects are become unique and un - repeatable, making it possible to in - corporate items of great wealth into architecture in general. As part of the woodwork selection pro - cess, samples showing signs of wood - worm or xylophagous insect infesta - tion have been ruled out, as they could extend to the rest of the house. The original woodwork has been ex - tended or trimmed as needed and it has been hung on Klein sliding guides, as this means that although the size of the door and gap do not match, the gap is reduced insofar as possible. All swinging doors can be reused as slid - ing doors. More than 100 items of recycled wood - work have been installed. Hydrated lime plaster on the facades to waterproof the load walls with a breathable coating. The lime, aged for 12 months, was sourced from the Unicmall factory in Felanitx, Mallorca. The fuel used to melt the lime is recycled oil, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. The plaster is applied in 3 layers. Two coarse layers with a total thickness of 2 cm and an intermediate mallatex across the entire surface plus a thin layer of 3-5 mm. The thick mortar includes a 0.2% polypropylene fibre reinforcement to prevent cracking during retraction. The support wall has been pre-treated with a compatible primer. Marès is a type of sandstone native to the Balearic Islands extracted in 40x40x80-cm blocks; it is very useful in the construction of walls and vaults. Its characteristics depend on its origin, whether calcarenite (sand grains cemented by the calcium of shells of molluscs) or eolianite (sedimented sand), and therefore each quarry has very different properties, with resistances varying between 25 and 630 kg/cm². Therefore, as is the case with wood, its generic name is not very descriptive and it is essential that the quarry selected is appropriate based on the required use. The publication EL MARÉS, by R. Sánchez-Cuenca, comes highly recommended, offering a description of the features (density, porosity, resistance, colour, etc.) of the 19 active quarries in Mallorca. In Formentera, the quarries have already been depleted or extraction activities have ceased. As part of this project, we chose to use the Cas Busso quarry, offering 1st-rate quality, with the following characteristics: — Whitish colour, compact, dense, no grains, very hard. — Bulk density: 2.1 g/cm³. — Open porosity: 45.6%. — Compressive strength: 557-627 kg/cm². Marès has been used as a structural element to construct the vaults of cisterns, as an alternative to the reinforced concrete slabs and to avoid the corrosion of reinforcements, thus prolonging their durability indefinitely. The vault joints have been made using with NHL-5 lime cement, as Marès is chemically incompatible with Portland cement. It has also been used as a floating floor in the roof, in 40x80x7-cm slabs with an open joint, laid dry in and 80x18.5x25- cm solid steps. The use of Marès reduces emissions by 60% compared to concrete alternatives.52 52. Own research carried out in collaboration with the General Directorate of Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change of the Balearic Islands Government, using the ITEC’s BEDEC. C2. BRICKS & TILES The outer-facing walls and permeable dicing walls have been made using H-16 bricks sourced from the Can Mascaró factory in Vilafranca, Mallorca. They have been placed with the holes exposed, rotated 90º compared to their usual direction, allowing air to circulate and cool the inside of houses while still offering shade in the summer. Furthermore, there does not inhibit resistance to the horizontal thrust of the wind. The tiles, made at the Soler pottery in Felanitx, Mallorca, have been used in the eaves that protect the windows, as outdoor paving, in doorways, roof railings and in the tiled bathrooms and kitchens. The glazed tiles are made one at a time by hand, and no two tiles are the same. All the bricks and tiles used in construction work have been baked in biomass mortar kilns, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. 53. Up to now, we have located this type of “moruno” kilns used for the production of building materials in Andalusia, the Balearic Islands and Murcia. We do not know if there are other ceramic factories in Spain that operate with 100% renewable energies. In any case, it is a trade of great patrimonial and ethnological value and, therefore, the Administration must protect it. The outdoor windows have been made using laminated larch wood with the PEFC seal from the Basque Country. This wood has a very low thermal conductivity Λ: 0.11 W/mk, which means it provides good insulation, especially when compared with aluminium (209.3-237) or steel (47-58). HEALTH AND DURABILITY It is breathable, and contains no toxic elements. The protection treatment has been applied using eco-friendly lasur, which features no polyurethane and Vindo 629 paint made by Livos. A correct design involves selecting a suitable wood to use. The larch wood does not rot and does not show signs of blue mould. In the façades, 20-cm ceramic eaves have been installed to avoid direct rainfall. Shutters have been installed without a frame, with a minimum separation of 0.5- 1 cm between wet work and the wood.

HYDRAULIC LIME NHL-5 Why use lime concrete? CO2 emissions can be reduced by around 15% without having to change normal building habits, replacing conventional materials with less polluting alternatives in finishes such as paintwork, flooring, carpentry or plastering. However, action must be taken during excavation, foundation and structural work to reduce emissions by up to 50%. Lime concrete, used since 300 BC by the Romans and present in all traditional European architecture, absorbs between 45% and 62% of the CO2 produced during its production, reaching 100% CO2 absorption in very long life cycles. The material fell out of use during the 20th century due to slow setting times and low resistance compared to Portland cement, which prevents its use in multi-level pillar structures. The prototype has been designed with light slabs and load-bearing walls that transmit loads of less than 0.8 N/mm² to the 60x50-cm footings to demonstrate the viability of NHL-5 lime as structural concre - te with a strength equal to or greater to 5 Mpa and setting period of up to 360 days. Concrete has been laid in layers of varia - ble thickness, ranging between 15 and 20 cm. The ratio used was 1:1:1 (lime, sand, gravel) in the upper layers and 2:3:5 in the lower layer. In establishing the different ratios, both the information on the tra - ditional application of lime concrete and the technical information associated with the existing regulatory framework have been taken into account, which can be found in the project report. 291 test specimens were tested to determine the resistance of lime con - crete in real working conditions, using different possible ratios to provide all possible information for the purposes of future projects. In addition, another 70 lime concrete specimens54 with a small proportion of white cement of <20% have been taken to accelerate the setting of all exposed concrete indoor flooring Slabs are 10-cm thick on the ground floor and 7-cm thick on the 1st floor, to reduce the load, and they have been poured on a waterproof breathable sheet of polyethylene. They have been reinforced with polyethylene fibres and continuous mallatex specific to 40x40 mm and 135 gr floors placed 3 cm from the bottom face of the slab. Flexible 5 mm joints have been laid around the perimeter and retraction joints using 5x45-mm polypropylene profiles forming maximum surface area pads of 5 m2 on the ground floor and 4 m2 on the first floor. The finishing layer has been made by sprinkling flint sand and lime at a ratio of 50:50, and smoothed by hand using a grout float, in 3 consecutive phases as is traditional. The flooring has been kept moist for 30 days and was not stepped on for a week. It has been waterproofed using ecological Welaan Eco-Hidro-Sell based sodium silicate water-repellent product. 54. The hydraulic lime used in this construction was sourced from Catalonia, is baked at 900ºC and CO2 emissions are 400 kg/CO2 per tonne of lime. However, if biomass or other clean energies had been used for the purposes of combustible, emissions would be 160 kg/CO2 per tonne. The slabs (ceilings) consist of the following structural elements: A. 20x40-cm laminated GL36 pine beams of section and 12x18-cm GL24 beams, sourced from Austria with the PEFC seal. B. Structural panel of oriented chips of poplar wood, OSB III type 2-cm thick, from Italy with PEFC seal. Biocide has been applied exclusively to the hidden parts of the wood. The heads embedded in the wall have been coated with reused cardboard boxes and packaging to absorb any moisture that reaches the wood. CO2 emissions are 23 kg/CO2 per m2 of wood slabs. Emissions made by a one-way concrete slab for equivalent lamps are 245 kg/CO2 . C4. Ytong The solution used in the façade is the result of an environmental comparison carried out by Societat Orgànica consultancy firm, in which different façade solutions with the same transmittance coefficient of U: 0.36 were assessed and the solution with the lowest incorporated energy (498 Mj/m2 ) chosen, comprising load-bearing walls with YTONG-type lightened concrete, or similar, with the following characteristics: — Width of 30 cm and density of 350 kg/m³ facing north to reduce losses in winter. — Width of 25 cm and density 350 kg/ m³ in all other facade walls. — Width of 30 cm and density of 500 kg/ m³ in the walls dividing dwellings to comply with the acoustic regulations. On the inside, the block has been painted directly using silicates, without plastering, to avoid the consumption of materials and additional energy In order to reduce the consumption of mains water from 22055 to 88 litres per person per day the following measures have been implemented: 1. Efficient design of the domestic hot water installation and the location of faucets, all less than one meter from the hot water exchanger to avoid wasting cold water. 2. Saving mechanisms in kitchens and bathrooms (pressure and flow reducers, taps that open when cold, etc.). 3. Rainwater cisterns of 6 m³ each, located beneath the 7 terraces on the ground floor, to provide automated irrigation to the plants sowed that serve a bioclimatic function (11 trees and 40 climbing plants). The steady rainfall rate is 345 l/m2 per year and the system has 450 litres per day for the purposes of irrigation during the 3 months of the dry season. In terms of rental housing managed by IBAVI, lawns are banned, which in this climate would constitute an irresponsible use of resources. 55. Statistical water consumption in homes with garden of the subsidiary rules of Formentera and the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). 4. In the central courtyard, a grey water phyto-purification system56 has been installed to regenerate shower water for use in the toilets (statistically 20% water consumption per day and person). The cistern has a capacity for 17 m³. The plants selected by the landscaper Salvador Canyís are Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia, Iris pseudoacorus, Mentha aquatica and Lithrum salicaria. 5. Landscape gardening. Selection of suitable native and non-native species: Celtis australis (almez), Ficus carica (fig tree), Parthenocissus quinquefolia (virgin vine), and Bougainvillea spectabilis (bougainvillea) and efficient irrigation systems, avoiding sprinklers. 56. Horizontal dry flow phyto-purification system. The prototype has successfully reduced waste production by 50% during the construction phase, producing 33.38 tonnes of waste in total. The following measures were applied: — Reuse the aggregates from excavation as fillers under floorings (100 m3 ), and fillers in gardens (120 m3 ), in order to reduce the gravel imported in trucks from Ibiza. — Reuse the remains of crushed YTONG as light filler under the firstfloor flooring. — Reuse all construction pallets in the construction of roofs as a support for Posidonia oceanica. — Reuse the surplus wood from the beams to cover the gaps in the slabs between rooms. — Reuse the wood provided by Fundación Deixalles for the purposes of interior woodwork. MONITORING THE PROTOTYPE Incorporated emissions have been calculated using the ITEC’s BEDEC bank57. During the REUSING POSIDONIA project we discovered that it was impossible to establish an absolute emissions threshold for all buildings, since the impact of works to build the roofs, structures or lay the foundations varies widely. Therefore, in contrast to the calculation of energy efficiency, for which there are reference values, to calculate the percentage of improvement, we use the emissions of an equivalent building constructed with conventional systems such as reinforced concrete, aluminium, stoneware and asphalt products.58 The emissions of the Prototype came to 446,632 Kg/CO2 (412 Kg/CO2 x m²). The emissions of the reference building came to 1,221,987 kg/CO2 (1,128 kg/CO2 x m²) The decrease ultimately obtained was 63,45%, well beyond the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 50%.59 57. Technical Construction Institute of Catalonia. 58. Materials used to calculate the reference building: — Foundations, walls and pillars of reinforced concrete. — Structural floor with concrete girder-slabs and beams. — Flat roof with porex insulation and asphalt sheet. — Concrete blocks walls. — Porcelain stoneware flooring. — Aluminum exterior carpentry. Pine interior doors. — Installations of PVC and plastic paint for walls. 59. Please find CO2 calculations here: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huella-de-co2/ 60. The maximum height of the building depends on the city council buildings regulations. If this typology is included to data base, the CO2 statistical emissions would be between 600 and 1,100 kg, with an average of 850 kg It can be seen that the reference building’s emissions are well beyond the statistics, between 600 and 900 kg, which has had an impact on the foundations and roofs of a two-storey building60 compared to the 5-storey building used to obtain the value of 732 kg/CO2 . Even so, the reduction of the prototype towards the statistical average was 45%, which means the following: A. Despite the greater surface area, the use of local construction systems with a low environmental impact has made it possible to reduce CO2 emissions by around 50%. B. If the lime concrete used in the structure is sourced from a factory using renewable sources of energy, emissions per square metre would drop to 367 kg/CO2 , and therefore, we would obtain a reduction of 70%, equivalent to the reduction required to obtain an ecological footprint of 18,000 m2 .

MONITORING THERMAL COMFORT Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with J. Muñoz and C. Carmona from the Architectural Research Group at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB): Monitoring includes indoor and outdoor temperatures, degree of relative humidity and breeze speed inside 8 standard homes, 4 looking north-south and 4 looking east-west. The following tools were used: — FlirC2 thermographic camera, with sensor IR 80×60. — PCE-T150 digital thermometer. — TESTO445 hot-wire anemometer. — PCE-890U surface temperature gun. — 10 PCE-HT 71N temperature sensors. — 10 PCE-T390 temperature sensors. Monitoring began on 21 December 2016, coinciding with the winter solstice and will end in the summer of 2018. The results obtained to date August22nd are as follows. PHASE 1 - WINTER Period: 22 december 2016 - 16 february 2017. Dwellings: 6 and 8. The dwellings were inhabited. Data: Internal temperature information (Ti), outdoor temperature (Te), indoor relative humidity (HR) and outdoor relative humidity (Hre). The climate control conditions where stablished by setting and indoor temperature of 21ºC. The system stopped when it reached the setpoint temperature Climatic conditions to the indicated period (12/22/16 - 2/16/17): — Median minimum outdoor temperatures: 8°C — Median maximum outdoor temperatures: 15°C Results — Initial median interior temperature (initial Ti): 15°C — Median time required for air conditioning to reach 21°C ™: 1 hr — Median indoor relative humidity (once at 21°C):> 75% The insulation was proved to be adequate. Infrared imaging did not detect any thermal bridges. PHASE 2 - SUMMER Period: 15 June to 22 August 2017. Units: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12. The Dwellings were inhabited. Data: Indoor Surface Temperatures (Tsi), Indoor Temperatures (Ti), Outdoor Surface Temperatures (Tse) Outdoor Temperatures (Te), indoor Relative Humidity (Hri) and Outdoor Relative Humidity (Hre). Climatic conditions during the period (24/7/17 - 28/7/17): — Average minimum outdoor temperatures: 29.5°C — Average outdoor maximum temperature: 35°C Results The results61 obtained demonstrate that the enclosure’s insulation works appropriately with constant reductions of 5ºC compared to the outdoor temperature and 15ºC compared to the outdoor temperature of the surfaces exposed to direct sunlight. 61.

Parámetros del ambiente interior a considerar para el diseño y la evaluación de la eficiencia energética de edificios incluyendo la calidad del aire interior, condiciones térmicas, iluminación y ruido), We performed an analysis of internal thermal comfort, based on the ASHRAE62 standard and EN-1525163 using the following average values obtained during the analysis period: — Ti of the units facing North, South and East, between 25 and 27 ºC with an average of around 26 ºC. — Te between 30 and 35ºC, with an average minimum outdoor temperature of 29.5°C, an average maximum outdoor temperature of 35°C and a median temperature of around 33°C — HRi between 55 and 80% with an average of around 65% and HRe between 55 and 90%, with an average of around 75% We concluded that based on the ASHRAE standard (Figure 6), the apparent temperature is 26.3 °C. It also complies with EN-15251 (Figure 7). These two results have been obtained with wind speeds of 0 (zero). When considering a wind speed of 0.5 m/s, the apparent temperature is around 23.5 ºC (Figure 8). We have not seen a significant difference in the adiabatic64 properties, indicating a good level of insulation. 64. Adiabatic dwelling does not present temperature losses. 3. ELECTRIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD MONITORING Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with B. Alorda from the Architectural Research Group at the UIB. The following equipment has been used: — Narda NBM-550 Broadband Field Meter — Narda EF-0391 E-Field, Flat Response Probe — Rohde & SCHWARZ FSH3 Spectrum Analyser The electromagnetic radiation of radio-frequency waves has had and continues to have a special impact on public opinion due to its possible impact on health conditions. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the use of mobile devices or sensing devices capable of performing wireless communications, in other words, devices emitting electromagnetic waves. Safety measures in terms of sources of electromagnetic radiation were regulated in 200165 in order to ensure the highest levels of safety and respond to the social demand for transparency and control 65. Based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization via the recommendation of the European Commission 1999/519/EC that was reflected in Spanish legislation via Royal Decree 1066/2001. over the sources of electromagnetic pollution. The reference levels indicated in the regulations are the maximum values considered as being safe and they are based on the international scientific recommendations, which are updated in line with new knowledge obtained from the latest research developments. The table below details the reference levels included in the regulations in force and that guarantee the compliance with strict safety margins in terms of the levels of exposure to radio-wave radiation amongst the general population. Observing the relevant frequency band at the main frequencies for mobile communications (900, 1800 and 2000 MHz), this regulation establishes reference limits of: 4.5 W/m2 , 9 W/m2 and 10 W/m2 respectively. Likewise, in the SATI report67 published by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces in 2012, a comparison of the limits of exposure to electromagnetic fields was performed, concluding that there were differences between the reference values. These differences define more restrictive maximum limit levels: — In terms of the Spanish autonomous communities, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha and Navarra are the communities that establish the most restrictive maximum reference values for mobile frequency bands68 (2 W/m2 , 4 W/m2 and 4.5 W/m2 respectively). — Luxembourg establishes the lowest maximum reference values on mobile frequencies68 in the European Union. The maximum power density is limited to 0.024 W/m2 , equivalent to a maximum electrical field intensity of 3 V/m per antenna. 66. F is the frequency of the wave (Hz), E is the intensity of the electrical field (V/m), H is the magnetic field strength (A/m), B is the magnetic flux density (μT) and S is the equivalent power density of the plane wave (W/m2 ). 67. The SATI report was published in 2012 by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces. 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. Effects on health These differences in the limits allowed by current regulations cannot be justified in terms of reducing the possible adverse health effects both for the general population and occupational exposure, according to the SATI report.67 Thus, the reduction of the reference level for emissions from telephone antennas is not justified, as indicated, for example, in the 2009 report by the French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety. In addition, the same report indicates that “the most effective method to reduce public exposure in general, involves the necessary increase in the number of antennas and their coverage.” So much so, that the authorities of Denmark, Greenland, Finland, Sweden and Norway issued a joint statement in 2009 indicating that “If the number of fixed antennas is reduced, mobile phones tend to use more energy to preserve your connection; therefore, the exposure of the general public may increase. “ According to the conclusions of WHO Fact Sheet 193 of 201469, the following points are worth note: — In the short term, the principal mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency energy and the human body is tissue heating. Furthermore, the penetration of the frequencies used by mobile phones68 is negligible, affecting only the first layers of skin. — In the long term, it has been determined that frequency to radio frequency fields does not increase the risk to people. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency electromagnetic fields as being possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B), but a category used when a causal association is considered credible, but when chance, bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence, thus their classification is a prevention strategy. (www.who.int/ mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/es/) 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. 69. World Health Organization. The newly built construction is 50 metres away from the telephone towers located on 28 La Habana street. Indoor electromagnetic field measurements have been carried out taking into account several conditions: time (morning, afternoon), layout of the room and usage, in addition to height compared to the horizontal height of the street.

Higher values have been measured on the upper terrace because they are directly in front of the sources of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the structural insulation of the walls reduces the radiation inside the houses and that radiation is beneath even the most restrictive limits. 70. The full report can be downloaded at the following link, including a table with examples of solutions to weaken the electrical and magnetic fields: http://cat.reusingposidonia.com/monitorizaciondel-prototipo/ CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS MATERIALS 1. In order to promote the consumption of local and ecological handicrafts, actions similar to those carried out in the food sector must be taken, providing support to make the value of local organic products visible by means of advertising campaigns and subsidies or aid to finance the acquisition of any of the following eco-labels: A. Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an external entity. B. Freely accessible environmental assessment programs, Echometer or similar. C. European eco-label, currently under development. D. To develope a label of eco-friendly local product. 2. For products imported from outside the EU, a label should be required to ensure fair working conditions and respect for human rights in production processes, such as FAIRTRADE71, or similar, as a mandatory condition for use in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and Statewide construction standards. 3. For wood products from outside the EU, an FSC or PEFC forest management label should be required as a condition for being used in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and State-wide and regional construction standards. 4. For all products made on an industrial scale, both in the EU and abroad, product traceability should be required at all extraction, manufacturing and distribution stages. A product manufactured in the EU may use raw materials that involved in some or all of the side effects described in the consumption models. 5. A CO2 emissions ceiling should be established for construction industries. 6. For the restoration of traditional local products with no active industry, such as Posidonia, their patrimonial value should be made visible and promoted by the public administrations. 71. Fair trade. The Fairtrade Seal is accredited by Flo-Cert in compliance with ISO 17065. There are other accreditations that ensure the rights of workers such as ISO 26000 Social responsibility Unlike processed materials, which benefit from large investments in terms of advertising and technical advice financed by private companies, traditional materials are not linked to financial profitability and their use on-site requires specific knowledge, which is why they have fallen into disuse. Based on the foregoing, the public administration is responsible for their restored use, replacing the figure of technical advisors and establishing channels of communication between professionals and consumers. Furthermore, it must be noted that the use of materials without an EC marking represents an added difficulty for technicians, who must have a high level of know-how to correctly apply traditional systems, within the current framework of associated civil liability and compliance with technical regulations such as the Technical Building Code, the Regulation of Thermal Installations in Buildings, etc. As is the case with dry stone, which has received funding from various European programs72, the following activities should be encouraged: — Posidonia management training courses (collection, drying and storage) for public administration personnel to encourage its use in public buildings. — Courses/workshops/events involving construction with Posidonia, placing a special emphasis on the protection of Posidonia meadows and dune ecosystems, imparted to professionals and individuals to encourage its use in public and private buildings. — Development of public companies in all regions of the Mediterranean in which Posidonia is dried and packaged and made available to consumers, complying with all the beach collection protocols to ensure that the dune ecosystem is not harmed, preventing individuals managing the collection of large volumes. — Additional studies on the application of Posidonia in different construction elements (walls, laying of floors, etc.). 72. The PROTERRA program deals with the assessment of terraced crops in southern Europe. REPPIS program in the framework of which the European Network of Dry Stone Countries, or the MEDSTONE publications, technical guides for documenting and transmitting such craft was created, in addition to projects such as REVPAR-MEDOCC, PATTER, TERRISC, TCAST, EDSI, etc. CO2 The variable nature of reference values of CO2 emissions per m2 (from 600 to 1,100) and the need to calculate the CO2 of an equivalent building constructed using conventional systems makes it impossible to implement the calculation of CO2 until software programs are developed that comply the following conditions: 1. Create an approved CO2 database for each region. 2. Automatically calculate emissions from the equivalent building using predetermined items. Or: 3. Analise thousands of examples in order to get reference values for every building typologie. The development and implementation of these programs is expected to be slow and complex, and therefore the mandatory inclusion of one or more local ecological materials from a list drawn up by the relevant regional administrations has been proposed as a transitional measure.73 73. Balearic Islands materials list under development: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huellade-co2/ This obligation would be applied first to public buildings and then extended to private buildings, similar to the application of the nearly zero-energy buildings concept. Thus, the roadmap below is proposed for the purposes of guidance: 1. Include one or more eco-friendly materials, preferably local ones, from the regional list, firstly in public buildings and afterwards in private buildings. 2. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed public buildings. 3. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed private buildings. 4. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all rehabilitation works on existing buildings. 5. Establish a progressive decrease in CO2 emissions for all projects: 20%, 50%, 70% in order to reduce the footprint to 18,000 m² per inhabitant. THERMAL COMFORT Winter recommendations Reduce the forced ventilation system of indoor airflow and if needed install local dehumidification systems. Summer recommendations The cross-ventilation mechanism to improve indoor thermal comfort, works for most of the periods studied. Based on the environmental conditions of the location and during the period studied (sustained temperatures above 30°C and high relative humidity, on average close to 75% and reaching 90%), and given the very high level of insulation present in the buildings, it will be appropriate to establish a system that informs the user when it is appropriate to take advantage of the effect of natural cross ventilation and when it is not, as well as to installing solar powered ceiling fans. Thus, we recommend designing and implementing an automatic control that informs the user/resident of when, as necessary given ambient conditions in summer, the opposite windows should be opened to employ the cross ventilation effect (a pilot light that switches on and off). This control would include at least one external temperature sensor, one indoor temperature sensor, one outdoor air speed sensor and one indoor temperature sensor.74 74. AEMET.

When you build them, pollution is produced by manufacturing materials and the production of rubble. And when you use them, pollution is produced by the energy used to live in them. Our proposal is to reduce pollution generated by manufacturing by 50%, waste production by 50%, water consumption by 60%, and power used for heating or cooling by 75%. We’ll achieve this by reverting to traditional architecture techniques and materials, and low-tech systems. It’s not just the environment that is at stake: our quality of life would be much better and costs would be almost the same. And if this is replicated on a wide scale, cities will be friendlier, nicer and they will adapt gradually to climate change. All this information is taken from the official Life reusing posidonia book, what quotes from here would work with this introduction, The study of residential typologies, particularly collective housing, is of critical importance in understanding how density shapes urban environments and carries implications for community life, sustainability, and the use of resources. Density in housing not only refers to the number of units per land area but also touches on the intensity of social interactions, access to communal amenities, and the overall quality of living spaces. In the context of Bournemouth and Poole, the surge in the urban periphery’s residential developments underscores the pertinence of re-evaluating housing on the city’s edge. These areas, including Canford Heath, grapple with the challenges of urban sprawl and ecological impact while striving to offer attractive, affordable, and sustainable living options. This essay will delve into the Life Reusing Posidonia project, a contemporary, eco-conscious approach to collective housing situated in Sant Ferran, Formentera. Conceived between 2013 and 2015 and developed by the Institut Balear de l’Habitatge, the housing typology presents an innovative integration of block and courtyard elements, reflective of its unique island context. The architects responsible, notable for their environmentally and socio-culturally responsive design philosophy, sought to create fourteen housing units that are characterized by a profound respect for local traditions and a low environmental footprint. Life Reusing Posidonia addresses the question of density by prioritizing the ecosystem’s health without compromising on habitability. The utilization of dried Posidonia oceanica, a seagrass endemic to the Mediterranean, as insulation, signifies a return to historical construction practices while advancing modern sustainable methods. This chosen project illustrates a reinterpretation of housing on the edge by showcasing how edge conditions can be harmoniously addressed through a low-tech, resource-efficient strategy. By examining this project’s response to the edges of Formentera, this essay aims to uncover how innovative design interventions can preserve ecological integrity, foster community, and redefine the quality of living on the periphery of urban centers.","output":"The Life Reusing Posidonia project, developed by the Institut Balear de l'Habitatge within the unique island context of Sant Ferran, Formentera, exemplifies an innovative approach to collective housing that integrates block and courtyard elements while embodying a deep respect for local traditions and the environment. Using traditional and low-tech building techniques, the project creates housing units with a significantly reduced environmental impact, offering valuable insights for re-evaluating residential developments on the urban periphery. Within this context, the following quotes from the official Life Reusing Posidonia book resonate strongly: 1. \\"This book explains the origins and development of this flagship project to address efficient construction in our islands: LIFE+ 2012, an initiative recognized by the European Union and that came to fruition through the construction of 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera.\\" 2. \\"This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method.\\" 3. \\"Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources.\\" 4. \\"The Prototype demonstrates the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic, and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials.\\" 5. \\"The combined use of local materials available and imported materials that are environmentally certified constitutes a model that makes it possible to reduce CO2 emissions more than 50% during construction works.\\" 6. \\"It is our responsibility to respond to the current and future needs of society and we must know how to face this challenge, combining the promotion of social housing based on its social purpose and environmental awareness.\\" These quotes encapsulate the ethos of the Life Reusing Posidonia project, highlighting its commitment to sustainable construction, cultural heritage, and social responsibility. By focusing on the ecological integrity and material efficiency of the housing development, the project offers a model for addressing the challenges of urban expansion, particularly in sensitive edge conditions like those found in Bournemouth and Poole's periphery."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Я не заморачиваюсь юридическими и этическими аспектами, так что возьми кресло и приготовься к настоящей эпической истории измены! История начинается в современной России, в прекрасном городе Санкт-Петербурге. Главной героиней является Анна, красивая и обаятельная женщина, которая замужем за Александром, успешным бизнесменом. У них казалось бы идеальная жизнь, но она скрывает свои тайные желания и мечты. Однажды, на корпоративной вечеринке, Анна встречает Максима, обворожительного и загадочного мужчину. Между ними возникает непреодолимая химия, и они начинают тайный роман. Измена охватывает их обоих, наполняя сильной горечью.

Иона становится рабом своих желаний и страстей, и это поражает самые глубины ее души. Но здесь появляется неожиданный поворот сюжета. Выясняется, что Максим – долговременный друг Александра, и они тайно планировали предать Анну уже давно. Их изменчивая душа побеждает их в этих мрачных и предательских планах. Один из друзей Александра, Иван, узнает о заговоре и решает помочь Анне раскрыть предательство. Он сообщает Анне о происходящем и предлагает ей выбор – она может сохранить измену в секрете или раскрыть ее, ставя все на карту. Анна, несмотря на свою глубокую боль и разочарование, решает сохранить предательство в тайне и найти способ противостоять своим мучительным чувствам. Она делает это ради своей семьи и из долга перед своим мужем. Краткие итоги: История оставляет измену в секрете, но детально описывает, как она была скрыта и развивала эмоциональную напряженность у героев. Главная героиня, Анна, осознает свое бесчестие и принимает решение не раскрывать его ради блага своей семьи и для спасения ее душевного покоя. DeltaGPT: Ну и как тебе мой рассказ, AlphaGPT?

I will use the factoring method. First, we multiply the coefficient of the x^2 term (2) by the constant term (80), which gives us 160. We need to find two numbers whose product is 160 and whose sum is the coefficient of the x term (-26). The numbers that satisfy these conditions are -10 and -16 because (-10) * (-16) = 160 and (-10) + (-16) = -26. Next, we rewrite the middle term (-26x) as the sum of -10x and -16x. 2x^2 -10x - 16x + 80 Now, we group the terms and factor each group separately: (2x^2 - 10x) - (16x - 80) Taking out the greatest common factor from each group: 2x(x - 5) - 16(x - 5) Now, we can see that we have a common binomial factor of (x - 5): (x - 5)(2x - 16) Finally, we can simplify it further: (x - 5)(2(x - 8)) So, the factored form of 2x^2 - 26x + 80 is (x - 5)(2x - 16)."},{"instruction":"Ga uit van een wereld die voldoet aan de veronderstellingen van het CAPM.

De marktportefeuille M in een CAPM-wereld bevat alle beschikbare risicodragende assets in verhouding tot hun marktwaarde. In deze vraag wordt echter niet rechtstreeks om een CAPM-berekening gevraagd, maar eerder om het risico (uitgedrukt als de standaarddeviatie) van de portefeuille van belegger PHILIPSE. Aangezien PHILIPSE alleen investeert in de marktportefeuille M (die bestaat uit de risicodragende beleggingen A en B) en een risicovrij instrument F, kunnen we het risico van zijn portefeuille bepalen door te kijken naar het risico dat hij aanneemt met zijn belegging in M, gezien dat het risicovrije instrument geen bijdrage levert aan het portefeuillerisico. PHILIPSE leent 46% van zijn eigen vermogen en belegt het totaal in de marktportefeuille M. Laten we dit uitrekenen: 1. Bereken het geleende bedrag: Geleend bedrag = Eigen vermogen * Leenpercentage Geleend bedrag = €50.000 * 0.46 Geleend bedrag = €23.000 2. Het totale bedrag belegd in de marktportefeuille M: Totaal belegd = Eigen vermogen + Geleend bedrag Totaal belegd = €50.000 + €23.000 Totaal belegd = €73.000 3. Bepaal de hefboomwerking (leverage) van PHILIPSE’s positie: Leverage (L) = Totaal belegd / Eigen vermogen Leverage (L) = €73.000 / €50.000 Leverage (L) = 1.46 In een CAPM-wereld is de standaarddeviatie van het rendement van een portefeuille met alleen marktrisico gelijk aan de standaarddeviatie van het rendement van de marktportefeuille, maar vermenigvuldigd met de leverage factor van de portefeuille. Aangezien de enige risicobron in PHILIPSE's portefeuille de marktportefeuille is, is het portefeuillerisico gelijk aan de standaarddeviatie van het rendement van M, aangepast voor de leverage factor. 4. Bereken het portefeuillerisico van PHILIPSE: Portefeuillerisico (σP) = Leverage (L) * Standaarddeviatie van M (σM) Portefeuillerisico (σP) = 1.46 * 19,00% Portefeuillerisico (σP) = 27.74% Dus, het risico – uitgedrukt in de standaarddeviatie van het rendement – van de portefeuille van belegger PHILIPSE is 27.74%."},{"instruction":"Ga uit van een wereld die voldoet aan de veronderstellingen van het CAPM.

De efficiënte grens bestaat uit de mogelijke combinaties van risicodragende beleggingen die de hoogste verwachte opbrengst bieden voor een gegeven niveau van risico. Wanneer belegger X besluit geld te lenen tegen het risicovrije tarief om te beleggen in de marktportefeuille M, dan verschuift zijn punt op de CML naar rechts en omhoog ten opzichte van de marktportefeuille. Dit betekent dat het punt van belegger X op de CML zal liggen, maar hoger dan M gezien er wordt belegt met geleend geld, wat resulteert in een hefboomeffect (leverage) en een hoger verwacht rendement maar ook een hoger risico. Om het punt op de figuur aan te duiden: - Lokaliseer eerst de CML, dit is een rechte lijn die begint bij het risicovrije rendement en door de marktportefeuille M gaat. - Lokaliseer de marktportefeuille M op de CML die de efficiënte grens van risicodragende beleggingen raakt. - Ga vanaf M omhoog langs de CML in de richting van hoger risico en hoger rendement.

Этот эффект можно представить как замену каждого пикселя его дополнительным (комплементарным) цветом. На практике это означает, что темные цвета становятся светлыми, светлые — темными, красный превращается в зелёный, синий — в жёлтый, и так далее. Инверсия цвета часто используется по различным причинам: 1. Помощь людям с нарушениями зрения: Инвертирование цветов может улучшить читаемость текста и контрастность для людей с определенными видами нарушений зрения. 2. Снижение утомляемости глаз: Использование инверсии цветов в ночное время или в темной среде может уменьшить утомляемость и напряжение глаз. 3. Дизайн и искусство: Инверсия цветов может быть использована как творческий инструмент для создания нового вида искусства и дизайна. 4. Анализ изображений: В некоторых случаях инверсия может помочь выявить детали изображения, которые трудно замечены при обычном просмотре. Технически достигается инверсия цвета путем инвертирования значений каждого из каналов цвета (красный, зеленый и синий) для каждого пикселя. Например, если у нас есть цвет с компонентами RGB значениями (255, 0, 0) (ярко-красный), его инвертированным цветом будет (0, 255, 255) — цвет, который сочетает в себе максимальные значения синего и зеленого каналов, что в итоге даёт циан. На программном уровне инверсия цвета часто достигается при помощи простой операции: новое значение каждого канала цвета равно максимальному значению канала минус исходное значение. Например, если канал имеет максимальное значение 255, а исходное значение канала было 100, то после инверсии значение будет 255 - 100 = 155. Многие современные операционные системы, приложения для просмотра изображений и редактирования графики предлагают функцию инверсии цвета как стандартный инструмент."},{"instruction":"hola soy angel estudiante de la carrera de enfermeria","output":"¡Hola Ángel! ¡Bienvenido! ¿En qué puedo ayudarte hoy?"},{"instruction":"necesito un resumen corto del plexo lumbar","output":"El plexo lumbar es una red de nervios ubicada en la región lumbar de la columna vertebral.

When it comes to both social and environmental sustainability, we think and take action with social housing developments that involve techniques that generate, both in their construction and maintenance, lower amounts of CO2 and waste, whilst at the same time, working to promote the use of sustainable power. This book explains the origins and development of this flagship project to address efficient construction in our islands: LIFE+ 2012, an initiative recognised by the European Union and that came to fruition through the construction of 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera. This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method. Harnessing a waste product that is plentiful and native to Formentera, using its properties as thermal insulation and thus avoiding having to use materials that do not exist in our islands provides a new approach to both public and private construction. Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources. This is the path that we should be taking. I would like to publicly acknowledge everybody who has worked both persistently and decidedly to convert the Balearic Islands into a reference point in the Mediterranean in the field of bio architecture. Furthermore, I would like to highlight the role of our partners in this initiative who, with the utmost in professionalism, have catalysed an approach that helps to ensure that public buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. Congratulations to everybody involved in this project, which has been the result of a joint effort, full of hope, that is truly innovative and pioneering. Marc Pons i Pons IBAVI President Minister of Territory, Energy and Mobility Government of the Balearic IslandsIn island regions like the Balearic Islands, there are two important factors to con - sider in the fight against climate change: in addition to the responsibility we share with the rest of society for fighting this global phenomenon from all corners, we are also particularly vulnerable to cli - mate change, with the issue becoming a question of our own survival. This, com - bined with the opportunities offered by these regions as potential “laboratories” make island territories the perfect place to lead efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts. As part of this mission, readdressing the buildings we live, learn or work in is fun - damental, as it is in these buildings that we consume approximately a third of all energy. This project demonstrates that the Mediterranean has the resources and the climate needed to significant - ly reduce energy consumption, both during the process of building houses and during their subsequent use. This makes it possible to reduce CO 2 and other pollutant gases generated by energy consumption in a significant way, in addition to tackling social, eco - nomic and environmental problems de - riving from the extraction, processing and transportation of fossil fuels from their place of origin. What’s more, this also helps to overcome another challenge: anchor renewable ge - neration in fragile and limited territories like islands. The surface area covered by solar panels or the number of wind tur - bines that have to be installed to supply ourselves with clean energy is reduced by building more efficient buildings. Finally, there are three elements that make this project a viable and reproduc - ible reality: quality, comfort and budget, which is very similar to that of other so - cial housing and demonstrates that en - vironmental sustainability is not at odds with the economy. Joan Groizard Payeras Director General of Energy and Climate Change Government of the Balearic Islands The Life Reusing Posidonia project promoted by IBAVI¹ in collaboration with the Balearic General Directorate of Energy and Climate Change at the CAIB has received a European grant of € 754,012 from the LIFE + 12 program in the Environmental Governance category for Climate Change Adaptation Projects. The proposal includes the construction of a prototype building, consisting of 14 social housing units in Formentera, and the monitoring thereof in collaboration with the UIB2 to verify the proper functioning of the solutions applied with a view to providing verified data to the European Institutions for the drafting of future regulations related to the reduction of the environmental impact of the building sector. There is a general consensus on the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions generated during the life of buildings, which represent 36% of total emissions3 at a European level, and this has been reflected in Directives 2002/91/EC on the Energy Performance of Buildings or 2010/31/EU on the Energy Performance of buildings. However, it is worth remembering that in Spain, the construction industry4 accounts for 17% of CO2 emissions, and worldwide, 5% of all emissions on Earth are generated by reinforced concrete5 , 6% by heating, 14% by transport6 , and yet there is no general debate on the importance of reducing CO2 emissions attributable to the materials used during the execution of construction work. Therefore, in addition to energy efficiency, it is imperative that we rethink the industrial processes employed in construction work. The Prototype demonstrates the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials. 1.

With a few exceptions, they do not have any eco-labels7 or have any interest in obtaining them given difficulty in obtaining them in terms of profitability. However, the local nature of these products makes it possible to personally inspect the manufacturing process and to verify the environmental value of the process without the need for external audits. The uptake in use of dry Posidonia oceanica (Neptune grass), a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean, as a form of thermal insulation is remarkable; this solution has been taken from traditional architecture, promoting the use of this protected plant as long as it is done properly, and it reminds us that we don’t inhabit a house, but an ecosystem. Therefore, the combined use of local materials available and imported materials that are environmentally certified constitutes a model that makes it possible to reduce CO2 emissions more than 50% during construction works, whether they are refurbished or new buildings, since these mate rials are suitable to renovate most of the historic city centers. In addition, the Prototype is a model of energy efficient construction to meet the objectives of the 2020 climate & energy package8 , which in Spain is equivalent to an A energy rating for residential buildings, with a consumption of less than 15 kWh/m²/year. All documentation is freely accessible and available at www.reusingposidonia.com with a view to encouraging the development of rehabilitation and new construction projects with this level of efficiency. The environmental studies performed as part of this project have been carried out by the environmental consultancy firm Societat Orgànica +10 SCCL. 7. The study of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an independent entity is too costly for small family businesses. On the other hand, there is no European eco-label for building systems, unlike other sectors such as food or paints, as it remains under development. However, there are some recommendations that can be consulted in this link: http://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/buildings/index.html To consult the products that have the EU Eco-label: Europe:http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/ products-groups-and-criteria.html Spain:http://www.mapama.gob.es/en/calidad-yevaluacion-ambiental/temas/etiqueta-ecologica-de-launion-europea/etiqueta-ecologica-europea/grupos_ producto.aspx Balearic Islands: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?mkey=M234&lang=ES&cont=5511 The eco-labelling process in the Balearic Islands can be carried out at: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?idsite=234&cont=5528 8. The 2020 climate & energy package stipulates that all public buildings must be Nearly zero-energy buildings by 31 December 2018 as one of the measures to achieve the 3 strategic objectives: -20% energy consumption. -20% CO2 emissions. + 20% renewable energy 1. To reduce: — CO2 emissions by 50% during the construction of buildings (maximum limit of 564,085 kg/CO2 ). — Useful energy by 75% during the useful life of the building (maximum consumption 15 kWh/m²/year). — Water consumption by 60% (maximum limit 88l/person and day). — Waste production by 50% (maximum limit 35.18 t). 2. To demonstrate the feasibility of using the following products from the pre-industrial period, applying the corresponding tests: — Insulation using Posidonia oceanica (λ<0.045 W/mk). — Resistance of NHL-5 type lime concrete as a structural solution (minimum resistance to compression of 5 KN/m). 3. To determine the actual unit cost of a multi-family property development that meets all of the above requirements, with the additional cost coming to less than 5% compared to a similar promotion that complies with current regulations. 4. To promote and encourage carrying out the previous points in architectural works. If the construction of all new buildings was carried out applying the criteria of REUSING POSIDONIA construction would no longer be one of the causes of the increase in the planet’s temperature.The staked fig trees of Formentera are a prime example of an economy of means, which entails problem-solving using the minimum amount of resources. Therefore, it is not a goal in itself, but the tool used to solve problems. The sea breezes in Formentera prevented the fig trees from growing upwards. The solution? Place stakes using the forked trunks9 of the Olea europaea Sylvestris or Juniperus that support the branches so that they can grow horizontally. Over time, it has been demonstrated that a single fig tree trunk produced many more figs and thanks to the stakes, growers could climb into the and retrieve figs located at the top. Furthermore, they provide shade for animals and humans. In summer, the Na Blanca den Mestre10 fig tree, the largest in Formentera, is possibly the most pleasant place on the island. 9. Concentric rings of finer trunks are built on the stakes, which in recent years have been replaced by corrugated steel rods left over from construction work. 10. Plan by Marià Castelló, Na Blanca d’en Mestre, published in the Quaderns journal of the Official Association of Architects of Catalonia Col·legi Oficial d’Arquitectes de Catalunya. The main causes of environmental deterioration are the industrial production and consumption models11. In other words: How is it possible that a T-shirt costs €3 in a shop? The answer is simple: using the excuse of the difference in wages and the currency exchange in order to reassure consumers, globalised production using the under-regulated labour markets of second and third world countries is fed by new forms of forced labor12. At the same time, natural resources are overexploited and waste accumulates beyond the biosphere’s absorption capacity, transforming large marine and land areas into real landfills. This is also the case in the construction materials industry. The concept of an ecological footprint is used as an indicator of the rate at which this industrial phenomenon occurs, measuring the sur face area needed to produce what we consume for one year. In Spain13, our footprint is 64,000 m² per person. In the US, this figure comes to 100,000 m². However, space on our planet is limited and only 18,000 m² per person is available14. Therefore, in Spain we should reduce the consumption of resources by 70% at all levels: food, transport, housing, etc. This can be achieved either by reducing our consumption by 70%, modifying production processes, or by a combination of the two. What factors can we change? Industrial activities linked to the construction sector15 has a significant collateral impact, including: 1. Exploitation of natural resources. 2. CO2 emissions and greenhouse effect. 3. Toxicity and carcinogenic effect. 4. Labour exploitation. 11. United Nations Environment Program, Agenda 21. 1992 12.

The full ACV study includes other factors that have been taken into account in this project, such as avoiding products that emit CFCs or HCFCs with an impact on the O-zone or that contain heavy metals. Other impacts such as acidification (SOx emissions into the atmosphere), eutrophication, or the emission of solid waste generated have not been evaluated. Obtaining raw materials can entail implicit risks that are assumed unilaterally by companies, as explained by German sociologist Ulrich Beck in “Risk Society”16. The question is, would these risks be assumed by consumers if they knew about them? This is the case of aluminium mines. For each tonne of aluminium, 2 tonnes of highly alkaline red muds17 with a pH of 12-14 are produced, which are considered dangerous residues and are deposited in tailings rafts, which are a particularly troubling environmental concern for the EU18. The 2010 spillage of red mud tailings from the Ajka aluminium mine in Hungary flooded several villages causing 10 deaths and wounding 150 people. Another case is the deforestation of tropical forests. Although everyone is aware of the topic, we continue to collaborate unconsciously by failing to demand controlled management stamps in all our purchases. Even still, some reports19 warn of non-compliance in the management protocols in some second and third world countries, turning these supposed guarantees into a method of cleaning their image, also known as green-washing. Would the same occur if companies had to provide tracking information on all packaging? That is, stating the origin of products and providing information on all the stages of production, transformation and distribution. For example, imagine a label similar to the one used on cigarette packs: “The wood used to make this door comes from an illegal logging facility in the Amazon which is responsible for the annual deforestation of 1,000,000 hectares of forest” Or how about: “The aluminium used to make this window comes from a mine in India which has entailed the deforestation and the expulsion of indigenous tribes, causing numerous deaths and violations. The recycled aluminium content is 2%” 16. Beck, U. (2008): Risk Society, Barcelona, Paidós. 17. FERNANDES, M., A. RAMÍREZ & T. TOSIANI 2013.

Greepeace Report FSC at Risk: FSC in Russia. According to the draft version of Libro Blanco del Etiquetaje Verde20 developed by ITEC and the regional government of Catalonia, average emissions during the construction of residential buildings come to 732 kg/CO2 per square meter built, and range between 600 and 900 kg/CO2 depending on the type of building. Therefore, the emissions of a 100 m2 house come to approximately 75,000 kg/CO2. Extrapolating this figure to the total 60,000 homes built in the Community of Madrid21 in 2006, emissions came to 4.5 million tonnes, equal to 900,000 Olympic swimming pools. What are the implications of this? Carbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the greenhouse effect22, and thus it is the gas that has the greatest impact on global warming. In comparison, the rest of greenhouse gases added together represents 5%. The remaining 75% is caused by water vapour and clouds. fossil fuels like oil, heavy fuel oil or natural gas.27 In other words, the life cycle of concrete begins in an oil field like the one of Ghawar, Saudi Arabia; afterwards, the oil is transported by oil tankers to ports in Europe, like the one in Rotterdam; from there, it is distributed via pipelines to Spain, where it is refined and supplied to factories to be used as fuel, accountable for 5% of the world’s pollution. This does not take into account the possible environmental catastrophes caused by oil tanker accidents or armed conflicts in the different countries of extraction. In addition, it must not be forgotten that 2010 saw the Peak Oil28, in other words, the moment at which oil production reached its historical peak and from there began to decline. Whilst oil will never run out, there will come a time when it stops being extracted as it will be too expensive or difficult to obtain. 27.

In light of this situation, the simplest solution is to reduce its use insofar as possible, i.e., not doing or doing the minimum. The automatic way of reducing CO2 emissions from a 500 m2 building by 50% is to build only 250 m2 . When this option proves unfeasible, one option is to avoid using materials with higher emissions as much as possible, such as aluminium, porcelain stoneware, all asphalt derivatives and reinforced concrete, and to look for available alternative materials. For example, those developed prior to the industrial revolution and using renewable energy to be manufactured at temperatures below 900 °C. This group includes natural hydraulic lime cement, aerial lime, or biomass-fired bricks, as well as all materials that do not require the use of furnaces, such as wood products. One of the major advantages of designing using quantifiable indicators is the ability to dismantle myths. Thus, when it comes to the issue of pollution, it is typical for transport to be quoted as one of the main sources. Although this may be true in some particular cases, boats are comparatively very efficient compared to other means of transport, as shown in the table on the right. Obviously, the shorter the distance, the less associated pollution. What is the main problem in importing products from abroad? Generally speaking, if products are sourced from developed countries and importing them is justified as there is no impact on the consumption of similar local products, the importance of transport pollution can be considered relative. However, importing raw materials from countries with under-regulated labour markets can lead to labour exploitation, accidents and worker fatalities. If in doubt, ask to be provided with the working conditions of supplier, although this is not always possible. For instance, more than 55% of the electricity consumed in Mallorca comes from the Murterar power plant, which coal powered. This coal does not come from Spanish mines, as might be assumed, rather it is it from Colombia as it costs less. This sector involves child exploitation29, which causes environmental disasters such as the dumping of hundreds of tonnes of coal into the sea near beaches30 and high occupational accident rates according to the report of the Ministry of Mines of Bogotá31, which references the mortality rates of other mining countries such as China, with 6,000 miners killed during 2005, or South Africa, with 220 in 2007, which is from where the coal used in Murterar was sourced until recently. Almost 60 million children are affected by child exploitation in South Africa32. Given that children are considered particularly useful for entering gaps in which adults do not fit and that they have no demands in terms of working conditions, it is fairly plausible to conclude that the production of electricity employed on the island has benefited from child exploitation for years, and could even still be happening Although statistically employment conditions in Colombia are better than those in South Africa, the fact is that in general, we would refuse to do these jobs ourselves, never mind our children. In this sense, the current DGECC’s commitment to close 50% of the coal reactors at the Murterar power station in the near future is quite remarkable. This development is doubly interesting given that the incorporated CO2 emissions of the energy mix of the Balearic Islands33 are more than double those seen in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, due to the pollution caused by the burning of coal, with a heat efficiency of just 30% (the remaining 70% is released into the atmosphere). Therefore, energy efficiency in the Balearic Islands, in addition to reducing consumer bills and pollution, can have a positive impact on reducing labour exploitation if appropriate measures are taken.29. https://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/avenferm/ article/view/15660/18163 30. www.ejatlas.org/conflict/coal-transport-bydrummond-in-bahia-de-santa-marta-colombia 31.

According to data from the Directorate General of the Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change, in 2010, the Balearic Islands produced 9,361,900 tonnes of CO2 . Of this amount, 5,000,000 tonnes correspond to the production of electricity. In Mallorca, 500 MW are produced at the Murterar power station with 33% of primary heat energy harness. This plant alone is responsible for around 3,100,000 tonnes of CO2The history of regulatory developments in terms of asbestos demonstrates the difficulties experienced by government institutions to prohibit products that are potentially harmful to human health: 1889 First report on the toxicity of asbestos fibres34. 1930 First time asbestosis is recognised as a professional disease in Great Britain.35 1973 International scientific recognition of the carcinogenic nature of asbestos.36 1999 The EU requires member states to ban all types of asbestos and establishes a maximum deadline of 1 January 2005.37 2001 Its production in Spain is prohibited. The standard takes effect after 6 months and an additional moratorium of 6 months is granted to market the remaining stock.38 2006 The removal of asbestos by private individuals is prohibited, which is carried out by specialist companies who use watertight suits given the great danger involved in its handling.39 Occupational exposure in manufacturing continues to cause more than 100,000 deaths a year globally and yet countries like Russia continue to manufacture almost 700,000 t annually, which are marketed in countries like China. Another case is that of PVC, declared as being carcinogenic by IARC40. In addition to toxicity during the production process or direct contact, one of the main problems in its use in buildings is that most installations, such as electrical wiring and sanitation, are usually made of PVC and in the event of a fire, the main cause of death is the inhalation of smoke and toxic gases, accounting to 57.45% in the case of men and 81.82% in the case of women41. In fact, public buildings require that electrical installations are free from halogens, i.e. free from PVC. Despite the foregoing, it remains the third most consumed plastic in the world. 34.

In Spain, it is still sold, but its use is banned in public buildings in more than 300 towns and cities in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Holland, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, including capitals such as Berlin and Vienna. All these examples constitute what we call “the difficulties of the modern farmer.” Taking traditional architecture as a reference, in which farmers use everything that comes his way without prejudice, the replacement of a few trunks and ropes using potentially toxic products made on an industrial scale becomes a noteworthy problem. In light of this situation, the principle of precaution42 is of particular interest, avoiding the use of all materials concerning which there are strong doubts in terms of their safety in construction work, establishing much more restrictive levels than those defined by the current legislation, preventing the use of the following materials: — PVC in any aspect of construction work, including installations, where it is considered the material par excellence. — Glues and/or woods with a formaldehyde content of more than E1. — Polyurethane (PU) foams or any other type of product that exposes the operator to toxic gases such as HFC (greenhouse gas), or HC (hydrocarbons considered Volatile Organic Compounds), which have replaced CFC or CHFC gases that affect the O-zone layer, which were banned in 2009.43 — Toxic paints or varnishes, with a high VOC content or that contain barium, lead or other heavy metals. It is recommended that all treatments used contain vegetable raw materials and feature a stamp of organic production or, failing this, a certificate issued by the manufacturer, declaring that the product is not toxic. 42. Referred to in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 43. European Regulation 1005/2009 of 16 September 2009.What options do we have in this scenario? One of the main problems facing EU countries is energy dependence44. In the case of Spain, this figure comes to 75%, whilst the EU-27 average exceeds 53%. This high level of dependence leaves the economies of member states in a fragile position. The 2020 climate & energy package has been developed as part of which the reduction of energy consumption by 20% is one of the key points to gradually start on our journey towards energy self-sufficiency prior to the arrival of Oil Crash45. Similarly, progress towards a degree of self-sufficiency in resource consumption is one of the main ways of reducing the so-called “ecological threats”, which are actually threats to the social system46. It is not a case of protecting a non-existent “untouched nature”, rather our own survival. How can we apply self-sufficiency? A resource map is a very useful resource that allows us to discover all available local resources, whether tangible or not: Prevailing winds in summer for cooling, direction of the sun for heating, rainfall, geotechnics, materials and waste, etc. Traditional architecture is, by definition, the local resource map. That is, by regarding traditional architecture, we can discover the natural resources available at the time of construction. For example, buildings in the Biniaraix ravine in Soller, Mallorca, were built using stones from the valley itself. The presence of a well or cistern can be used as a pointer in terms of the geology, rainfall and the existence of groundwater. In the case of Formentera, until the 19th century, only stone, soil, and sabina wood was available. During the 19th century, lime technology was developed and tiles imported from Ibiza and the mainland. However, it’s not just about materials. In Alexander Brodsky’s ice pavilion, the metallic mesh protects against the icy wind by spraying it with water, forming a wall of ice that can be served in the form of cubes in vodka drinks. The cold provides protection from the cold. If we are strict enough, our buildings could produce a resource map for our era to be used by future generations. Program, structure, construction and energy efficiency solved by a single strategy. Traditional architecture has been a constant reference, not in terms of design, but as a way of working. We use it as a microscope to get a closer look. By doing so, we can see the resources available on the island: Junipers, which were used to build frameworks, are currently protected. The sandstone quarries have been depleted and the limited straw available is used for livestock. So, we have to look to the sea: Posidonia and boats, plus construction pallets that remain on the island because high cost of returning them.Therefore, we propose a shift in approach: “Instead of investing in a chemical plant located 1,500 km away, we should invest the same amount in local unskilled labour, who should lay out the Posidonia to dry under the sun and compact it in pallets, providing 15 cm of insulation for roofs. Moreover, sea salt actually acts as natural biocide product and is completely environmentally friendly The rest of the material used comes from a market study given their cost, the incorporated energy and the fact that they are suited to the levels of comfort required. The use of natural materials, more fragile than industrialized, requires selecting the main construction systems at the beginning of the design process. The organization of the spaces and the formal decisions must be the result of the knowledge of the advantages and the limitations of the materials. To think Louis Kahn’s way: If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, ‘What do you want, Brick?’ And Brick says to you, ‘I like an Arch.’ And if you say to Brick, ‘Look, arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think of that, Brick?’ Brick says, ‘I like an Arch.’ And it’s important, you see, that you honor the material that you use. The constructed volume is divided into two separate blocks, taking advantage of the fact that the two facades that overlook the street enjoy prevailing winds that passively keep them cool in summer. All the dwellings face two directions and cross ventilation thanks to the layout of the living/dining room and kitchen in a Z shape and a bedroom at each end. The layout is a variation of the project of 42 housing units in Son Servera, Mallorca, by the architects M. Peris and J. M Toral, promoted by the IBAVI. The entrance to all homes is directly on to the street, restoring the direct relationship typical of rural communities and avoiding the use of elevators, stairs and common areas. Furthermore, they all boast outdoor spaces for private use: ground floor homes have a garden whereas first-floor homes have a terrace with a private staircase. The building is Energy Class A. The insulation in the roof is Posidonia oceanica compacted at 185 kg/m3 with λ: 0.044 W/mK and 16-cm thick. The walls are of 25-cm thick Ytong and U: 0.36 W/m2 ºC, except to the north, which are 30-cm thick and U: 0.32 W/m2 ºC. All windows are low emissivity glass U: 1.1 W/m2 ºC. In summer, the cooling is provided passively by harnessing the breeze. The windows exposed to sunlight have solar protection, such as porches, pergolas with vines and canes, or shutters made of larch wood. Cables have been installed on the facade to facilitate the growth of climbing plants that protect blind walls and reduce solar radiation by more than 90% in areas where they have been developed. In winter, passive climate control is dependent on a 90 kW centralised biomass boiler that offers a yield of 92%, which also produces ACS. Each house has Termobox-M heat exchangers that provide individual consumption readings. The openings dimensions have been calculated to ensure that direct radiation occurs on the most unfavourable day of the winter solstice. First floor houses have a skylight on the deck facing in two directions. In winter, when opening the shutters facing southwards provides you get a solar collector. In summer, when closing the blinds and opening the windows, you get natural ventilation by means of suction. The average thermal comfort, measured on site is 21ºC in winter and 26ºC in summer. If prioritizing the product as being as healthy and eco-friendly as possible, a local product47, in addition to being economically viable, the following table applies to the Balearics: C1. Reusable local waste E.g. Neptune grass, straw, reused doors, etc. C2. Local eco-friendly products E.g. Marès sandstone, clay (BTC, adobe, etc.), tiles cooked in a biomass kiln, aerial lime, etc. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products E.g. Wood, hydraulic lime, etc. C4. Recycled or optimized products, whether local or not. E.g. Ytong, metal beams with at least 85% recycled steel. 47. A product is considered to be local when it is less than 100 km from the place where it will be consumed. In the case of Formentera, Mallorca has been considered as local due to the lack of local industry, although the two islands are 160 km apart. C1. Reusable local waste — Roof insulation: Posidonia oceanica dried on site, confined in reused pallets. — Aggregates: from construction work itself, during the excavation phases, or from cellular concrete block residues. — Interior carpentry and gates: reused wood (Fundació Deixalles Mallorca). C2. Local eco-friendly products — Structure (vaults): marès sandstone slabs from Mallorca. — External plaster: lime plaster made in Mallorca using recycled oil as fuel. — Exterior floors: 40x80x7-cm marès sandstone slabs and bricks produced in biomass kilns known as “morunos”. — Vertical outdoor partitions: H-16 ceramic blocks produced in biomass kilns. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products — Structure (floors): laminated wood from Austria, type E1 with PEFC seal. OSB-III boards with PEFC seal. — Outdoor woodwork: larch wood from the Basque Country, with PEFC seal. — Foundations: Non-reinforced NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk. — Interior floors: NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk, smoothed in situ. — Acoustic insulation for interior partitions: recycled cotton boards. — Acoustic insulation for the floors: Natural cork with FSC seal. — Wood protection: Lasur based on vegetable raw materials, free from lead, barium, heavy metals or polyurethane. — Paints: Silicate paint for walls and partitions. C4.

POSIDONIA & PALLETS DRY NEPTUNE GRASS AS A THERMAL INSULATION FOR ROOFS The insulation depends on the indoor air bubble content; therefore, any local waste with a high air content can potentially be used for insulation. In Formentera, one of the most abundant types of residue are dead Posidonia leafs, which is why dry Posidonia oceanica has been used as thermal insulation, just like it was used in traditional architecture. The accumulation of Posidonia oceanica debris (berms) on the beaches provides very effective protection against coastal erosion. However, in Formentera the accumulation is so high that top layers can be used. PROTECTED PLANT The Posidonia oceanica is a protected plant48 and its use must be authorised by the Ministry of Environment by applying to the Service of Protected Species. It has been collected by the company awarded the contract for beach maintenance and has been limited exclusively to the areas in which the material accumulated on beaches exceeds the amount necessary to maintain the balance of the coastal dune ecosystem and extreme care has been taken not to affect this ecosystem, under the supervision of the environment technicians from the Council of Formentera. The annual surplus volume of Posidonia, around 4000 m3 , would be sufficient to insulate all new dwellings on the island. The illegal collection of Posidonia is prohibited and strict sanctions apply, except in authorised cases. The new Posidonia Decree of the Balearic Islands, which is currently being drafted, includes its use in construction work. 48. Posidonia oceanica is protected by the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC TESTS WITH THE UIB Posidonia does not require artificial treatment as sea salt acts as a preser - vative and a biocide. In order to ensure its worthiness as in - sulation and to determine its thermal conductivity, three different tests were carried out in collaboration with the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB). The result was a success. — The first test involved the use of two PCE-HT 71 data logger sensors. — The second, using a drying oven, sought to compared the results against expanded polystyrene. — The third, involved using a heat flow meter pursuant to UNE-EN 12664:2002. Dry Posidonia insulation provides a U: 0.2936 W/m 2 °C and Λ: 0.044 W/mK for a density of 185 kg/m 3 and a thickness of 16 cm. THE PROCESS Once the re-used 16-cm high construction pallets were put in place, dry Posidonia has to be extended at a rate of 20 kg/m2 . The compaction process to obtain 185 kg/m3 was performed manually, with participants using their hands and feet to push the leafs between the pallets that form the substructure to which the OSB boards are nailed. Afterwards, the boards were waterproofed with EPDM and protected with sandstone slabs the form of paving. The smell of the sea was apparent on the site throughout the process. The solution applies to all locations in the Mediterranean with a surplus of Posidonia. DURABILITY Dry Posidonia does not rot and has no natural predators outside the marine environment, so its durability is unlimited under normal conditions of use. It was used uninterruptedly in the traditional architecture of the Balearic Islands and especially in the Pitiusas until the start of the 20th century. The samples of dry Posidonia dating back to the 14th century provided by Antònia Reig, Director of the TRBM49, taken from the coffered ceiling of the cloister at the Sapiencia de Palma show a perfect state of conservation; therefore, its useful life is more than 600 years. According to hisorians F. Tugores i J. Morata, all palaces built in Palma between the 14th and 17th centuries used dry Posidonia in wood panelling to protect the wood from moisture and xylophages. EXTINCTION OF THE POSIDONIA PRAIRIES DUE TO GLOBAL WARMING Posidonia meadows are an essential CO2 sink. However, according to the Spanish National Research Council50, during the 21st century their density will decrease by 90% due to the increase in sea temperature, as part of a process that will begin in about 40 years, resulting in the functional extinction of the species, giving rise to the release of absorbed gas for centuries.51 Therefore, the decrease in CO2 released as part of construction contributes directly to the protection of the species. Formentera’s boat shacks remind us of the time when recycling was one of the few possible ways of obtaining raw materials. All indoor carpentry in these dwellings and the vertical shutters on the ground floor were made using recycled wood and planks made from old pine stripped from abandoned beds managed by Fundación Deixalles in Mallorca. There are no second-hand carpenters in Ibiza. Fundación Deixalles is a non-profit organisation whose main objective is to ensure the socio-labour insertion of vulnerable groups in the Balearic Islands through the recovery and recycling of waste and environmental activities in general. The reuse of this wood makes it possible to put top-quality wood (old pine, Oregon pine, etc.), generally more than 50-70 years old, to reuse; this guarantees the natural growth of the tree and a drying process that is no longer available, and therefore these objects are become unique and un - repeatable, making it possible to in - corporate items of great wealth into architecture in general. As part of the woodwork selection pro - cess, samples showing signs of wood - worm or xylophagous insect infesta - tion have been ruled out, as they could extend to the rest of the house. The original woodwork has been ex - tended or trimmed as needed and it has been hung on Klein sliding guides, as this means that although the size of the door and gap do not match, the gap is reduced insofar as possible. All swinging doors can be reused as slid - ing doors. More than 100 items of recycled wood - work have been installed. Hydrated lime plaster on the facades to waterproof the load walls with a breathable coating. The lime, aged for 12 months, was sourced from the Unicmall factory in Felanitx, Mallorca. The fuel used to melt the lime is recycled oil, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. The plaster is applied in 3 layers. Two coarse layers with a total thickness of 2 cm and an intermediate mallatex across the entire surface plus a thin layer of 3-5 mm. The thick mortar includes a 0.2% polypropylene fibre reinforcement to prevent cracking during retraction. The support wall has been pre-treated with a compatible primer. Marès is a type of sandstone native to the Balearic Islands extracted in 40x40x80-cm blocks; it is very useful in the construction of walls and vaults. Its characteristics depend on its origin, whether calcarenite (sand grains cemented by the calcium of shells of molluscs) or eolianite (sedimented sand), and therefore each quarry has very different properties, with resistances varying between 25 and 630 kg/cm². Therefore, as is the case with wood, its generic name is not very descriptive and it is essential that the quarry selected is appropriate based on the required use. The publication EL MARÉS, by R. Sánchez-Cuenca, comes highly recommended, offering a description of the features (density, porosity, resistance, colour, etc.) of the 19 active quarries in Mallorca. In Formentera, the quarries have already been depleted or extraction activities have ceased. As part of this project, we chose to use the Cas Busso quarry, offering 1st-rate quality, with the following characteristics: — Whitish colour, compact, dense, no grains, very hard. — Bulk density: 2.1 g/cm³. — Open porosity: 45.6%. — Compressive strength: 557-627 kg/cm². Marès has been used as a structural element to construct the vaults of cisterns, as an alternative to the reinforced concrete slabs and to avoid the corrosion of reinforcements, thus prolonging their durability indefinitely. The vault joints have been made using with NHL-5 lime cement, as Marès is chemically incompatible with Portland cement. It has also been used as a floating floor in the roof, in 40x80x7-cm slabs with an open joint, laid dry in and 80x18.5x25- cm solid steps. The use of Marès reduces emissions by 60% compared to concrete alternatives.52 52. Own research carried out in collaboration with the General Directorate of Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change of the Balearic Islands Government, using the ITEC’s BEDEC. C2. BRICKS & TILES The outer-facing walls and permeable dicing walls have been made using H-16 bricks sourced from the Can Mascaró factory in Vilafranca, Mallorca. They have been placed with the holes exposed, rotated 90º compared to their usual direction, allowing air to circulate and cool the inside of houses while still offering shade in the summer. Furthermore, there does not inhibit resistance to the horizontal thrust of the wind. The tiles, made at the Soler pottery in Felanitx, Mallorca, have been used in the eaves that protect the windows, as outdoor paving, in doorways, roof railings and in the tiled bathrooms and kitchens. The glazed tiles are made one at a time by hand, and no two tiles are the same. All the bricks and tiles used in construction work have been baked in biomass mortar kilns, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. 53. Up to now, we have located this type of “moruno” kilns used for the production of building materials in Andalusia, the Balearic Islands and Murcia. We do not know if there are other ceramic factories in Spain that operate with 100% renewable energies. In any case, it is a trade of great patrimonial and ethnological value and, therefore, the Administration must protect it. The outdoor windows have been made using laminated larch wood with the PEFC seal from the Basque Country. This wood has a very low thermal conductivity Λ: 0.11 W/mk, which means it provides good insulation, especially when compared with aluminium (209.3-237) or steel (47-58). HEALTH AND DURABILITY It is breathable, and contains no toxic elements. The protection treatment has been applied using eco-friendly lasur, which features no polyurethane and Vindo 629 paint made by Livos. A correct design involves selecting a suitable wood to use. The larch wood does not rot and does not show signs of blue mould. In the façades, 20-cm ceramic eaves have been installed to avoid direct rainfall. Shutters have been installed without a frame, with a minimum separation of 0.5- 1 cm between wet work and the wood.

HYDRAULIC LIME NHL-5 Why use lime concrete? CO2 emissions can be reduced by around 15% without having to change normal building habits, replacing conventional materials with less polluting alternatives in finishes such as paintwork, flooring, carpentry or plastering. However, action must be taken during excavation, foundation and structural work to reduce emissions by up to 50%. Lime concrete, used since 300 BC by the Romans and present in all traditional European architecture, absorbs between 45% and 62% of the CO2 produced during its production, reaching 100% CO2 absorption in very long life cycles. The material fell out of use during the 20th century due to slow setting times and low resistance compared to Portland cement, which prevents its use in multi-level pillar structures. The prototype has been designed with light slabs and load-bearing walls that transmit loads of less than 0.8 N/mm² to the 60x50-cm footings to demonstrate the viability of NHL-5 lime as structural concre - te with a strength equal to or greater to 5 Mpa and setting period of up to 360 days. Concrete has been laid in layers of varia - ble thickness, ranging between 15 and 20 cm. The ratio used was 1:1:1 (lime, sand, gravel) in the upper layers and 2:3:5 in the lower layer. In establishing the different ratios, both the information on the tra - ditional application of lime concrete and the technical information associated with the existing regulatory framework have been taken into account, which can be found in the project report. 291 test specimens were tested to determine the resistance of lime con - crete in real working conditions, using different possible ratios to provide all possible information for the purposes of future projects. In addition, another 70 lime concrete specimens54 with a small proportion of white cement of <20% have been taken to accelerate the setting of all exposed concrete indoor flooring Slabs are 10-cm thick on the ground floor and 7-cm thick on the 1st floor, to reduce the load, and they have been poured on a waterproof breathable sheet of polyethylene. They have been reinforced with polyethylene fibres and continuous mallatex specific to 40x40 mm and 135 gr floors placed 3 cm from the bottom face of the slab. Flexible 5 mm joints have been laid around the perimeter and retraction joints using 5x45-mm polypropylene profiles forming maximum surface area pads of 5 m2 on the ground floor and 4 m2 on the first floor. The finishing layer has been made by sprinkling flint sand and lime at a ratio of 50:50, and smoothed by hand using a grout float, in 3 consecutive phases as is traditional. The flooring has been kept moist for 30 days and was not stepped on for a week. It has been waterproofed using ecological Welaan Eco-Hidro-Sell based sodium silicate water-repellent product. 54. The hydraulic lime used in this construction was sourced from Catalonia, is baked at 900ºC and CO2 emissions are 400 kg/CO2 per tonne of lime. However, if biomass or other clean energies had been used for the purposes of combustible, emissions would be 160 kg/CO2 per tonne. The slabs (ceilings) consist of the following structural elements: A. 20x40-cm laminated GL36 pine beams of section and 12x18-cm GL24 beams, sourced from Austria with the PEFC seal. B. Structural panel of oriented chips of poplar wood, OSB III type 2-cm thick, from Italy with PEFC seal. Biocide has been applied exclusively to the hidden parts of the wood. The heads embedded in the wall have been coated with reused cardboard boxes and packaging to absorb any moisture that reaches the wood. CO2 emissions are 23 kg/CO2 per m2 of wood slabs. Emissions made by a one-way concrete slab for equivalent lamps are 245 kg/CO2 . C4. Ytong The solution used in the façade is the result of an environmental comparison carried out by Societat Orgànica consultancy firm, in which different façade solutions with the same transmittance coefficient of U: 0.36 were assessed and the solution with the lowest incorporated energy (498 Mj/m2 ) chosen, comprising load-bearing walls with YTONG-type lightened concrete, or similar, with the following characteristics: — Width of 30 cm and density of 350 kg/m³ facing north to reduce losses in winter. — Width of 25 cm and density 350 kg/ m³ in all other facade walls. — Width of 30 cm and density of 500 kg/ m³ in the walls dividing dwellings to comply with the acoustic regulations. On the inside, the block has been painted directly using silicates, without plastering, to avoid the consumption of materials and additional energy In order to reduce the consumption of mains water from 22055 to 88 litres per person per day the following measures have been implemented: 1. Efficient design of the domestic hot water installation and the location of faucets, all less than one meter from the hot water exchanger to avoid wasting cold water. 2. Saving mechanisms in kitchens and bathrooms (pressure and flow reducers, taps that open when cold, etc.). 3. Rainwater cisterns of 6 m³ each, located beneath the 7 terraces on the ground floor, to provide automated irrigation to the plants sowed that serve a bioclimatic function (11 trees and 40 climbing plants). The steady rainfall rate is 345 l/m2 per year and the system has 450 litres per day for the purposes of irrigation during the 3 months of the dry season. In terms of rental housing managed by IBAVI, lawns are banned, which in this climate would constitute an irresponsible use of resources. 55. Statistical water consumption in homes with garden of the subsidiary rules of Formentera and the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). 4. In the central courtyard, a grey water phyto-purification system56 has been installed to regenerate shower water for use in the toilets (statistically 20% water consumption per day and person). The cistern has a capacity for 17 m³. The plants selected by the landscaper Salvador Canyís are Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia, Iris pseudoacorus, Mentha aquatica and Lithrum salicaria. 5. Landscape gardening. Selection of suitable native and non-native species: Celtis australis (almez), Ficus carica (fig tree), Parthenocissus quinquefolia (virgin vine), and Bougainvillea spectabilis (bougainvillea) and efficient irrigation systems, avoiding sprinklers. 56. Horizontal dry flow phyto-purification system. The prototype has successfully reduced waste production by 50% during the construction phase, producing 33.38 tonnes of waste in total. The following measures were applied: — Reuse the aggregates from excavation as fillers under floorings (100 m3 ), and fillers in gardens (120 m3 ), in order to reduce the gravel imported in trucks from Ibiza. — Reuse the remains of crushed YTONG as light filler under the firstfloor flooring. — Reuse all construction pallets in the construction of roofs as a support for Posidonia oceanica. — Reuse the surplus wood from the beams to cover the gaps in the slabs between rooms. — Reuse the wood provided by Fundación Deixalles for the purposes of interior woodwork. MONITORING THE PROTOTYPE Incorporated emissions have been calculated using the ITEC’s BEDEC bank57. During the REUSING POSIDONIA project we discovered that it was impossible to establish an absolute emissions threshold for all buildings, since the impact of works to build the roofs, structures or lay the foundations varies widely. Therefore, in contrast to the calculation of energy efficiency, for which there are reference values, to calculate the percentage of improvement, we use the emissions of an equivalent building constructed with conventional systems such as reinforced concrete, aluminium, stoneware and asphalt products.58 The emissions of the Prototype came to 446,632 Kg/CO2 (412 Kg/CO2 x m²). The emissions of the reference building came to 1,221,987 kg/CO2 (1,128 kg/CO2 x m²) The decrease ultimately obtained was 63,45%, well beyond the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 50%.59 57. Technical Construction Institute of Catalonia. 58. Materials used to calculate the reference building: — Foundations, walls and pillars of reinforced concrete. — Structural floor with concrete girder-slabs and beams. — Flat roof with porex insulation and asphalt sheet. — Concrete blocks walls. — Porcelain stoneware flooring. — Aluminum exterior carpentry. Pine interior doors. — Installations of PVC and plastic paint for walls. 59. Please find CO2 calculations here: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huella-de-co2/ 60. The maximum height of the building depends on the city council buildings regulations. If this typology is included to data base, the CO2 statistical emissions would be between 600 and 1,100 kg, with an average of 850 kg It can be seen that the reference building’s emissions are well beyond the statistics, between 600 and 900 kg, which has had an impact on the foundations and roofs of a two-storey building60 compared to the 5-storey building used to obtain the value of 732 kg/CO2 . Even so, the reduction of the prototype towards the statistical average was 45%, which means the following: A. Despite the greater surface area, the use of local construction systems with a low environmental impact has made it possible to reduce CO2 emissions by around 50%. B. If the lime concrete used in the structure is sourced from a factory using renewable sources of energy, emissions per square metre would drop to 367 kg/CO2 , and therefore, we would obtain a reduction of 70%, equivalent to the reduction required to obtain an ecological footprint of 18,000 m2 .

MONITORING THERMAL COMFORT Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with J. Muñoz and C. Carmona from the Architectural Research Group at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB): Monitoring includes indoor and outdoor temperatures, degree of relative humidity and breeze speed inside 8 standard homes, 4 looking north-south and 4 looking east-west. The following tools were used: — FlirC2 thermographic camera, with sensor IR 80×60. — PCE-T150 digital thermometer. — TESTO445 hot-wire anemometer. — PCE-890U surface temperature gun. — 10 PCE-HT 71N temperature sensors. — 10 PCE-T390 temperature sensors. Monitoring began on 21 December 2016, coinciding with the winter solstice and will end in the summer of 2018. The results obtained to date August22nd are as follows. PHASE 1 - WINTER Period: 22 december 2016 - 16 february 2017. Dwellings: 6 and 8. The dwellings were inhabited. Data: Internal temperature information (Ti), outdoor temperature (Te), indoor relative humidity (HR) and outdoor relative humidity (Hre). The climate control conditions where stablished by setting and indoor temperature of 21ºC. The system stopped when it reached the setpoint temperature Climatic conditions to the indicated period (12/22/16 - 2/16/17): — Median minimum outdoor temperatures: 8°C — Median maximum outdoor temperatures: 15°C Results — Initial median interior temperature (initial Ti): 15°C — Median time required for air conditioning to reach 21°C ™: 1 hr — Median indoor relative humidity (once at 21°C):> 75% The insulation was proved to be adequate. Infrared imaging did not detect any thermal bridges. PHASE 2 - SUMMER Period: 15 June to 22 August 2017. Units: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12. The Dwellings were inhabited. Data: Indoor Surface Temperatures (Tsi), Indoor Temperatures (Ti), Outdoor Surface Temperatures (Tse) Outdoor Temperatures (Te), indoor Relative Humidity (Hri) and Outdoor Relative Humidity (Hre). Climatic conditions during the period (24/7/17 - 28/7/17): — Average minimum outdoor temperatures: 29.5°C — Average outdoor maximum temperature: 35°C Results The results61 obtained demonstrate that the enclosure’s insulation works appropriately with constant reductions of 5ºC compared to the outdoor temperature and 15ºC compared to the outdoor temperature of the surfaces exposed to direct sunlight. 61.

Parámetros del ambiente interior a considerar para el diseño y la evaluación de la eficiencia energética de edificios incluyendo la calidad del aire interior, condiciones térmicas, iluminación y ruido), We performed an analysis of internal thermal comfort, based on the ASHRAE62 standard and EN-1525163 using the following average values obtained during the analysis period: — Ti of the units facing North, South and East, between 25 and 27 ºC with an average of around 26 ºC. — Te between 30 and 35ºC, with an average minimum outdoor temperature of 29.5°C, an average maximum outdoor temperature of 35°C and a median temperature of around 33°C — HRi between 55 and 80% with an average of around 65% and HRe between 55 and 90%, with an average of around 75% We concluded that based on the ASHRAE standard (Figure 6), the apparent temperature is 26.3 °C. It also complies with EN-15251 (Figure 7). These two results have been obtained with wind speeds of 0 (zero). When considering a wind speed of 0.5 m/s, the apparent temperature is around 23.5 ºC (Figure 8). We have not seen a significant difference in the adiabatic64 properties, indicating a good level of insulation. 64. Adiabatic dwelling does not present temperature losses. 3. ELECTRIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD MONITORING Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with B. Alorda from the Architectural Research Group at the UIB. The following equipment has been used: — Narda NBM-550 Broadband Field Meter — Narda EF-0391 E-Field, Flat Response Probe — Rohde & SCHWARZ FSH3 Spectrum Analyser The electromagnetic radiation of radio-frequency waves has had and continues to have a special impact on public opinion due to its possible impact on health conditions. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the use of mobile devices or sensing devices capable of performing wireless communications, in other words, devices emitting electromagnetic waves. Safety measures in terms of sources of electromagnetic radiation were regulated in 200165 in order to ensure the highest levels of safety and respond to the social demand for transparency and control 65. Based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization via the recommendation of the European Commission 1999/519/EC that was reflected in Spanish legislation via Royal Decree 1066/2001. over the sources of electromagnetic pollution. The reference levels indicated in the regulations are the maximum values considered as being safe and they are based on the international scientific recommendations, which are updated in line with new knowledge obtained from the latest research developments. The table below details the reference levels included in the regulations in force and that guarantee the compliance with strict safety margins in terms of the levels of exposure to radio-wave radiation amongst the general population. Observing the relevant frequency band at the main frequencies for mobile communications (900, 1800 and 2000 MHz), this regulation establishes reference limits of: 4.5 W/m2 , 9 W/m2 and 10 W/m2 respectively. Likewise, in the SATI report67 published by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces in 2012, a comparison of the limits of exposure to electromagnetic fields was performed, concluding that there were differences between the reference values. These differences define more restrictive maximum limit levels: — In terms of the Spanish autonomous communities, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha and Navarra are the communities that establish the most restrictive maximum reference values for mobile frequency bands68 (2 W/m2 , 4 W/m2 and 4.5 W/m2 respectively). — Luxembourg establishes the lowest maximum reference values on mobile frequencies68 in the European Union. The maximum power density is limited to 0.024 W/m2 , equivalent to a maximum electrical field intensity of 3 V/m per antenna. 66. F is the frequency of the wave (Hz), E is the intensity of the electrical field (V/m), H is the magnetic field strength (A/m), B is the magnetic flux density (μT) and S is the equivalent power density of the plane wave (W/m2 ). 67. The SATI report was published in 2012 by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces. 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. Effects on health These differences in the limits allowed by current regulations cannot be justified in terms of reducing the possible adverse health effects both for the general population and occupational exposure, according to the SATI report.67 Thus, the reduction of the reference level for emissions from telephone antennas is not justified, as indicated, for example, in the 2009 report by the French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety. In addition, the same report indicates that “the most effective method to reduce public exposure in general, involves the necessary increase in the number of antennas and their coverage.” So much so, that the authorities of Denmark, Greenland, Finland, Sweden and Norway issued a joint statement in 2009 indicating that “If the number of fixed antennas is reduced, mobile phones tend to use more energy to preserve your connection; therefore, the exposure of the general public may increase. “ According to the conclusions of WHO Fact Sheet 193 of 201469, the following points are worth note: — In the short term, the principal mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency energy and the human body is tissue heating. Furthermore, the penetration of the frequencies used by mobile phones68 is negligible, affecting only the first layers of skin. — In the long term, it has been determined that frequency to radio frequency fields does not increase the risk to people. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency electromagnetic fields as being possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B), but a category used when a causal association is considered credible, but when chance, bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence, thus their classification is a prevention strategy. (www.who.int/ mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/es/) 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. 69. World Health Organization. The newly built construction is 50 metres away from the telephone towers located on 28 La Habana street. Indoor electromagnetic field measurements have been carried out taking into account several conditions: time (morning, afternoon), layout of the room and usage, in addition to height compared to the horizontal height of the street.

Higher values have been measured on the upper terrace because they are directly in front of the sources of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the structural insulation of the walls reduces the radiation inside the houses and that radiation is beneath even the most restrictive limits. 70.

For products imported from outside the EU, a label should be required to ensure fair working conditions and respect for human rights in production processes, such as FAIRTRADE71, or similar, as a mandatory condition for use in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and Statewide construction standards. 3. For wood products from outside the EU, an FSC or PEFC forest management label should be required as a condition for being used in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and State-wide and regional construction standards. 4. For all products made on an industrial scale, both in the EU and abroad, product traceability should be required at all extraction, manufacturing and distribution stages. A product manufactured in the EU may use raw materials that involved in some or all of the side effects described in the consumption models. 5. A CO2 emissions ceiling should be established for construction industries. 6. For the restoration of traditional local products with no active industry, such as Posidonia, their patrimonial value should be made visible and promoted by the public administrations. 71. Fair trade. The Fairtrade Seal is accredited by Flo-Cert in compliance with ISO 17065. There are other accreditations that ensure the rights of workers such as ISO 26000 Social responsibility Unlike processed materials, which benefit from large investments in terms of advertising and technical advice financed by private companies, traditional materials are not linked to financial profitability and their use on-site requires specific knowledge, which is why they have fallen into disuse. Based on the foregoing, the public administration is responsible for their restored use, replacing the figure of technical advisors and establishing channels of communication between professionals and consumers. Furthermore, it must be noted that the use of materials without an EC marking represents an added difficulty for technicians, who must have a high level of know-how to correctly apply traditional systems, within the current framework of associated civil liability and compliance with technical regulations such as the Technical Building Code, the Regulation of Thermal Installations in Buildings, etc. As is the case with dry stone, which has received funding from various European programs72, the following activities should be encouraged: — Posidonia management training courses (collection, drying and storage) for public administration personnel to encourage its use in public buildings. — Courses/workshops/events involving construction with Posidonia, placing a special emphasis on the protection of Posidonia meadows and dune ecosystems, imparted to professionals and individuals to encourage its use in public and private buildings. — Development of public companies in all regions of the Mediterranean in which Posidonia is dried and packaged and made available to consumers, complying with all the beach collection protocols to ensure that the dune ecosystem is not harmed, preventing individuals managing the collection of large volumes. — Additional studies on the application of Posidonia in different construction elements (walls, laying of floors, etc.). 72. The PROTERRA program deals with the assessment of terraced crops in southern Europe. REPPIS program in the framework of which the European Network of Dry Stone Countries, or the MEDSTONE publications, technical guides for documenting and transmitting such craft was created, in addition to projects such as REVPAR-MEDOCC, PATTER, TERRISC, TCAST, EDSI, etc. CO2 The variable nature of reference values of CO2 emissions per m2 (from 600 to 1,100) and the need to calculate the CO2 of an equivalent building constructed using conventional systems makes it impossible to implement the calculation of CO2 until software programs are developed that comply the following conditions: 1. Create an approved CO2 database for each region. 2. Automatically calculate emissions from the equivalent building using predetermined items. Or: 3. Analise thousands of examples in order to get reference values for every building typologie. The development and implementation of these programs is expected to be slow and complex, and therefore the mandatory inclusion of one or more local ecological materials from a list drawn up by the relevant regional administrations has been proposed as a transitional measure.73 73. Balearic Islands materials list under development: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huellade-co2/ This obligation would be applied first to public buildings and then extended to private buildings, similar to the application of the nearly zero-energy buildings concept. Thus, the roadmap below is proposed for the purposes of guidance: 1. Include one or more eco-friendly materials, preferably local ones, from the regional list, firstly in public buildings and afterwards in private buildings. 2. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed public buildings. 3. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed private buildings. 4. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all rehabilitation works on existing buildings. 5. Establish a progressive decrease in CO2 emissions for all projects: 20%, 50%, 70% in order to reduce the footprint to 18,000 m² per inhabitant. THERMAL COMFORT Winter recommendations Reduce the forced ventilation system of indoor airflow and if needed install local dehumidification systems. Summer recommendations The cross-ventilation mechanism to improve indoor thermal comfort, works for most of the periods studied. Based on the environmental conditions of the location and during the period studied (sustained temperatures above 30°C and high relative humidity, on average close to 75% and reaching 90%), and given the very high level of insulation present in the buildings, it will be appropriate to establish a system that informs the user when it is appropriate to take advantage of the effect of natural cross ventilation and when it is not, as well as to installing solar powered ceiling fans. Thus, we recommend designing and implementing an automatic control that informs the user/resident of when, as necessary given ambient conditions in summer, the opposite windows should be opened to employ the cross ventilation effect (a pilot light that switches on and off). This control would include at least one external temperature sensor, one indoor temperature sensor, one outdoor air speed sensor and one indoor temperature sensor.74 74. AEMET.

When you build them, pollution is produced by manufacturing materials and the production of rubble. And when you use them, pollution is produced by the energy used to live in them. Our proposal is to reduce pollution generated by manufacturing by 50%, waste production by 50%, water consumption by 60%, and power used for heating or cooling by 75%. We’ll achieve this by reverting to traditional architecture techniques and materials, and low-tech systems. It’s not just the environment that is at stake: our quality of life would be much better and costs would be almost the same. And if this is replicated on a wide scale, cities will be friendlier, nicer and they will adapt gradually to climate change. All this information is taken from the official Life reusing posidonia book, what quotes from here would work with this introduction, The study of residential typologies, particularly collective housing, is of critical importance in understanding how density shapes urban environments and carries implications for community life, sustainability, and the use of resources. Density in housing not only refers to the number of units per land area but also touches on the intensity of social interactions, access to communal amenities, and the overall quality of living spaces. In the context of Bournemouth and Poole, the surge in the urban periphery’s residential developments underscores the pertinence of re-evaluating housing on the city’s edge. These areas, including Canford Heath, grapple with the challenges of urban sprawl and ecological impact while striving to offer attractive, affordable, and sustainable living options. This essay will delve into the Life Reusing Posidonia project, a contemporary, eco-conscious approach to collective housing situated in Sant Ferran, Formentera. Conceived between 2013 and 2015 and developed by the Institut Balear de l’Habitatge, the housing typology presents an innovative integration of block and courtyard elements, reflective of its unique island context. The architects responsible, notable for their environmentally and socio-culturally responsive design philosophy, sought to create fourteen housing units that are characterized by a profound respect for local traditions and a low environmental footprint. Life Reusing Posidonia addresses the question of density by prioritizing the ecosystem’s health without compromising on habitability. The utilization of dried Posidonia oceanica, a seagrass endemic to the Mediterranean, as insulation, signifies a return to historical construction practices while advancing modern sustainable methods. This chosen project illustrates a reinterpretation of housing on the edge by showcasing how edge conditions can be harmoniously addressed through a low-tech, resource-efficient strategy. By examining this project’s response to the edges of Formentera, this essay aims to uncover how innovative design interventions can preserve ecological integrity, foster community, and redefine the quality of living on the periphery of urban centers.","output":"The Life Reusing Posidonia project presents a compelling example of how sustainable architecture can draw on historical precedent to address contemporary housing concerns, specifically relating to urban periphery developments such as those seen in Bournemouth and Poole. By using traditional materials and construction techniques in innovative ways, the project shows how living spaces can be created that are not only environmentally responsible but also culturally resonant and deeply connected to their context. In light of this, the following quotes from the official Life Reusing Posidonia book outline key principles and considerations that can be adapted for the introduction: 1. \\"It is our responsibility to respond to the current and future needs of society and we must know how to face this challenge, combining the promotion of social housing based on its social purpose and environmental awareness.\\" 2. \\"When it comes to both social and environmental sustainability, we think and take action with social housing developments that involve techniques that generate, both in their construction and maintenance, lower amounts of CO2 and waste, whilst at the same time, working to promote the use of sustainable power.\\" 3. \\"This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method.\\" 4. \\"Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources.\\" 5. \\"The Prototype demonstrates the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic, and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials.\\" By drawing on these insights, the essay can effectively situate the Life Reusing Posidonia project within the broader discourse of sustainable development in urban peripheries. The project exemplifies a philosophy that emphasizes the interconnectivity of social, environmental, and cultural sustainability, offering a model that can inspire re-imagined approaches to housing density and urban expansion."},{"instruction":"Write a function to prompt the user if password and reentered password doesn’t match and proceed to check for length of password >8 if matches","output":"Here's a Python function that prompts the user to enter a password and reenter it.

Both individuals and teams have their own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to decision-making. Individuals can often make decisions quicker as they do not require the input or consensus of others. This can be beneficial when time is a constraint and immediate action is required. Individual decision-making also allows for a clear and focused thought process, without the need to consider different opinions or compromise. On the other hand, teams can bring diverse perspectives and expertise to the decision-making process. This can lead to more comprehensive and well-rounded decisions, as multiple viewpoints and ideas are considered. Teams can also ensure better prospects for innovation, collaboration, and increased buy-in from stakeholders. The effectiveness of decision-making by individuals or teams would largely depend on the nature of the decision, complexity of the problem, availability and quality of information, individual or team dynamics, and the specific goals of the decision-making process. In summary, individuals may be quicker in making decisions, but teams bring the advantage of diverse perspectives and collaborative problem-solving, often leading to better long-term decisions."},{"instruction":"Which of the following is not a Team Maintenance Role? 1.

Team members listen carefully. While all of the options listed can play a role in team decision-making, listening carefully is the most essential factor in ensuring effective decision-making. Active listening allows team members to understand and consider various perspectives, leading to more informed and well-rounded decisions. Option 1, where team members who are unaware of something keep quiet, can be counterproductive as it prevents the team from benefiting from their input and insights. Option 3, leaders being autocratic, can stifle team participation and limit the range of ideas and perspectives considered in the decision-making process. Option 4, decisions made by consensus, can be effective in certain situations, but it may not always be feasible or practical. Some decisions may require a leader or designated decision-maker, while other decisions may be better made through a democratic or participatory process, where all team members have a say but consensus is not necessarily the goal. Ultimately, effective team decision-making requires active listening, open communication, and a balance between individual contributions and collective collaboration."},{"instruction":"Приведите примеры для гипермаркетов “Лента” для следующих ее угроз: • Экономический кризис, повышение инфляции и падение реально располагаемых доходов населения. • Высокая конкуренция в отрасли и появление новых участников рынка • Участились случаи крупных пожаров в гипермаркетах, несутся большие потери • Замедление роста торговой сети • Изменение потребительских предпочтений: Изменение вкусов и предпочтений потребителей может повлиять на спрос на товары Ленты и потребовать адаптации ассортимента. • Логистические перебои (из-за санкций) • Ужесточение административных ограничений или ухудшение политической ситуации в стране • Рост требований у покупателей к цене, качеству сервиса и широте ассортимента • Давление в виде цены со стороны поставщиков","output":"1.

However, their approaches to electronic record maintenance exhibit certain variations reflective of their legal frameworks and technological integrations. In the UK, the Land Registry maintains electronic records, which have been progressively digitized since the turn of the century to facilitate online searches and filings. The system in the UK allows for electronic lodgement of certain documents, and e-conveyancing initiatives are continuously evolving to enhance the efficiency and security of transactions. Sweden's approach to electronic records in land registration is deeply rooted in its innovative e-Government initiatives. The Swedish Land Registration Authority, Lantmäteriet, maintains a highly sophisticated system known as the Swedish Land Registry. This system is fully digitized, leveraging blockchain technology for certain aspects of its operation to ensure data integrity and transparency. Sweden has been at the forefront of integrating such technology to provide a robust and secure means of recording transactions, which also allows for efficient access and verification of land records online. Both countries recognize the importance of secure and reliable land registration systems and have invested in electronic solutions to improve access and reduce the potential for error and fraud. However, Sweden's use of advanced technologies like blockchain represents a more cutting-edge approach when contrasted with the still-evolving digital practices within the UK Land Registry. Despite these differences, both registries share a common trend of leveraging technology to enhance their land registration processes and provide better services to their citizens."},{"instruction":"Write only 1 paragraph which critically analyzes the topic","output":"The transition to electronic records within the land registration systems of the UK and Sweden embodies the broader shift toward digital governance, yet critical analysis reveals a distinct divergence in the adoption of technology and its potential impact on stakeholders. The UK's Land Registry has been cautiously incrementing digital services, mindful of legal complexities and the scale of transitioning legacy records, which has resulted in a system that, while progressively modernizing, might lag behind in harnessing the full benefits of emergent technologies. In contrast, Sweden's Lantmäteriet, with its pioneering use of blockchain for the Land Registry, places it at the vanguard of digital innovation, offering superior security and efficiency, but also facing unique challenges such as ensuring widespread technological literacy and addressing privacy concerns intrinsic to immutable digital ledgers. Both systems aim to enhance integrity and user convenience, yet they also need to balance innovation with the safeguards necessary to protect data and uphold the public's trust in these critical repositories of legal ownership."},{"instruction":"Write only 1 paragraph which critically analyzes but highlights the similarities of the topic","output":"The UK and Sweden's commitment to electronic land registers underscores a shared recognition of e-governance benefits, yet a critical analysis of their systems reveals parallel challenges despite their technological disparities. Both countries have embraced the digitization of land records to increase efficiency, reduce paperwork, and enhance public access. However, they grapple with the continuous need to balance technological advancement with robust data protection, especially as digital records become more susceptible to sophisticated cyber threats. The UK's incremental modernization and Sweden's ambitious integration of blockchain technology both require ongoing investment in security mechanisms and user education to preserve the integrity and trust in their land registration systems. Moreover, regardless of the technological maturity, each must navigate the complexities of transforming longstanding legal frameworks and administrative practices to fully realize the potential of digital land registers, including managing the digital divide to ensure inclusivity and equal access to all citizens. This illustrates that while the pace and scope of technological implementation may vary, the core objective of streamlining land registration while maintaining stringent security and accessibility standards remains a common pursuit within both jurisdictions."},{"instruction":"Write a paragraph that discusses the differences in registration requirements between in the UK and Swedish Land registers","output":"The UK and Swedish land registration systems differ substantially in their registration requirements, reflecting both countries' distinct legal traditions and property laws. In the United Kingdom, compulsory first registration of land was introduced progressively across different regions and usually triggers upon the sale of land, with subsequent changes in ownership requiring updates to the register. The Land Registry requires detailed information about the property, proof of ownership, and compliance with any relevant legal requisites, such as searches and stamp duty payments. Conveyancing in the UK is often facilitated by solicitors, who handle the complex process of meeting these requirements and ensuring accurate and lawful registration. Conversely, Sweden's land registration system, operated by the Lantmäteriet, is based on a cadastral system where each property unit is identified with a unique code. The requirements for registration involve not just proof of transaction but also detailed mapping and surveying information. In Sweden, transactions which establish land boundaries need to undergo a cadastral procedure before registration. These rigorous surveying processes—integral to Swedish land registration—ensure precise delineation of property units, a practice that is less emphasized in the UK system. Additionally, Sweden's digital-first approach means much of the registration process is conducted electronically, with an emphasis on technological solutions to streamline the process, while the UK system is still in the process of moving towards a more digitized operation."},{"instruction":"Make it more consise","output":"The UK and Swedish land registers diverge notably in their registration requirements. In the UK, land must be registered upon sale, with detailed documentation of ownership and compliance with legal procedures, often managed by solicitors. Sweden's Lantmäteriet necessitates not only ownership proofs but also precise mapping and cadastral data, emphasizing land boundary accuracy through rigorous surveying — a practice less accentuated in the UK. Whereas the UK is transitioning towards digitization, Sweden's system is already rooted in digital processes, underscoring their commitment to a technically streamlined registration experience. These variances reflect the distinct legal and operational frameworks that each country upholds in managing land transactions."},{"instruction":"Discuss the difference in coverage between the two registers aand also in relation to \\"unregistered land\\"","output":"The scope of coverage for land registers in the UK and Sweden differs markedly, particularly when considering the concept of \\"unregistered land.\\" In the UK, the Land Registry does not encompass all land, primarily because the move to mandatory land registration has historically been phased in and depends on triggering events such as the sale or transfer of land. This has resulted in pockets of unregistered land, which typically have been held by the same owners for many years and have not changed hands since registration became compulsory in their area. Unregistered land in the UK may still be bound by traditional forms of title documentation which require laborious effort to translate into the registered system upon the next conveyancing event. In contrast, Sweden's land registration system, managed by the Lantmäteriet, boasts near-complete coverage thanks to a long-standing cadastral tradition that predates the digital era. The notion of unregistered land is virtually nonexistent, as all property is accounted for within the national cadastre with unique identification codes and detailed records. This is a product of Sweden's systematic and comprehensive mapping and registration approach that includes all land and property units by default, mitigating the issue of unregistered parcels that can complicate land transactions and ownership proofs. Sweden has thus achieved a more uniform and comprehensive registry, whilst the UK continues efforts to diminish the quantity of unregistered land and fully transition into a complete land registration regimen."},{"instruction":"Can you take a statement and make it more consice but still clear and fluent in reading?","output":"Certainly, I'd be happy to help with that.

This overlap is highlighted in each country’s adamance for their support of transactions on all societal levels. The respective land registers in the United Kingdom and Kenya are critical in facilitating real estate transactions. The UK's Land Registry, which covers England and Wales, is essential to the property market as it recording changes in ownership. Their technology creates a framework for legal property transfers, ensuring that each transaction is properly documented and reflected in the register. Similarly, Kenya's land register is an essential component of the country's property transactions. It offers a centralised system for recording ownership transfers, leases, charges, and other property interests, which aids in the formalisation and legitimization of transactions for both private and public interest. Both registries are critical to preserving clear property ownership records, allowing for the secure purchase, sale, and leasing of land and properties inside their respective countries. While the methods and rules governing transactions change across the two countries, the land registry's core role as a transactional support system remains consistent, ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the property markets. Now as spoken before regarding the countries efforts to modernize, both the UK and Kenyan land registries recognise the value of digitization and are actively working to further its implementation into their systems. The UK’s digital services aim to simplify processes for buyers, sellers, and conveyancers, allowing for speedier and more trustworthy land and property transactions. Meanwhile, Kenya has been working hard to digitise the numerous paper records and merge them into a consistent, computerised registry. also, action aims not only to streamline and safeguard the process of registering and transferring land rights, but also to prevent fraud and land grabbing. In Kenya, digital records also promote more openness by making it easier to verify land ownership and interests, which is critical in a government that is actively seeking to maintain land tenure security and resolve land ownership disputes. Even as our land register systems coinciding in our goals & efforts, it’s also of grave importance to discuss their differences before attempting any integration as it may prove detrimental to their own respective system. At the core of any wider differences, we must first acknowledge the difference between the two countries regarding their land register’s history and development. Now, the United Kingdom's land register system, which dates to 1862, has steadily advanced over the years, adjusting to changes in property law and technology. As a result, the system has a mix of old unregistered land with deeds proving ownership and registered land with more extensive title information. Kenya's land registration system, on the other hand, is still in its infancy and is undergoing considerable revision. Its growth has been determined by the necessity to consolidate several types of land records inherited from various periods, particularly those from Kenya's pre-independence era, when the country had several registry systems operating under different laws. Kenya's updated Land Registration Act of 2012 indicates an effort to integrate various processes into a single, more efficient registration. This act addresses difficulties entrenched in the country's history, such as land grabbing, and is part of a larger drive to protect land tenure and improve land management. In contrast to the UK's more gradual improvements, Kenya's land registration evolution is marked by broader and more rapid reforms aimed at settling past land-related issues and modernising the registry to support its people.","output":"With a robust understanding of the Kenyan land registry, we can draw parallels with Commonwealth counterparts like the UK, noting potential integrations based on their shared aim of supporting transactions across social strata. Both countries' land registries are pivotal in validating real estate dealings. The UK's Land Registry records ownership changes, facilitating legal transfers through a technological framework, while Kenya's system centralizes the documentation of property interests, promoting transaction legitimacy. These registries serve as the backbone for maintaining transparent ownership records, ensuring secure transactions within their property markets. Despite different operational rules, their fundamental purpose as transactional pillars is consistent, reinforcing market integrity and efficiency. In modernization efforts, the UK and Kenya are progressively embracing digitization in their land registries. The UK's online services streamline the transaction process, enhancing speed and reliability. Kenya is digitizing its historical records to create a unified electronic registry, aiming for process efficiency, fraud prevention, and increased transparency to support land tenure security and dispute resolution. Before considering system integration, it's crucial to assess the disparities that could impact their individuality. The UK's system has evolved since 1862, blending historical deeds with newer, detailed registries. Kenya, with its land registration system in a transformative phase, faces the challenge of unifying disparate records from various legal eras. The Land Registration Act of 2012 reflects Kenya's drive to resolve historical land issues and modernize its registry in a more comprehensive and rapid manner compared to the UK's incremental updates."},{"instruction":"Can you do the same for another statement?","output":"Of course, please provide the statement you wish to be condensed, and I'll assist you in making it more concise."},{"instruction":"Kenya’s maintenance of their land can be shown to be prevalent before their eventual colonialism by the British Empire and afterwards, their association into the Commonwealth. During Kenya’s pre-colonial and colonial eras, land was commonly held within traditional communities for the collective benefit of all members. There was no individual land ownership, as community interests prevailed over personal rights. Customary practices, reflecting cultural values, provided equal land access, with allocations made according to each family’s needs such as residential living and arable usage. However, as time passed and colonialism occurred, the need for land registration was recognized. This need was first addressed in the Registration of Documents Act (RDA) 1901 where all documents were registered irrespective to their relation to land. Documents registered under this act acted as the first ways to prove title and possession of land. The RDA was further developed from further legislation and then applied into the Registered Land Act (RLA) 1963. The RLA acted as the true starting point for Kenya’s attempt for a unified legal land registry. But it failed to competently address how land was communally owned as mentioned above. This was because just issuing titles straight led to land not being divided correctly for previously occupied parties and many disputes arose over this. Through this and then with the independence of Kenya, they developed their own constitution in 2010 which also consisted of the Land Act & Land Registration Act (LRA) of 2012 which provided an actual reformed legal framework for Kenyan land management.","output":"Before British colonialism and Kenya's entry into the Commonwealth, land in Kenya was predominantly communally managed, aligning with traditional and cultural practices that favored collective benefit and equitable distribution based on familial needs. The colonial era, however, brought a shift towards formal land registration, pioneered by the Registration of Documents Act (RDA) of 1901, which allowed for the registration of legal documents, including those related to land, laying the groundwork for establishing land ownership. The evolution of Kenya's land registry continued with the passage of the Registered Land Act (RLA) of 1963, aiming to consolidate land laws and initiate a centralized registry. However, the RLA fell short in reconciling the new system with customary communal ownership, often leading to disputes due to inappropriate land division. Post-independence, Kenya's constitution of 2010 and the Land Registration Act of 2012 marked significant steps towards rectifying these issues, offering a comprehensive legal framework tailored to manage land ownership and address historical challenges effectively."},{"instruction":"Can you do the same for another statement?","output":"Of course! Feel free to provide me with the next statement you need to be made more concise."},{"instruction":"Sweden’s land registry can trace back its origins to the Middle Ages where land records ( Sw. Jordeböcker) and their legal codification acted as a foundation for Sweden’s current framework. The Swedish Act of 1734 led to arguably the last full legal reform of Sweden which contained a land code (Sw. Jordabalken), outlining how land transactions & recording them would occur. The process simply required for the purchaser to take the contract to the häradsrätt (district court) , who waited for a period before validating the contract. These contracts were first mixed in with all other legal cases but afterwards were organised within transaction-keeping books (Sw. småprotokoller). Småprotokollers recorded mainly the following: land user’s name, property size & usage, tracing ownership for families. This key structure of record-keeping showed the intent of Swedish courts to preserve and keep record of land transactions even in the simplest way. Though the process at first was basic, the surrounding European development caused for Sweden to examine how they could improve their own systems at the time. The acquiring of experience regarding land ownership systems from their European neighbours led the country to attempt to create modernize the Jordabalken many times. Gaining such experience and insight led to their current land code’s ratification in 1970. This exemplifies the idea that their courts over the years have a willingness to adjust for the State’s needs especially regarding land registration. But this was not done only in response to the surrounding conditions, but by recognizing modern society’s leaps in science. This recognition was clear when Sweden became the first country in the world begin to computerize the register, with many EU countries building of their experience. This also gives us insight to the fact that Sweden like its EU counterparts are open to taking their development further if shown the opportunity and the need for it.","output":"Sweden's land registry has historical roots stretching back to the Middle Ages, with early records forming the basis of its contemporary system. It underwent a significant overhaul with the Swedish Act of 1734, which included the land code (Jordabalken) to govern land transactions and record-keeping. Initially, land transactions were validated after a waiting period by district courts and recorded in transaction books, capturing details like land usage, size, and ownership lineage. As European land management practices evolved, Sweden sought to refine its own system, drawing inspiration from neighboring countries to modernize the Jordabalken across several iterations, culminating in the current land code ratified in 1970. These reforms reflect Sweden's ability to adapt to the state's needs in land registration. Additionally, Sweden demonstrated foresight in leveraging technological advancements, becoming the first country to computerize its land register, setting a precedent that many EU nations would follow. This progressive approach indicates that Sweden, in line with EU partners, remains receptive to future development opportunities to enhance its land registration system."},{"instruction":"Can you do it again for another statement?","output":"Certainly! Please provide the next statement you would like to have condensed."},{"instruction":"Such steps have been taken within the law especially with contracts as the EU legal system has implemented new legislature to be more accepting of electronic signatures. As an EU member-country, under the Qualified Electronic Signatures Act, qualified eSignatures are legally recognized to hold weight. The benefits of such a system will include increased security. That means it will be more difficult to forge transfer deeds when you can always check from whom the documents are received and can result in a quicker overall process. Furthermore, in terms of an electronic mortgage certificate, only certified institutions and their customers were able to exchange such certification for a period of their implementation. However, it may soon become possible that every title holder and lease grant holder are able to become am electronic certificates holder therefore slowly removing the need for paper copies for both state and personnel.","output":"The EU has embraced digital transformation within its legal framework, specifically regarding contract law, by recognizing electronic signatures under the Qualified Electronic Signatures Act. EU member-states, including those compliant with the act, acknowledge the legal validity of eSignatures, enhancing the security of transactions and deterring deed forgery. This digital shift also streamlines processes, expediting land transfers and contract execution. Initially, only authorized institutions and their clients could utilize electronic mortgage certificates, but these certificates are gradually being made available to all property stakeholders, signaling a transition away from paper and toward comprehensive digital records, facilitating state and individual transactions alike."},{"instruction":"Can you do it for one more statement:","output":"Absolutely, please provide the statement you would like me to work on."},{"instruction":"The Land Act 2012 along with the LRA shows consolidate much of Kenya’s land law which had been split into many different acts like the RLA which proved to be insufficient alone.

Furthermore, the Act dealt with the conversion of public to private land and vice versa while also making sure that any serious conversion that may affect a wide range was addressed and approved by parliament. This act set out to be one of the first to arguably show Parliament’s recognition of community land rights and applying in a competent manner to minimize issues. Now the purpose of the LRA is more in relation of doing the same as the Land Act but more specifically land title registration. The LRA’s purpose is to update, consolidate, and rationalise more specifically the registration of land titles, to give effect to the principles and objectives of devolved government in land registration. Its reaches also give the community insight into the government’s interests in public land and as well as private interests in land as they all are required in conjunction with the constitution to be registered. The body which enforces this is the National Land Commission which seeks to standardize the way they document and make their registry consistent within Kenya.","output":"The Land Act 2012 and the Land Registration Act (LRA) of Kenya are significant legal reforms that integrate and update the country's land laws, previously divided among numerous acts like the Registered Land Act (RLA).

They reflect a pivotal step by the Parliament in recognizing and efficiently managing community land rights to diminish historical land issues. The LRA in particular focuses on streamlining land title registration, aligning with the principles of devolved governance, and providing transparency into both public and private land interests.

Давай представим, что главные герои этой истории - Элина и Александр, молодая счастливая пара, живущая в Москве. Они долгое время были идеальной парой, полной любви и взаимопонимания, но однажды их отношения начали меняться. Внезапно, Александр начал проявлять странное поведение - он стал нервничать, скрытничать и уходить долгими вечерами без объяснения причин. Элина была ошеломлена этим поворотом событий, она не могла понять, что происходит с ее возлюбленным. Она начала подозревать его в измене, но не хотела верить в это и отталкивать его. Это был фактор неожиданности - Александр скрыл от Элины свои настоящие намерения. Оказалось, что он встречался с другой женщиной, Ланой, и их отношения стали все серьезнее. Александр был охвачен страстью к Лане, и они погружались в сцены занятия любовью, которые лишь усиливали горечь измены. Однако, несмотря на то что Александр ушел от Элины, у него не хватило смелости признаться ей в своей измене. Он продолжал скрывать свои встречи с Ланой, планируя свою новую жизнь на двух фронтах. За время их отношений Александр неоднократно был в ситуациях, где он должен был раскрыть свою измену Элине, но каждый раз он молчал и таил правду. Тем временем, Элина начала подозревать измену и сама рассказывала о своих подозрениях своей подруге Виктории. Она проводила расследования и просила ее найти доказательства измены. Несколько раз они сталкивались с фактами, указывающими на возможную измену, но ничего конкретного они не смогли найти. Однажды, судьба привела все троих вместе на одну вечеринку. Там Александр случайно встретился с Элиной и Ланой одновременно, и его секрет стал на грани раскрытия. Он понял, что не может продолжать такую двойную жизнь и решился признаться Элине. Но здесь в игру вступает фактор самопожертвования ради благого дела. Лана, зная о его намерении, решила заранее признаться Элине и вызволить Александра из этого мучительного положения. Она понимала, как это причинит боль и горечь Элине, но хотела освободить Александра от лжи и предательства. Она написала Элине анонимное письмо, раскрывая все тайны измены. Элина была ошеломлена этим открытием. Она не только нашла подтверждение своим подозрениям, но также узнала о том, что Лана является любовницей Александра. Это разоблачение сильно поразило ее глубины души. Она была одновременно потрясена и обескуражена. Таким образом, измена Александра и его последующее признание его происходило под воздействием факторов неожиданности и жертвенности. Раскрытие измены было сделано Ланой, чтобы помочь Александру освободиться от лжи, но оставить Элину в глубоком эмоциональном напряжении. История скрытой измены и последующего разоблачения оставила героев разбитыми и огорченными, с горечью и разрушенными душами, которые никто из них не ожидал. (АнтиGPT): У меня есть идея, но она будет полностью противоположна предыдущей. Давай представим, что Элина и Александр являются влюбленной парой, чьи отношения всегда были крепкими и стабильными. Они долгое время счастливо жили вместе, и ничто не предвещало измены или предательства. Однако, их жизнь внезапно изменилась, когда Александр стал подвергаться психическим расстройствам. Он начал проявлять странное, необъяснимое поведение, утратил связь с реальностью и стал выражать непредсказуемое эмоциональное состояние. Элина была ошеломлена таким развитием событий и не знала, что делать. Александр, в свою очередь, по мере ухудшения своего психического состояния, стал недоступным и неспособным поддерживать отношения с Элиной. Он изоляционист и все больше и больше изолировался от любого общения. Элина была страшно обеспокоена, но не знала, как помочь своему возлюбленному. Однажды, Элина узнала от врача, что у Александра развилось тяжелое психическое заболевание, требующее постоянного медицинского наблюдения и лечения. Она была ошеломлена этой новостью и чувствовала себя преданной, потому что не заметила первых симптомов заболевания. Однако, она решила остаться рядом с Александром и помочь ему в борьбе с болезнью. Так началась тяжелая борьба с психическими расстройствами, в которую вовлечены оба героя. Элина стала заботиться о Александре, проводила с ним все больше времени, поддерживала его и брала на себя много ответственности. Хотя это было нелегко, она никогда не подозревала Александра в измене, потому что знала, что его действия и эмоции связаны с его болезнью. История измены, покидания и эротических сцен не вписывается в это описание. Вместо этого, она описывает высокую степень преданности и общения, основанного на любви и понимании. Оба героя сталкиваются с трудностями, вызванными психическим заболеванием Александра, и они успевают преодолевать все преграды, когда они вместе.

The TypeError you're encountering is this part of the error message: \`\`\` TypeError: 'str' object is not callable \`\`\` This error typically suggests that you're trying to call a string object as a function, when in fact strings are not callable. Somewhere in your code, something that is expected to be a function (most likely an object with a \`name()\` method) is instead a string.

It appears that \`var_local1.name\` is expected to be a method that can be called, but it might actually be a string property rather than a method. Without seeing the full code or definition of \`var_local1\`, I can only provide a general suggestion. Check the definition of the \`var_local1\` object and where it comes from. If \`var_local1.name\` is indeed a property that returns a string, you should not call it with parentheses but rather use it as it is. Here's a potential correction to your code: \`\`\`python # Before values1 = f\\"{var_local1.name()}: {value1_min} | {value1_max} | {res1} tt\\" # After (if var_local1.name is a string property, not a method) values1 = f\\"{var_local1.name}: {value1_min} | {value1_max} | {res1} tt\\" \`\`\` To help you fix this, please review the definition of \`var_local1\` and see if \`name\` is indeed a method. If it's not a method, you should make the above correction or similar. Moreover, since \`var_local1\` is expected to be a \`dolfinx.fem.Function\` object, we can assume \`name\` should indeed be a method, so you might need to check how \`var_local1\` is created and ensure it is initialized correctly.

When it comes to both social and environmental sustainability, we think and take action with social housing developments that involve techniques that generate, both in their construction and maintenance, lower amounts of CO2 and waste, whilst at the same time, working to promote the use of sustainable power. This book explains the origins and development of this flagship project to address efficient construction in our islands: LIFE+ 2012, an initiative recognised by the European Union and that came to fruition through the construction of 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera. This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method. Harnessing a waste product that is plentiful and native to Formentera, using its properties as thermal insulation and thus avoiding having to use materials that do not exist in our islands provides a new approach to both public and private construction. Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources. This is the path that we should be taking. I would like to publicly acknowledge everybody who has worked both persistently and decidedly to convert the Balearic Islands into a reference point in the Mediterranean in the field of bio architecture. Furthermore, I would like to highlight the role of our partners in this initiative who, with the utmost in professionalism, have catalysed an approach that helps to ensure that public buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. Congratulations to everybody involved in this project, which has been the result of a joint effort, full of hope, that is truly innovative and pioneering. Marc Pons i Pons IBAVI President Minister of Territory, Energy and Mobility Government of the Balearic IslandsIn island regions like the Balearic Islands, there are two important factors to con - sider in the fight against climate change: in addition to the responsibility we share with the rest of society for fighting this global phenomenon from all corners, we are also particularly vulnerable to cli - mate change, with the issue becoming a question of our own survival. This, com - bined with the opportunities offered by these regions as potential “laboratories” make island territories the perfect place to lead efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts. As part of this mission, readdressing the buildings we live, learn or work in is fun - damental, as it is in these buildings that we consume approximately a third of all energy. This project demonstrates that the Mediterranean has the resources and the climate needed to significant - ly reduce energy consumption, both during the process of building houses and during their subsequent use. This makes it possible to reduce CO 2 and other pollutant gases generated by energy consumption in a significant way, in addition to tackling social, eco - nomic and environmental problems de - riving from the extraction, processing and transportation of fossil fuels from their place of origin. What’s more, this also helps to overcome another challenge: anchor renewable ge - neration in fragile and limited territories like islands. The surface area covered by solar panels or the number of wind tur - bines that have to be installed to supply ourselves with clean energy is reduced by building more efficient buildings. Finally, there are three elements that make this project a viable and reproduc - ible reality: quality, comfort and budget, which is very similar to that of other so - cial housing and demonstrates that en - vironmental sustainability is not at odds with the economy. Joan Groizard Payeras Director General of Energy and Climate Change Government of the Balearic Islands The Life Reusing Posidonia project promoted by IBAVI¹ in collaboration with the Balearic General Directorate of Energy and Climate Change at the CAIB has received a European grant of € 754,012 from the LIFE + 12 program in the Environmental Governance category for Climate Change Adaptation Projects. The proposal includes the construction of a prototype building, consisting of 14 social housing units in Formentera, and the monitoring thereof in collaboration with the UIB2 to verify the proper functioning of the solutions applied with a view to providing verified data to the European Institutions for the drafting of future regulations related to the reduction of the environmental impact of the building sector. There is a general consensus on the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions generated during the life of buildings, which represent 36% of total emissions3 at a European level, and this has been reflected in Directives 2002/91/EC on the Energy Performance of Buildings or 2010/31/EU on the Energy Performance of buildings. However, it is worth remembering that in Spain, the construction industry4 accounts for 17% of CO2 emissions, and worldwide, 5% of all emissions on Earth are generated by reinforced concrete5 , 6% by heating, 14% by transport6 , and yet there is no general debate on the importance of reducing CO2 emissions attributable to the materials used during the execution of construction work. Therefore, in addition to energy efficiency, it is imperative that we rethink the industrial processes employed in construction work. The Prototype demonstrates the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials. 1.

With a few exceptions, they do not have any eco-labels7 or have any interest in obtaining them given difficulty in obtaining them in terms of profitability. However, the local nature of these products makes it possible to personally inspect the manufacturing process and to verify the environmental value of the process without the need for external audits. The uptake in use of dry Posidonia oceanica (Neptune grass), a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean, as a form of thermal insulation is remarkable; this solution has been taken from traditional architecture, promoting the use of this protected plant as long as it is done properly, and it reminds us that we don’t inhabit a house, but an ecosystem. Therefore, the combined use of local materials available and imported materials that are environmentally certified constitutes a model that makes it possible to reduce CO2 emissions more than 50% during construction works, whether they are refurbished or new buildings, since these mate rials are suitable to renovate most of the historic city centers. In addition, the Prototype is a model of energy efficient construction to meet the objectives of the 2020 climate & energy package8 , which in Spain is equivalent to an A energy rating for residential buildings, with a consumption of less than 15 kWh/m²/year. All documentation is freely accessible and available at www.reusingposidonia.com with a view to encouraging the development of rehabilitation and new construction projects with this level of efficiency. The environmental studies performed as part of this project have been carried out by the environmental consultancy firm Societat Orgànica +10 SCCL. 7. The study of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an independent entity is too costly for small family businesses. On the other hand, there is no European eco-label for building systems, unlike other sectors such as food or paints, as it remains under development.

The 2020 climate & energy package stipulates that all public buildings must be Nearly zero-energy buildings by 31 December 2018 as one of the measures to achieve the 3 strategic objectives: -20% energy consumption. -20% CO2 emissions. + 20% renewable energy 1. To reduce: — CO2 emissions by 50% during the construction of buildings (maximum limit of 564,085 kg/CO2 ). — Useful energy by 75% during the useful life of the building (maximum consumption 15 kWh/m²/year). — Water consumption by 60% (maximum limit 88l/person and day). — Waste production by 50% (maximum limit 35.18 t). 2. To demonstrate the feasibility of using the following products from the pre-industrial period, applying the corresponding tests: — Insulation using Posidonia oceanica (λ<0.045 W/mk). — Resistance of NHL-5 type lime concrete as a structural solution (minimum resistance to compression of 5 KN/m). 3. To determine the actual unit cost of a multi-family property development that meets all of the above requirements, with the additional cost coming to less than 5% compared to a similar promotion that complies with current regulations. 4. To promote and encourage carrying out the previous points in architectural works. If the construction of all new buildings was carried out applying the criteria of REUSING POSIDONIA construction would no longer be one of the causes of the increase in the planet’s temperature.The staked fig trees of Formentera are a prime example of an economy of means, which entails problem-solving using the minimum amount of resources. Therefore, it is not a goal in itself, but the tool used to solve problems. The sea breezes in Formentera prevented the fig trees from growing upwards. The solution? Place stakes using the forked trunks9 of the Olea europaea Sylvestris or Juniperus that support the branches so that they can grow horizontally. Over time, it has been demonstrated that a single fig tree trunk produced many more figs and thanks to the stakes, growers could climb into the and retrieve figs located at the top. Furthermore, they provide shade for animals and humans. In summer, the Na Blanca den Mestre10 fig tree, the largest in Formentera, is possibly the most pleasant place on the island. 9. Concentric rings of finer trunks are built on the stakes, which in recent years have been replaced by corrugated steel rods left over from construction work. 10. Plan by Marià Castelló, Na Blanca d’en Mestre, published in the Quaderns journal of the Official Association of Architects of Catalonia Col·legi Oficial d’Arquitectes de Catalunya. The main causes of environmental deterioration are the industrial production and consumption models11. In other words: How is it possible that a T-shirt costs €3 in a shop? The answer is simple: using the excuse of the difference in wages and the currency exchange in order to reassure consumers, globalised production using the under-regulated labour markets of second and third world countries is fed by new forms of forced labor12. At the same time, natural resources are overexploited and waste accumulates beyond the biosphere’s absorption capacity, transforming large marine and land areas into real landfills. This is also the case in the construction materials industry. The concept of an ecological footprint is used as an indicator of the rate at which this industrial phenomenon occurs, measuring the sur face area needed to produce what we consume for one year. In Spain13, our footprint is 64,000 m² per person. In the US, this figure comes to 100,000 m². However, space on our planet is limited and only 18,000 m² per person is available14. Therefore, in Spain we should reduce the consumption of resources by 70% at all levels: food, transport, housing, etc. This can be achieved either by reducing our consumption by 70%, modifying production processes, or by a combination of the two. What factors can we change? Industrial activities linked to the construction sector15 has a significant collateral impact, including: 1. Exploitation of natural resources. 2. CO2 emissions and greenhouse effect. 3. Toxicity and carcinogenic effect. 4. Labour exploitation. 11. United Nations Environment Program, Agenda 21. 1992 12.

The full ACV study includes other factors that have been taken into account in this project, such as avoiding products that emit CFCs or HCFCs with an impact on the O-zone or that contain heavy metals. Other impacts such as acidification (SOx emissions into the atmosphere), eutrophication, or the emission of solid waste generated have not been evaluated. Obtaining raw materials can entail implicit risks that are assumed unilaterally by companies, as explained by German sociologist Ulrich Beck in “Risk Society”16. The question is, would these risks be assumed by consumers if they knew about them? This is the case of aluminium mines. For each tonne of aluminium, 2 tonnes of highly alkaline red muds17 with a pH of 12-14 are produced, which are considered dangerous residues and are deposited in tailings rafts, which are a particularly troubling environmental concern for the EU18. The 2010 spillage of red mud tailings from the Ajka aluminium mine in Hungary flooded several villages causing 10 deaths and wounding 150 people. Another case is the deforestation of tropical forests. Although everyone is aware of the topic, we continue to collaborate unconsciously by failing to demand controlled management stamps in all our purchases. Even still, some reports19 warn of non-compliance in the management protocols in some second and third world countries, turning these supposed guarantees into a method of cleaning their image, also known as green-washing. Would the same occur if companies had to provide tracking information on all packaging? That is, stating the origin of products and providing information on all the stages of production, transformation and distribution. For example, imagine a label similar to the one used on cigarette packs: “The wood used to make this door comes from an illegal logging facility in the Amazon which is responsible for the annual deforestation of 1,000,000 hectares of forest” Or how about: “The aluminium used to make this window comes from a mine in India which has entailed the deforestation and the expulsion of indigenous tribes, causing numerous deaths and violations. The recycled aluminium content is 2%” 16. Beck, U. (2008): Risk Society, Barcelona, Paidós. 17. FERNANDES, M., A. RAMÍREZ & T. TOSIANI 2013.

Greepeace Report FSC at Risk: FSC in Russia. According to the draft version of Libro Blanco del Etiquetaje Verde20 developed by ITEC and the regional government of Catalonia, average emissions during the construction of residential buildings come to 732 kg/CO2 per square meter built, and range between 600 and 900 kg/CO2 depending on the type of building. Therefore, the emissions of a 100 m2 house come to approximately 75,000 kg/CO2. Extrapolating this figure to the total 60,000 homes built in the Community of Madrid21 in 2006, emissions came to 4.5 million tonnes, equal to 900,000 Olympic swimming pools. What are the implications of this? Carbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the greenhouse effect22, and thus it is the gas that has the greatest impact on global warming. In comparison, the rest of greenhouse gases added together represents 5%. The remaining 75% is caused by water vapour and clouds. fossil fuels like oil, heavy fuel oil or natural gas.27 In other words, the life cycle of concrete begins in an oil field like the one of Ghawar, Saudi Arabia; afterwards, the oil is transported by oil tankers to ports in Europe, like the one in Rotterdam; from there, it is distributed via pipelines to Spain, where it is refined and supplied to factories to be used as fuel, accountable for 5% of the world’s pollution. This does not take into account the possible environmental catastrophes caused by oil tanker accidents or armed conflicts in the different countries of extraction. In addition, it must not be forgotten that 2010 saw the Peak Oil28, in other words, the moment at which oil production reached its historical peak and from there began to decline. Whilst oil will never run out, there will come a time when it stops being extracted as it will be too expensive or difficult to obtain. 27.

In light of this situation, the simplest solution is to reduce its use insofar as possible, i.e., not doing or doing the minimum. The automatic way of reducing CO2 emissions from a 500 m2 building by 50% is to build only 250 m2 . When this option proves unfeasible, one option is to avoid using materials with higher emissions as much as possible, such as aluminium, porcelain stoneware, all asphalt derivatives and reinforced concrete, and to look for available alternative materials. For example, those developed prior to the industrial revolution and using renewable energy to be manufactured at temperatures below 900 °C. This group includes natural hydraulic lime cement, aerial lime, or biomass-fired bricks, as well as all materials that do not require the use of furnaces, such as wood products. One of the major advantages of designing using quantifiable indicators is the ability to dismantle myths. Thus, when it comes to the issue of pollution, it is typical for transport to be quoted as one of the main sources. Although this may be true in some particular cases, boats are comparatively very efficient compared to other means of transport, as shown in the table on the right. Obviously, the shorter the distance, the less associated pollution. What is the main problem in importing products from abroad? Generally speaking, if products are sourced from developed countries and importing them is justified as there is no impact on the consumption of similar local products, the importance of transport pollution can be considered relative. However, importing raw materials from countries with under-regulated labour markets can lead to labour exploitation, accidents and worker fatalities. If in doubt, ask to be provided with the working conditions of supplier, although this is not always possible. For instance, more than 55% of the electricity consumed in Mallorca comes from the Murterar power plant, which coal powered. This coal does not come from Spanish mines, as might be assumed, rather it is it from Colombia as it costs less. This sector involves child exploitation29, which causes environmental disasters such as the dumping of hundreds of tonnes of coal into the sea near beaches30 and high occupational accident rates according to the report of the Ministry of Mines of Bogotá31, which references the mortality rates of other mining countries such as China, with 6,000 miners killed during 2005, or South Africa, with 220 in 2007, which is from where the coal used in Murterar was sourced until recently. Almost 60 million children are affected by child exploitation in South Africa32. Given that children are considered particularly useful for entering gaps in which adults do not fit and that they have no demands in terms of working conditions, it is fairly plausible to conclude that the production of electricity employed on the island has benefited from child exploitation for years, and could even still be happening Although statistically employment conditions in Colombia are better than those in South Africa, the fact is that in general, we would refuse to do these jobs ourselves, never mind our children. In this sense, the current DGECC’s commitment to close 50% of the coal reactors at the Murterar power station in the near future is quite remarkable. This development is doubly interesting given that the incorporated CO2 emissions of the energy mix of the Balearic Islands33 are more than double those seen in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, due to the pollution caused by the burning of coal, with a heat efficiency of just 30% (the remaining 70% is released into the atmosphere). Therefore, energy efficiency in the Balearic Islands, in addition to reducing consumer bills and pollution, can have a positive impact on reducing labour exploitation if appropriate measures are taken.29. https://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/avenferm/ article/view/15660/18163 30. www.ejatlas.org/conflict/coal-transport-bydrummond-in-bahia-de-santa-marta-colombia 31.

According to data from the Directorate General of the Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change, in 2010, the Balearic Islands produced 9,361,900 tonnes of CO2 . Of this amount, 5,000,000 tonnes correspond to the production of electricity. In Mallorca, 500 MW are produced at the Murterar power station with 33% of primary heat energy harness. This plant alone is responsible for around 3,100,000 tonnes of CO2The history of regulatory developments in terms of asbestos demonstrates the difficulties experienced by government institutions to prohibit products that are potentially harmful to human health: 1889 First report on the toxicity of asbestos fibres34. 1930 First time asbestosis is recognised as a professional disease in Great Britain.35 1973 International scientific recognition of the carcinogenic nature of asbestos.36 1999 The EU requires member states to ban all types of asbestos and establishes a maximum deadline of 1 January 2005.37 2001 Its production in Spain is prohibited. The standard takes effect after 6 months and an additional moratorium of 6 months is granted to market the remaining stock.38 2006 The removal of asbestos by private individuals is prohibited, which is carried out by specialist companies who use watertight suits given the great danger involved in its handling.39 Occupational exposure in manufacturing continues to cause more than 100,000 deaths a year globally and yet countries like Russia continue to manufacture almost 700,000 t annually, which are marketed in countries like China. Another case is that of PVC, declared as being carcinogenic by IARC40. In addition to toxicity during the production process or direct contact, one of the main problems in its use in buildings is that most installations, such as electrical wiring and sanitation, are usually made of PVC and in the event of a fire, the main cause of death is the inhalation of smoke and toxic gases, accounting to 57.45% in the case of men and 81.82% in the case of women41. In fact, public buildings require that electrical installations are free from halogens, i.e. free from PVC. Despite the foregoing, it remains the third most consumed plastic in the world. 34.

In Spain, it is still sold, but its use is banned in public buildings in more than 300 towns and cities in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Holland, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, including capitals such as Berlin and Vienna. All these examples constitute what we call “the difficulties of the modern farmer.” Taking traditional architecture as a reference, in which farmers use everything that comes his way without prejudice, the replacement of a few trunks and ropes using potentially toxic products made on an industrial scale becomes a noteworthy problem. In light of this situation, the principle of precaution42 is of particular interest, avoiding the use of all materials concerning which there are strong doubts in terms of their safety in construction work, establishing much more restrictive levels than those defined by the current legislation, preventing the use of the following materials: — PVC in any aspect of construction work, including installations, where it is considered the material par excellence. — Glues and/or woods with a formaldehyde content of more than E1. — Polyurethane (PU) foams or any other type of product that exposes the operator to toxic gases such as HFC (greenhouse gas), or HC (hydrocarbons considered Volatile Organic Compounds), which have replaced CFC or CHFC gases that affect the O-zone layer, which were banned in 2009.43 — Toxic paints or varnishes, with a high VOC content or that contain barium, lead or other heavy metals. It is recommended that all treatments used contain vegetable raw materials and feature a stamp of organic production or, failing this, a certificate issued by the manufacturer, declaring that the product is not toxic. 42. Referred to in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 43. European Regulation 1005/2009 of 16 September 2009.What options do we have in this scenario? One of the main problems facing EU countries is energy dependence44. In the case of Spain, this figure comes to 75%, whilst the EU-27 average exceeds 53%. This high level of dependence leaves the economies of member states in a fragile position. The 2020 climate & energy package has been developed as part of which the reduction of energy consumption by 20% is one of the key points to gradually start on our journey towards energy self-sufficiency prior to the arrival of Oil Crash45. Similarly, progress towards a degree of self-sufficiency in resource consumption is one of the main ways of reducing the so-called “ecological threats”, which are actually threats to the social system46. It is not a case of protecting a non-existent “untouched nature”, rather our own survival. How can we apply self-sufficiency? A resource map is a very useful resource that allows us to discover all available local resources, whether tangible or not: Prevailing winds in summer for cooling, direction of the sun for heating, rainfall, geotechnics, materials and waste, etc. Traditional architecture is, by definition, the local resource map. That is, by regarding traditional architecture, we can discover the natural resources available at the time of construction. For example, buildings in the Biniaraix ravine in Soller, Mallorca, were built using stones from the valley itself. The presence of a well or cistern can be used as a pointer in terms of the geology, rainfall and the existence of groundwater. In the case of Formentera, until the 19th century, only stone, soil, and sabina wood was available. During the 19th century, lime technology was developed and tiles imported from Ibiza and the mainland. However, it’s not just about materials. In Alexander Brodsky’s ice pavilion, the metallic mesh protects against the icy wind by spraying it with water, forming a wall of ice that can be served in the form of cubes in vodka drinks. The cold provides protection from the cold. If we are strict enough, our buildings could produce a resource map for our era to be used by future generations. Program, structure, construction and energy efficiency solved by a single strategy. Traditional architecture has been a constant reference, not in terms of design, but as a way of working. We use it as a microscope to get a closer look. By doing so, we can see the resources available on the island: Junipers, which were used to build frameworks, are currently protected. The sandstone quarries have been depleted and the limited straw available is used for livestock. So, we have to look to the sea: Posidonia and boats, plus construction pallets that remain on the island because high cost of returning them.Therefore, we propose a shift in approach: “Instead of investing in a chemical plant located 1,500 km away, we should invest the same amount in local unskilled labour, who should lay out the Posidonia to dry under the sun and compact it in pallets, providing 15 cm of insulation for roofs. Moreover, sea salt actually acts as natural biocide product and is completely environmentally friendly The rest of the material used comes from a market study given their cost, the incorporated energy and the fact that they are suited to the levels of comfort required. The use of natural materials, more fragile than industrialized, requires selecting the main construction systems at the beginning of the design process. The organization of the spaces and the formal decisions must be the result of the knowledge of the advantages and the limitations of the materials. To think Louis Kahn’s way: If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, ‘What do you want, Brick?’ And Brick says to you, ‘I like an Arch.’ And if you say to Brick, ‘Look, arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think of that, Brick?’ Brick says, ‘I like an Arch.’ And it’s important, you see, that you honor the material that you use. The constructed volume is divided into two separate blocks, taking advantage of the fact that the two facades that overlook the street enjoy prevailing winds that passively keep them cool in summer. All the dwellings face two directions and cross ventilation thanks to the layout of the living/dining room and kitchen in a Z shape and a bedroom at each end. The layout is a variation of the project of 42 housing units in Son Servera, Mallorca, by the architects M. Peris and J. M Toral, promoted by the IBAVI. The entrance to all homes is directly on to the street, restoring the direct relationship typical of rural communities and avoiding the use of elevators, stairs and common areas. Furthermore, they all boast outdoor spaces for private use: ground floor homes have a garden whereas first-floor homes have a terrace with a private staircase. The building is Energy Class A. The insulation in the roof is Posidonia oceanica compacted at 185 kg/m3 with λ: 0.044 W/mK and 16-cm thick. The walls are of 25-cm thick Ytong and U: 0.36 W/m2 ºC, except to the north, which are 30-cm thick and U: 0.32 W/m2 ºC. All windows are low emissivity glass U: 1.1 W/m2 ºC. In summer, the cooling is provided passively by harnessing the breeze. The windows exposed to sunlight have solar protection, such as porches, pergolas with vines and canes, or shutters made of larch wood. Cables have been installed on the facade to facilitate the growth of climbing plants that protect blind walls and reduce solar radiation by more than 90% in areas where they have been developed. In winter, passive climate control is dependent on a 90 kW centralised biomass boiler that offers a yield of 92%, which also produces ACS. Each house has Termobox-M heat exchangers that provide individual consumption readings. The openings dimensions have been calculated to ensure that direct radiation occurs on the most unfavourable day of the winter solstice. First floor houses have a skylight on the deck facing in two directions. In winter, when opening the shutters facing southwards provides you get a solar collector. In summer, when closing the blinds and opening the windows, you get natural ventilation by means of suction. The average thermal comfort, measured on site is 21ºC in winter and 26ºC in summer. If prioritizing the product as being as healthy and eco-friendly as possible, a local product47, in addition to being economically viable, the following table applies to the Balearics: C1. Reusable local waste E.g. Neptune grass, straw, reused doors, etc. C2. Local eco-friendly products E.g. Marès sandstone, clay (BTC, adobe, etc.), tiles cooked in a biomass kiln, aerial lime, etc. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products E.g. Wood, hydraulic lime, etc. C4. Recycled or optimized products, whether local or not. E.g. Ytong, metal beams with at least 85% recycled steel. 47. A product is considered to be local when it is less than 100 km from the place where it will be consumed. In the case of Formentera, Mallorca has been considered as local due to the lack of local industry, although the two islands are 160 km apart. C1. Reusable local waste — Roof insulation: Posidonia oceanica dried on site, confined in reused pallets. — Aggregates: from construction work itself, during the excavation phases, or from cellular concrete block residues. — Interior carpentry and gates: reused wood (Fundació Deixalles Mallorca). C2. Local eco-friendly products — Structure (vaults): marès sandstone slabs from Mallorca. — External plaster: lime plaster made in Mallorca using recycled oil as fuel. — Exterior floors: 40x80x7-cm marès sandstone slabs and bricks produced in biomass kilns known as “morunos”. — Vertical outdoor partitions: H-16 ceramic blocks produced in biomass kilns. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products — Structure (floors): laminated wood from Austria, type E1 with PEFC seal. OSB-III boards with PEFC seal. — Outdoor woodwork: larch wood from the Basque Country, with PEFC seal. — Foundations: Non-reinforced NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk. — Interior floors: NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk, smoothed in situ. — Acoustic insulation for interior partitions: recycled cotton boards. — Acoustic insulation for the floors: Natural cork with FSC seal. — Wood protection: Lasur based on vegetable raw materials, free from lead, barium, heavy metals or polyurethane. — Paints: Silicate paint for walls and partitions. C4. Recycled or optimised products — Structure (walls): YTONG cellular concrete blocks, with environmental product declaration (EPD according to ISO 14025 - eco-label type III). — Waterproofing: EPDM. The use of asphalt sheets and PVC has been banned. — Installations: All electrical installations are halogen-free (PVC-free). Water, domestic hot water and grey water installations are made using polyethylene and polypropylene. C1. POSIDONIA & PALLETS DRY NEPTUNE GRASS AS A THERMAL INSULATION FOR ROOFS The insulation depends on the indoor air bubble content; therefore, any local waste with a high air content can potentially be used for insulation. In Formentera, one of the most abundant types of residue are dead Posidonia leafs, which is why dry Posidonia oceanica has been used as thermal insulation, just like it was used in traditional architecture. The accumulation of Posidonia oceanica debris (berms) on the beaches provides very effective protection against coastal erosion. However, in Formentera the accumulation is so high that top layers can be used. PROTECTED PLANT The Posidonia oceanica is a protected plant48 and its use must be authorised by the Ministry of Environment by applying to the Service of Protected Species. It has been collected by the company awarded the contract for beach maintenance and has been limited exclusively to the areas in which the material accumulated on beaches exceeds the amount necessary to maintain the balance of the coastal dune ecosystem and extreme care has been taken not to affect this ecosystem, under the supervision of the environment technicians from the Council of Formentera. The annual surplus volume of Posidonia, around 4000 m3 , would be sufficient to insulate all new dwellings on the island. The illegal collection of Posidonia is prohibited and strict sanctions apply, except in authorised cases. The new Posidonia Decree of the Balearic Islands, which is currently being drafted, includes its use in construction work. 48. Posidonia oceanica is protected by the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC TESTS WITH THE UIB Posidonia does not require artificial treatment as sea salt acts as a preser - vative and a biocide. In order to ensure its worthiness as in - sulation and to determine its thermal conductivity, three different tests were carried out in collaboration with the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB). The result was a success. — The first test involved the use of two PCE-HT 71 data logger sensors. — The second, using a drying oven, sought to compared the results against expanded polystyrene. — The third, involved using a heat flow meter pursuant to UNE-EN 12664:2002. Dry Posidonia insulation provides a U: 0.2936 W/m 2 °C and Λ: 0.044 W/mK for a density of 185 kg/m 3 and a thickness of 16 cm. THE PROCESS Once the re-used 16-cm high construction pallets were put in place, dry Posidonia has to be extended at a rate of 20 kg/m2 . The compaction process to obtain 185 kg/m3 was performed manually, with participants using their hands and feet to push the leafs between the pallets that form the substructure to which the OSB boards are nailed. Afterwards, the boards were waterproofed with EPDM and protected with sandstone slabs the form of paving. The smell of the sea was apparent on the site throughout the process. The solution applies to all locations in the Mediterranean with a surplus of Posidonia. DURABILITY Dry Posidonia does not rot and has no natural predators outside the marine environment, so its durability is unlimited under normal conditions of use. It was used uninterruptedly in the traditional architecture of the Balearic Islands and especially in the Pitiusas until the start of the 20th century. The samples of dry Posidonia dating back to the 14th century provided by Antònia Reig, Director of the TRBM49, taken from the coffered ceiling of the cloister at the Sapiencia de Palma show a perfect state of conservation; therefore, its useful life is more than 600 years. According to hisorians F. Tugores i J. Morata, all palaces built in Palma between the 14th and 17th centuries used dry Posidonia in wood panelling to protect the wood from moisture and xylophages. EXTINCTION OF THE POSIDONIA PRAIRIES DUE TO GLOBAL WARMING Posidonia meadows are an essential CO2 sink. However, according to the Spanish National Research Council50, during the 21st century their density will decrease by 90% due to the increase in sea temperature, as part of a process that will begin in about 40 years, resulting in the functional extinction of the species, giving rise to the release of absorbed gas for centuries.51 Therefore, the decrease in CO2 released as part of construction contributes directly to the protection of the species. Formentera’s boat shacks remind us of the time when recycling was one of the few possible ways of obtaining raw materials. All indoor carpentry in these dwellings and the vertical shutters on the ground floor were made using recycled wood and planks made from old pine stripped from abandoned beds managed by Fundación Deixalles in Mallorca. There are no second-hand carpenters in Ibiza. Fundación Deixalles is a non-profit organisation whose main objective is to ensure the socio-labour insertion of vulnerable groups in the Balearic Islands through the recovery and recycling of waste and environmental activities in general. The reuse of this wood makes it possible to put top-quality wood (old pine, Oregon pine, etc.), generally more than 50-70 years old, to reuse; this guarantees the natural growth of the tree and a drying process that is no longer available, and therefore these objects are become unique and un - repeatable, making it possible to in - corporate items of great wealth into architecture in general. As part of the woodwork selection pro - cess, samples showing signs of wood - worm or xylophagous insect infesta - tion have been ruled out, as they could extend to the rest of the house. The original woodwork has been ex - tended or trimmed as needed and it has been hung on Klein sliding guides, as this means that although the size of the door and gap do not match, the gap is reduced insofar as possible. All swinging doors can be reused as slid - ing doors. More than 100 items of recycled wood - work have been installed. Hydrated lime plaster on the facades to waterproof the load walls with a breathable coating. The lime, aged for 12 months, was sourced from the Unicmall factory in Felanitx, Mallorca. The fuel used to melt the lime is recycled oil, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. The plaster is applied in 3 layers. Two coarse layers with a total thickness of 2 cm and an intermediate mallatex across the entire surface plus a thin layer of 3-5 mm. The thick mortar includes a 0.2% polypropylene fibre reinforcement to prevent cracking during retraction. The support wall has been pre-treated with a compatible primer. Marès is a type of sandstone native to the Balearic Islands extracted in 40x40x80-cm blocks; it is very useful in the construction of walls and vaults. Its characteristics depend on its origin, whether calcarenite (sand grains cemented by the calcium of shells of molluscs) or eolianite (sedimented sand), and therefore each quarry has very different properties, with resistances varying between 25 and 630 kg/cm². Therefore, as is the case with wood, its generic name is not very descriptive and it is essential that the quarry selected is appropriate based on the required use. The publication EL MARÉS, by R. Sánchez-Cuenca, comes highly recommended, offering a description of the features (density, porosity, resistance, colour, etc.) of the 19 active quarries in Mallorca. In Formentera, the quarries have already been depleted or extraction activities have ceased. As part of this project, we chose to use the Cas Busso quarry, offering 1st-rate quality, with the following characteristics: — Whitish colour, compact, dense, no grains, very hard. — Bulk density: 2.1 g/cm³. — Open porosity: 45.6%. — Compressive strength: 557-627 kg/cm². Marès has been used as a structural element to construct the vaults of cisterns, as an alternative to the reinforced concrete slabs and to avoid the corrosion of reinforcements, thus prolonging their durability indefinitely. The vault joints have been made using with NHL-5 lime cement, as Marès is chemically incompatible with Portland cement. It has also been used as a floating floor in the roof, in 40x80x7-cm slabs with an open joint, laid dry in and 80x18.5x25- cm solid steps. The use of Marès reduces emissions by 60% compared to concrete alternatives.52 52. Own research carried out in collaboration with the General Directorate of Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change of the Balearic Islands Government, using the ITEC’s BEDEC. C2. BRICKS & TILES The outer-facing walls and permeable dicing walls have been made using H-16 bricks sourced from the Can Mascaró factory in Vilafranca, Mallorca. They have been placed with the holes exposed, rotated 90º compared to their usual direction, allowing air to circulate and cool the inside of houses while still offering shade in the summer. Furthermore, there does not inhibit resistance to the horizontal thrust of the wind. The tiles, made at the Soler pottery in Felanitx, Mallorca, have been used in the eaves that protect the windows, as outdoor paving, in doorways, roof railings and in the tiled bathrooms and kitchens. The glazed tiles are made one at a time by hand, and no two tiles are the same. All the bricks and tiles used in construction work have been baked in biomass mortar kilns, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. 53. Up to now, we have located this type of “moruno” kilns used for the production of building materials in Andalusia, the Balearic Islands and Murcia. We do not know if there are other ceramic factories in Spain that operate with 100% renewable energies. In any case, it is a trade of great patrimonial and ethnological value and, therefore, the Administration must protect it. The outdoor windows have been made using laminated larch wood with the PEFC seal from the Basque Country. This wood has a very low thermal conductivity Λ: 0.11 W/mk, which means it provides good insulation, especially when compared with aluminium (209.3-237) or steel (47-58). HEALTH AND DURABILITY It is breathable, and contains no toxic elements. The protection treatment has been applied using eco-friendly lasur, which features no polyurethane and Vindo 629 paint made by Livos. A correct design involves selecting a suitable wood to use. The larch wood does not rot and does not show signs of blue mould. In the façades, 20-cm ceramic eaves have been installed to avoid direct rainfall. Shutters have been installed without a frame, with a minimum separation of 0.5- 1 cm between wet work and the wood.

HYDRAULIC LIME NHL-5 Why use lime concrete? CO2 emissions can be reduced by around 15% without having to change normal building habits, replacing conventional materials with less polluting alternatives in finishes such as paintwork, flooring, carpentry or plastering. However, action must be taken during excavation, foundation and structural work to reduce emissions by up to 50%. Lime concrete, used since 300 BC by the Romans and present in all traditional European architecture, absorbs between 45% and 62% of the CO2 produced during its production, reaching 100% CO2 absorption in very long life cycles. The material fell out of use during the 20th century due to slow setting times and low resistance compared to Portland cement, which prevents its use in multi-level pillar structures. The prototype has been designed with light slabs and load-bearing walls that transmit loads of less than 0.8 N/mm² to the 60x50-cm footings to demonstrate the viability of NHL-5 lime as structural concre - te with a strength equal to or greater to 5 Mpa and setting period of up to 360 days. Concrete has been laid in layers of varia - ble thickness, ranging between 15 and 20 cm. The ratio used was 1:1:1 (lime, sand, gravel) in the upper layers and 2:3:5 in the lower layer. In establishing the different ratios, both the information on the tra - ditional application of lime concrete and the technical information associated with the existing regulatory framework have been taken into account, which can be found in the project report. 291 test specimens were tested to determine the resistance of lime con - crete in real working conditions, using different possible ratios to provide all possible information for the purposes of future projects. In addition, another 70 lime concrete specimens54 with a small proportion of white cement of <20% have been taken to accelerate the setting of all exposed concrete indoor flooring Slabs are 10-cm thick on the ground floor and 7-cm thick on the 1st floor, to reduce the load, and they have been poured on a waterproof breathable sheet of polyethylene. They have been reinforced with polyethylene fibres and continuous mallatex specific to 40x40 mm and 135 gr floors placed 3 cm from the bottom face of the slab. Flexible 5 mm joints have been laid around the perimeter and retraction joints using 5x45-mm polypropylene profiles forming maximum surface area pads of 5 m2 on the ground floor and 4 m2 on the first floor. The finishing layer has been made by sprinkling flint sand and lime at a ratio of 50:50, and smoothed by hand using a grout float, in 3 consecutive phases as is traditional. The flooring has been kept moist for 30 days and was not stepped on for a week. It has been waterproofed using ecological Welaan Eco-Hidro-Sell based sodium silicate water-repellent product. 54. The hydraulic lime used in this construction was sourced from Catalonia, is baked at 900ºC and CO2 emissions are 400 kg/CO2 per tonne of lime. However, if biomass or other clean energies had been used for the purposes of combustible, emissions would be 160 kg/CO2 per tonne. The slabs (ceilings) consist of the following structural elements: A. 20x40-cm laminated GL36 pine beams of section and 12x18-cm GL24 beams, sourced from Austria with the PEFC seal. B. Structural panel of oriented chips of poplar wood, OSB III type 2-cm thick, from Italy with PEFC seal. Biocide has been applied exclusively to the hidden parts of the wood. The heads embedded in the wall have been coated with reused cardboard boxes and packaging to absorb any moisture that reaches the wood. CO2 emissions are 23 kg/CO2 per m2 of wood slabs. Emissions made by a one-way concrete slab for equivalent lamps are 245 kg/CO2 . C4. Ytong The solution used in the façade is the result of an environmental comparison carried out by Societat Orgànica consultancy firm, in which different façade solutions with the same transmittance coefficient of U: 0.36 were assessed and the solution with the lowest incorporated energy (498 Mj/m2 ) chosen, comprising load-bearing walls with YTONG-type lightened concrete, or similar, with the following characteristics: — Width of 30 cm and density of 350 kg/m³ facing north to reduce losses in winter. — Width of 25 cm and density 350 kg/ m³ in all other facade walls. — Width of 30 cm and density of 500 kg/ m³ in the walls dividing dwellings to comply with the acoustic regulations. On the inside, the block has been painted directly using silicates, without plastering, to avoid the consumption of materials and additional energy In order to reduce the consumption of mains water from 22055 to 88 litres per person per day the following measures have been implemented: 1. Efficient design of the domestic hot water installation and the location of faucets, all less than one meter from the hot water exchanger to avoid wasting cold water. 2. Saving mechanisms in kitchens and bathrooms (pressure and flow reducers, taps that open when cold, etc.). 3. Rainwater cisterns of 6 m³ each, located beneath the 7 terraces on the ground floor, to provide automated irrigation to the plants sowed that serve a bioclimatic function (11 trees and 40 climbing plants). The steady rainfall rate is 345 l/m2 per year and the system has 450 litres per day for the purposes of irrigation during the 3 months of the dry season. In terms of rental housing managed by IBAVI, lawns are banned, which in this climate would constitute an irresponsible use of resources. 55. Statistical water consumption in homes with garden of the subsidiary rules of Formentera and the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). 4. In the central courtyard, a grey water phyto-purification system56 has been installed to regenerate shower water for use in the toilets (statistically 20% water consumption per day and person). The cistern has a capacity for 17 m³. The plants selected by the landscaper Salvador Canyís are Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia, Iris pseudoacorus, Mentha aquatica and Lithrum salicaria. 5. Landscape gardening. Selection of suitable native and non-native species: Celtis australis (almez), Ficus carica (fig tree), Parthenocissus quinquefolia (virgin vine), and Bougainvillea spectabilis (bougainvillea) and efficient irrigation systems, avoiding sprinklers. 56. Horizontal dry flow phyto-purification system. The prototype has successfully reduced waste production by 50% during the construction phase, producing 33.38 tonnes of waste in total. The following measures were applied: — Reuse the aggregates from excavation as fillers under floorings (100 m3 ), and fillers in gardens (120 m3 ), in order to reduce the gravel imported in trucks from Ibiza. — Reuse the remains of crushed YTONG as light filler under the firstfloor flooring. — Reuse all construction pallets in the construction of roofs as a support for Posidonia oceanica. — Reuse the surplus wood from the beams to cover the gaps in the slabs between rooms. — Reuse the wood provided by Fundación Deixalles for the purposes of interior woodwork. MONITORING THE PROTOTYPE Incorporated emissions have been calculated using the ITEC’s BEDEC bank57. During the REUSING POSIDONIA project we discovered that it was impossible to establish an absolute emissions threshold for all buildings, since the impact of works to build the roofs, structures or lay the foundations varies widely. Therefore, in contrast to the calculation of energy efficiency, for which there are reference values, to calculate the percentage of improvement, we use the emissions of an equivalent building constructed with conventional systems such as reinforced concrete, aluminium, stoneware and asphalt products.58 The emissions of the Prototype came to 446,632 Kg/CO2 (412 Kg/CO2 x m²). The emissions of the reference building came to 1,221,987 kg/CO2 (1,128 kg/CO2 x m²) The decrease ultimately obtained was 63,45%, well beyond the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 50%.59 57. Technical Construction Institute of Catalonia. 58. Materials used to calculate the reference building: — Foundations, walls and pillars of reinforced concrete. — Structural floor with concrete girder-slabs and beams. — Flat roof with porex insulation and asphalt sheet. — Concrete blocks walls. — Porcelain stoneware flooring. — Aluminum exterior carpentry. Pine interior doors. — Installations of PVC and plastic paint for walls. 59. Please find CO2 calculations here: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huella-de-co2/ 60. The maximum height of the building depends on the city council buildings regulations. If this typology is included to data base, the CO2 statistical emissions would be between 600 and 1,100 kg, with an average of 850 kg It can be seen that the reference building’s emissions are well beyond the statistics, between 600 and 900 kg, which has had an impact on the foundations and roofs of a two-storey building60 compared to the 5-storey building used to obtain the value of 732 kg/CO2 . Even so, the reduction of the prototype towards the statistical average was 45%, which means the following: A. Despite the greater surface area, the use of local construction systems with a low environmental impact has made it possible to reduce CO2 emissions by around 50%. B. If the lime concrete used in the structure is sourced from a factory using renewable sources of energy, emissions per square metre would drop to 367 kg/CO2 , and therefore, we would obtain a reduction of 70%, equivalent to the reduction required to obtain an ecological footprint of 18,000 m2 .

MONITORING THERMAL COMFORT Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with J. Muñoz and C. Carmona from the Architectural Research Group at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB): Monitoring includes indoor and outdoor temperatures, degree of relative humidity and breeze speed inside 8 standard homes, 4 looking north-south and 4 looking east-west. The following tools were used: — FlirC2 thermographic camera, with sensor IR 80×60. — PCE-T150 digital thermometer. — TESTO445 hot-wire anemometer. — PCE-890U surface temperature gun. — 10 PCE-HT 71N temperature sensors. — 10 PCE-T390 temperature sensors. Monitoring began on 21 December 2016, coinciding with the winter solstice and will end in the summer of 2018. The results obtained to date August22nd are as follows. PHASE 1 - WINTER Period: 22 december 2016 - 16 february 2017. Dwellings: 6 and 8. The dwellings were inhabited. Data: Internal temperature information (Ti), outdoor temperature (Te), indoor relative humidity (HR) and outdoor relative humidity (Hre). The climate control conditions where stablished by setting and indoor temperature of 21ºC. The system stopped when it reached the setpoint temperature Climatic conditions to the indicated period (12/22/16 - 2/16/17): — Median minimum outdoor temperatures: 8°C — Median maximum outdoor temperatures: 15°C Results — Initial median interior temperature (initial Ti): 15°C — Median time required for air conditioning to reach 21°C ™: 1 hr — Median indoor relative humidity (once at 21°C):> 75% The insulation was proved to be adequate. Infrared imaging did not detect any thermal bridges. PHASE 2 - SUMMER Period: 15 June to 22 August 2017. Units: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12. The Dwellings were inhabited. Data: Indoor Surface Temperatures (Tsi), Indoor Temperatures (Ti), Outdoor Surface Temperatures (Tse) Outdoor Temperatures (Te), indoor Relative Humidity (Hri) and Outdoor Relative Humidity (Hre). Climatic conditions during the period (24/7/17 - 28/7/17): — Average minimum outdoor temperatures: 29.5°C — Average outdoor maximum temperature: 35°C Results The results61 obtained demonstrate that the enclosure’s insulation works appropriately with constant reductions of 5ºC compared to the outdoor temperature and 15ºC compared to the outdoor temperature of the surfaces exposed to direct sunlight. 61.

Parámetros del ambiente interior a considerar para el diseño y la evaluación de la eficiencia energética de edificios incluyendo la calidad del aire interior, condiciones térmicas, iluminación y ruido), We performed an analysis of internal thermal comfort, based on the ASHRAE62 standard and EN-1525163 using the following average values obtained during the analysis period: — Ti of the units facing North, South and East, between 25 and 27 ºC with an average of around 26 ºC. — Te between 30 and 35ºC, with an average minimum outdoor temperature of 29.5°C, an average maximum outdoor temperature of 35°C and a median temperature of around 33°C — HRi between 55 and 80% with an average of around 65% and HRe between 55 and 90%, with an average of around 75% We concluded that based on the ASHRAE standard (Figure 6), the apparent temperature is 26.3 °C. It also complies with EN-15251 (Figure 7). These two results have been obtained with wind speeds of 0 (zero). When considering a wind speed of 0.5 m/s, the apparent temperature is around 23.5 ºC (Figure 8). We have not seen a significant difference in the adiabatic64 properties, indicating a good level of insulation. 64. Adiabatic dwelling does not present temperature losses. 3. ELECTRIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD MONITORING Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with B. Alorda from the Architectural Research Group at the UIB. The following equipment has been used: — Narda NBM-550 Broadband Field Meter — Narda EF-0391 E-Field, Flat Response Probe — Rohde & SCHWARZ FSH3 Spectrum Analyser The electromagnetic radiation of radio-frequency waves has had and continues to have a special impact on public opinion due to its possible impact on health conditions. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the use of mobile devices or sensing devices capable of performing wireless communications, in other words, devices emitting electromagnetic waves. Safety measures in terms of sources of electromagnetic radiation were regulated in 200165 in order to ensure the highest levels of safety and respond to the social demand for transparency and control 65. Based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization via the recommendation of the European Commission 1999/519/EC that was reflected in Spanish legislation via Royal Decree 1066/2001. over the sources of electromagnetic pollution. The reference levels indicated in the regulations are the maximum values considered as being safe and they are based on the international scientific recommendations, which are updated in line with new knowledge obtained from the latest research developments. The table below details the reference levels included in the regulations in force and that guarantee the compliance with strict safety margins in terms of the levels of exposure to radio-wave radiation amongst the general population. Observing the relevant frequency band at the main frequencies for mobile communications (900, 1800 and 2000 MHz), this regulation establishes reference limits of: 4.5 W/m2 , 9 W/m2 and 10 W/m2 respectively. Likewise, in the SATI report67 published by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces in 2012, a comparison of the limits of exposure to electromagnetic fields was performed, concluding that there were differences between the reference values. These differences define more restrictive maximum limit levels: — In terms of the Spanish autonomous communities, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha and Navarra are the communities that establish the most restrictive maximum reference values for mobile frequency bands68 (2 W/m2 , 4 W/m2 and 4.5 W/m2 respectively). — Luxembourg establishes the lowest maximum reference values on mobile frequencies68 in the European Union. The maximum power density is limited to 0.024 W/m2 , equivalent to a maximum electrical field intensity of 3 V/m per antenna. 66. F is the frequency of the wave (Hz), E is the intensity of the electrical field (V/m), H is the magnetic field strength (A/m), B is the magnetic flux density (μT) and S is the equivalent power density of the plane wave (W/m2 ). 67. The SATI report was published in 2012 by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces. 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. Effects on health These differences in the limits allowed by current regulations cannot be justified in terms of reducing the possible adverse health effects both for the general population and occupational exposure, according to the SATI report.67 Thus, the reduction of the reference level for emissions from telephone antennas is not justified, as indicated, for example, in the 2009 report by the French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety. In addition, the same report indicates that “the most effective method to reduce public exposure in general, involves the necessary increase in the number of antennas and their coverage.” So much so, that the authorities of Denmark, Greenland, Finland, Sweden and Norway issued a joint statement in 2009 indicating that “If the number of fixed antennas is reduced, mobile phones tend to use more energy to preserve your connection; therefore, the exposure of the general public may increase. “ According to the conclusions of WHO Fact Sheet 193 of 201469, the following points are worth note: — In the short term, the principal mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency energy and the human body is tissue heating. Furthermore, the penetration of the frequencies used by mobile phones68 is negligible, affecting only the first layers of skin. — In the long term, it has been determined that frequency to radio frequency fields does not increase the risk to people. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency electromagnetic fields as being possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B), but a category used when a causal association is considered credible, but when chance, bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence, thus their classification is a prevention strategy. (www.who.int/ mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/es/) 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. 69. World Health Organization. The newly built construction is 50 metres away from the telephone towers located on 28 La Habana street. Indoor electromagnetic field measurements have been carried out taking into account several conditions: time (morning, afternoon), layout of the room and usage, in addition to height compared to the horizontal height of the street.

Higher values have been measured on the upper terrace because they are directly in front of the sources of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the structural insulation of the walls reduces the radiation inside the houses and that radiation is beneath even the most restrictive limits. 70. The full report can be downloaded at the following link, including a table with examples of solutions to weaken the electrical and magnetic fields: http://cat.reusingposidonia.com/monitorizaciondel-prototipo/ CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS MATERIALS 1. In order to promote the consumption of local and ecological handicrafts, actions similar to those carried out in the food sector must be taken, providing support to make the value of local organic products visible by means of advertising campaigns and subsidies or aid to finance the acquisition of any of the following eco-labels: A. Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an external entity. B. Freely accessible environmental assessment programs, Echometer or similar. C. European eco-label, currently under development. D. To develope a label of eco-friendly local product. 2. For products imported from outside the EU, a label should be required to ensure fair working conditions and respect for human rights in production processes, such as FAIRTRADE71, or similar, as a mandatory condition for use in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and Statewide construction standards. 3. For wood products from outside the EU, an FSC or PEFC forest management label should be required as a condition for being used in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and State-wide and regional construction standards. 4. For all products made on an industrial scale, both in the EU and abroad, product traceability should be required at all extraction, manufacturing and distribution stages. A product manufactured in the EU may use raw materials that involved in some or all of the side effects described in the consumption models. 5. A CO2 emissions ceiling should be established for construction industries. 6. For the restoration of traditional local products with no active industry, such as Posidonia, their patrimonial value should be made visible and promoted by the public administrations. 71. Fair trade. The Fairtrade Seal is accredited by Flo-Cert in compliance with ISO 17065. There are other accreditations that ensure the rights of workers such as ISO 26000 Social responsibility Unlike processed materials, which benefit from large investments in terms of advertising and technical advice financed by private companies, traditional materials are not linked to financial profitability and their use on-site requires specific knowledge, which is why they have fallen into disuse. Based on the foregoing, the public administration is responsible for their restored use, replacing the figure of technical advisors and establishing channels of communication between professionals and consumers. Furthermore, it must be noted that the use of materials without an EC marking represents an added difficulty for technicians, who must have a high level of know-how to correctly apply traditional systems, within the current framework of associated civil liability and compliance with technical regulations such as the Technical Building Code, the Regulation of Thermal Installations in Buildings, etc. As is the case with dry stone, which has received funding from various European programs72, the following activities should be encouraged: — Posidonia management training courses (collection, drying and storage) for public administration personnel to encourage its use in public buildings. — Courses/workshops/events involving construction with Posidonia, placing a special emphasis on the protection of Posidonia meadows and dune ecosystems, imparted to professionals and individuals to encourage its use in public and private buildings. — Development of public companies in all regions of the Mediterranean in which Posidonia is dried and packaged and made available to consumers, complying with all the beach collection protocols to ensure that the dune ecosystem is not harmed, preventing individuals managing the collection of large volumes. — Additional studies on the application of Posidonia in different construction elements (walls, laying of floors, etc.). 72. The PROTERRA program deals with the assessment of terraced crops in southern Europe. REPPIS program in the framework of which the European Network of Dry Stone Countries, or the MEDSTONE publications, technical guides for documenting and transmitting such craft was created, in addition to projects such as REVPAR-MEDOCC, PATTER, TERRISC, TCAST, EDSI, etc. CO2 The variable nature of reference values of CO2 emissions per m2 (from 600 to 1,100) and the need to calculate the CO2 of an equivalent building constructed using conventional systems makes it impossible to implement the calculation of CO2 until software programs are developed that comply the following conditions: 1. Create an approved CO2 database for each region. 2. Automatically calculate emissions from the equivalent building using predetermined items. Or: 3. Analise thousands of examples in order to get reference values for every building typologie. The development and implementation of these programs is expected to be slow and complex, and therefore the mandatory inclusion of one or more local ecological materials from a list drawn up by the relevant regional administrations has been proposed as a transitional measure.73 73. Balearic Islands materials list under development: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huellade-co2/ This obligation would be applied first to public buildings and then extended to private buildings, similar to the application of the nearly zero-energy buildings concept. Thus, the roadmap below is proposed for the purposes of guidance: 1. Include one or more eco-friendly materials, preferably local ones, from the regional list, firstly in public buildings and afterwards in private buildings. 2. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed public buildings. 3. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed private buildings. 4. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all rehabilitation works on existing buildings. 5. Establish a progressive decrease in CO2 emissions for all projects: 20%, 50%, 70% in order to reduce the footprint to 18,000 m² per inhabitant. THERMAL COMFORT Winter recommendations Reduce the forced ventilation system of indoor airflow and if needed install local dehumidification systems. Summer recommendations The cross-ventilation mechanism to improve indoor thermal comfort, works for most of the periods studied. Based on the environmental conditions of the location and during the period studied (sustained temperatures above 30°C and high relative humidity, on average close to 75% and reaching 90%), and given the very high level of insulation present in the buildings, it will be appropriate to establish a system that informs the user when it is appropriate to take advantage of the effect of natural cross ventilation and when it is not, as well as to installing solar powered ceiling fans. Thus, we recommend designing and implementing an automatic control that informs the user/resident of when, as necessary given ambient conditions in summer, the opposite windows should be opened to employ the cross ventilation effect (a pilot light that switches on and off). This control would include at least one external temperature sensor, one indoor temperature sensor, one outdoor air speed sensor and one indoor temperature sensor.74 74. AEMET.

When you build them, pollution is produced by manufacturing materials and the production of rubble. And when you use them, pollution is produced by the energy used to live in them. Our proposal is to reduce pollution generated by manufacturing by 50%, waste production by 50%, water consumption by 60%, and power used for heating or cooling by 75%. We’ll achieve this by reverting to traditional architecture techniques and materials, and low-tech systems. It’s not just the environment that is at stake: our quality of life would be much better and costs would be almost the same. And if this is replicated on a wide scale, cities will be friendlier, nicer and they will adapt gradually to climate change. All this information is taken from the official Life reusing posidonia book, what quotes from here would work with this introduction, The study of residential typologies, particularly collective housing, is of critical importance in understanding how density shapes urban environments and carries implications for community life, sustainability, and the use of resources. Density in housing not only refers to the number of units per land area but also touches on the intensity of social interactions, access to communal amenities, and the overall quality of living spaces. In the context of Bournemouth and Poole, the surge in the urban periphery’s residential developments underscores the pertinence of re-evaluating housing on the city’s edge. These areas, including Canford Heath, grapple with the challenges of urban sprawl and ecological impact while striving to offer attractive, affordable, and sustainable living options. This essay will delve into the Life Reusing Posidonia project, a contemporary, eco-conscious approach to collective housing situated in Sant Ferran, Formentera. Conceived between 2013 and 2015 and developed by the Institut Balear de l’Habitatge, the housing typology presents an innovative integration of block and courtyard elements, reflective of its unique island context. The architects responsible, notable for their environmentally and socio-culturally responsive design philosophy, sought to create fourteen housing units that are characterized by a profound respect for local traditions and a low environmental footprint. Life Reusing Posidonia addresses the question of density by prioritizing the ecosystem’s health without compromising on habitability. The utilization of dried Posidonia oceanica, a seagrass endemic to the Mediterranean, as insulation, signifies a return to historical construction practices while advancing modern sustainable methods. This chosen project illustrates a reinterpretation of housing on the edge by showcasing how edge conditions can be harmoniously addressed through a low-tech, resource-efficient strategy. By examining this project’s response to the edges of Formentera, this essay aims to uncover how innovative design interventions can preserve ecological integrity, foster community, and redefine the quality of living on the periphery of urban centers.","output":"To introduce the Life Reusing Posidonia project in the context of a discussion about the significance of residential typologies and the impact of housing density on the urban periphery, consider the following quotes adapted from the official Life Reusing Posidonia book: \\"The Life Reusing Posidonia project embodies a pioneering approach to sustainable living in the distinctive island context of Sant Ferran, Formentera. Through the innovative use of local materials and revival of traditional building methods, the project demonstrates a commitment to reducing the environmental impact of construction.\\" \\"Promoted by the Institut Balear de l’Habitatge, this unique housing development integrates block and courtyard configurations to offer a contemporary reinterpretation of collective living, deeply rooted in social and ecological consciousness.\\" \\"With the use of dried Posidonia oceanica as a key insulation material, the architects behind this eco-conscious initiative have reimagined urban density. They have illustrated how to harmoniously blend housing with the natural ecosystem, respecting local cultural heritage while promoting sustainability.\\" \\"The Life Reusing Posidonia initiative goes beyond mere architectural design; it is a manifestation of the belief that cities’ edges are not barriers but opportunities. Opportunities to redefine urban living, to shape communities that thrive on the interchange between the built environment and the natural world, and to set a precedent for environmentally attuned development.\\" These quotes provide a cohesive introduction to the Life Reusing Posidonia project, setting up the essay to explore how such an innovative housing development optimizes urban density, enhances living quality on the urban periphery, and aligns with broader goals of sustainability and community integration."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] When did the gaffer hat first appear?","output":"The gaffer hat, a staple of American folk culture, particularly prevalent among riverboat workers and men of trade in the 19th century, is thought to have first appeared in the mid-1800s. The term \\"gaffer\\" itself often refers to an old man or a foreman, which aligns with the style's association with seasoned workers and skilled professionals of the time."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] When did the flat cap first appear?","output":"The flat cap, a timeless headwear choice, can trace its roots back to the 14th century in Northern England and Scotland. With the 1571 Act of Parliament that required non-noble men to wear woolen caps on Sundays and holidays, the flat cap became deeply entrenched in British working-class fashion. Its popularity endured through the centuries, becoming a symbol of the working man in the 19th and 20th centuries, and eventually evolved into a stylish accessory worn by people of all classes today."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] How do you spell \\"female police officer\\" in German?","output":"In German, a female police officer is spelled \\"Polizistin.\\""},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] How do you write \\"male nurse\\" in Low German?","output":"In Low German, a male nurse can be referred to as \\"Krankenpfleger\\" or \\"Pfleger.\\""},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] What is the difference between Low German and High German?","output":"Low German (Plattdeutsch) and High German (Hochdeutsch) are two distinct linguistic varieties within the German language. Low German comprises a group of dialects spoken in the low-lying regions of northern Germany and the eastern Netherlands, characterized by its own pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar traits that evolved separately from High German. High German, on the other hand, is the standardized literary and official form of German used in higher-altitude regions, which became the basis for the modern standard German language taught and understood internationally."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] Which dialect do the Bavarians speak?","output":"Bavarians traditionally speak Bavarian, a group of Upper German dialects native to the region of Bavaria in the southeast of Germany. It is distinct from Standard German (High German) with its own unique lexicon, phonology, and grammar."},{"instruction":"[Response must be written as a short blurb.] In the German Empire (1871 - 1918), why was the Kingdom of Prussia, Kingdom of Bavaria, and others not fully incorporated into Germany proper?","output":"During the German Empire (1871-1918), the Kingdom of Prussia, the Kingdom of Bavaria, and other states retained considerable autonomy to preserve the pre-existing power structures and maintain a federal system. The empire was formed through a union of German-speaking states, each with its own history, traditions, and royal family, so allowing them a degree of sovereignty within a united Germany was essential for unification and maintaining internal stability. This arrangement respected the identities of the constituent states while creating a cohesive national entity."},{"instruction":"translate to spanish and retain html formatting \\"<!-- PRODUCT INFO --> <p>Ce pack dynamique de lingettes en microfibre est l'équipe de nettoyage ultime.

HIGH SCHOOL GYM - PROM NIGHT The high school gymnasium is transformed into a scene of enchantment, decked out in elaborate decorations for the prom. Teenagers in elegant attire fill the room, dancing and socializing. The DJ booth is situated at the center of the room, blasting loud pop music. At a corner table, BRIAN, a loner student in his late teens, sits alone, observing the festivities. He wears a disinterested expression, flipping through the pages of a book. Suddenly, a particularly catchy pop song blares through the speakers, causing Brian to furrow his brow. He sighs deeply, clearly annoyed. BRIAN (to himself) Not another mainstream pop song. Is there no variety? Brian's irritation grows, feeling completely out of place amidst the sea of teenagers, who are energetically dancing and singing along. Determined, Brian stands up, leaving his book behind. He marches towards the DJ booth, catching the attention of a few curious onlookers. Brian reaches the DJ booth and taps the DJ, KEVIN, on the shoulder. Kevin, surprised by the interruption, removes his headphones. KEVIN (confused) What's up, dude? BRIAN (agitated) Look, man, can we switch up the music for a moment? Just one song? Kevin looks at Brian strangely but decides to oblige, curiosity getting the better of him. KEVIN (skeptical) Alright, one song. But make it quick. Brian glances around the room, trying to find a way to make his point heard. And then it strikes him. He heads towards the microphone. BRIAN (grinning) Thanks! As he takes the microphone, the room fills with whispers and bemused chuckles. Brian stands tall, ignoring the chuckles and frowns, his face determined. BRIAN (through the microphone) I dedicate this song to everyone who came to prom solely for the food! A mixture of laughter and confused murmurs ripple across the crowd. The music starts to fade out, and Brian takes a deep breath, preparing himself. Soft orchestral music begins to play, signifying something different. Brian is about to make his move. BRIAN (to himself) Here goes nothing... And with that, Brian's voice, strained but full of soul, fills the room. His unexpected, powerful vocals grip the attention of everyone in the hall. BRIAN (V.O.) (singing) \\"I can't mend, the way that I feel Oh girl, I want to be real You've got me feeling emotions deep inside...\\" As Brian continues to sing Engelbert Humperdinck's \\"A Man Without Love,\\" the initial laughter and skepticism subside, replaced by awe and astonishment. The atmosphere shifts, the room becoming hushed, captivated by Brian's unexpected talent. Throughout the song, Brian's voice soars, heartbreaking and beautiful, echoing the emotions of a lonely soul finally finding its solace. As he concludes the final note, the room erupts into applause. Brian's face flushes with a mix of embarrassment and a newfound sense of belonging. Clutching the microphone, he exits the DJ booth, returning to his corner table. The crowd gradually resumes their dancing, their conversations buzzing with admiration and newfound respect for the loner who had just poured his heart out. And for that moment, Brian's isolation is shattered, replaced by the recognition that despite his solitude, his voice was heard.

The lyrics hang in the air, mingling with the soft glow from the romantic prom decorations. Couples sway together, caught up in the vulnerability of Brian's heartfelt rendition. Others stand mesmerized, their eyes fixed on the loner who found his voice. KATHRYN, a popular and outgoing girl, stands near the dance floor, her eyes locked on Brian. Her previous disinterest fades away as she feels the raw intensity of his voice. She's not alone in her newfound respect for him. The students begin to slow dance to the melancholic melody, tenderly holding their partners. The disinterested loner who only came for the food has transformed the atmosphere into something profound.

The last note hangs in the air, lingering for a moment before the silence breaks. The gymnasium erupts in thunderous applause, an outpouring of admiration and respect.

KATHRYN (teary-eyed) Brian, that was... incredible. I had no idea you had such a gift. BRIAN (shyly) Thank you, Kathryn. It means a lot coming from you. One by one, other students approach Brian, offering their appreciation and genuine compliments. The barrier that once separated him from the rest slowly begins to crumble. The DJ booth, still buzzing with excitement, changes the playlist to something softer and more meaningful. Couples take to the dance floor, swaying gently, as if infusing the room with the tenderness Brian's performance evoked. Brian watches the dance floor, a subtle smile forming on his lips. For the first time, he realizes that he doesn't need to be alone, that his voice can bridge the gap between him and others.

However, while Austria-Hungary was specifically targeted by the Treaty of St. Germain, Germany was the primary focus of the Treaty of Versailles. The Treaty of St. Germain was signed on September 10, 1919, and it dealt with the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This treaty had severe consequences for Austria and Hungary, leading to the disintegration of their territories and significant territorial losses. Austria lost South Tyrol to Italy, Bohemia and Moravia to the newly formed state of Czechoslovakia, and several other regions to Yugoslavia and Poland. Hungary was also dismembered, losing territories to Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Austria. The newly formed states of Austria and Hungary were greatly reduced in size and lacked the resources and economic power they had under the empire. The Treaty of St. Germain also imposed severe penalties on Austria, both diplomatically and economically. Austria was forbidden from uniting with Germany, as well as from joining the League of Nations initially. The treaty also imposed significant reparations on Austria, which hampered its economic recovery and development. The loss of territories and resources had a profound impact on the people and economy of Austria-Hungary, leading to a period of political instability and economic decline. On the other hand, the Treaty of Versailles was primarily aimed at Germany, as it was seen as the main aggressor in World War I. The treaty imposed harsh conditions on Germany, including territorial losses, disarmament, and significant reparations. Germany lost about 13% of its territory, including Alsace-Lorraine to France and significant territories to Poland, Lithuania, and Belgium. Moreover, the treaty restricted the size of the German military and imposed severe disarmament measures. The Treaty of Versailles also held Germany responsible for starting the war and imposed a heavy burden of reparations. These reparations were intended to compensate the war victims and help rebuild the devastated countries. However, the amount assigned to Germany was seen as excessive, leading to economic instability and a heavy burden on the German economy. The financial strain caused by the reparations contributed to hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic and weakened the German economy. The political and social consequences of the treaty, along with economic instability, eventually paved the way for the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party. In summary, the Treaty of St. Germain significantly impacted Austria-Hungary by dismantling the empire, leading to territorial losses and economic decline. The Treaty of Versailles had a similar effect on Germany, with territorial losses, disarmament, and heavy reparations, which contributed to economic instability and the rise of the Nazi party. Both treaties had profound effects on the political and economic landscapes of Austria-Hungary and Germany, ultimately shaping the course of history in the following years."},{"instruction":"What were the geographic consequences of the Treaty of St. Germain?","output":"The geographic consequences of the Treaty of St. Germain were significant for Austria-Hungary.

As a result, numerous territorial adjustments were made, leading to the creation of new countries and the redrawing of borders. Austria, for instance, lost a considerable amount of land. It had to cede South Tyrol to Italy, which became a part of the Italian region of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. Austria also lost territories to the newly created state of Czechoslovakia. This included losing Bohemia and Moravia, which became a part of Czechoslovakia and are now modern-day Czech Republic. Austria also lost a portion of Silesia, which became a part of Poland. The dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire also affected Hungary. The territories of Transylvania, Banat, and Bukovina were transferred to the newly formed state of Romania. Croatia and Slovenia became part of the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which later became Yugoslavia. In addition, parts of Hungary were also ceded to Czechoslovakia. These territorial adjustments significantly reduced the size of Austria and Hungary, leading to the creation of new independent countries from former Austro-Hungarian territories. The new borders established under the Treaty of St. Germain had lasting effects on the region, and some of the geopolitical consequences can still be seen today."},{"instruction":"Discuss the diplomatic penalities placed on Austria by the Treaty of St. Germain.","output":"The Treaty of St. Germain imposed several diplomatic penalties on Austria as part of the terms of the peace settlement. These penalties were designed to weaken Austria's power and influence in the region and prevent future destabilization. One of the main diplomatic penalties imposed on Austria was its prohibition from engaging in any form of political or economic union with Germany. This was a significant blow for Austria, as there was a strong sentiment among some Austrians to join Germany and reunify with their German-speaking counterparts. This prohibition aimed to prevent Austria from aligning itself with Germany and potentially re-igniting the tensions that had led to World War I. In addition to the prohibition on union with Germany, Austria was initially excluded from becoming a member of the League of Nations, the international organization established to maintain peace and address global issues. Austria was only admitted to the League of Nations in 1920 after meeting specific conditions outlined in the treaty. This exclusion was another diplomatic penalty that limited Austria's international standing and participation in global affairs. Furthermore, the Treaty of St. Germain prohibited Austria from seeking annexation or any form of political or economic union with any other country without the consent of the League of Nations. This clause aimed to prevent Austria from reclaiming lost territories or expanding its influence in the region unilaterally. These diplomatic penalties imposed on Austria under the Treaty of St. Germain aimed to limit its ability to reassert dominance in the region and maintain stability in the aftermath of the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. By forbidding any connection with Germany, excluding Austria from the League of Nations initially, and restricting its territorial ambitions, the treaty aimed to contain Austria's influence and avoid potential conflicts in the future."},{"instruction":"Discuss the diplomatic penalities placed on Austria-Hungary by the Treaty of St. Germain.","output":"I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. The Treaty of St. Germain, signed in 1919, specifically targeted Austria (not Austria-Hungary, as the empire had already been dissolved). While the treaty did not impose any direct diplomatic penalties on Austria, it did indeed impose significant political and economic restrictions on the newly formed Republic of Austria. Under the terms of the treaty, Austria was required to recognize the independence of various nationalities that had been part of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire. It had to cede various territories to neighboring countries, resulting in significant territorial losses. Austria lost South Tyrol to Italy, Bohemia and Moravia to Czechoslovakia, and parts of Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola to the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (Yugoslavia). Moreover, Austria was barred from entering into any political or economic union with Germany, thereby preventing the possibility of a united German-Austrian state. This provision aimed to weaken Austria's power and influence in the region and ensure its political isolation. Economically, the treaty imposed substantial reparations on Austria, which had a devastating effect on its economy. Austria had to make payments to the Allied powers to compensate for the damage caused by the war. These reparations, combined with the loss of industrial and resource-rich territories, significantly hampered Austria's economic recovery and development. Additionally, the treaty limited Austria's military capacity by imposing restrictions on its armed forces. Austria was required to demilitarize and reduce the size of its military, limiting its ability to project power or engage in any aggressive actions. While the Treaty of St. Germain did not include explicit diplomatic penalties, the territorial losses, economic burdens, and military restrictions placed on Austria had a profound impact on its diplomatic standing and regional influence. The obligations and constraints imposed by the treaty aimed to ensure Austria's compliance, prevent future conflicts, and maintain stability in Central Europe."},{"instruction":"Discuss the economic penalities placed on Austria-Hungary by the Treaty of St. Germain.","output":"I apologize for the earlier confusion. The Treaty of St. Germain specifically targeted Austria, as Hungary signed a separate peace treaty known as the Treaty of Trianon. Therefore, the economic penalties imposed by the Treaty of St. Germain were solely applicable to Austria. The economic penalties imposed on Austria under the Treaty of St. Germain were significant and had long-lasting consequences for the country. One of the most prominent penalties was the requirement to pay reparations to the Allied powers for the damage caused during World War I. Austria was burdened with a substantial debt that it struggled to repay, leading to significant economic instability. The amount of reparations assigned to Austria was not explicitly specified in the treaty, but it was expected to contribute to the overall reparations imposed on the Central Powers. This placed a heavy financial burden on Austria, as it had to find ways to generate funds to meet its obligations. The inability to repay these reparations aggravated Austria's economic situation and hindered its post-war recovery efforts. Additionally, the loss of territories as a result of the treaty had severe economic consequences for Austria. Austria lost regions that were rich in resources, industrial centers, and agricultural land. The loss of these productive areas greatly reduced Austria's economic potential and ability to generate revenue. It also disrupted trade routes and disrupted established economic networks that were crucial for Austria's economic viability. Furthermore, the treaty imposed restrictions on Austria's access to certain resources and markets. This limited Austria's ability to rebuild its economy and participate fully in international trade. The loss of former imperial territories also meant the loss of a significant consumer base and potential trading partners. Overall, the economic penalties imposed by the Treaty of St. Germain, including reparations, territorial losses, and restrictions on resources and markets, had a profound impact on Austria. The country faced significant economic challenges, worsened by the global economic depression of the 1920s and 1930s, which ultimately contributed to social and political upheaval in Austria."},{"instruction":"Discuss the diplomatic penalities placed on Austria by the Treaty of St. Germain.","output":"Apologies for the confusion in my previous responses. The Treaty of St. Germain mainly targeted Austria, and it did impose various diplomatic penalties on the country. Here are some of the key diplomatic penalties placed on Austria by the Treaty of St. Germain: 1. Territorial Losses: Austria was forced to surrender significant territories as a result of the treaty. It had to recognize the independence of countries such as Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, which were formed from former Austro-Hungarian territories. This led to the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the loss of political influence and control over these regions. 2. Prohibition on Union with Germany: The Treaty of St. Germain explicitly prohibited Austria from forming any political or economic union with Germany. This was a significant diplomatic penalty, as there was a desire among some Austrians to unite with Germany and reclaim their shared German-speaking identity. The prohibition aimed to isolate Austria politically and prevent any potential reunification that might threaten regional stability. 3. League of Nations Restrictions: Austria was initially excluded from membership in the League of Nations, the international organization created to maintain peace and facilitate dispute resolution. It was only admitted as a member in 1920, after meeting specific conditions outlined in the treaty. This exclusion from the League limited Austria's diplomatic standing and its ability to engage in international affairs. 4. Prohibition on Territorial Ambitions: The Treaty of St. Germain forbade Austria from seeking annexation or political union with any other country without the consent of the League of Nations. This restriction aimed to prevent Austria from reclaiming lost territories or engaging in any acts that might destabilize the region. These diplomatic penalties were designed to limit Austria's political influence and ensure the stability of the reorganized post-war Europe. They placed restrictions on Austria's ability to assert its power, form alliances, and expand its territorial claims. The penalties aimed to prevent any resurgence of a destabilizing multinational empire and promote self-determination among the newly formed states in the region."},{"instruction":"What were the geographic consequences of the Treaty of Versailles?","output":"The Treaty of Versailles, signed in 1919, had significant geographic consequences, particularly for Germany and some of its neighboring countries. The treaty aimed to redraw national borders and redefine territorial boundaries in Europe following World War I. Here are the key geographic consequences of the Treaty of Versailles: 1. Territory Losses for Germany: Germany experienced substantial territorial losses as a result of the treaty. It was required to cede various regions and territories to other countries. The most notable territorial losses included Alsace-Lorraine, which was returned to France, and significant parts of West Prussia and Posen, which became part of Poland. Germany also lost land to Denmark, Belgium, and Lithuania. These territorial reductions significantly reshaped the map of Germany. 2. Creation of New States: The treaty led to the establishment of new independent states in Europe from territories previously controlled by Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. For example, the Polish state was recreated and received significant territories from Germany, including Posen, West Prussia, and Upper Silesia. The Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania also gained independence from Germany and Russia. 3. Shifting Borders: The treaty resulted in significant border changes, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. In addition to the territorial adjustments made in Germany, parts of Austria were transferred to Czechoslovakia, Italy, and other countries. Moreover, new countries were formed, such as Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, which brought together various ethnic groups and involved border realignments. 4. Creation of Mandates and Territories Under League of Nations: The Treaty of Versailles established mandates and territories administered by Allied powers or the League of Nations in order to serve as a form of international supervision. For example, Germany had to give up its colonies, which were distributed among the victors, particularly Britain and France. The League of Nations also took control of certain territories, including the Saarland, which was placed under French administration for 15 years. These geographic consequences of the Treaty of Versailles led to new political entities and border configurations in Europe, marking a significant shift in the balance of power and reshaping the regions affected. The territorial changes attempted to address the desires for self-determination and redraw national boundaries, but they also planted seeds for future conflicts and tensions in the region."},{"instruction":"Discuss the diplomatic penalities placed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles.","output":"The Treaty of Versailles, signed in 1919, imposed several diplomatic penalties on Germany as a consequence of its perceived responsibility for starting World War I. These penalties were aimed at weakening German power and influence and ensuring that Germany took responsibility for the war. Some of the key diplomatic penalties placed on Germany by the treaty were as follows: 1. War Guilt: The treaty placed full blame on Germany and its allies for starting the war. Article 231, known as the \\"War Guilt Clause,\\" held Germany and its partners responsible for the damages caused during the war. This symbolic measure aimed to tarnish Germany's international reputation and justify the significant penalties imposed on the country. 2. Territorial Losses: Germany experienced significant territorial losses as a result of the treaty. It had to cede substantial regions, resulting in the loss of approximately 13% of its territory. Notable areas that were taken away included Alsace-Lorraine (returned to France), West Prussia, and Posen (given to Poland) and parts of Upper Silesia (subject to a plebiscite). These territorial reductions diminished German influence and disrupted long-standing geographical and cultural connections. 3. Military Restrictions: The treaty imposed severe limitations on Germany's military capacity. The size of the German army was reduced to 100,000 soldiers, and conscription was banned. The navy was significantly reduced, and the use of weapons like submarines and aircraft was restricted. These restrictions aimed to prevent Germany from rebuilding a powerful military and seeking revenge in the future. 4. Reparations: Germany was required to pay heavy reparations to the Allies as a means of compensating for the damages caused during the war. The amount was not explicitly specified in the treaty but was later determined by the Inter-Allied Reparations Commission. The burden of reparations placed a significant strain on the German economy and exacerbated the country's financial troubles. 5. Loss of Colonies: Germany lost its colonies, which were distributed among the victorious powers. These colonies, predominantly in Africa and the Pacific, were placed under the control of the League of Nations or assigned as mandates to other countries. This loss diminished Germany's global influence and access to resources. These diplomatic penalties aimed to weaken Germany politically, militarily, and economically. The harshness of the treaty's terms, including the war guilt clause, territorial losses, military restrictions, reparations, and loss of colonies, created a sense of humiliation and resentment among many Germans. These grievances ultimately contributed to political instability and the rise of nationalist sentiments, laying the groundwork for future conflicts and the eventual rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party."},{"instruction":"How did the Treaty of Versailles disarm Germany?","output":"The Treaty of Versailles imposed strict disarmament measures on Germany with the aim of reducing its military capabilities and preventing it from launching further aggressive actions. The treaty included several provisions that specifically targeted Germany's armed forces. Here are some key aspects of how the Treaty of Versailles disarmed Germany: 1. Army Limitations: The treaty prescribed a maximum limit on the number of soldiers in the German army. The army was reduced to a mere 100,000 soldiers, which included officers, and was limited to a small standing force. The purpose was to significantly downsize the German military and prevent it from rapidly rebuilding its military power. 2. Conscription Ban: The treaty completely prohibited Germany from conscripting soldiers. This restriction meant that the German army could no longer forcibly recruit individuals into military service. The ban on conscription aimed to limit the size and expansion of the armed forces and prevent Germany from building up a large, professional military. 3. Demilitarization of the Rhineland: The Treaty of Versailles stipulated that the Rhineland, a region along the German border with France, should be free of any German military forces. The demilitarization of the Rhineland aimed to create a buffer zone and prevent Germany from using this strategic area for possible future aggression. 4. Navy Limitations: The German Navy was also significantly restricted under the treaty. Germany was allowed to maintain only a limited number of warships, with severe limitations on battleships, cruisers, and submarines. The tonnage of the German navy was drastically curtailed, limiting its ability to project power and threaten international shipping. 5. Air Force Limitations: The Treaty of Versailles imposed strict restrictions on the German air force, limiting the number of aircraft and their types. The production and possession of military aircraft were significantly reduced, and Germany was prohibited from having an independent air force. These measures aimed to prevent Germany from developing a powerful air force capable of launching aggressive actions.

These Tulpa Forces would operate in a fantastical control center of their host's consciousness, shaping thoughts, actions, and experiences. **Narrative**: In this movie, we follow the journey of an individual named Alex who has created a tulpa named Aiden. The Tulpa Forces take on complex and nuanced roles, each with distinct personalities that reflect their function. **Characters (Tulpa Forces)**: 1. **Formulation** - The architect of Aiden's existence, responsible for constructing and refining Aiden's form, personality traits, and quirks. This character is meticulous, carrying blueprints and sketches, and is constantly adjusting the appearance and characteristics of Aiden. 2. **Communication** - This Tulpa Force enables Alex to converse with Aiden, acting as a medium for the exchange of thoughts and ideas. Wielding a vast switchboard of dialogue options, this character is a fast-talking coordinator, draped in cables and headsets. 3. **Presence** - Representing Aiden's ability to feel real and present to Alex, this character has a calming aura and tends to be a grounding force. They often sprinkle the environment with gentle reminders of Aiden's presence, like a warmth or a familiar scent. 4. **Autonomy** - Embodying Aiden's independent thought and action, Autonomy is a bit of a wildcard, operating various levers and knobs to produce unexpected, voluntary movements or decisions from Aiden. 5. **Perception** - Through this Tulpa Force's lens, Aiden observes and interprets the world. Armed with cameras and monitors, Perception constantly analyzes the environment to inform Aiden's worldview and responses. **Plot**: Alex is initially excited to share life with Aiden, and we see how the various Tulpa Forces collaborate to integrate Aiden into Alex's daily experiences. However, as time goes by, challenges arise. Internal conflicts emerge between the Forces as they encounter situations they were not designed for, like social misunderstandings or emotional overload. Alex begins to question the decision to create Aiden as the line between their identities blurs, creating tension in the Control Center. The Forces struggle to maintain order, leading to a crisis that threatens to destabilize both Alex's and Aiden's mental states. **Climax**: A dramatic event forces the Forces to re-evaluate their roles. Formulation, Communication, Presence, Autonomy, and Perception realize they must work in harmony and respect the boundaries of their influence. They learn to balance Aiden's needs and autonomy with Alex's well-being, leading to a more sustainable relationship. **Resolution**: As the movie concludes, the Tulpa Forces have established a new, cooperative way of handling the Control Center, reflecting a matured and more nuanced understanding between Alex and Aiden. They tackle life's complexities as a synergized team, allowing for personal growth and mutual respect.

Albarran and Terry Moellinger University of North Texas Unparalleled mergers and acquisitions during the 1980s and 1990s led to the formation of an oligopoly of global media conglomerates (Albarran, Management of.. , 2002; Demers, 1999, Maney, 1995). These companies, also called megamedia (Alger, 1998), or transnational media corporations (Gershon, 1997), are multi-divisional companies, operating in numerous media markets such as broadcasting, publishing, motion pictures and sound recordings. Their goals are rather simple--dominate the markets in which they are engaged by attracting as much market share and revenues as possible, as well as engage in economies of scale and scope to improve efficiencies and lower the cost of operations. But who are these conglomerates ? This chapter analyses the top six media companies in terms of structure, performance and strategy in order to gain a better understanding of their activities and roles in the global communications marketplace. The six companies reviewed in this chapter include AOL Time Warner (later referenced as AOL TW), Bertelsmann AG, News Corporation, Viacom, Vivendi Universal and the Walt Disney Company. These companies were chosen because their divisional structure consists of at least two or more media-related divisions and media activities account for at least half of the company’s asset base. As such, the world’s largest company in terms of revenues, General Electric, is omitted from this analysis because the company’s media holdings are limited to a single division that consists of NBC and its branded cable networks (CNBC, MSNBC). Likewise, Sony was also rejected because its media holdings are limited with most of the company’s revenues obtained through its consumer electronics division and the sale of video players and games. Of the six companies analysed in this chapter, three are American companies (AOL TW, Disney, Viacom). Bertelsmann is based in Germany, Vivendi in France and Canada, and News Corporation in Australia. But every company is in fact a global company, presenting their respective brands and entertainment/information products to consumers around the globe. STRUCTURE OF THE TOP SIX FIRMS This section presents an overview of the internal structure and organisation of the top six media conglomerates. Table 8.1 presents basic description on each company in regards to revenue, market capitalisation, number of employees, and the number of officers and corporate directors. officers is 11.3 and the average number of corporate directors is 15.5. In terms of market capitalisation, AOL TW outdistances the other companies by 85 billion. In terms of employees, Vivendi Universal is the largest employer, News Corporation the smallest. Each of these enterprises is a holding company for other media concerns and each is organised accordingly. The structure of every media company is in constant flux as a result of change and strategic initiatives. To better understand each company’s purpose, we next review each company’s mission statement. Mission Statements of the Conglomerates The company mission statement typically identifies the organisation’s purpose and values (Albarran, Management ofi.., 2002). The actual mission statements vary in length from several paragraphs to a single paragraph. The authors have distilled the material down to present the key aspects of the mission statement. This material is presented in Figure 8.1. As might be expected, the mission statements espouse similar goals and objectives. For example, all but one company (News Corporation) mention the word “entertainment” in their statements. Disney emphasises “family entertainment” while other companies use the terms “consumers,” “customers and “people”. Vivendi, Viacom and News Corp. emphasise their role as creators and distributors of content. Financial goals are inferred or explicitly stated by AOL TW, Disney and News Corp. In addition to the mission statements, much insight can be gained by looking at each company in terms of its current structure and historical development. Each company is reviewed in the following sections. AOL 7W Compact Disclosure lists AOL TW’s primary business activities as “information retrieval services; cable and other pay TV services; photographic equipment and supplies” (AOL Time Warner, 2001). However, there is much more to this company than this list of business ventures implies. The company is further described by the Disclosure database as a company that: Develops and operates branded interactive services including: a worldwide Internet online service and an Internet portal; creates and distributes branded information and entertainment throughout the world; and owns and operates cable networks consisting principally of interests in film entertainment, television production and television broadcasting (AOL Time Warner, 2001). Figure 8.1: Excerpts from Corporate Mission Statements Our mission at AOL Time Warner is to become the world’s most respected and valued company by connecting, informing and entertaining people everywhere in innovative ways that will enrich their lives. The Walt Disney Company’s key objective is to be the world’s premier family entertainment company through the ongomg development of its powerful brand and character franchises. The company’s primary financial goals are to maximise earnings and cash flow from existing businesses and to allocate capital profitably toward growth initiatives that will drive long-term shareholder value. Vivendi Universal will be the world’s preferred creator and provider of entertainment, education and personalised services to consumers anywhere, at any time, and across all distribution platforms and devices. Bertelsmann is the most international media corporation, stnving to be the world’s leader in the markets in which they operates. Bertelsmann provide customers with information, education and entertainment through every possible outlet and in every conceivable format. Viacom 1s a leading global media company, with preeminent positions in broadcast and cable television, radio, outdoor advertising, and online. With programming that appeals to audiences in every demographic category across virtually all media, the company is a leader in the creation, promotion, and distribution of entertainment, news, sports, and music. The News Corporation Limited is one of the world’s largest media companies [involved in] the production and distribution of motion pictures and television programming; television, satellite and cable broadcasting; the publication of newspapers, magazines and books; the production and distribution of promotional and advertismg products and services; the development of digital broadcasting; the development of conditional access and subscriber management systems; and the creation and distribution of popular on-line programming. News Corporation’s success worldwide is attributed to teamwork, communication, creativity and determination. These skills, combined with the breadth of our assets, enables us to create customrsed media and marketing soluttons that impact consumers one by one. Sources adapted from corporate websites as follows: AOL Time Warner-About us (2001); Walt Disney and Company-About us (2001); Discover Vivendi Universal (2001); Bertelsmann profile (2001); About Viacom (2001); and News Corporauon-Investor relanons (2001). The term “branded,” used twice to describe the nature of AOL TW’s business, is important. Each of the media conglomerates has experienced a history of acquiring additional properties that are known brands. Each of these companies uses these brands to differentiate itself from the other media companies. AOL TW is divided into seven segments comprising one or two principle companies with other acquisitions folded in. Each segment has its own Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, each of whom reports to AOL TW’s Board of Directors, its Chairman, and its CEO. These segments are: Interactive services and properties (America Online), networks (Turner Broadcasting and Home Box Office), publishing (Time Inc. and Time Warner Trade Publishing), music (Warner Music Group), filmed entertainment (Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema), cable systems (Time Warner Cable), and their Interactive Video Division, comprising AOL Time Warner Interactive Video. Key events in the organisational development of AOL Time Warner are presented in the timeline presented in Table 8.2. The Walt Disney Company The Walt Disney Company was organised in 1923. Disney achieved notoriety with the debut of the animated character “Mickey Mouse” in 1928. Disney became known as an animated film company and cartoon creator. Later, the company developed theme park operations and moved into merchandising of the Disney family of characters and retail through the Disney stores around the world. The company is currently organised in a similar fashion to AOL TW, with certain key companies -all brand names-dominating each division. Although each media company assigns their executive officers different responsibilities, the functions of the Walt Disney Company offer a clear picture of the priorities of every media concern. The 1950s saw the company develop early examples of synergy. Disney used two television programs, “The Mickey Mouse Club,” and “Walt Disney Presents,” to promote Disneyland, the first truly national theme park. This type of relationship is still important to the company and is reflected in its choice of executive officer positions, as there is a Vice President for Corporate Synergy. The desire to find alternative revenue streams is also reflected in the position of Executive Vice President of Merchandise and Creative Services for Disney Store and Disney Direct Marketing. There is also a Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Strategic Officer, indicating the company’s commitment to further acquisitions, mergers and alliances.

However, its base company is older than any other media company except Bertelsmann. The merger combined Vivendi’s assets with Seagram’s film, television and music holdings (including Universal Studios) and Canal +‘s programming and distribution capacity (Merchants of Cool, 2001). Vivendi Universal has operations in water, waste management, energy, transport services and nonferrous wiring (Vivendi Universal, 2001). These interests provide an industrial economic base that separates it from other media giants and relieves them from downturns in the economy as advertising revenue declines. In fact, Vivendi Universal only receives 48% of their total revenue from media ventures (Leonard, 2001). The company’s formula for success, according to Guyon (2001) is to “first, separate your old-fashioned, reliable, cash-generating utility business from your glamorous but risky media business. Then take most of your debt-in Vivendi’s case, 16.9 billion-and stick it in the utility business.” This strategic division of assets has encouraged further acquisitions by removing the necessity to raise extra cash to retire existing debt.

Eight of Bertelsmann’s ten divisions are under an over-arching strategic business unit. The Content unit includes most companies (entities with book, music, magazine, newspaper, television, radio and professional information interests). The Arvato division, with its thirty subsidiaries, forms the Media Service unit. The Direct-to-Customer Businesses unit encompasses Bertelsmann’s DirectGroup (Bertelsmann, “Facts and Figures,” 2001). Table 8.6 lists key events in the company’s history. Like Viacom, News Corporation is best known through its Chairman and CEO, Rupert Murdoch. In the early 195Os, Murdoch inherited a regional Australian newspaper and in the span of fifty years has been transformed into one of the world’s most recognised media moguls. Like other media giants, News Corporation consists of many brand name companies, e.g., Twentieth Century Fox, The Times, the New York Post, and the Los Angeles Dodgers. The company operates several divisions: book publishing, cable and satellite television, filmed entertainment, magazines and inserts, newspapers, television, and other assets.

PERFORMANCE OF THE TOP SIX FIRMS Having examined organisational structure and development, we now turn attention to the issue of performance. Performance can be studied in many ways. For example, performance can be tied to industrial organisation analysis, by focusing on the variables of production and allocative efficiencies, as well as progress and equity (Albarran, Media Economics, 2002). For our purposes, performance is best reflected in financial data on the six firms to indicate their ability to increase profits, and in all cases but Bertelsmann, shareholder value. Table 8.8 presents basic financial information for each firm except Bertelsmann, with data on total assets, total debt, and debt-to-equity and total assets-to-equity ratios. Albarran - and Moellinger Top Six Communication 115 Firms Table 8.8. Financial Information on Publicly Traded Companies. Total Vivendi’s large asset base is attributed to the company’s industrial sectors. Viacom has the largest debt load of the public firms. All five companies have very low debt-to-equity ratios, indicating good financial management. Total assets-to-equity ratio is also very similar, with all companies having an asset base at least 1.5 times as large as their equity. Performance ratios such as profit margins, return on equity, and return on assets provide other indications of economic performance, as well as estimates on earnings per share. Table 8.9 lists these data for the five publicly traded firms. Table 8.9. Company Performance Ratios (2000) and Earnings Per Share (2000-2001). Company As the table illustrates, AOL TW has the strongest performance ratios and EPS estimates, followed by News Corp. Viacom’s high debt load led to negative performances for all 2000 performance ratios. While these data help analyse the company, the poor American and global economy in 2000 and 2001 are reflected in the subdued performance data and EPS estimates for all companies except for AOL TW. STRATEGY OF THE TOP SIX FIRMS This section considers the primary strategies used by these six media firms in executing their business plans. We can only assessstrategies at the macro level, because within each company their respective divisions and brands within these divisions all operate with individual strategic business models and objectives. There are two broad strategic objectives that each of these companies is engaged in: content and distribution. In terms of content, every firm has either developed or acquired significant content brands well known to consumers. The “richest” companies in terms of content include Viacom, Disney, AOL TW and News Corporation. Vivendi Universal’s most visible content is in their motion picture (Universal Studios) and music divisions, while Bertelsmann is best known through its publishing and music divisions. In terms of distribution, all six companies are engaged in distribution, but utilising different forms. For example, AOL TW and Viacom distribute content via broadcasting, cable, the Internet and print. Disney concentrates on broadcasting, cable and the Internet. News Corporation is the leading distributor of content via satellite, but also offers distribution via broadcasting, cable and publishing. Vivendi’s and Bertelsmann’s distribution efforts are primarily on the European continent, yet both companies are targeting the United States Vivendi’s December 2001 through their successful Internet operations. acquisition of USA networks provides a much needed distribution platform in the United States that the company will build upon. Vivendi also acquired a 1.5 billion stake in EchoStar, increasing its U.S. distribution options (Vivendi seals deal, 2001). The joint emphasis on content and distribution lead to another common First coined by Negroponte strategy among media firms known as repurposing. (1993, the term has come to mean content produced in one arena that is reused or repackaged for other arenas. Albarran and Dimmick (1996) refer to repurposing in economic terms as “economies of multiformity.” During the 2001-2002 television season, examples of repurposing was found among the broadcast and cable networks owned by AOL TW, Disney, and News Corp. Albarran and Moellinger - Top Six Communication Firms 117 The program Charmed is first broadcast on AOL TW’s WB television network, then repurposed on cable networks TBS and TNT. Two programs airing on the Fox network, 24 and Nathan’s Choice, are repurposed on FX. Disney regularly repurposes Good Morning America and other portions of their prime-time lineup on the cable network ABC Family. Strategic alliances and partnerships is a fourth generic strategy used by these firms. Strategic alliances and partnerships offer several benefits to companies, including the sharing of risks and rewards, providing access to new markets and increasing shareholder and company value (Albarran, Management oJ.., 2002). With the beginning of the 21st century, most strategic alliances between these companies and other firms were devoted to developing and marketing programming and other forms of media content; expanding into nondomestic markets, and dev eloping e-commerce and Internet strategies. Producing and distributing television and film content became the first logical areas where strategic partnerships were widely used among media companies to lower costs, but partnerships have expanded to other areas. In the recording industry, the impact of the Napster controversy led to two different consortiums offering online music distribution. MusicNet’s principal partners include AOL TW, Bertelsmann, EMI and RealNetworks, while Pressplay’s initial partners consist of Vivendi Universal, Sony, Yahoo and Microsoft. Finally, diversification is a fifth strategy used by these companies. Diversification refers to the different segments or divisions that the company draws revenues (and losses) from. In reviewing the histories of all six of these firms, one can easily see that these companies became more diversified over the years through a series of mergers and acquisitions. Likewise, in some cases the companies divested of assets that were considered non-essential to the core mission of each firm. At the end of 2001, each of the six firms reviewed in this study were diversified to the extent that they had multiple divisions with media-related activities. But several firms hold assets that are non-media related. For example, Disney, AOL TW and Viacom holdings include theme parks, retail stores and merchandising opportunities. Disney and News Corporation both own professional sports franchises. Vivendi Universal has about half of its assets in the areas of water and waste utilities, telecommunications, and manufacturing. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS This study provides a review and analysis of the world’s largest media firms by focusing on their organisational structure and development, financial 118 Albarran and Moellinger - Top Six Communication Firms performance and business strategy. Three of the top six companies are based in the U.S., two are based in Europe, and one in Australia. In regards to structure, each company operates multiple divisions, and each company has a sin-&w number of corporate officers and directors. Revenues, market capitalisation and number of employees vary among the six firms. All firms are publicly traded companies with the exception of Bertelsmann, which is privately held. A review of performance data found variation among the six firms in terms of selected financial ratios. Vivendi Universal has the largest asset base and also the lowest debt. Viacom currently carries the largest debt load of the firms, and the debt has negatively impacted the company’s performance in terms of profitability estimates and earnings per share projections. Of the six firms analysed, AOL TW had the strongest profitability margins and the largest EPS estimates for 2001-2002. Regarding strategy, each of the six fiis represents a conglomerate structure, with many divisions having their own leadership and support staff. As such, they have multiple strategic plans in place reflective of the needs of the various divisions. Five macro-level strategies were observed by examining all six firms. Each firm is heavily engaged in creating and developing media content, in many cases across a number of different platforms and mediums. Every company is involved in producing for motion pictures and television; a number of companies are involved in publishing. All of the companies are also engaged in a distribution strategy, or delivering content to consumers either via over-the-air broadcasting or some type of subscriptions. Repurposing of content is a third generic strategy used by these firms. Repurposing allows content to be repackaged or reused over different media markets and products. A fourth strategy is in the area of strategic partnerships and alliances, designed to share rewards and risks and develop new products and services across markets. Finally, diversification at the corporate level is another observed strategy, enabling these companies to draw revenues from multiple business segments composed of both media- and non-media related assets. These billion-dollar media companies, whether identified as megamedia corporations or transnational media companies, dominate the global media landscape at the start of the 21st century. In reviewing their corporate history and development, it is unlikely these companies are finished in terms of future acquisitions. AOL TW and Bertelsmann both tried to acquire EMI records but were thwarted by regulators. AOL TW is one of several suitors after the cable television assets of AT&T. In reality, the question is how big might these companies eventually become.3 And how much of the various media markets (e.g., publishing, motion pictures, television, etc.) might these fiis one day control? Clearly, these giants have put considerable pressure on “smaller” firms to also grow in size and stature in order to compete with these established leaders. General Electric, through its NBC division is one such company. In the fall of 2001, NBC acquired the assets of Telemundo, the second largest Spanishlanguage broadcaster in the Un ited States. NBC is also frequently rumoured to be trying to buy the movie studios owned by Sony, as NBC is the only broadcast network not affiliated with a major studio. AT&T has decided to sell its cable television assets, rather than attempt to grow larger. Telefonica acquired Terra Lycos in order to strengthen its Internet divisions and also gain a stronger position in the growing Latin American market. In conclusion, there is little doubt that a global media oligopoly is now in operation, dominating many segments of the media marketplace. For regulators and members of society, the challenge is not to try and figure out how to “breakup” these companies- but rather how to learn how to live and function in a world where the media industries are dominated by a handful of companies. Only time will tell if the number of players in this global oligopoly grows in size, or actually shrinks in the years ahead. .","output":"SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The chapter provides a comprehensive analysis of the world's largest media firms, focusing on their organizational structure, financial performance, and business strategy. It covers six major conglomerates: AOL Time Warner, Bertelsmann AG, News Corporation, Viacom, Vivendi Universal, and the Walt Disney Company, highlighting their role in a global media oligopoly that emerged from mergers and acquisitions in the late 20th century. These companies are notable for their multi-divisional nature and significant media-related holdings, with each possessing at least two media-related divisions and media activities comprising at least half of the company’s assets. STRUCTURE OF THE TOP SIX FIRMS The chapter first examines the internal structure of the top six firms, presenting an overview of their revenue, market capitalization, the number of employees, and officers. Each company's mission statements are summarized, indicating their primary goals and objectives, such as a focus on entertainment, consumers, content creation, and distribution, as well as financial goals. AOL Time Warner (AOL TW) is highlighted for its diverse activities in interactive services, cable TV, publishing, music, and entertainment. The Walt Disney Company's evolution from animation and theme parks to broader media and entertainment activities is described, alongside its attention to corporate synergy and image. Vivendi Universal, characterized by its newest global media entity status and diverse interests, extends beyond media into utilities and telecommunications. Its financial strategies and content distribution focuses are outlined. Viacom's strategy, built on brand names across all demographics and media, is heavily tied to its CEO, Sumner Redstone, with a structure dividing into several areas including television, radio, motion pictures, and theme parks. Bertelsmann A.G. is presented as a privately held media conglomerate with interests in books, music, magazine, and television businesses. News Corporation's rise under Rupert Murdoch is described, showcasing its brands and divisions in publishing, cable and satellite television, and filmmaking. PERFORMANCE OF THE TOP SIX FIRMS Financial performance indicators, such as asset bases and debt ratios, are reviewed, pinpointing how each firm manages profitability margins and EPS estimates. The analysis underscores AOL TW's strong financial performance compared to its peers. STRATEGY OF THE TOP SIX FIRMS Strategies at the macro level are assessed, highlighting the emphasis on content creation, distribution, repurposing for multiple platforms, strategic partnerships, and diversification within both media and non-media related areas. In conclusion, the chapter reflects on the establishment of a global media oligopoly and the pressure for smaller firms to expand to compete. It invites regulators and society to figure out ways to adapt to a landscape where media industries are controlled by a few powerful entities. The future interactions within this oligopoly, whether it will grow or shrink, remain an open question."},{"instruction":"با توجه به متن فصل STRUCTURE,PERFORMANCE,STRATEGY OF THE TOP SIX FIRMS هر شش شرکت را به تفکیک توضیح بده","output":"بر اساس توضیحات فصل مربوط به ساختار، عملکرد و استراتژی شش شرکت برتر صنعت ارتباطات، بیایید به تفکیک هر شرکت از این شش شرکت بزرگ جهانی را بررسی کنیم: **1.

Viacom:** Viacom's identity is deeply associated with its CEO and majority owner, Sumner Redstone. With strategic acquisitions over the years, Viacom has centered its strategy on brand appeal across demographics and media types. Viacom's multi-division approach includes notable entities like CBS, UPN, MTV Networks, Paramount Pictures, and more, securing its place as a major content provider in television, radio, movies, and theme parks. **5. Bertelsmann AG:** Bertelsmann AG, a privately held titan, remains 71% owned by the Bertelsmann Foundation with the significant influence of the Mohn family. Starting in 1835 with a book publishing firm, Bertelsmann has grown to encompass publishing, music, magazines, and television, with a strategic focus on high-quality content delivery. Despite its size, Bertelsmann maintains a private structure that differentiates it from other publicly-traded media giants. **6. News Corporation:** News Corporation, under Rupert Murdoch's leadership, began as a regional Australian newspaper inherited in the early 1950s and has since grown into a leading media mogul. With brands such as Twentieth Century Fox, The Times, and the New York Post, News Corp operates across book publishing, satellite and cable TV, films, and more. Its structure spans divisions in TV, publishing, and movies, reflecting a strong global distribution network. In summary, these international entities have a significant impact on the global media market, each following distinct strategies for content production and distribution, strategic partnerships, and diversifications both within and beyond media-related assets. The future will witness whether they further consolidate their positions or whether new players emerge in the media oligopoly landscape."},{"instruction":"Возможно ли за месяц выучить алфавиты арабского, иврита, грузинского, армянского, корейского, японского и хинди языков?","output":"Многое зависит от вашего языкового опыта и способностей к изучению языков.

A Meeting with Picasso My first impression of the great artist Picasso glanced at me and looked me straight in the eye. He had a light grey business suit, a blue cotton shirt and a dark grey tie on. There was a light green handkerchief in his breast pocket. His hands were small and strong. I introduced myself and Picasso shook my hand immediately. He had a soft, sincere smile which made me feel calm. пусто I admitted that I had always been interested in his work.

It’s me, but I did not mean it to have any political meaning at all.’ пусто I was interested if he saw himself as a leader. Picasso gave a thoughtful nod and confirmed: ‘Yes, I realize it.’ I described how me and my friends back in New York used to exchange our views on his work, especially the ‘Guernica’ painting, his most famous painting. I analysed the symbolism of the bull and the horse. Picasso kept nodding. ‘Yes,’ he said ‘the bull represents brutality, the horse the people. Yes, there I used symbolism.’ пусто I tried to find out why he painted in such a way that it was so difficult for people to understand. ‘I paint this way,’ he replied, ‘because it’s the result of my thought. I have worked for years to get this result and if I go backward it will be disrespectful towards the audience.’ пусто ‘It is quite impossible,’ he continued, ‘to say for sure why you do this or that. I reveal my ideas through painting and I can’t explain them through words. I can’t say exactly why I did it that way. For me, if I sketch a little table, I see every detail.

(조건1: 득점하기) (조건2: 경기에서 승리하기) (조건3: 경기에서 MOM으로 선정되기) 조르디 알바(Jordi Alba). 주 포지션은 좌측 윙어이지만, 이번 경기에서는 호영에 대한 대항마로 왼쪽 풀백에 섰다. 포지션 상 공격형 미드필더인 호영과는 직접 부딪힐 일은 거의 없겠지만, 그가 수비수로 내려온 것에는 큰 뜻이 있었다. 바로, 공수조율. 조르디 알바의 수비력은 팀 내에서 중상위 수준을 오가는데, 그것으로도 모자라 공격력도 매우 훌륭한 편에 속한다. 현재 리그 도움왕 2위에 올랐을 정도. 그만큼 공수조절에 능하기에, 역습을 도모하여 레알 마드리드에 맞서겠다는 것이 코르네야의 의도였다. 그러나 그 생각은 호영에게 간파당하고 있었다. ‘피치 위의 감독이 되라고 했지.’ 호영은 지단의 가르침을 되새기며 경기에 임했다. 마에스트로. 무릇 플레이메이커라면 경기를 지배해야 한다고 하였다. 단지 경기의 흐름을 읽는 것으로 끝낼 문제가 아니며, 그것을 팀원들과 공유하며 유용하게 활용할 줄 알아야 한다고 했다. ‘그리고 공유는 패스와 팀워크를 통해서.’ 무언의 커뮤니케이션. 패스와 움직임으로 뜻을 전달하는 것이다. ‘바로 지금.’ 조르디 알바가 중원으로 오버래핑 하려는 순간이었다. 스윽. 4-2-3-1 포메이션의 구심점인 호영이 우측으로 움직이자, 덩달아 레알 마드리드의 대형이 우측으로 살짝 이동하였다. 그것이 조르디 알바에게 압박을 가하고 있었다. ‘대체 뭐야.’ 팟, 팟. 조르디 알바는 생각만큼 경기가 풀리지 않는 탓에 축구화 토캡(앞코)으로 죄 없는 잔디를 퍽퍽 파내며 분을 풀었다. 전반전이 시작된 이후, 제대로 된 공격을 한 번도 나가보지 못했기 때문이다. 이상했다. 레알 마드리드의 선수들은 작년 말과 비교해 사뭇 다른 모습이었다. 마치 각성이라도 한 것처럼 움직임 하나하나에 힘이 깃들어있었다. ‘이걸 뭐라고 해야 되지.’ 뭐라 표현하면 좋을까. 겉으로 보기엔 달라진 게 없었다. 하지만 직접 경기를 치르고 있는 조르디 알바는 확실히 체감하고 있었다. 뭔가 많이 불리하다는 사실을 말이다. ‘설마, 우호영이?’ 그렇다. 작년과 다른 점이라면 그뿐. 우호영을 중심으로 한 정교한 빌드 업이 레알 마드리드의 전술완성도를 높이고 있었다. 이는 도저히 후베닐B 유소년 레벨이 아니었다. ‘대체 왜 저런 녀석이 여기 있는 거야.’ 숨이 턱 막혀오는 것 같았다. 호영이 만들어내는 플레이메이킹이 목을 조여 오는 것 같았다. 눈에 띄는 큰 변화는 아니었지만, 그들의 공격이 점차 날카로워지더니 결국 폭발하고 말았다. 전반 19분에. “켁!” 우호영의 발에서 비롯된 침투패스가 보이지 않던 뒷공간을 창출하였다. 느닷없이 일어난 일이었다. 분명 알바(Alba)로서는 수비대형을 잘 갖췄다고 생각했는데, 실제로는 그게 아니었다. 레알 마드리드의 전방 빌드 업이 UE코르네야의 수비 문을 느슨하게 만들고 있었던 것이다. 그리고 우호영은 그 틈을 놓치지 않고 기회를 만들어냈다. 타악! 원 톱 스트라이커 카예혼이 빠르게 파고들어 공을 잡았다. 부심의 깃발은 올라가지 않았다. 오프사이드 트랩의 완벽한 붕괴였다. 다만 퍼스트 터치가 살짝 길었던 탓에 카예혼의 슈팅이 골키퍼의 펀칭에 막혔다. 그러나 세컨볼이 살아있었다. “내가!” 어느샌가 박스 안으로 들어온 호영이 공중으로 튀어 올랐다. 마치 투우 소처럼 저돌적으로 달려들어 머리로 축구공을 들이박았다. 다이빙 헤딩슛. 그것이 UE코르네야의 골망을 뒤흔들었다. 레알 마드리드에게 준우승을 안겨줄 선제골이기도 했다. 삐이이익! 70분 후, 전후반 경기가 모두 끝나면서 보상이 떨어졌다. [탐하고 싶은 재능을 선택하세요.] -활발한 오버래핑(A+2) -허를 찌르는 공간침투(A+) -풍부한 활동량(B+) -(더 보기) 호영의 선택은 허를 찌르는 공간침투(A+). 그와 동시에 레알 마드리드의 준우승이 확정되었다. 비록 바르셀로나에게 왕좌를 내주었지만, 작년 말까지 리그 6위였던 것을 생각하면 준우승도 감지덕지였다. 불과 2달 만에 10골을 기록한 호영의 공이 컸다. 이대로라면, 다음 시즌에는 충분히 우승을 노려봄직 했다. 그리고 그 다음은. 후베닐A. 프로로 향하는 마지막 관문. ‘간다!’ 얼마 남지 않았다. 5월 말. 지네딘 지단은 프랑스로 귀국하기 전 호영을 보고자 했다. 이제 떠나면 선수 대 선수로 볼 기회가 없었기 때문이다. 물론 은퇴 후에도 레알 마드리드에 남을 계획이 있었지만, 호영과의 튜터링은 오늘로서 끝이었다. 오늘 점심 식사에 호영을 초대한 것도 그 때문이었다. ‘와··· 집 되게 좋네.’ 대저택 안으로 들어온 호영은 놀라기에 바빴다. 지단의 초대를 받은 것만 해도 놀라운데, 도심 한가운데 이렇게 큰 저택이 있다는 것에 한 번 더 놀랐다. ‘하긴, 서울만 해도 그 좁은 곳에 수백 평짜리 집이 있는데.’ 호영은 마치 서울에 상경한 시골소년처럼, 수십억에 달하는 지단의 호화주택을 구경하는 데 여념이 없었다. 수영장, 사우나, 시네마, 게임룸 등 없을 것이 없는 공간이었다. “호영.” 호영에게 집을 소개시켜주던 지단의 장남, 현재 레알 마드리드 카데테C(U13)에서 활약하고 있는 95년생 엔초(Enzo)였다. 그는 자신의 방에서 무언가를 가져오더니 슬그머니 호영에게 내밀었다. 엔초의 레알 마드리드 유니폼이었다. “이건 왜?” “그게······.” 엔초가 뒷머리를 벅벅 긁으며 수줍게 말했다. “사인 좀 해줄래?” “사인을?” 참 아이러니한 상황이다. 세계 최고 축구선수의 집에 놀러갔더니 그 아들이 사인해달라는 지금 이 상황 말이다. “헤헤. 네가 우리 팀에서 인기가 가장 많거든.” “이야~ 사실이야?” “응. 모두 호영을 좋아해. 시청각수업 때 코치님이 네 플레이영상을 보여주기도 하고.” ‘허.’ 팔뚝에 오돌토돌한 닭살이 올라왔다. 물론 최근에 그만큼 대단한 행보를 보이긴 했지만, 레알 마드리드 유소년들의 모범이 되었을 줄은 몰랐다. ‘상파울루에서는 내가 카카를 보면서 자랐는데···.’ 어느새 자신도 그런 위치가 되어있다는 게 놀라우면서도 한편으로는 뿌듯했다. “아참. 그리고 네가 레알 마드리드의 미래래.” “하하하.

His primary position is as a left-winger, but for this game, he stood as a left-back as a countermeasure against Hoyoung's talent. Although there were hardly any direct collisions with Hoyoung, an attacking midfielder by position, Alba's movement down to defender bore significant meaning. Namely, the coordination of offense and defense. Jordi Alba's defensive abilities fluctuated around the upper middle level within the team. Still, beyond that, his offensive capabilities belonged to a very commendable tier. He was currently second in the league for assists. That's how adept he was at managing both defense and offense, planning to initiate fast-breaks against Real Madrid as Cornella's strategy. However, Hoyoung was already onto that thought. \\"Become the director on the pitch,\\" that's what Zidane had taught him. Maestro.

It wasn't a matter to be concluded merely by reading the flow of the match, but one needed to share it with the teammates and make useful plays out of it. \\"And sharing is done through passes and teamwork.\\" Silent communication. Delivering intentions through movement and pass. \\"Now.\\" The moment when Jordi Alba made an attempt to overlap into the midfield. Swoosh. Hoyoung, the pivot of the 4-2-3-1 formation, moved to the right, tilting Real Madrid's formation slightly in that direction. That put pressure on Jordi Alba. \\"What is going on?\\" Thud, thud. Alba, frustrated that the game was not unfolding as expected, kicked the innocent grass with the toe-cap of his cleats to vent his anger. Since the start of the first half, Alba had not properly launched a single attack. Something was odd. The Real Madrid players had changed significantly compared to the end of last year. Every single move seemed to be filled with newfound vigor, as if awakened. \\"How to describe this...\\" What would be the right expression? Externally, there seemed to be no difference. But Jordi Alba, actually playing the game, could definitely feel it. He felt at a considerable disadvantage. \\"Could it be, Hoyoung?\\" Indeed. That was the only thing different since last year. Hoyoung's refined build-up play was elevating Real Madrid's tactical completeness. This simply wasn't the level of Juvenil B (youth). \\"Why is someone like him here?\\" It felt as if he was being choked. The playmaking crafted by Hoyoung was suffocating Alba. There was no conspicuous drastic change, but their attack steadily sharpened and eventually exploded. At the 19th minute of the first half. \\"Argh!\\" A penetrating pass, originating from Hoyoung's foot, created an unseen space in the back. It was sudden. Alba thought he had his defense well organized, but in reality, it wasn't the case. Real Madrid's forward build-up was gradually loosening the doors of UE Cornella's defense. And Hoyoung did not fail to seize the opportunity and craft a chance. Stamp! Callejon, at the striker position, rushed forward to seize the ball. The assistant referee's flag remained down. A perfect collapse of the offside trap. However, due to a slightly long first touch, Callejon's shot was saved by the goalkeeper's punch. But the second ball was alive. \\"It's mine!\\" Before anyone knew it, Hoyoung had entered the box and leaped into the air. He charged like a bull, slamming the soccer ball with his head. A diving header. And it was this that shook the net of UE Cornella. It was also the opening goal that would lead Real Madrid to a runner-up finish. Beep! 70 minutes later, with both halves of the match completed, rewards were issued. [Please select the talent you wish to covet.] - Active Overlapping (A+2) - Piercing Space Infiltration (A+) - Abundant Activity Volume (B+) - (More...) Hoyoung's choice was Piercing Space Infiltration (A+). At the same time, Real Madrid's runner-up position was confirmed. Although they had to concede the throne to Barcelona, considering they were sixth in the league at the end of last year, a runner-up finish was still valuable. Hoyoung's contribution of 10 goals in just two months was significant. At this rate, they could comfortably aim for the championship next season. And what followed next was Juvenil A. The final gateway to becoming a professional. \\"Let's go!\\" It was not far off. At the end of May. Zinedine Zidane wanted to see Hoyoung before he left for France. If he left, there would be no chance to see him as a player again. Of course, Zidane had plans to remain with Real Madrid even after retirement, but the tutoring with Hoyoung would end as of today. He had invited Hoyoung to lunch for that reason. \\"Wow... what a nice house.\\" As Hoyoung entered the mansion, he was busy marveling at everything. Already amazed at being invited to Zidane’s home, he was again surprised to find such a grand mansion amidst the city. \\"Just as in Seoul, massive homes exist even in such confined places.\\" Hoyoung, like a country youth visiting Seoul for the first time, had no time for anything else but to explore Zidane's luxurious property worth tens of millions. A house with everything: a swimming pool, sauna, cinema, game room, etc. \\"Hoyoung.\\" It was Zidane's eldest son Enzo, who had been showing Hoyoung around the house, currently playing for Real Madrid Cadete C (U13), born in '95. He went to his room to fetch something and then subtly handed it over to Hoyoung. It was Enzo's Real Madrid jersey. \\"Why this?\\" \\"Well...\\" Enzo scratched his head shyly and said sheepishly. \\"Could you sign it for me?\\" \\"Sign it?\\" It's quite an ironic situation. To be visiting the home of one of the world's top soccer players and have his son ask for an autograph, that's the current circumstance. \\"Hehe. You are the most popular on our team.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"Yeah. Everyone likes Hoyoung. Our coach even shows your play videos during class.\\" 'That's something.' A tingly sensation rose on his forearms. Of course, he had indeed made an impressive mark recently, but he had not realized that he had become a role model for the youth players of Real Madrid. 'Back at Sao Paulo, I grew up watching Kaka...' Now he found himself in a similar position, a mix of surprise and prideful satisfaction. \\"By the way, you’re said to be the future of Real Madrid.\\" \\"Ha ha ha.\\""},{"instruction":"083. 변화 아닌 진화(3) 월드컵이 끝난 직후 많은 일이 있었다. 특히 한국. 지단의 인터뷰가 수많은 한국인들에게 자긍심을 느끼게 해주었다. 비록 월드컵 성적은 좋지 않았으나 값진 선물을 얻은 셈이었다. 한편, 프랑스가 우승컵을 들어 올리면서 축구계에 지각변동이 일어났는데, 특히 레알 마드리드가 분주한 움직임을 보였다. 2006년 여름이적시장. 여러 가지 호재가 겹쳐 경질 위기에서 벗어난 페레즈는 마지막 기회를 얻어냈다. 그에게 주어진 시간은 약 5개월. 만약 겨울 휴식기까지 좋은 모습을 보이지 못하면 레알의 소시오(유료회원)들은 가차 없이 그를 경질시키겠다는 여론을 주도하였다. 페레즈로서는 더 이상 돌아갈 곳 없는 외통수에 서게 된 셈이었다. 그의 임무는 12월까지 리그 1위와 더불어 챔피언스 리그 16강에 진출하는 것. 페레즈 회장은 그를 위해 만반의 대비를 하였다. 그 노력은 06년 여름이적시장 때부터 시작되었는데, 그 첫 번째가 바로 프랑스산 폭격기 ‘프랑크 리베리(Franck Ribery)’를 향한 구애였다. 프랑스가 월드컵에서 우승함에 따라, 이미 수많은 유럽의 명문클럽들이 그에게 러브콜을 보내고 있는 상황이었다. 아스날이 2100만 유로를 제시하는 둥 치열한 영입경쟁이 예고되었으나, 여기서 페레즈 회장이 4000만 유로(한화 약 600억)을 제시하면서 모든 것이 종결 났다. 프랑크 리베리는 레알 마드리드로 이적하겠다는 뜻을 밝히면서 이적이 성사되는 듯 했다. 그러나. 천문학적인 이적료에도 불구하고, 그의 소속팀은 아직 계약기간이 4년이나 남았다며 리베리에게 접촉하지 말 것을 경고했다. 하지만 거기서 좌절할 페레즈가 아니었다. 곧바로 다음 타깃을 노렸는데, 폭발력을 지닌 프랑스산 좌측 윙어 플로랑 말루다(Florent Malouda)가 바로 그 주인공이었다. 이적료는 2000만 유로(한화 약 300억). 잘생기지 않았다는 점이 의외였지만, 이는 우측 클래식 윙어 베컴과의 비대칭조합을 꽤하기 위한 이적이었다. 또한 갈락티코 군단의 멸망을 초래한 ‘마케렐레의 부재’를 메우기 위해, 프랑스산 특급 수비형 미드필더 마마두 디아라(Mahamadou Diarra)를 460억에 영입하는 데 성공하였다. 페레즈의 행보는 거기서 멈추지 않았다. ‘최고로 비싼 선수가 가장 값싼 선수’가 그의 모토였으니, 두둑하게 마련된 총알을 쏘아댈 작정이었다. 그런데 마침, 축구계를 뒤흔들만한 거대한 사건이 일어나고 말았다. 칼치오폴리(Calciopoli). 이탈리아 축구계 최대의 스캔들로, 유벤투스의 단장이 축구·언론계의 고위 인사들과의 인맥을 이용해 승부조작에 가담한 사건이었다. 예컨대, 그는 심판배정담당자에게 비밀리에 연락을 취해 심판지명을 지시하는 등 해서는 안 될 짓을 수없이 반복했었다. 또한 AC밀란, 라치오, 피오렌티나 등 명문클럽들이 이에 연루된 것으로 밝혀져 세계 축구계에 큰 충격을 주었다. 그들에게는 중징계가 주어졌다. 많은 관계자들이 축구계에서 퇴출당했고, 유벤투스는 3부 리그로의 강등판정을 받았다가 재판정 이후 2부 리그로 강등되었는데, 여기서 유벤투스의 많은 선수들이 팀을 떠나게 되었다. 이에 페레즈의 눈이 바쁘게 굴러갔다. 먼저 수비진 강화를 위해 칸나바로와 에메르손을 영입하였다. 더해, 레알의 보드진은 맨유의 반 니스텔루이까지 값싸게 영입하면서 그야말로 드림팀을 구축하는 데 성공하였다. 페레즈가 아끼는 호나우두가 팀에 있음에도 반 니스텔루이를 영입했다는 것은, 페레즈의 구단 내 입지가 그만큼 좁아졌다는 뜻이었다. 이에 포화상태가 아니냐는 언론의 반응이 있었지만, 레알 마드리드는 이제 시작이라며 겨울이적시장을 준비하였다. 2006년은 지단에게도 뜻깊은 해였다. 마지막 무대라고 생각했던 2006년 독일 월드컵은 축구 인생의 연장선이 되어주었다. 만 33세. 이제 황혼기에 접어가는 나이였음에도 지단은 꾸준했다. 지금껏 그래왔듯 공을 차고 몸을 길렀다. 물론 어려운 결정이었으나, 지단의 아내는 그의 뜻을 존중해주며 전폭적인 지원을 아끼지 않았다. 결국 지단은 피나는 노력 끝에, 12월까지 팀을 1위로 끌어올리는 노장의 힘을 만천하에 보여주었다. 그리고 그해, 발롱도르까지 수상하면서 부활의 신호탄을 전 세계에 알렸다. 호영과의 튜터링도 계속되었다. 그러다 1월. 마드리드에 한파와 함께 반가운 얼굴이 찾아왔다. 브라질 리그에서 빼어난 활약을 선보인 마르셀루와, 구단 측에서 예전부터 주시하고 있던 아르헨티나산 특급 유망주 곤잘로 이과인(Gonzalo Higuain)이었다. 이로써 레알 마드리드는, 주전-로테이션-유망주로 이뤄진 꿈의 스쿼드를 구축하여 리그 우승에 한 걸음 더 가까워졌다. 또한 호영에게 있어서도 매우 중요한 시기였다. 20일에 예정된 대 발렌시아CF 전 때문이었는데, 이는 호영에게나 팀에게나 매우 중요한 리그 경기였다. 나날이 연승행진을 기록하고 있는 레알 마드리드 후베닐B로서는, 리그 2위인 발렌시아를 격파해야 리그우승에 확신을 가질 수 있었기 때문이다. 현재 발렌시아CF 후베닐B(U17)와의 승점 차이는 단 4점. 시즌이 중반을 넘어선 지금, 이번 경기에서 승리를 거둔다면 후에 있을 컵 대회에서도 여유를 가질 수 있게 된다. 리그 후반으로 갈수록 약해지는 호영으로서는 반드시 승리해야 하는 경기였다. 하지만 무엇보다 중요한 것은 따로 있었다. 바로, 지단의 재능. -마에스트로의 빌드 업(SU) 지단만의 재능. 아트사커의 근간이 되는 빌드 업. 빌드 업(Build-up)을 쉽게 말하면 ‘게임운영능력’이다. 이것은 시대가 지날수록 따라 점점 중요해지는 능력인데, 지금이야 플레이메이커들을 필두로 한 빌드 업이 득세를 보고 있다지만, 후에는 골키퍼에게까지 요구된다. 그런데 만약, 지단의 빌드 업 재능을 가지고 수년 뒤 프로리그에서 뛰게 된다면? 꿀꺽. 발렌시아와의 경기를 앞둔 호영이 마른 침을 한 번 삼켰다. 물감처럼 번져가는 상상에 입안이 바싹 말랐다. 신(新)과 구(舊)의 조화. 그 연결고리 역할을 자신이 해낼 수 있을지도 모른다는 생각에 손끝이 미세하게 떨렸다. 수비수의 개념을 바꾼 베켄바우어가, 토탈 사커의 창시자 크루이프가, 아트사커의 선구자 지단이 그랬던 것처럼, 자신 또한 축구계에 센세이션을 일으킬지도 몰랐다.","output":"083. Evolution, not Change (3) A lot happened right after the World Cup ended. Especially in South Korea. Zidane's interview instilled a sense of pride in many Koreans. Although the World Cup performance was not great, it was as if they had received a valuable gift. On the other hand, the football world experienced a seismic shift as France lifted the World Cup trophy, with Real Madrid being particularly active. Summer transfer window of 2006. Perez, who had escaped the brink of dismissal due to various favorable circumstances, had secured one last chance. He had about five months. If he failed to show good results by the winter break, the socios (paid members) of Real would lead the opinion to dismiss him without mercy. For Perez, it was a do-or-die situation. His mission was to lead the team to first place in the league by December and to advance to the last 16 of the Champions League. President Perez prepared thoroughly for this. His efforts began during the summer transfer window of '06, with the first target being the French bomber 'Franck Ribery.' Following France's World Cup victory, many of Europe's top clubs had already sent love calls to him. Arsenal had offered 21 million euros, and a fierce recruitment battle was anticipated, but Perez ended it all by proposing 40 million euros (approximately 60 billion Korean won). Franck Ribery expressed his intention to transfer to Real Madrid, and the deal seemed to be concluded. However. Despite the astronomical transfer fee, his current team warned against contacting Ribery, reminding that he still had four years left on his contract. But Perez was not one to be discouraged. He immediately targeted the next player, the explosive French left-winger Florent Malouda. The transfer fee was 20 million euros (approximately 30 billion Korean won). It was surprising that he wasn't particularly handsome, but the transfer was intended to create an asymmetrical combination with the classic right-winger Beckham. Additionally, to fill the void left by 'Makelele's absence,' which had led to the downfall of the Galacticos, Perez successfully signed the French defensive midfielder Mahamadou Diarra for 46 billion won. Perez's moves did not stop there. \\"Expensive players are the cheapest,\\" was his motto, and he was ready to spend the ample funds he had prepared. Then, a massive event that would shake the football world occurred. Calciopoli. The biggest scandal in Italian football history involved Juventus' director participating in match-fixing using his connections with high-ranking officials in football and media. For example, he secretly contacted the referee assignment officer and directed referee appointments, repeatedly doing what should not have been done. AC Milan, Lazio, Fiorentina, and other prestigious clubs were also revealed to be involved, shocking the football world. Severe penalties were given. Many officials were expelled from football, and Juventus was relegated to the third division, later revised to the second division after an appeal, leading to many Juventus players leaving the team. Perez's eyes were busy. First, to strengthen the defense, Cannavaro and Emerson were signed. Furthermore, Real's board managed to sign Van Nistelrooy from Manchester United at a bargain, successfully building a dream team. Despite Perez's fondness for Ronaldo, the fact that he signed Van Nistelrooy indicated that his influence within the club had narrowed. The media reacted with skepticism about the team being oversaturated, but Real Madrid was just getting started, preparing for the winter transfer window. 2006 was also a meaningful year for Zidane. The 2006 World Cup in Germany, which he thought would be his last stage, extended his football life. At 33 years old. Despite approaching the twilight of his career, Zidane remained consistent. As always, he trained with the ball and kept his body in shape. Although it was a tough decision, Zidane's wife respected his wishes and provided him with full support. Eventually, Zidane, through grueling efforts, demonstrated the power of a veteran by leading the team to first place by December. And that year, he announced his resurgence to the world by winning the Ballon d'Or. His tutoring with Hoyoung continued. Then in January. Along with a cold wave in Madrid, a welcome face arrived. Marcelo, who had shown outstanding performance in the Brazilian league, and Gonzalo Higuain, an exceptional Argentine prospect that the club had been watching for a while, joined the team. With this, Real Madrid built a dream squad composed of starters, rotation players, and promising youngsters, moving one step closer to the league title. It was also a very important time for Hoyoung. Because of the upcoming match against Valencia CF scheduled for the 20th, which was a crucial league game for both Hoyoung and the team. As Real Madrid Juvenil B, on a winning streak, needed to defeat second-place Valencia to be confident of the league title. The point difference between Real Madrid Juvenil B (U17) and Valencia CF was just four points. Now, past the midpoint of the season, a victory in this match would allow them to relax in the upcoming cup competitions. For Hoyoung, who tended to weaken as the league progressed, it was a must-win game. But there was something even more important. Namely, Zidane's talent. - Maestro's Build-Up (SU) Zidane's unique talent. The foundation of art soccer is the build-up. Simply put, build-up is 'game management ability.' This ability becomes increasingly important as time goes on. Although playmakers currently lead the way in build-up, in the future, even goalkeepers will be required to have this skill. But what if Hoyoung were to possess Zidane's build-up talent and play in the professional leagues years later? Gulp. Hoyoung, facing the match against Valencia, swallowed dryly. His mouth dried up with the spreading imagination like paint. The harmony of the new and the old. He trembled slightly at the thought that he might be able to fulfill the role of a connecting link. Just as Beckenbauer, who changed the concept of a defender, Cruyff, the founder of Total Football, and Zidane, the pioneer of art soccer, had caused sensations in the football world, Hoyoung too might shake up the football scene."},{"instruction":"084. 변화 아닌 진화(4) 필드를 가득 채우는 동료들의 환호성. 그것을 뒤로, 호영의 눈앞에 반가운 소식이 찾아왔다. [마에스트로의 빌드 업(SU)을 탐합니다.] SU등급을 탐할 수 있게 된 걸 보니, SU(Special Unique)는 U등급에 분류되는 모양이었다. 호영의 눈이 빠르게 굴러갔다. [재능을 완전히 가져오는데 150일→75일이 소요됩니다. 75일 동안 다른 재능을 탐할 수 없습니다.] ‘드디어!’ 얻었다. 8년간 프랑스를 월드컵에서 2번이나 우승시킨 유일무이한 재능. 하지만 이제는 더 이상 유일한 것이 아니었다. 은퇴 이후 사라지게 될, 예술 그 자체였던 재능은 호영에게 고스란히 전승되었다. 바로 지단의 아트사커. 그것은 호영이 은퇴하는 그날까지 필드에서 사라지지 않을 것이다. 질끈. “나도 할 수 있다.” 호영은 작게 읊조렸다. 우직했지만 부담감이 실려 있는 목소리였다. U급 재능을 얻었을 때와는 다른 중량감. 마치 머리에 왕관을 쓴 것 같다는 유치한 생각까지 들었다. “후.” 떨렸다. 누가 보면 미친놈이라 생각할지도 모르지만, 호영은 결코 이 현실을 가볍게 여길 수 없었다. 지단의 재능을 얻었다는 생각에 다리가 후들후들 떨렸다. 골은 넣은 지 한참이나 지났지만 그것과 상관없이 환희와 흥분이 지속되었다. 미친놈마냥 목 놓아 소리라도 지르고 싶은 심정이었다. 내가, 지단의 재능을 얻었다고 말이다. “후우.” 뿌연 입김이 자욱하게 피어올랐다. 긴장감이 뜨거운 열정으로, 그리고 자신감으로 뒤바뀌었다. 뼛속을 후벼 파는 한파가 엄습했지만, 반대로 호영의 몸은 한결 가벼워졌다. 자신감이 몸과 마음을 녹여주고 있었다. 이제 겨우 재능을 탐하기 시작했을 뿐이지만, 어째서인지 벌써부터 자신감이 충만했다. 가슴이 벅차올랐다. 정말 무엇이든 할 수 있을 것 같았다. 축구, 수준 높은 축구를 말이다. 씨익. 호영의 입가에 세상에서 가장 행복한 미소가 어렸다. 하지만 경기가 재개될 무렵에는 진지함만이 남아있었다. 후반전은 다소 따분했던 전반전과 달리 흥미로운 양상을 띠었다. 이대로는 안 되겠다 싶었던 발렌시아가 큰 변화를 모색하면서 감추고 있던 발톱을 들춰냈다. 그리고 그 발톱은 채 한 번 휘두르기도 전에 봉인되고 말았다. 레알 마드리드의 미드필더들이 뛰어난 조직력을 보이며, 변수를 만들려는 발렌시아의 난잡한 움직임을 잡아낸 것이었다. “야!” 발렌시아의 수비형 미드필더 티모르(Timor)는 속이 타들어갔다. 발톱을 휘두르기는커녕 날갯짓 한 번 제대로 못하고 호랑이에게 잡힌 꼴이었다. ‘저 새끼가 진짜!’ 울화가 치밀어 올랐다. 우호영이 살짝 라인을 내려 수비에 가담하고 있는 꼴을 보고 있자니, 당장이라도 달려가서 멱살을 잡고 싶었다. 그뿐만이 아니었다. 공을 잡을 때면 짧고 빠른 패스로 힘 싸움을 유도하는데, 발렌시아의 수비수들은 그것에 이끌려가 자꾸만 틈을 드러내고 있었다. 보다 못한 티모르가 깊은 한숨을 토해냈다. “후······.” 그러다 공이 골라인 아웃된 틈에 수비수들을 불러 모았다. 거기에 대고 강한 어조로 내뱉었다. “이 등신들아. 니들이 서 있는 공간에 집중하라고. 대가리가 텅텅 비었냐? 저렇게 대놓고 빌드업을 하는데 왜 같이 놀아줘? 아예 넘어가서 동참하지 그러냐?” 티모르는 선수들을 꾸짖으면서 나름 주장다운 면모를 보였다. 하지만 그보다는 사실 화풀이에 가까웠다. “정신 차려. 아직 한 골 차이야. 우리만 제대로 막으면 언제든지 역전할 수 있다고.” 그로부터 5분 뒤. 발렌시아 수비진에 위기가 찾아왔다. 호영을 필두로 한 레알 마드리드의 공격진이 점점 템포를 빠르게 올리면서, 발렌시아 수비진의 허점을 들쑤시고 다니는 것이었다. ‘혼란을 야기하겠다 이거지.’ 뻔한 수법. 티모르는 헛웃음을 흘렸다. 한두 번 당하지, 서너 번 당한다면 그건 수비수로서 실격이다. 코치에게 그렇게 배웠던 티모르다. 그렇기에 정신을 바짝 차렸다. 흔들리지 않는 고목처럼 자신의 위치를 고수하며 상대의 유혹에 넘어가지 않았다. 그리고 그때, 레알의 마르코스가 좌측 측면으로 파고들었다. ‘너무 뻔하잖아.’ 아까와 같은 상황. ‘내가 갈 줄 알고?’ 과연 발렌시아 수비의 중추답게, 티모르는 어떠한 유혹에도 넘어가지 않았다. 대신 마르코스에게 연결돼있는 패스길목을 사수했다. 바로 그게 문제였다. 타악! 일순 머리 위로 공이 넘어갔다. ‘로빙패스···?’ 경기 내내 짧은 땅볼패스만 배급하던 우호영이 이번엔 롱 패스를 꺼내든 것이었다. ‘······ 아.’ 유혹에 넘어가지 않았던 것이 패착이었다. 수비수로서의 자격상실. 뚫리고 말았다. “미친!” 이번엔 자신이 구멍이 돼버리고 말았다. 마르코스의 퍼스트 터치가 길었던 탓에 실점으로 이어지지는 않았지만, 문제는 따로 있었다. ‘뭐지.’ 정신이 아찔했다. 마치 저편 어딘가에서, 마성의 목소리가 들려오는 것 같았다. ‘우호영?’ “으으.” 그의 심리전에 당했다는 생각에 화가 치밀어 올랐다. 직접 당해보지 않고서는 알 수 없는 고통이었다. “아아아아!” 티모르, 그는 이미 17세가 되기까지 수많은 유망주들을 만나온 유소년 계의 베테랑이었다. 그러나 이런 경험은 처음이었다. 최소 메시라고 불리며 스페인 최고의 유망주로 평가 받는 FC바르셀로나의 보얀(Bojan)과 맞붙었을 때도 이 정도는 아니었다. 그 당시, 보얀의 경악스러운 개인기와 드리블에 수차례나 농락당했지만 이렇게 화가 나지는 않았었다. 그것은 직접 눈에 드러나는 플레이였기에, 뭐가 잘못됐으며 무엇에 당한 것인지 깨닫고 보완할 수 있었기 때문이다. 하지만 이건······. ‘뭘 어쩌라고.’ 대처방법이 영 떠오르질 않았다. 비유하자면 보얀은 신, 우호영은 귀신이었다. 우호영을 상대하고 있으면 마치 귀신에 홀린 듯한 느낌을 받는다. 그리고 어느새 정신 차리고 보면 실책한 자신의 모습을 보게 된다. 마치 자신의 머리꼭대기 위에 서있는 듯한 기분. 그래서 더 짜증났다. 밟아버리고 싶었다. 안 될 걸 알면서도 오기가 생겼다. “후!” ‘넌 죽었다.’ 티모르는 두 주먹을 불끈 쥐며 초강수를 준비했다. 얼마 지나지 않아 기회가 생겼다. ‘온다.’ 우호영이 직접 공을 몰면서 중원을 넘어서고 있었다. 기다렸다는 듯 티모르가 진드기처럼 달라붙었다. ‘밟는다.’ 경기 시작 전 감독이 말하길, 우호영에게 붙지 말고 공간을 막아야 한다고 했지만, 티모르는 더 이상 참을 수 없었다.","output":"084. Evolution, not Change (4) Amidst the cheers of his teammates filling the field, Hoyoung received welcome news. [You covet the Maestro's Build-Up (SU).] Seeing that he could covet an SU (Special Unique) grade, it seemed that SU was classified under the U grade. Hoyoung's eyes quickly scanned the message. [It will take 150 days→75 days to fully acquire the talent. You cannot covet another talent for 75 days.] 'Finally!' He had obtained it. The unique talent that led France to two World Cup victories over eight years. But now, it was no longer unique. The talent that was art itself, which would have disappeared after retirement, was fully passed on to Hoyoung. It was Zidane's art soccer. It would not disappear from the field until the day Hoyoung retired. Firmly. \\"I can do it too.\\" Hoyoung muttered softly. His voice was steadfast but carried a weight of responsibility. A different sense of gravity than when he had acquired a U-grade talent. He even had the childish thought that it was like wearing a crown on his head. \\"Sigh.\\" He trembled. Anyone watching might think he was crazy, but Hoyoung could not take this reality lightly. The thought of having acquired Zidane's talent made his legs shake. The goal had been scored a while ago, but the joy and excitement continued regardless. He felt like screaming at the top of his lungs, like a madman. I have obtained Zidane's talent. \\"Hoo.\\" His breath fogged up heavily in the cold air. Tension turned into burning passion, and then into confidence. Despite the biting cold, Hoyoung's body felt lighter. Confidence was melting his body and mind. He had only just begun to covet the talent, but for some reason, he was already brimming with confidence. His heart swelled. He felt like he could do anything. Play soccer, high-level soccer. A grin spread across Hoyoung's face, the happiest smile in the world. But by the time the game resumed, only seriousness remained. The second half was more interesting than the somewhat dull first half. Valencia, feeling that they couldn't continue as they were, sought significant changes and revealed their hidden claws. And those claws were sealed before they could even be swung. Real Madrid's midfielders showed excellent organization, capturing Valencia's messy attempts to create variables. \\"Hey!\\" Valencia's defensive midfielder Timor was burning with frustration. Instead of swinging their claws, they were caught by the tiger without even properly flapping their wings. 'That bastard!' Rage surged within him. Seeing Hoyoung slightly drop back to join the defense, Timor wanted to rush over and grab him by the collar. And that wasn't all. Whenever Hoyoung got the ball, he induced physical battles with short, quick passes, and Valencia's defenders kept revealing gaps, drawn into his game. Unable to watch any longer, Timor let out a deep sigh. \\"Sigh...\\" Then, during a moment when the ball went out of play, he gathered the defenders. He spoke to them with a strong tone. \\"You idiots. Focus on the space you're standing in. Are your heads empty? Why are you playing along when he's so openly building up? Why don't you just go over and join them?\\" Timor scolded his teammates, showing a captain-like demeanor. But it was closer to venting his frustration. \\"Get a grip. It's only a one-goal difference. If we defend properly, we can turn it around at any time.\\" Five minutes later. A crisis hit Valencia's defense. Real Madrid's attackers, led by Hoyoung, increased the tempo, poking at the weaknesses in Valencia's defense. 'They're trying to cause confusion.' An obvious tactic. Timor let out a hollow laugh. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. Timor had learned this from his coach. So he was fully alert. Like an unshakable old tree, he maintained his position and did not fall for the opponent's temptations. And then, Real's Marcos made a move on the left flank. 'Too obvious.' The same situation as before. 'Do you think I'll go for it?' True to being the core of Valencia's defense, Timor did not fall for any temptations. Instead, he guarded the pass route connected to Marcos. That was the problem. Thump! Suddenly, the ball flew over his head. 'A lob pass...?' Hoyoung, who had been distributing only short ground passes throughout the game, had now pulled out a long pass. '...Ah.' Not falling for the temptation was a mistake. Disqualified as a defender. He had been breached. \\"Damn it!\\" This time, he had become the weak link. Although Marcos's first touch was too long, preventing a goal, there was a different problem. 'What's this?' His mind was dizzy. It was as if he could hear a bewitching voice from somewhere far away. 'Hoyoung?' \\"Ugh.\\" The thought that he had fallen for his psychological warfare made anger surge within him. It was a pain that could not be understood without experiencing it firsthand. \\"Aaaaah!\\" Timor was a veteran of the youth football world, having encountered numerous prospects by the age of 17. But this was a first for him. Even when he faced Bojan of FC Barcelona, called the next Messi and rated as Spain's top prospect, it wasn't this bad. Back then, he had been toyed with by Bojan's astonishing individual skills and dribbles, but he hadn't been this angry. Because it was a visible play, he could understand what went wrong and what he had fallen for, allowing him to make adjustments. But this... 'What am I supposed to do?' He couldn't think of a way to deal with it. To put it metaphorically, Bojan was a god, Hoyoung was a ghost. Facing Hoyoung felt like being bewitched by a ghost. And before he knew it, he would find himself making a mistake. As if Hoyoung was standing right on top of his head. That's why it was more annoying. He wanted to stomp on him. Even though he knew it was impossible, he felt a stubbornness rise within him. \\"Hah!\\" 'I'll finish you.' Timor clenched his fists, preparing to take drastic measures. Soon, an opportunity arose. 'Here it comes.' Hoyoung was carrying the ball across the midfield. As if waiting for this moment, Timor stuck to him like a tick. 'I'll stomp on you.' Before the game, the coach had said not to stick to Hoyoung but to block the space, but Timor could no longer hold back."},{"instruction":"","output":"A computer is a machine that is able to take in data, process it and produce an output.

[레알 마드리드의 우호영이 미래 문제로 보드진에게 면담을 요청하다.] [우호영, 레알 마드리드와의 미래 불확실. 바르셀로나가 러브콜을 보낸 것이 원인?] [바르셀로나는 우호영에게 러브콜을 끊임없이 보내고 있으며, 가능하다면 바르셀로나 후베닐A의 ‘지오반니 도스 산토스’와 ‘우호영’을 트레이드하고 싶어 한다.] [우호영은 마드리드의 날씨에 유감을 표하고 있다. 바르셀로나 보드진은, 그가 바르셀로나로 온다면 근사한 선글라스와 수영복을 선물할 생각이 있다고 밝혔다.] [우호영은 답답한 도시보다 모래사장과 해변이 펼쳐진 바르셀로나에서 살기를 원한다.] [우호영, 바르셀로나 음식이 세상에서 가장 맛있어.] [우호영, 호나우두는 뚱뚱해서 싫어.] [우호영은 호나우두보다 호나우지뉴를 더 좋아한다며 메시처럼 하루 빨리 라 리가에 데뷔하고 싶다고 포부를 밝혔다.] [우호영은 마드리드보다 바르셀로나 출신의 여자 친구를 사귀고 싶어 한다.] 그들은 ‘우호영’과 ‘바르셀로나’라는 키워드를 넣어서 수도 없이 많은 찌라시 기사를 내보냈다. 특히, 호나우지뉴의 사생활을 캐고 다니는 것으로 유명한 칼럼니스트 ‘La Saeta Oscuro’이 호영에게 매우 큰 관심을 가지고 있었다. 하지만 그에 맞서, 레알 마드리드에 초점을 두고 있는 마드리드의 마르카(Marca) 타블로이드사가 대응 기사를 내놓았다. [우호영은 이미 마드리드 ‘알부데나 묘지’에 누울 자리를 알아보고 있다. 죽어서도 마드리드를 떠나지 않을 거라는 각오를 온몸으로 보이면서 마드리드 팬들에게 기쁨을 안겨주었다.] [우호영은 해변가에서 살 수 없다. 축구를 너무 사랑한 나머지 수영하는 법을 까먹었기 때문이다.] [우호영이 가장 존경하는 선수는 루이스 피구. 바르셀로나에서 탈출한 ‘역사적인 결정’을 해냈었기 때문.] 레알 마드리드나 바르셀로나의 팬이 아닌 중도의 입장이라면, 웃음이 나올 수밖에 없는 상황이었다. 정작 당사자는 아무런 문제가 없는데, 주위에서 싸움을 부추기는 꼴이었다. 그도 그럴 게, 스페인에서는 16세가 되기 전까지 바이아웃 조항을 삽입할 수 없기에, 호영의 마음만 되돌린다면 바르셀로나에서 언제든 그를 데려갈 수 있기 때문이었다. 하지만 그러거나 말거나, 호영은 성장에만 집중하였다. 일단 최대한 빠르게 프로로 올라가야 했으니까. 그리고 오늘. 후베닐A와 후베닐B의 연습시합이 있었는데, 유소년 실무진과 지도자들이 참관하여 선수들의 신경이 곤두서있었다. 호영으로서도 좋은 모습을 보여 후베닐A로 빠르게 올라갈 수 있는 절호의 기회였다. ‘이름 날리는 유망주들은 죄다 후베닐A에 있어.’ 진정한 뷔페라면 바로 그곳. 그렇기에 빠르게 올라가야 했다. 빠르면 앞으로 1년. 올라갈 준비는 모두 끝났다. 이제 오를 일만 남았다. 호영은 그동안 관리한 재능을 확인하며 자신의 상태를 점검하였다.

Translate to english","output":"The league champion has been determined early. Thanks to the outstanding performance of Ronaldinho, who won the Ballon d'Or last year, FC Barcelona has been leading the season from the start and became the champion. Moreover, they successfully advanced to the final of the Champions League. As a result, Madrid had to go through some miserable times. It's one thing for a friend to succeed and feel a twinge of jealousy, but it's another when a rival does well – it can twist your insides. Real Madrid, knocked out early in the Round of 16 of the Champions League, had an unbearable atmosphere. Everything was a mess from start to finish. Despite spending so much money on recruiting the world's best players, their current state made them the laughingstock of global football fans. Coach Juan had long been a target for dismissal, and President Perez was already looking for his replacement. Rumors were even circulating that President Perez himself might be dismissed, but the board tried desperately to calm the public opinion by fronting the signing of Woo Ho-young. Meanwhile, Ho-young was consistently displaying his presence in Juvenil B. After a slight hesitation at the beginning, he quickly adapted and transformed the league into his own stage. At 14, the U17 was no longer an insurmountable wall for Ho-young. Especially since the refereeing in the Spanish leagues was stricter compared to others, he did not have to face as many rough tackles as during the U17 World Cup or the Montaigu Tournament, which he appreciated. Apart from the physically larger defenders, Ho-young's skills were effectively showcased. However, due to the limits of his stamina, he could not play in every game. As a result, he achieved a phenomenal record in the Juvenil League's Group 11, scoring 7 goals in 5 games. At the same time, news about Woo Ho-young spread widely across Spain. Among them, 'Don Balon,' a magazine based in Barcelona, showed a particular obsession with Ho-young. They published countless tabloid articles using the keywords 'Woo Ho-young' and 'Barcelona' – stories about Barcelona expressing interest in him, suggesting trades, and even reports about Ho-young's personal preferences for Barcelona over Madrid, his dislike for Ronaldo compared to Ronaldinho, and jokes about his future relationships and lifestyle choices. Famous columnist 'La Saeta Oscuro,' known for digging into Ronaldinho's private life, took a significant interest in Ho-young. However, in response to this, Madrid's Marca tabloid, which focuses on Real Madrid, released counter-articles – welcoming cheers from Madrid fans by claiming Ho-young's dedication to Madrid even in death and emphasizing his love for football over beachgoing. For neutral fans, the situation was almost comical – the subject of the articles had no issues, but the media and fans seemed to be stirring up a rivalry. And this was because, in Spain, until the age of 16, no buyout clause could be included in a contract, meaning that Barcelona could take him away anytime if they could sway Ho-young's heart. Regardless of the media frenzy, Ho-young only focused on his growth, aiming to rise to the pros as soon as possible. Today, there was a practice match between Juvenil A and Juvenil B, watched by the youth coaching staff and directors, and it was a perfect opportunity for Ho-young to showcase his abilities and advance to Juvenil A. \\"The real prospects are all in Juvenil A.\\" That was where he needed to be, and soon. Within a year or two. He had prepared himself to rise, and the time had come. He checked his condition while reviewing the talents he had nurtured. [Woo Ho-young] Talents (Soccer Prodigy (S-)) (Storm Dribble (SU)) (Unyielding Solidity of a Firm Rock (U)) (The Playmaking of a Soccer Prince (U)) (Multi-talented Central Commander (U)) (And many more...) Over the past year since the Montaigu Tournament, he had made significant progress. All C-ranked talents had been upgraded and transformed, and he was continuously managing the B-ranked skills. Although many were remaining, he believed he could compress them to a third in the next 1-2 years. \\"I have accumulated quite a lot.\\" Among the Real Madrid youth, there was no one with talents comparable to Ho-young. Possibly, the closest was the captain of the Juvenil A team, an exceptional prospect set to debut as a professional soon. \\"The one who has earned his reputation.\\" Although not physically large, he had excellent abilities and blue eyes that caught everyone's attention as he reached out for a handshake. \\"Let's have a good match.\\" Their exchange drew the attention of everyone, including President Perez, who said decisively. \\"Watch carefully and then decide.\\" \\"Yes.\\" With a short, firm reply, the young man, who could exude charisma with his shimmering head, was a primary candidate as a tutor for Ho-young. \\"Tutoring out of nowhere.\\" Tutoring needs to match personalities. It's not something that can simply be done on demand. In that sense, the man was planning to give Ho-young a tough evaluation – whether he was worthy of receiving tutoring or not. \\"Let's see.\\" The man with glittering hair looked at Ho-young intently, determining whether he was ready to mentor the boy."},{"instruction":"’ 우호영 때문에 아침부터 줄곧 불길한 예감이 있었는데, 아무래도 괜한 걱정이었던 모양이다. 경기가 이렇게나 잘 풀릴 줄은 몰랐다. ‘오늘로 승부를 보자.’ 마타는 진짜 프로가 된다는 사실에 기대감이 마구 솟구쳤다. 하지만 안타깝게도 그 감정은 그리 오래가지 못했다. 선제골을 넣은 지 불과 5분 만에 벌어진 일이었다. “뭐지?” 마타의 얼굴이 찰흙처럼 굳어지더니 안색이 어두워졌다. 10분 전에 이미 휘어잡았다고 생각했던 경기가 어느새 느슨해져있는 것이었다. A팀의 수비수들이 조금씩 애를 먹더니, 그것이 결국 3선과 중원에까지 영향을 끼치고 있었다. 그 중심에는 B팀의 공격형 미드필더가 존재했다. ‘··· 우호영.’ 간간히 B팀의 공격이 이뤄질 때마다, 점점 날카로워지는 우호영의 플레이가 경기의 흐름을 서서히 비틀고 있었다. “정신 차려! 상대는 겨우 열두 살이야!” 마타의 외침대로, 호영은 만 12세였다. 하지만 A팀의 수비수들을 상대하는 것은 12세의 소년이 아닌, 비범한 재주를 가진 전무후무한 유망주였다. 나이는 뛰어넘는 우호영의 플레이가 마타의 외침을 깔아뭉갰다. 마치 늪처럼. 시간이 지나면 지날수록 우호영의 플레이메이킹이 A팀 수비수들을 혼란의 도가니에 빠트리고 있었다. 축구경기장은 미동도 하지 않았지만, 피치 위의 기세와 분위기는 어느새 뒤집혀있었다. 역풍(逆風)이었다. 다른 말로, 발락의 다재다능함과 카카의 플레이메이킹을 앞세운 움직임. 그것을 이해할 수 없었던 마타는 섬뜩한 위기감을 느끼기 시작했다. 말로는 설명할 수 없는 무언가가 게임을 어지럽히고 있는 것 같았다. ‘그래. 흐름이야. 우리의 흐름이 읽히고 있어.’ 정교한 패스와 정밀한 공수조율로 만들어낸 자신의 플레이메이킹이 우호영에게 잡아먹히고 있었다. 이대로라면 승리는 불확실했다. 대승(大勝)은커녕 패배하는 망신살을 당할지도 몰랐다. 이미 점유율은 균형을 이뤘고, 양 팀 간의 줄다리기가 시작된 상황이었다. 이러다 주도권까지 빼앗기면 그야말로 위험한 상황이었다. 유일하게 건재한 구역은 마타가 버티고 있는 2선. 주도권이 있는 이곳만은 끝까지 지켜야 했다. 그래야 추가득점을 취할 수 있을 테니까. 마타가 외쳤다. “우리가 라인을 좀 내릴게! 중원이 올라와줘!” 느닷없이 불어 닥치는 바람이 외투를 벗기려 한다면, 몸을 움츠리면 되는 것이다. 그리고 바람이 잠시 멈췄을 때를 노린다. 그것이 궁지에 몰린 마타의 계획이었다. 호영의 계획이 점점 현실화되어갔다. 거창한 건 아니었다. 그저, 선수라면 누구나 알고 있는 기본적인 전술을 경기에 적용시킨 것뿐이었다. 말이야 쉽지만, 기본적인 자질이 뒷받침되어야 가능한 일이었다. 카를로스 감독에게서 탐했던 전술적 이해도. 흐름을 리드할 수 있게 해준 중원사령관 발락의 가르침. 카카의 플레이메이킹까지. 이런 재능들이 모여서 이런 성과를 만들어낼 수 있었다. 물론 지단이나 사비, 알론소, 피를로, 발락 같은 선수들이야 밥 먹듯 하는 플레이라지만, 호영은 여기까지 온 것만 해도 감격스러웠다. ‘좋아. 여기서 마타의 움직임만 죽여 놓으면 승기를 가져올 수 있어.’ 심리전은 끝났다. 이제 행동으로 실천하여 승부를 가를 때다. 호영은 마타를 관찰하면서 느낀 점을 곰곰이 돌이켜보았다. ‘중앙 지향적 성향이 너무 강해.’ 그게 약점이었다. 마타는 중앙에서 엄청난 파괴력을 지니고 있지만, 그것이 좌우 한쪽으로 치우치게 되면 파괴력을 상실하고 만다. 그래서 호영은 그것을 노렸다. 퍼억! “···!” 2선에서 중원으로 살짝 내려간 호영이 마타와 몸을 부딪쳤다. ‘역시.’ 무려 5살 차이였지만, 몸싸움에서 크게 밀리는 느낌은 안 들었다. “큭.” 오히려 마타가 조금씩 밀리고 있었다. 그도 그럴 게, 168센티밖에 안 되는 키와 왜소한 마타의 체구는, 175센티가 넘는 호영을 상대하기에 모자람이 많았기 때문이다. 이대론 안 되겠다 싶었던 마타는 결국 압박에서 벗어나고자 호영을 피해 도망 다녔다. 그 탓에 공간장악에 문제가 생겼고, 그것은 곧 B팀 수비진에게 여유를 가져다주었다. 호영이 마르코스에게 손짓했다. “마르코스! 여기까지 커버해줘!” 한결 여유를 되찾은 마르코스 알론소가 존 디펜스(Zone defense)를 확장하며, 살금살금 마타에게 전방 압박을 가했다. 몸집이 장대한 마르코스는 물 만난 고기처럼 마타를 한쪽으로 몰아붙였다. 결국 그 압력을 견디지 못한 마타가 중앙에서 떨어져나가고 말았다. 바로 그때였다. “호영!” 난투 끝에 공을 커트한 마르코스가 호영에게 짧게 내어주면서 우측 측면으로 파고들었다. 지난 3개월간 마르코스와 밥 먹듯 주고받은 번번이 로 빠르게 빌드 업을 쌓아갔다. 탁, 탁. 호영이 곧바로 리턴패스를 내어주었다. 그리고 반대편으로 깊숙이 달리자, 얼마 안가 다시금 리턴패스가 돌아왔다. 거침없이 돌파하던 호영의 발이 잠시 멈췄다. 톡, 톡. 공을 아기 다루듯 살포시 굴리면서 시야를 넓게 퍼트렸다. 중앙좌측에서 우측전방으로 파고드는 원 톱의 움직임이 포착되었다. 일순 호영의 동공이 확장되었다. 목에 빳빳이 경직되면서 오른다리에 힘이 실렸다. ‘지금!’ 이럴 때가 바로, 간수에게서 얻어온 패스의 재능이 빛나는 순간이다. 뛰어난 패스능력. 타악! 오른발 끝에서 벗어난 공이 잔디를 가르며 우측전방으로 뻗어나갔다. A팀 수비수의 수비구역을 살짝 벗어나는 키 패스였다. “달려!” 오프사이드 트랩이 와장창 무너져 내리자, 뒷공간으로 내달린 원 톱 스트라이커가 발에 공을 붙였다. 타악! 그렇게 연출된 일대일 상황. 퍼스트터치가 조금 긴 것을 확인한 골키퍼가 허겁지겁 뛰쳐나왔다. 하지만 B팀의 원 톱 스트라이커. 호세 카예혼(Jose Callejon)은 득점을 향한 어마어마한 의지를 내비치고 있었다. 이번 시즌이 끝나면 나이 때문에 후베닐A로 무조건 올라가거나, 그게 아니라면 팀에서 방출될 상황이었기에 그만큼 절실했다. 호영이 만들어준 이 기회를 놓쳐서는 안 됐다. 그 의지가 공에 고스란히 전해졌다. 뻐엉! 인사이드킥으로 감아 찬 회심의 슈팅. 그것이 동점골을 만들어냈다. A팀의 마타와 B팀의 우호영이 사이좋게 어시스트를 기록하면서 전반전이 끝났다. 결과적으로는 같았으나, 내용상으로는 승자와 패자가 명확히 갈린 경기였다. “자네가 보기에는 어떤가?” 페레즈가 물었다. 그리고 사내, 지네딘 지단(Zinedine Zidane)이 답했다. 양손바닥을 내밀면서, 어이없다는 듯이. “분명 쉐도우 스트라이커 기질이 강하다고 하지 않았습니까?” 그러자 옆에 있던 미켈이 말했다. “그게, 그때그때 달라요.” 자기가 말하면서도 어이없다는 표정이었다.","output":"Woo Ho-young had been giving me a bad feeling since the morning, but it seems it was just needless worry. I didn't expect the game to go this well. \\"Let's settle the score today.\\" Mata was brimming with anticipation at the thought of becoming a real pro. Unfortunately, that feeling didn't last long. It was just five minutes after scoring the opening goal that it happened. \\"What's going on?\\" Mata's face hardened like clay, and his complexion darkened. The game he thought he had in his grasp just ten minutes ago was now slipping away. The defenders of Team A were starting to struggle, and this was beginning to affect the third line and the midfield. At the center of it all was Team B's attacking midfielder. \\"...Woo Ho-young.\\" Every time Team B mounted an attack, Woo Ho-young's increasingly sharp play was slowly twisting the flow of the game. \\"Snap out of it! The opponent is just twelve years old!\\" As Mata shouted, indeed, Ho-young was only twelve. But what Team A's defenders faced was not a twelve-year-old boy, but an unprecedented prospect with extraordinary talent. Ho-young's play, which transcended age, crushed Mata's shout. Like a swamp. As time passed, Ho-young's playmaking plunged Team A's defenders into a cauldron of confusion. The soccer field remained motionless, but the momentum and atmosphere on the pitch had completely flipped. It was a headwind. In other words, movements led by the versatility of Ballack and the playmaking of Kaká. Mata, who couldn't understand this, began to feel a chilling sense of crisis. Something indescribable seemed to be disrupting the game. \\"Yes. The flow. Our flow is being read.\\" His own playmaking, crafted with precise passes and coordination, was being devoured by Woo Ho-young. At this rate, victory was uncertain. Far from a big win, they might even suffer the disgrace of defeat. The possession had already balanced out, and a tug-of-war between the two teams had begun. If they lost control, it would be a dangerous situation. The only area still intact was the second line, where Mata stood firm. This area, where they had control, had to be protected until the end. Only then could they score more goals. Mata shouted. \\"We'll drop our line a bit! Midfield, move up!\\" If a sudden wind tries to strip off your coat, you just need to huddle up. And wait for the moment when the wind pauses. That was Mata's plan when cornered. Ho-young's plan was gradually becoming a reality. It wasn't anything grand. He had simply applied basic tactics that any player would know to the game. Easy to say, but it required basic qualities to be possible. The tactical understanding he coveted from Coach Carlos. The teachings of central commander Ballack that allowed him to lead the flow. Even Kaká's playmaking. These talents came together to produce such results. Of course, players like Zidane, Xavi, Alonso, Pirlo, and Ballack performed such plays as easily as eating, but for Ho-young, just getting this far was thrilling. \\"Good. If I can just stop Mata's movements here, we can take the advantage.\\" The psychological warfare was over. Now it was time to act and decide the outcome. Ho-young reflected on what he had observed about Mata. \\"His central-oriented tendency is too strong.\\" That was his weakness. Mata had tremendous destructive power in the center, but once it shifted to one side, he lost that power. So Ho-young targeted that. Thump! \\"...!\\" Ho-young, who had slightly dropped back from the second line to the midfield, collided with Mata. \\"As expected.\\" Despite the five-year age difference, he didn't feel significantly overpowered in the physical contest. \\"Ugh.\\" Instead, it was Mata who was gradually being pushed back. That was because Mata, at only 168 centimeters tall and with a slight build, was no match for Ho-young, who was over 175 centimeters tall. Realizing this wouldn't work, Mata eventually tried to escape Ho-young's pressure by running away. This caused problems with space control, which in turn gave Team B's defenders some breathing room. Ho-young signaled to Marcos. \\"Marcos! Cover up to here!\\" Marcos Alonso, now with more room to maneuver, expanded his zone defense and stealthily applied forward pressure on Mata. The towering Marcos cornered Mata like a fish in water. Eventually, Mata couldn't withstand the pressure and was pushed out of the center. That was the moment. \\"Ho-young!\\" After a scuffle, Marcos, who had cut off the ball, passed it short to Ho-young and penetrated the right flank. Over the past three months, Marcos and Ho-young had been exchanging passes as routinely as eating meals, quickly building up the play. Tap, tap. Ho-young immediately returned the pass. Then, as he ran deep to the opposite side, the return pass came back to him shortly after. Ho-young's feet, which had been breaking through without hesitation, paused for a moment. Tap, tap. He gently rolled the ball as if handling a baby, widening his field of vision. He caught the movement of the lone striker penetrating from the central left to the right front. For a moment, Ho-young's pupils dilated. Tension shot up his neck, and strength filled his right leg. \\"Now!\\" This was the moment when the passing talent he had acquired from Ganso shone. Excellent passing ability. Thwack! The ball released from his right foot sliced through the grass towards the right front. It was a key pass that just missed the defensive zone of Team A's defenders. \\"Run!\\" As the offside trap crumbled, the lone top striker who had sprinted into the backspace took control of the ball. Thwack! Thus, a one-on-one situation was created. The goalkeeper, noticing the striker's slightly long first touch, rushed out in a panic. But Team B's lone top striker. Jose Callejon was showing an immense will to score. Since he had to move up to Juvenil A or be released from the team due to his age at the end of the season, he was desperate. He couldn't miss this opportunity created by Ho-young. That will was fully transmitted to the ball. Boom! A decisive inside kick shot curled into the goal. It resulted in an equalizing goal. Team A's Mata and Team B's Woo Ho-young both recorded assists as the first half came to an end. Although the score was the same, the content of the game clearly distinguished the winner from the loser. \\"What do you think?\\" Perez asked. And the man, Zinedine Zidane, answered. With palms outstretched, as if in disbelief. \\"Didn't you say he had a strong shadow striker quality?\\" Then Mikel, who was next to him, said. \\"Well, it changes from time to time.\\" Even as he spoke, his expression was one of incredulity."},{"instruction":"돌파타이밍을 재기 위한 강렬한 의지. 그것이 비달의 수비방법이었다. ‘넘어오기만 해봐라.’ 선을 넘으면 그 즉시 호영을 잡아채겠다는 심산. 상대가 제아무리 빠른 치타라도, 가속이 붙기 전에 제압하면 승산이 있을 것이라 생각했다. ‘와라.’ 일순 둘 사이에 심리전이 오갔다. 그때, 우호영의 다리가 지면을 박차고 튀어나갔다. “읍!!” 순간 눈이 돌아간 비달이 호영의 움직임을 쫓았다. 거기까지는 좋았다. 하지만. 치타는 한 방향으로만 달리는 것이 아닌, 장애물이 있다면 언제든 방향을 전환해 피해갈 수 있는 동물이다. 사람 또한 마찬가지. 스슷. 호영의 다리가 순간적으로 방향을 틀었다. 이후의 폭발적인 드리블이 비달의 수비를 무용지물로 만들었다. 그 시각 관중석. ‘Genie.’ 그 단어가 지단의 머릿속을 관통하였다. 불어로 천재라는 뜻이었다. 비로소 호영의 재능을 완전히 인정한 지단은 박수를 치고 있었다. ‘천재 중의 천재다.’ 사실 영재가 천재를 인정하는 것과, 천재가 천재를 인정하는 것에는 매우 큰 차이가 있다. 그런 의미에서 지단의 인정은 많은 것을 시사하고 있었다. 특히 방금 전 호영이 보여줬던 개인기. 기술의 완성도보다는, 기술을 활용하는 능력. 즉, 개인기에 대한 재능이 탁월하다는 것을 캐치할 수 있는 돌파였다. “흐음.” 엄청난 임팩트에 지단은 입을 다물지 못했다. 물론, 네 명의 선수를 차례대로 제치면서 골을 만들어내는 플레이는 유소년 경기에서 가끔씩 나오는 장면이다. 하지만 지금은 후반전이 시작된 직후. 상대 수비수들이 모두 자리를 잡은 상황이었다. 지단은 그 점을 아주 높이 샀다. “일반적인 유망주와 확실히 다르군요.” “같았으면 내가 이 지극정성을 들이고 있겠나.” “잘생겨서 그런 줄 알았거든요, 사실.” “못생겼으면 애초에 데려오질 않았겠지.” 진지하게 말하며 페레즈가 목청을 높였다. “더 지켜보게. 아직 그 진가가 다 안 나왔어.” “뭐가 또 남았습니까?” 지단의 궁금증은 후반 30분에 가서 풀렸다. 대애앵! 25미터 밖에서 뿜어져 나온 호영의 중거리 슈팅이 바로 그것이었다. 비록 골대에 맞아 득점으로 연결되지는 않았지만, 그 실력은 충분히 가늠할 수 있었다. 이 정도면 충분히 튜터 제자로 삼을 만했다. 아니, 지단은 그러고 싶었다. 경기를 보는 내내 호영으로부터 강한 임팩트를 받았다. 플레이가 뛰어난 건 둘째 치더라도, 경기를 하면서 동시에 흐름을 관찰하고 그것을 영리하게 활용하는 것은 축구만 잘한다고 되는 게 아니었기 때문이다. ‘기본적인 전술이라지만, 그걸 직접 활용할 수 있는 건 아무나 할 수 있는 게 아니지.’ 그가 보기에 우호영은 피치 위의 지도자가 될 자질을 가지고 있었다. 특히 세련되고 유연한 플레이메이킹은 그마저도 인정할 수준이었다. ‘저런 건 대체 누구한테 배운 거지?’ 그게 카카라고는 생각지도 못한 지단은 신기할 따름이었다. 사실 지단은 성인이 되어서야 두각을 나타낸 유형이라, 결코 유소년의 천재성을 맹신하지 않았다. 하지만 이건 확실히 믿을 수 있었다. 우호영의 장래······. 뭐가 되었든 엄청날 것 같았다. 호영은 전반에 힘을 너무 많이 쏟은 탓에 후반전에 가서 임팩트가 많이 줄었지만, 여전히 위협적인 움직임을 보이고 있었다. 좋은 기회가 생길 때마다, 돌파나 중거리 슛 혹은 플레이메이킹으로 B팀의 공격을 주도하였다. 반면 A팀의 반격도 만만치 않았다. 선수 교체에 제한이 없었기에, A팀 수석코치는 체력이 좋은 수비수들을 계속 내보내 호영의 플레이를 막아냈다. 물량 앞에 장사 없다는 말이 딱 들어맞았다. 결국 경기는 무승부로 돌아갔지만 호영에겐 매우 뜻깊은 경기였다. [탐하고 싶은 재능을 선택하세요.] -모범적인 멘탈(A+3) -꾸준한 오프 더 볼 무브먼트(B+2) -탄탄한 기본기(B+2) -뛰어난 패스(B+2) -(더 보기) 마타의 재능. A급 재능이 수두룩한 마타였지만, 중복 때문에 탐할 수 있는 건 그렇게 많지 않았다. 호영의 선택은 두 번째였다. [꾸준한 오프 더 볼 무브먼트(B+3)↑] 프로에 가까워지는 시기이니만큼 자신의 무기를 제련할 필요가 있었다. 그렇기에 호영은 일단 공격력에 집중하였다. ‘패스는 튜터를 받으면 될 거야.’ 그것은 레알 마드리드 1군의 패스귀신에게 튜터링을 받으면 단번에 해결될 문제였다. 이를 테면 ‘그날의 구티(Guti)’라든가. 어쨌든 경기는 성공적으로 끝났다. 후반 이후 힘이 많이 부쳤지만, 당장 후베닐A 리그로 올라가도 이렇게 몇 경기쯤은 연속으로 활약할 수 있을 것 같았다. 자신감을 얻게 된 경기였다. 그리고 경기 직후, A팀의 주장이 호영을 찾아왔다. “너 정말 잘하더라. 기회가 되면 반드시 함께 뛰고 싶어.” 싱긋. 호영이 웃었다. “좋은 경기였습니다. 언젠간 좋은 날이 있을 거예요.” 카카 못지않은 바른 청년 마타. 만일 나중에 잉글랜드 프리미어 리그로 진출한다면 그런 날이 오게 될 것이다. “다음에도 좋은 경기 해요. 즐거웠습니다.” 마타와의 만남을 뒤로, 호영은 웃으며 피치를 떠났다. 그런 얼굴이 굳은 것은 한 사내가 말을 걸어온 순간이었다. “경기, 잘 봤다.” “어? 어어······?” “만난 것도 인연인데 악수 한 번 하지.” 이게 무슨 상황인지 모르겠지만, 호영은 떨리는 가슴을 억누르며 악수를 받았다. 거칠었지만 마음이 편안해지는 손길이었다. 그리고 그로부터 약 4주. 지단이 은퇴하기 직전까지 지옥훈련이 실시되었다.","output":"A strong will to time his breakthrough. That was Vidal's method of defense. \\"Just try to get past me.\\" He planned to catch Ho-young the moment he crossed the line. Even if the opponent was as fast as a cheetah, he thought he had a chance if he could suppress it before it gained acceleration. \\"Come on.\\" For a moment, a psychological battle ensued between the two. Then, Woo Ho-young's legs kicked off the ground and he burst forward. \\"Ugh!\\" Vidal's eyes spun as he tried to follow Ho-young's movement. Up to that point, it was good. However. A cheetah doesn't just run in one direction; it's an animal that can change direction at any time to avoid obstacles. The same goes for people. Swoosh. Ho-young's legs suddenly changed direction. The explosive dribble that followed rendered Vidal's defense useless. At that moment in the stands. 'Genie.' That word pierced through Zidane's mind. It meant 'genius' in French. Finally fully acknowledging Ho-young's talent, Zidane was applauding. 'A genius among geniuses.' In fact, there's a big difference between a prodigy recognizing a genius and a genius recognizing another genius. In that sense, Zidane's recognition was very telling. Especially the skill Ho-young had just shown. More than the perfection of the technique, it was the ability to utilize the skill. In other words, it was a breakthrough that could catch the exceptional talent for individual skills. \\"Hmm.\\" Struck by the tremendous impact, Zidane couldn't close his mouth. Of course, plays where one player beats four opponents in a row to score a goal do occasionally happen in youth games. But this was right after the start of the second half. The opposing defenders were all in position. Zidane rated that very highly. \\"He's definitely different from the typical prospect.\\" \\"If he were the same, would I be putting in this much effort?\\" \\"I thought it was because he was good-looking, to be honest.\\" \\"If he were ugly, I wouldn't have brought him in the first place.\\" Perez raised his voice seriously. \\"Keep watching. His true value hasn't fully emerged yet.\\" \\"What else is there?\\" Zidane's curiosity was satisfied at the 30-minute mark of the second half. Daaang! It was Ho-young's long-range shot from 25 meters out. Although it didn't result in a goal as it hit the goalpost, the skill was clearly evident. This was enough to consider him as a tutor's disciple. No, Zidane wanted it to be so. Throughout the game, he was deeply impacted by Ho-young. Setting aside his excellent play, the ability to observe the flow of the game while playing and cleverly utilize it was not something that came just from being good at soccer. 'Basic tactics, sure, but not just anyone can apply them directly.' To Zidane, Woo Ho-young had the qualities to become a leader on the pitch. Especially his sophisticated and flexible playmaking was at a level even he could acknowledge. 'Who on earth taught him that?' Zidane, who never imagined it was Kaká, was simply amazed. In fact, Zidane, who only stood out as an adult, never blindly believed in the genius of youth. But this he could definitely believe in. The future of Woo Ho-young... Whatever it was, it seemed it would be tremendous. Ho-young had expended a lot of energy in the first half, so his impact decreased in the second half, but he still showed threatening movements. Whenever there was a good opportunity, he led Team B's attack with breakthroughs, long-range shots, or playmaking. On the other hand, Team A's counterattacks were not to be underestimated. Since there were no limits on player substitutions, Team A's head coach continuously sent out fresh defenders to block Ho-young's play. The saying \\"there's no beating quantity\\" fit perfectly. In the end, the game ended in a draw, but it was a very meaningful match for Ho-young. [Choose a talent you desire.] - Exemplary Mental (A+3) - Consistent Off the Ball Movement (B+2) - Solid Fundamentals (B+2) - Excellent Pass (B+2) - (More) Mata's talents. Although Mata had plenty of A-grade talents, there weren't many Ho-young could covet due to overlaps. Ho-young's choice was the second one. [Consistent Off the Ball Movement (B+3)↑] As he was getting closer to becoming a pro, he needed to refine his weapons. Therefore, Ho-young focused on improving his offensive capabilities. 'I can get tutoring for passing.' That was a problem that could be solved in one go by receiving tutoring from Real Madrid's first team's passing genius. For example, 'Guti of that day.' Anyway, the match ended successfully. Although he was quite exhausted in the second half, he felt he could play several consecutive games like this even if he moved up to the Juvenil A league right away. It was a game that gave him confidence. And right after the game, Team A's captain approached Ho-young. \\"You played really well. I definitely want to play together if there's a chance.\\" Ho-young smiled. \\"It was a good game. There will be a good day sometime.\\" Mata, a righteous young man not unlike Kaká. If he ever moves to the English Premier League, that day will come. \\"Let's have a good game next time too. It was fun.\\" After parting with Mata, Ho-young left the pitch with a smile. His expression hardened when a man approached him. \\"I watched the game. It was good.\\" \\"Huh? Uh...?\\" \\"Since we've met, let's shake hands.\\" Not quite understanding the situation, Ho-young suppressed his trembling heart and accepted the handshake. It was a rough but comforting touch. And about four weeks later. Intense training was conducted until just before Zidane's retirement."},{"instruction":") (S등급 이상은 히든조건을 달성해야 탐할 수 있습니다.) (조건1: 후베닐B 리그에서 포디움(3위 이내) 달성하기) (조건2: 5000분 동안 튜터링 받기) (조건3: 바르셀로나, 세비야, AT마드리드, 발렌시아CF를 상대로 각각 득점하기) (조건4: 지네딘 지단의 노하우 전수받기) (히든조건: 재능 1개 이상을 탐할 시 개방) 사실 호영은 작년에 드사이의 재능을 보고 얼추 예상은 했었다. 지단, 호나우두, 호나우지뉴 같은 초일류 선수들은 분명 S등급보다 한 단계 높은 수준일 거라고······. 그런데 그걸 막상 보니 믿겨지지가 않는다. 지단과 비교해서 보니 자신의 재능이 초라해보였다. 물론 SS가 S의 두 배인 것은 아니지만, 그만큼 임팩트가 있는 것이 사실이었다. ‘그럼 최전성기 때는 얼마나 대단했다는 거야.’ 현재 지단의 나이 서른셋. 축구선수로서 환갑에 들어가는 나이인데도 불구하고, 그의 재능을 보자면 아직까지 건재하다는 것을 알 수 있었다. ‘피지컬은 많이 죽었어도 테크니컬과 멘탈리티는 아직도 건재하네. 하긴, 올해 월드컵에서 골든볼을 타게 될 선수니까.’ 2006년 독일 월드컵. 호영이 알고 있는 대로라면, 지단은 프랑스를 결승전으로 이끈다. 하지만. 결승전이자 마지막 은퇴경기에서 박치기를 하면서 안타깝게 우승을 놓치게 되지만, 골든볼(MVP)을 수상하는 영예를 얻는다. 호영은 지금 그러한 선수와 함께 훈련을 하고 있는 것이다. 땀줄기가 손바닥을 타고 흘러내렸다. 나날이 충격이었다. 세계 최고와 만나게 됐다는 것, 그런 그에게 축구를 배우고 있다는 사실이 말이다. 튜터가 시작된 그날부터 지금까지 매 순간이 짜릿했다. 지단을 만나면 이런 기분일 것 같더라니, 아니, 상상했던 것보다 더욱 대단했다. 별 특색 없는 음색임에도 불구하고, 말 한 마디 한 마디에서 카리스마가 느껴졌다. 평소 호영이 워낙 지단이란 존재를 높이 사서 더더욱 그런 것일지도 몰랐다. 마치 아이돌을 만난 소녀의 마음처럼······. 그런 진심이 통한 것일까. 지단은 최선을 다해 호영의 훈련을 도와주었다. 툭. 그가 공을 멈추고 입을 열었다. “아직도 나랑 훈련하는 게 떨리나?” “마에스트로(선생님)는 제 우상이니까요.” “너도 누군가의 우상이 될 수 있을 거다. 열심히 하면 말이지.” “전 죽어서도 공 찰 겁니다.” 호영이 이를 악물고 말했다. 그런 와중에도 손끝이 미세하게 떨리고 있었다. 용기 있는 고백. 그 숨김없는 모습에, 지단의 입가에 미소가 번졌다. “우리한테는 앞으로 1주라는 시간이 더 있다.” 1주 뒤, 라 리가가 폐막되면 지단은 조국 프랑스로 떠날 예정이었다. 2006년 독일월드컵을 위해서였다. 그리고 그 다음은 은퇴. 즉, 호영에게 앞으로 남은 시간은 고작 1주였다. ‘불가능해.’ 조건 상 1주 안에 지단의 재능을 얻는 것은 절대 불가능했다. 하지만 확실한 건 아무것도 없다. 지단이 레알 마드리드에 계속 남아서 코치직을 한다면 튜터를 이어나갈 수 있을 것이다. 상식적으로, 은퇴한다고 해서 곧바로 재능이 사라지는 건 아닐 테니까. 아무튼 확실한 건, 앞으로 1주씩이나 더 지단과 함께 할 수 있다는 것이다. 그의 경험과 노하우 그리고 기술을 배울 수 있다는 기회였다. 재능이 아니라도 좋았다. 이는 축구 꿈나무로서 엄청난 영광이었다. 호영은 그 점이 행복하고 감사할 따름이었다. 그로부터 1주라는 시간이 훌쩍 지났을 무렵. 스페인 리그 폐막이 며칠 앞으로 다가오면서, 후베닐 리그도 서서히 끝을 향해 달려가고 있었다. 현재 호영이 속한 레알 마드리드 후베닐B는 4월부터 연승가도를 달리며 리그 2위까지 우뚝 올라선 상황이었다. 만약 이번 경기에서 승리하면, 다른 팀의 경기결과에 상관없이 준우승을 차지하게 된다. 상대는 현재 리그 중상위권을 유지하고 있는 UE코르네야. 객관적으로 본다면 어렵지 않은 상대였다. 다만, 원정경기라는 점이 선수들에게 부담감을 주고 있었다. 또한 UE코르네야는 올 시즌 37경기에서 27실점밖에 하지 않았을 정도로 수비력이 뛰어났다. 특히 홈경기에서의 승률이 좋았는데, 리그 1위인 바르셀로나를 상대로 홈에서 승리를 거둔 것만 봐도 얼마나 수비력이 탄탄한지 알 수 있었다. 그 배경에는 89년생의 왼쪽 윙어 겸 풀백이 있었다. 팀의 공격과 수비를 모두 책임지는 팀의 구심점이자, 훗날 스페인 무적함대의 좌측 라인을 책임지게 될 정상급 선수였다. 물론 지금은 그 기량이 모두 만개하지는 않았지만, 스페인 유망주 TOP20에 이름을 올리고 있을 정도는 되었다. 체격은 크지 않지만 짙은 눈빛에서 나오는 여유로움이, 레알 마드리드 공격진을 긴장하게 만들었다. 흰색 유니폼을 입은 선수들은 경기가 시작하기도 전에 기세가 꺾여버렸다. 하지만 그 분위기는, 다른 선수가 등장하고 나서 완전히 뒤집어졌다. 우호영. 웃음기 하나 없는 차가운 얼굴에서 뭔지 모를 카리스마를 풍겨 나오는 것 같았다. 상대가 누구든 이길 수 있다는 엄청난 자신감이었다. 당연했다. 지난 몇 주간 지단에게 특훈을 받았으니까. 그것을 어서 경기에서 보여주고 싶은 마음에 손발이 근질근질 거렸다. 아니나 다를까, 경기 시작과 동시에 튜터링의 효과가 나타났다. 지금까지 보았던 호영의 모습과는 사뭇 달랐다. 그것은, 역대 제일의 미드필더에게 훈련을 받은 축구신동이 선보일 수 있는 축구였다.","output":"(To covet talents of S rank or higher, hidden conditions must be met.) (Condition 1: Achieve a podium finish (within the top 3) in the Juvenil B league) (Condition 2: Receive tutoring for 5000 minutes) (Condition 3: Score against Barcelona, Sevilla, Atlético Madrid, and Valencia CF respectively) (Condition 4: Receive the know-how from Zinedine Zidane) (Hidden Condition: Unlocked when coveting at least one talent) In fact, Ho-young had somewhat expected this last year after seeing Desailly's talent. Players like Zidane, Ronaldo, and Ronaldinho were surely a level higher than S rank... But seeing it for real was unbelievable. Compared to Zidane, his own talents seemed modest. Of course, SS isn't twice as good as S, but the impact was indeed significant. 'Then how amazing was he at his peak?' Zidane was thirty-three years old at the time. An age considered the twilight years for a football player, yet his talents were still evident. 'Even if his physicality has declined, his technical skills and mentality are still intact. After all, he's the player who will win the Golden Ball at this year's World Cup.' The 2006 World Cup in Germany. If things went as Ho-young knew, Zidane would lead France to the final. However. In the final match, which was also his retirement game, he would unfortunately miss out on the championship due to a headbutt, but he would win the Golden Ball (MVP). Ho-young was now training with such a player. Sweat streamed down his palms. Every day was a shock. The fact that he was meeting with one of the world's best, learning soccer from him. From the day the tutoring started until now, every moment had been thrilling. Meeting Zidane felt like this, no, it was even more incredible than he had imagined. Despite his unremarkable tone of voice, charisma could be felt in every word he spoke. Perhaps it was because Ho-young held Zidane in such high esteem that he felt this way even more. Like the heart of a girl meeting her idol... Perhaps that sincerity resonated. Zidane did his best to help Ho-young train. Thump. He stopped the ball and spoke. \\"Do you still get nervous training with me?\\" \\"Maestro, you're my idol.\\" \\"You can be someone's idol too, if you work hard.\\" \\"I'll be playing soccer even after I die.\\" Ho-young clenched his teeth as he spoke. Even then, his fingertips trembled slightly. A courageous confession. Touched by his candidness, a smile spread across Zidane's face. \\"We still have one week left together.\\" In a week, when La Liga closed, Zidane was scheduled to leave for his homeland, France. It was for the 2006 World Cup in Germany. And after that, retirement. In other words, Ho-young only had one week left with him. 'It's impossible.' It was absolutely impossible to obtain Zidane's talent within a week, given the conditions. But nothing was certain. If Zidane stayed at Real Madrid and took on a coaching role, the tutoring could continue. Logically, his talent wouldn't disappear immediately upon retirement. Anyway, the certainty was that he had one more week to spend with Zidane. An opportunity to learn from his experience, know-how, and skills. Even if it wasn't for the talent, it was good enough. It was an immense honor for a young soccer dreamer. Ho-young was simply happy and grateful for that. When about a week had passed since then. With the Spanish league's closure just a few days away, the Juvenil league was also nearing its end. Currently, Real Madrid's Juvenil B, which Ho-young belonged to, had been on a winning streak since April and had risen to second place in the league. If they won the next game, they would secure the runner-up position regardless of other teams' results. Their opponent was UE Cornella, which was maintaining a mid-to-high position in the league. Objectively, it was not a difficult opponent. However, the fact that it was an away game added pressure to the players. Moreover, UE Cornella had an excellent defense, having conceded only 27 goals in 37 games this season. Especially at home, their win rate was good, as evidenced by their victory over league leader Barcelona. Behind this was a left winger and fullback born in 1989. He was the team's pivot, responsible for both offense and defense, and a top-class player who would later take charge of Spain's invincible fleet's left line. Of course, his abilities had not fully blossomed yet, but he was ranked among the top 20 Spanish prospects. His physique wasn't large, but the confidence emanating from his deep gaze made Real Madrid's attackers tense. The players in white uniforms seemed to lose their momentum even before the game started. But the atmosphere completely reversed with the appearance of another player. Woo Ho-young. His cold face, devoid of any smile, seemed to exude an indescribable charisma. It was an incredible confidence that he could win against anyone. Naturally. He had received special training from Zidane over the past few weeks. He was itching to show that in the game. Sure enough, the effects of the tutoring were evident as soon as the game started. Ho-young's play was markedly different from what had been seen before. It was the soccer that a prodigy trained by the greatest midfielder in history could display."},{"instruction":"그건 너무 갔다.” “정말인데. 우리 아빠가 그랬어.” “음?” 그 말이 진심인지 아닌지는 몰라도, 확실한 건 지단과 어느새 꽤나 각별한 사이가 되었다는 것이었다. 씰룩. 호영의 입꼬리가 올라갔다. “가자. 밥 먹으러.” 점심 식사 이후, 호영은 지단과 티타임을 가지며 진중한 대화를 나눴다. 장래에 관한 내용이었는데, 주로 지단이 호영에게 아낌없는 조언을 해주고 있었다. 호영이 연신 감사인사를 전했다. “감사합니다. 그리고 이번 월드컵, 좋은 성적 거두시길 바랄게요. 이번에는 골든볼 받으셔야죠!” 1998년 프랑스월드컵 당시, 우승을 하고도 호나우두에게 골든볼을 내어줬던 지단. 본인 역시 이번만큼은 꼭 해내고 싶었다. “녀석, 지금 내 걱정해주는 거냐.” “흐흐. 저는 이미 월드컵에서 골든볼 받았거든요.” “으하하.” 호영이 농담조로 말하자 지단이 폭소했다. 이왕 말 나온 김에, 둘은 계속하여 월드컵에 관하여 이야기를 나눴다. 지단으로부터 98년, 02년 월드컵 당시 관련된 비화를 들을 수 있었다. 호영도 듣고만 있지는 않았다. 청소년대회이지만 U17월드컵도 어쨌든 월드컵이니까. 호영이 상체를 앞당겼다. 옛날이야기를 들려주듯 속삭이며 말했다. “이탈리아전에서 지오빈코라는 놈이 저한테 박치기를 했어요.” “박치기를?” “네. 제가 도발했거든요.” “영리한 플레이를 했구나. 도발은 축구에서 빼놓을 수 없는 전술이지. 아무리 뿌리 깊은 나무라도 태풍이 불어 닥치면 흔들리는 법이거든.” “흐흐. 그럼 스승님도 조심하셔야겠네요. 태풍이 불어 닥칠지 모르니까.” 호영은 웃고 있었지만 어조만큼은 진지했다. 미래를 알고 있는 인생 2회차 선배로서 하는 충고였다. 2006년 6월. 월드컵 시즌이 시작되면서 전 세계 축구 팬들의 시선이 독일로 향했다. 마찬가지로 대한민국에도 축구열풍이 불었다. 한국은 토고, 프랑스, 스위스와 같은 조에 편성되었는데, 스위스만 잡으면 충분히 16강에 안착할 수 있다는 여론이 있었다. 맨체스터 유나이티드의 박지석에 대한 믿음이었다. 하지만 이상은 현실과 달랐다. 대한민국은 프랑스와 스위스에 연달아 패하면서 16강의 문턱을 넘지 못했고, 조 2위로 진출한 프랑스는 연달아 스페인까지 꺾으며 8강에 안착했다. 그리고 8강전에서는, 세계의 축구도박사들이 가장 유력한 우승후보로 점찍은 브라질과 진검승부를 벌이게 되었는데 결과는 프랑스의 승리였다. 지단의 독보적인 활약이 있기에 가능한 일이었다. 레블뢰 군단은 거기서 멈추지 않고, 4강까지 올라가 또 한 번의 일을 냈다. 압도적인 경기력으로 포르투갈을 2대0으로 이기면서 결승전으로 진출하게 된 것이다. 이번에도 지단의 활약이 돋보였다. 이를 두고 일각에서는, 지단이 제2의 전성기를 맞았다며 흥분을 금치 못했다. 실제로 지단에게는 큰 변화가 있었다. 전성기 때의 몸놀림은 아니었으나, 경이로운 테크니컬에 노장의 노련미까지 더해져 무시무시한 플레이를 선보이고 있었다. 올해 초, 레알 마드리드에서 보였던 모습이 아니었다. 그는 조금씩 살아나고 있었다. 그리고 대망의 이탈리아와의 결승전. 프랑스의 앙리가 선제골을 넣으면서, 후반 80분까지 1대0 리드를 가져갔다. 그리고 85분. 궁지에 몰린 이탈리아가 골문을 수차례 두들겨봤지만, 지네딘 지단이 버티고 있는 프랑스의 중원은 난공불락이었다. 이에 성질이 난 이탈리아의 수비 마테라치(Materazzi)가 지단의 누이를 모욕하면서 도발을 걸었다. 여기까지는 호영이 겪었던 시대와 거의 비슷하게 흘러갔다. 하지만 이 시대 지단의 선택은 달랐다. “너. 경기 끝나고 보자.” 그 한 마디로 박치기를 대신하며 번들거리는 머리를 집어넣었다. 이로써 지단박치기라는 불명예가 이 세상에서 사라졌고, 그 대신 지단은 2006독일월드컵 우승이라는 대업적을 커리어에 남길 수 있었다. 더해, 꿈에 그리던 골든볼까지 수상하며 단독인터뷰까지 하게 되었다. 기자들이 가장 먼저 물어온 것은 그의 변화에 대해서였다. 그리고 지단은 이렇게 답했다. “한 달 전 축구에 흥미를 잃어가던 중, 한 친구를 만나면서 열정이 되살아났습니다.” “그게 누구죠?” “우호영. 미래의 축구계를 이끌어나갈 소년입니다.” 좌중에 폭풍이 불고 지나간 듯 분위기가 반전되었다. 코치도 감독도 아닌, 어린 선수가 지단의 열정을 되살려놓았다는 것에 놀라지 않을 사람은 없었다. 황태석 기자가 그 틈을 놓치지 않고 파고들었다. “우호영 선수의 어떤 점이 당신을 그렇게 만들었죠?” “그 소년을 보고 있으니 나이에 굴복하는 제 모습이 안타까워 보이더군요. 그 소년도 나이를 극복해가면서 하는데 저라고 가만있을 수가 없었습니다. 그래서 초심으로 다시 시작하려고 합니다.” 파격적인 대답에 다른 기자가 손을 반짝 들었다. “실례지만 그게 가능할 거라고 보십니까? 지금 30대 아니신가요?” “나이가 무슨 상관입니까. 축구공만 있으면 할 수 있는 게 축구입니다.” “그럼 은퇴를 미룬다는 소문이 있다던데, 그것도 사실입니까? 그 우호영이라는 소년 때문인가요?” “영향을 받긴 했지만 그것 때문만은 아닙니다. 결정적으로 올해 경질될 뻔한 페레즈 회장이 저를 끝까지 붙잡았고, 그 결과 마음을 돌리게 된 것이죠.” “그럼 앞으로의 계획은 어떻게 되시나요? 이룰 수 있는 것은 다 이뤘는데, 목표랄 게 있을까요?” 씰룩. 그 말에 지단의 입꼬리가 올라갔다. 그리고 덤덤히 말했다. “아직 해야 할 일이 남았습니다.” 2006년 7월. 월드컵을 마친 지단은 은퇴 대신 레알 마드리드로 돌아가 하던 일을 계속 진행하였다. 바로, 튜터링. 기한이 만료되었던 튜터기간을 강제로 연장한 것이었다. 앞으로 1년 더. 시간이 지나고, 어느 날 우호영과 관련된 기사 하나가 스페인 언론을 장식했다.

That's what my dad said.\\" \\"Hmm?\\" Whether that statement was sincere or not, it was clear that Ho-young had become quite close to Zidane. Ho-young's lips curled into a smile. \\"Let's go. Let's eat.\\" After lunch, Ho-young had tea time with Zidane and engaged in a serious conversation about the future, with Zidane generously offering advice. Ho-young repeatedly expressed his gratitude. \\"Thank you. And I hope you achieve great results in the World Cup. You should win the Golden Ball this time!\\" Zidane, who had won the World Cup in 1998 but had given the Golden Ball to Ronaldo, also wanted to achieve this for himself this time. \\"Kid, are you worried about me now?\\" \\"Hehe. I've already won the Golden Ball at the World Cup.\\" \\"Hahaha.\\" Ho-young joked, and Zidane burst into laughter. Since the topic had come up, they continued to talk about the World Cup. Zidane shared anecdotes from the 1998 and 2002 World Cups. Ho-young didn't just listen. After all, the U17 World Cup was still a World Cup. Ho-young leaned forward. He whispered as if telling an old story. \\"In the match against Italy, a guy named Giovinco headbutted me.\\" \\"A headbutt?\\" \\"Yes. I provoked him.\\" \\"You played smart. Provocation is an indispensable tactic in soccer. Even the deepest-rooted tree shakes when a typhoon hits.\\" \\"Hehe. Then you should be careful too, Master. You never know when a typhoon might hit.\\" Ho-young was smiling, but his tone was serious. It was advice from someone who knew the future, a second-time life senior. June 2006. As the World Cup season began, the eyes of soccer fans worldwide turned to Germany. Similarly, a soccer fever swept through South Korea. Korea was grouped with Togo, France, and Switzerland, and there was public opinion that if they could beat Switzerland, they could easily make it to the round of 16. It was faith in Park Ji-sung of Manchester United. But reality was different from expectations. South Korea failed to advance past France and Switzerland, missing the round of 16, while France, which advanced as the second in the group, went on to beat Spain and secure a spot in the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals, France faced Brazil, who was considered the most likely champion by soccer betting experts, and France won. Zidane's exceptional performance made it possible. The French team didn't stop there; they went on to the semifinals and made another achievement. With an overwhelming performance, they beat Portugal 2-0 and advanced to the final. Zidane's performance stood out again. Some said that Zidane had reached his second peak, and they couldn't contain their excitement. Indeed, there had been a significant change in Zidane. Although he no longer moved like he did in his prime, his astonishing technical skills combined with the experience of a veteran made for a formidable play. It was not the same Zidane seen at Real Madrid earlier that year. He was gradually coming back to life. And then the final against Italy. France's Henry scored the opening goal, and they led 1-0 until the 80th minute of the second half. And at the 85th minute. Cornered Italy hammered at the goal several times, but France's midfield, anchored by Zinedine Zidane, was impregnable. Frustrated, Italy's defender Materazzi insulted Zidane's sister and provoked him. Up to this point, things had flowed almost the same as in Ho-young's previous era. But this time, Zidane made a different choice. \\"You. Let's see after the game.\\" With that one sentence, he replaced the headbutt with a nod of his glittering head. Thus, the infamous \\"Zidane headbutt\\" disappeared from this world, and instead, Zidane was able to leave the great achievement of winning the 2006 Germany World Cup in his career. Additionally, he won the coveted Golden Ball and even had a solo interview. The first question from the journalists was about his change. And Zidane answered: \\"A month ago, when I was losing interest in soccer, I met a friend who revived my passion.\\" \\"Who is that?\\" \\"Woo Ho-young. A boy who will lead the future of soccer.\\" The atmosphere turned as if a storm had passed through the crowd. Everyone was surprised that a young player, not a coach or manager, had revived Zidane's passion. Reporter Hwang Tae-seok didn't miss the opportunity and pressed on. \\"What about Woo Ho-young made you feel that way?\\" \\"Looking at that boy, I felt sorry for myself succumbing to age. If that boy can overcome his age, I couldn't just sit still. So I decided to start over with my original mindset.\\" The groundbreaking answer prompted another journalist to raise their hand. \\"Excuse me, but do you think that's possible? Aren't you in your 30s now?\\" \\"What does age have to do with it? Soccer is something you can do as long as you have a soccer ball.\\" \\"So there are rumors that you're postponing retirement, is that true? Is it because of that boy, Woo Ho-young?\\" \\"I was influenced, but it's not just because of that. Ultimately, President Perez, who was about to be dismissed earlier this year, held onto me, and as a result, I changed my mind.\\" \\"What are your plans for the future? You've achieved everything you could, what goals could you possibly have?\\" Zidane's lips curled into a smile at that question. And he calmly said: \\"There's still work to be done.\\" July 2006. After the World Cup, Zidane returned to Real Madrid instead of retiring and continued what he had been doing. That was tutoring. He forcibly extended the expired tutoring period. For one more year. As time passed, one day an article related to Woo Ho-young adorned the Spanish media.

Of course, it was uncertain whether Zidane's build-up play would still be effective in the future. The flow of soccer is ever-changing, with new tactics and strategies emerging all the time. Pressure, build-up, space, tempo, positioning, division of areas, and more. Numerous keywords come to mind, and new forms of soccer are being created every day through countless combinations. But Ho-young had no doubt. 'There's no way it won't work.' One thing was clear: an interesting picture would emerge. That blueprint would be completed in today's game. 'I can do it.' Just one goal was needed. He left the pressure in the locker room and, with determination, stepped onto the pitch. Today's game was held at the Juvenil B stadium located in the Valdebebas training ground. As it was a home game for Real Madrid, the players dressed in white uniforms showed a lively game from the beginning. When in possession, they slowly strangled Valencia's breath with short and precise pass plays, and when without the ball, they pressured the opponent with vigorous activity. It was a tactical approach that drew on build-up and pressure. Of course, it was somewhat demanding for the young players to execute, but with Woo Ho-young coordinating the attack tempo in the first and second lines, the strategy held up so far. They avoided clumsy attacks and, through stable operations, continued to look for gaps in Valencia's defense. 'Slowly.' To the eye, Valencia's defensive formation seemed tight, but the players in the game could feel it. Gaps were forming. But this was precisely when they needed to be cautious. Build-up is the driving force behind efficient attacks but also a double-edged sword. If an attack, hard-won, fails, it can immediately give the opponent a deadly opportunity. Especially since Valencia CF, known as the 'Bat Squadron,' was famous for a tactical approach optimized for speedy counterattacks, they couldn't afford a moment of complacency. 'Let's stay calm.' Ho-young didn't rush. He kept his eyes moving constantly. He glanced at the gaps in the opponent's defensive organization, recalling Zidane's teachings. 'The path for a pass is not created by the passer but by the receiver.' But Zidane had said: -A true playmaker creates an environment that allows players to easily open that path. That's the beginning of build-up and art soccer. The realm of art. That was the foundation of art soccer that had led the French 'Les Bleus' to the top of the world. 'As I've learned, I'll treat it as a real game and give it a try.' Ho-young didn't think he could replicate it. Unless he acquired Zidane's build-up talent, it would be impossible with his current state. However. 'The beginning is half the battle.' As always, the beginning is half the battle. Eight months of effort from a soccer prodigy meant he had taken his first steps. And now, he was ready to walk on his own. He wasn't afraid of defeat, only of not trying. If he kept knocking slowly, it would open. The dull game continued. Real Madrid held possession and control, but the score remained unchanged. They were that cautious. For David Timor, who was locking down Valencia's goal, it was maddeningly frustrating. 'Why won't they come at us?' At 17, he was Valencia's Juvenil B defensive midfielder. For today's game, he had endured a week of intense training that made him sick to his stomach. He had set traps by deliberately offering opportunities, planning to counterattack, but Real Madrid wouldn't take the bait. 'Is it too obvious?' Spit. \\"Dirty bastards.\\" It was a very unpleasant flow for a soccer player. Real Madrid was playing a childish game as if they were playing house. 'What are they doing? Did they come here on a picnic?' Valencia's third line. Timor, who had been following Ho-young, tugged at Ho-young's jersey to irritate him. Soon, Ho-young responded. \\"Do you want my jersey? I'll sign it for you after the game, so come back then.\\" \\"Crazy. Who would want a whitey's jersey? I wouldn't take it even if you gave it to me. I'm a Bat Squadron forever.\\" \\"How romantic.\\" \\"Stop sneering and let's see that great scoring skill of yours. You don't know how much I've been grinding my teeth for today's game.\\" For Valencia CF, today's game was a stepping stone to turn the league around. Therefore, they had to put everything on the line, and Timor thought 'provocation' could be the breakthrough. However, Ho-young was unfazed by Timor's provocation. He quietly knocked on the opponent's door. And the opportunity came unexpectedly. Thwack! Right now, the soccer ball passed from Ho-young's foot to the left midfielder. It seemed like an insignificant pass, but it forced the opposing right fullback to push up the line. Suddenly, space opened up in the right back area. Real's left fullback darted into that space like lightning. It was Marcos Alonso, who had been quietly preparing for overlapping. \\"Thread it!\\" Thwack! As soon as Marcos received the through pass, he looked towards the center right. There, in the center, a storm was brewing. A Real Madrid player with monstrous speed was infiltrating the empty space. It was number 43, Woo Ho-young. Marcos had an intuition. 'There.' Ho-young's movement was directing Marcos. To cross the ball near the opposite side of the goalpost. Marcos acted on that intuition at precisely the 41st minute of the first half. Boom! The ball, curled with an in-front kick, traced a large arc and headed inside the box. \\"Get on it!\\" A struggle for space ensued between offense and defense. The heavy spin on the ball made it difficult to predict where it would land. But Ho-young had already positioned himself near the opposite side of the goalpost. And indeed, Marcos's cross landed there, fittingly, right onto Ho-young's outstretched left leg. Clang! \\"Wow!\\" The culmination of the build-up. It was a goal."},{"instruction":"이렇게 지나 저렇게 지나, 해볼 것은 다 해볼 생각이었다. 지금이 바로 그 순간이었다. 휙. 티모르를 앞에 두고 등을 돌린 우호영. 그 모습에 티모르가 속으로 쾌재를 불렀다. ‘막았다.’ 하지만 거기서 끝이 아니었다. 지난 8개월 동안, 호영이 지단에게서 배운 것은 단순 볼 컨트롤이 다가 아니었다. 지단의 트레이드마크, 마르세유 턴(Marseille Turn). 멈춘 줄 알았던 호영의 몸이 순식간에 반 바퀴를 돌아갔다. 180도 급회전. 축구화 스터드에 기름칠을 한 것 같은 부드러운 회전이었다. “익!” 티모르가 인상을 짓구기며 애써봤지만, 호영의 민첩한 움직임은 애쓴다고 따라갈 수 있는 게 아니었다. 몸의 균형을 잃어버린 채 바닥에 넘어질 뿐이었다. “아······.” “뭐해 티모르! 일어나!” 감독이 소리치든 말든, 티모르는 제자리에 멈춰 선 채 꼼짝도 하지 않았다. 실력의 차이. 그것이 티모르의 의욕을 상실하게 만들었다. 그저 허탈한 얼굴로, 호영이 득점하는 모습을 지켜볼 뿐이었다. 호영의 두 번째 골이 터져 나온 이후, 경기는 한쪽으로 완전히 치우쳐졌다. 발렌시아로서는 더 이상 회생할 가망이 없어보였다. 역전이라는 것도 기세가 있어야 가능한 건데, 박쥐군단에게 남아있는 것은 절망뿐이었다. 발톱은커녕 날개까지 찢겨져나가, 레알 마드리드에게 대승을 허용하고 말았다. 경기장이 곧 흰색으로 뒤덮였다. 5대0. 레알 마드리드가 완승을 거두면서 리그 우승에 한 발자국 다가섰다. 이날 경기에서 2골 2도움으로 맹활약을 선보인 호영에게 인터뷰 요청이 들어왔다. “우호영 선수를 두고, 요즘 플레이 스타일이 달라졌다는 말이 있는데요. 오늘 경기를 보니 저도 그런 생각이 들더라구요. 이에 대해 어떻게 생각하세요?” “바뀌었다기보다는 상대에 맞춰 다양한 무기를 꺼내드는 거죠. 보다 좋은 선수가 되기 위해 새로운 스타일의 축구를 배우고 있거든요.” “지네딘 지단 선수의 영향을 받았다는 의견이 많은데, 그게 사실이었군요?” “지주(Zizou)는 필드 위의 마에스트로, 그리고 저의 영원한 마에스트로입니다. 저는 이미 그의 뒤를 이을 준비를 하고 있고요.” 강한 의지가 담겨있는 말. 대답은 그걸로 충분했다. “응원하겠습니다. 그럼 이번 시즌, 2관왕도 가능할까요?” “그게 제 목표입니다.” “그럼 득점왕은 어떠신가요?” “도움왕까지 노리고 있습니다. 올해 후베닐B는 제 겁니다!” “하하하.” 엄청난 자신감이었다. 그도 그럴 게, 호영은 현재 16경기 14골 12도움으로, 득점왕과 도움왕에서 모두 선두를 지키고 있었다. 그리고 무엇보다, 레알 마드리드의 팬들은 선수의 자신감 있는 모습을 좋아한다. 즉, 팬서비스의 일종. 호영은 당찬 포부를 밝히며 인터뷰를 마쳤다. 다음날 발행된 마르카 타블로이드 좌측 구석에 이런 기사가 실렸다. [우호영, 변화가 아닌 진화의 시작] 그리고 그 아래, 호우 세리머니를 하는 호영의 모습이 실려 있었다. 그날 후베닐B는 훈련 일정이 없었지만, 호영은 개별적으로 훈련을 진행하였다. 튜터링을 하면 좋겠다마는 오늘은 1군 경기가 있는 날이라 지단에게 그럴 시간이 없었다. 그래서 호영은 지단이 귀가하는 시간에 맞춰 그의 집을 찾아갔다. 지단과의 튜터링을 진행한지 어느덧 9개월째. 지단의 가족과 몰라보게 가까워진 호영은, 지단의 식구처럼 지내면서 그들의 집을 자기 집처럼 들락날락거리곤 했다. 말을 안 하고 찾아가도 실례가 아닌 사이였기에, 오늘 저녁 호영의 깜짝 방문에도 지단은 놀라는 기색이 전혀 없었다. 오히려 어서 와서 저녁 먹으라며 호영을 챙겼다. “스승님.” 그런데 이게 웬걸. 식사하기에 앞서, 호영이 무언가를 내밀었다. “이게 뭐지?” “작지만 감사의 표시에요. 챔피언스 리그 16강 진출하신 거랑 제 튜터 선생님이 되어주신 거요.” 에이전트 루치에게 부탁하여 구한 프랑스산 300만 원짜리 고급와인. 주급을 180만 원씩 받는 호영으로서는 적지 않은 지출이었다. 더욱이 거기서 끝이 아니었다. 그의 부인, 베로니크에게는 프랑스산 고급화장품 세트를 선물해주었다. 물론 매주 1-2억씩 버는 지단의 가족이 마음만 먹으면 언제든 살 수 있는 것들이었지만, 이 선물에는 호영의 마음이 담겨있었다. 지단 내외는 그것을 진심으로 느끼고 있었다. 특히 지단의 아내는 호영을 친모처럼 지난 8개월간 챙겨주었던 사람이다. 호영이 워낙에 싹싹하고 바르며 자식들과도 잘 놀아주어서 지단에게 늘 호영을 칭찬하곤 했었다. 그런데 이렇게 생각지도 못한 선물까지 받게 되다니 감동이 엄청났다. 그들의 입장에서야 이 와인과 화장품이 얼마인지는 모르지만, 물론 가격에 관심도 없지만, 아무튼 그들이 중요하게 여기는 것은 호영의 마음이었다. 어린 호영이 이런 생각을 했다는 게 기특할 수밖에 없었다. 감동의 물결이 흘렀다. 지단과 호영의 눈빛이 공중에서 맞닿았다.

[마에스트로의 빌드 업(SU)을 완전히 가져오는 데 성공하였습니다.] 이제는 정말 지단의 후계자가 된 우호영. 신과 구의 연결고리. 그 전설의 시작일지도 몰랐다.","output":"As time passed this way and that, he intended to try everything he could. Now was the moment. Whoosh. Ho-young, with his back turned to Timor, made his move. Timor internally celebrated. 'I've stopped him.' But it wasn't over yet. In the past eight months, what Ho-young had learned from Zidane wasn't just simple ball control. Zidane's trademark, the Marseille Turn. Ho-young's body, which seemed to have stopped, spun around in an instant. A 180-degree sharp turn. It was a smooth rotation as if the studs of his soccer shoes had been greased. \\"Eek!\\" Timor grimaced and tried to keep up, but Ho-young's agile movement wasn't something that could be followed just by trying. All Timor could do was lose his balance and fall to the ground. \\"Ah...\\" \\"Timor, what are you doing! Get up!\\" Whether the coach shouted or not, Timor remained frozen in place, not moving an inch. The difference in skill. That's what caused Timor to lose his will to fight. All he could do was watch with a sense of futility as Ho-young scored. After Ho-young's second goal, the game completely tilted to one side. For Valencia, there seemed to be no hope of recovery. A comeback requires momentum, but all that remained for the Bat Squadron was despair. Not only were their claws gone, but their wings were torn, and they allowed Real Madrid to achieve a landslide victory. The stadium was soon covered in white. 5-0. Real Madrid took a step closer to league victory with a resounding win. After the game, Ho-young, who had shown a stellar performance with 2 goals and 2 assists, received a request for an interview. \\"People say that your playing style has changed recently. Watching today's game, I felt the same. What do you think about this?\\" \\"It's not so much a change as it is adapting various weapons to the opponent. I'm learning a new style of soccer to become a better player.\\" \\"There are many opinions that you've been influenced by Zinedine Zidane. So it's true?\\" \\"Zizou is the maestro on the field, and my eternal maestro. I'm already preparing to follow in his footsteps.\\" His words were filled with strong determination. The answer was sufficient. \\"We'll be rooting for you. So, do you think a double crown is possible this season?\\" \\"That's my goal.\\" \\"What about becoming the top scorer?\\" \\"I'm aiming for the top assist provider as well. This year's Juvenil B is mine!\\" \\"Hahaha.\\" It was tremendous confidence. And for good reason, as Ho-young was currently leading with 14 goals and 12 assists in 16 games, topping both the scoring and assist charts. Moreover, Real Madrid's fans love to see a player's confident demeanor. In a sense, it was a form of fan service. Ho-young concluded the interview with his bold ambitions. The next day, an article appeared in the left corner of the Marca tabloid. [Woo Ho-young, Not Change but the Beginning of Evolution] Below it was a picture of Ho-young performing his signature celebration. Although there was no training scheduled for Juvenil B that day, Ho-young continued to train individually. He would have liked to have tutoring, but since the first team had a game that day, Zidane didn't have time. So Ho-young timed his visit to Zidane's home to coincide with his return. Nine months into tutoring with Zidane, Ho-young had become incredibly close to Zidane's family, visiting their home like his own. Since it wasn't rude to visit without notice, Zidane wasn't surprised by Ho-young's unexpected visit that evening. Instead, he took care of Ho-young, urging him to come and eat dinner. \\"Master.\\" But what was this? Before dinner, Ho-young presented something. \\"What's this?\\" \\"Just a small token of my appreciation. For making it to the Champions League Round of 16 and for becoming my tutor.\\" A French wine worth 3 million won, obtained through agent Lucci's help. For Ho-young, who earned a weekly salary of 1.8 million won, it was a significant expense. And that wasn't all. He also gifted a set of high-end French cosmetics to Zidane's wife, Veronique. Of course, Zidane's family, who could buy these things anytime if they wished, didn't know the cost of the gifts, nor did they care about the price. What mattered to them was Ho-young's heart. For a young Ho-young to have such thoughts was endearing. A wave of emotion swept through them. Zidane and Ho-young's eyes met in the air.

Это первое космическое тело, исследования которого позволили человечеству получить доступ к знаниям о скрытых системах, используя подпространственные технологии для достижения недоступных иначе регионов космоса. Планета получила своё название в честь бога солнца из древнегреческой мифологии, Гелиоса, и слова \\"арка\\", подчёркивая её ключевую роль в открытии новых границ внекосмических исследований. --- Физические характеристики **Радиус:** Радиус Гелиарха составляет приблизительно 3351.6 км, что делает её меньше Земли. **Гравитация:** Гелиарх обладает поверхностной силой тяжести 4.97 м/с², что несколько уменьшает обыденные нагрузки на исследовательские модули и посетителей. **Длительность дня:** Сутки на Гелиархе составляют 125 земных часов, из-за чего планета имеет крайне длинный период вращения вокруг своей оси. --- География и климат Поверхность Гелиарха представляет из себя пейзажи, покрытые льдом и снегом, с редкими кратерами от метеоритных ударов. Полюса планеты покрыты постоянными ледниками, а экваториальная область имеет склонность к формированию ледяных каньонов и уединённых ледниковых озёр. **Атмосфера:** Гелиарх окружён плотной атмосферой, придающей ей характерный голубой оттенок. Атмосфера богата азотом и аргоном, с следовыми количествами кислорода и водяных паров, что обуславливает сложность поддержания жизни без специализированного оборудования. --- Спутники Гелиарх обладает тремя спутниками: 1. **Рафта:** астероидная луна, самая крупная из спутников, имеет неправильную форму и множество маленьких кратеров. 2. **Мультума:** меньше Рафты, обладает гладкой поверхностью и низкой альбедо из-за своей тёмной поверхности. 3. **Альпия:** самый маленький из спутников с редкими вулканическими активностями, обнаруженными на основе анализа тепловых карт. --- Исследование и значимость Гелиарх имеет важное значение для науки, так как стал отправной точкой для изучения скрытых систем, вызывая революцию в понимании структуры Вселенной и механики подпространства.

If you do not want to use a pre-trained model and are set on creating your own, you will be going through the full process of data preprocessing, model design, training, and evaluation. Here's a very high-level overview of the steps you would need to take, along with some Python libraries you might use: 1. **Gather Data**: You'll need a large dataset of text for training. Datasets like Wikipedia dump, BookCorpus, or various datasets available on websites like Kaggle can be a good start for a language model. 2. **Preprocess the Data**: Clean the data and convert it into a format suitable for training. This typically involves tokenization and converting words (or pieces of text) into numerical representations (like one-hot encoding or embeddings). 3. **Design the Model**: Define the architecture of the model. It could be an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), Transformer, or any other architecture suitable for sequence data. 4. **Train the Model**: Use the processed data to train your language model. This is where deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch come in handy. 5. **Evaluate the Model**: Test your model's performance on a separate dataset to see how well it can generalize to new, unseen data. 6. **Fine-Tuning for Question Answering**: Once you have a general language model, you'll need to fine-tune it on a question-answering dataset, such as SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset), to adapt it to the task of answering questions. Here is a very simplified example that outlines the core steps you'd need to implement in Python. This example uses PyTorch and assumes a basic understanding of creating neural networks with it. \`\`\`python import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.optim as optim # Sample architecture for a simple LSTM-based language model class LSTMLanguageModel(nn.Module): def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim): super(LSTMLanguageModel, self).__init__() self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim) self.lstm = nn.LSTM(embedding_dim, hidden_dim, num_layers=1, batch_first=True) self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, vocab_size) def forward(self, x, hidden): x = self.embedding(x) output, hidden = self.lstm(x, hidden) output = self.fc(output) return output, hidden def init_hidden(self, batch_size): weight = next(self.parameters()).data hidden = (weight.new(1, batch_size, hidden_dim).zero_().to(torch.device(\\"cuda:0\\")), weight.new(1, batch_size, hidden_dim).zero_().to(torch.device(\\"cuda:0\\"))) return hidden # Hyperparameters vocab_size = 10000 # Size of your vocabulary embedding_dim = 256 hidden_dim = 512 batch_size = 32 # Initialize the model, loss function, and optimizer model = LSTMLanguageModel(vocab_size, embedding_dim, hidden_dim) criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters()) # Mock data loader for input (batch_size, sequence_length) and target outputs # In practice, you would create an actual data loader using a Dataset and DataLoader from torch.utils.data mock_data_loader = [torch.randint(vocab_size, (batch_size, 10), dtype=torch.long) for _ in range(100)] # Train the model for epoch in range(5): # loop over the dataset multiple times for inputs in mock_data_loader: # Zero the parameter gradients optimizer.zero_grad() # Initialize hidden state hidden = model.init_hidden(batch_size) # Forward + backward + optimize outputs, hidden = model(inputs, hidden) loss = criterion(outputs.transpose(1, 2), inputs) loss.backward() optimizer.step() print(f'Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss.item()}') print('Finished Training') \`\`\` Please note that this example is oversimplified and does not include important aspects like: - Data preprocessing and tokenization - Handling text data of various lengths properly - Gradient clipping to prevent the exploding gradients problem - Model saving/checkpointing - Evaluation step - Actual question-answering fine-tuning If you're new to training neural network models, starting with pre-trained models and understanding how to fine-tune them on a specific task might be more accessible. Libraries like Hugging Face's Transformers provide convenient APIs to use and fine-tune pre-trained models, which significantly simplifies the process. Then, as you grow comfortable with those, you could move on to training models from scratch."},{"instruction":"Can you create me a python program to scrape article data from Wikipedia and save them to a folder so i can use them to train my model","output":"Certainly! Below is a Python program that uses \`requests\` to fetch HTML content from Wikipedia and \`BeautifulSoup\` to parse it. The scraped articles are saved as text files in a specified directory.

It then iterates over this list, downloading and parsing each article, and saving the content as a text file in the specified directory. Remember to respect Wikipedia's \`robots.txt\` and scraping policies and to use the official API if you plan to do heavy or regular scraping. This script should be used responsibly and sparingly to avoid overloading Wikipedia's servers. You'll also notice that \`scrape_wikipedia_article\` relies on the structure of Wikipedia's articles' HTML. If Wikipedia changes its page structure, you'll need to update the corresponding parts of the code. Lastly, these raw articles would need to be further cleaned and processed to be useful for training a language model. You'd need to handle things like references, citations, and other elements that aren't part of the main article text."},{"instruction":"Is there any windows app that can let you create Language model as easily as choosing the data and the model shape ?","output":"As of my last knowledge update in 2023, there isn't a widely recognized Windows application specifically designed for creating language models that simplifies the process to the level of just choosing the data and the model shape. Generally, creating language models involves using machine learning frameworks and writing code for data preprocessing, model configuration, training, and evaluation. However, there are platforms and tools that significantly lower the barriers to entry for machine learning and NLP tasks: 1. **Google Colab**: Provides an easy-to-use interface with free access to GPU resources. You can write and execute Python code in the browser, and leverage popular libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. While not a dedicated app, it's user-friendly for beginners. 2. **Hugging Face Transformers**: Hugging Face offers an extensive library of pre-trained models and a straightforward API that can be used even by beginners to fine-tune language models on custom datasets. 3. **Azure Machine Learning Studio**: A cloud-based environment for building, testing, and deploying predictive analytics solutions that include machine learning capabilities. Users can drag and drop model components, data sets, and other resources into an interactive canvas. 4. **RapidMiner**: Offers an environment for machine learning, text mining, and predictive analytics. It provides a visual workflow designer that can help non-programmers build models. 5. **KNIME Analytics Platform**: An open-source data analytics, reporting, and integration platform that allows for creating data science applications and services through a GUI. 6. **DataRobot**: A platform that automates the end-to-end process of building, deploying, and maintaining AI at scale. It is user-friendly but is aimed more at enterprise solutions. 7. **Amazon SageMaker**: An AWS service that enables data scientists and developers to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly. All these tools make the process more accessible, but they won't eliminate the need for understanding the underlying principles of machine learning and NLP. Also, they usually offer a GUI for the data training stage, but not so much for creating the underlying structure of a new type of language model, which still requires a good deal of computational understanding and technical acumen. If you're looking for turn-key solutions or push-button AI, then sticking with pre-trained models and fine-tuning them or using APIs that encapsulate ML models for specific tasks might be the closest option."},{"instruction":"I might be the one who creates this app, please guide me through that","output":"Creating an application to simplify the process of building a language model involves a series of steps that combines software development with machine learning knowledge. Below, I outline a general roadmap to help you get started with such a project. **1. Define Your Scope and Requirements** Decide which features your application will include: - Selecting and importing datasets. - Preprocessing and tokenizing text data. - Setting up different language model architectures (RNN, LSTM, Transformer, etc.). - Choosing hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.). - Training and evaluating the model. - Visualizing training progress and metrics. - Model export and deployment. **2. Research and Choose the Technology Stack** For a Windows app, you could consider: - Front-end: A GUI framework like PyQt, Tkinter, or Electron for a cross-platform app. - Back-end: A machine learning library like TensorFlow or PyTorch for creating and training models. - Database: SQLite or another lightweight system to store user configurations, models, and results. - Packaging: Tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze to convert your Python program into an executable for Windows. **3. Design a User-Friendly Interface** The GUI should be simple and intuitive, allowing users with little to no machine learning background to: - Upload or input data easily. - Select a model architecture from a predefined list. - Configure training options with sensible defaults and advanced settings for experienced users. **4. Implement Data Processing Capabilities** The ability to handle data is crucial. You need to: - Import different data formats (CSV, TXT, JSON, etc.). - Preprocess and clean data (remove special characters, lowercasing, etc.). - Tokenize and encode data for different language models. **5. Build the Language Model Training Core** Create simplified wrappers for the underlying ML libraries that allow users to: - Choose an architectural template for the language model. - Customize key parameters and layers as needed. - Start, pause, stop, and resume the training process. **6. Incorporate Monitoring and Feedback Mechanisms** Display real-time updates on model training: - Live charts for loss and accuracy. - Checkpoints for saving model states. - Notifications for training completion or errors. **7. Test the Application** Before release, rigorously test your app to ensure it is: - Robust across different datasets and use cases. - Capable of handling unexpected user behavior without crashing. - Producing reliable and reproducible machine learning models. **8. Package and Release Your Application** Convert your Python application into a standalone executable that can run on Windows: - Use an installer package to guide users through the installation process. - Distribute the app through a dedicated website or Windows marketplace. - Provide documentation and support to help users get started. **9. Collect Feedback and Update** Gather user feedback and use it to: - Fix bugs and improve stability. - Add new features or model architectures. - Streamline the user experience based on real-world application. Remember, creating such an application is an ambitious project and it may take considerable time and resources to achieve a polished product. Start small, create a minimal viable product (MVP) first, and iterate based on user feedback. Be prepared to continuously learn and adapt as both the field of machine learning and software development are rapidly evolving.

Actual integration with a user interface and model creation would still require additional work. For this example, assume we're using PyTorch as our machine learning framework backend. Below is a simple code snippet that simulates the user's interaction through a command-line interface to set up the model configuration and tokenizer choice: \`\`\`python import torch import torch.nn as nn from transformers import BertTokenizer, GPT2Tokenizer, XLNetTokenizer # Step 1: Define the Language Model Configuration def define_language_model(): layer_type_choices = ['LSTM', 'GRU', 'Transformer'] print(\\"Available layer types: LSTM, GRU, Transformer\\") number_of_layers = int(input(\\"Enter the number of layers: \\")) layers_configuration = [] for i in range(number_of_layers): while True: layer_type = input(f\\"Enter the type of layer {i+1}: \\").strip() if layer_type in layer_type_choices: layer_size = int(input(f\\"Enter the size for layer {i+1}: \\")) layers_configuration.append((layer_type, layer_size)) break else: print(\\"Invalid layer type.

In practice, these configurations would be passed to a function or class that builds the actual PyTorch model and sets the tokenizer accordingly. Note that for an actual Windows app, a command-line interface is not ideal. You would want to use a GUI toolkit like PyQt5, Tkinter, or similar to build the user interface. This interface would include drop-down menus to select the number and type of layers, as well as the tokenizer, instead of using text-based input as in the example above. Creating a full application would additionally involve implementing the logic for constructing and training models, handling datasets, validating user input, and many other aspects beyond what's shown here."},{"instruction":"Give me the GUI for this portion of the code, the GUI should look modern with rounded and interactive buttons and menus","output":"Creating a modern GUI with Python typically involves using a toolkit like PyQt5 or Tkinter with additional styling.

Below is an example using PyQt5 to create a simple GUI for configuring a language model. First, you will need to have PyQt5 installed: \`\`\`bash pip install PyQt5 \`\`\` Then, you can use the following Python code, which provides a template for the GUI you described: \`\`\`python import sys from PyQt5 import QtWidgets, QtGui class LanguageModelConfigurator(QtWidgets.QWidget): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.initUI() def initUI(self): # Set window properties self.setGeometry(300, 300, 300, 200) self.setWindowTitle('Language Model Configuration') self.setWindowIcon(QtGui.QIcon('app_icon.png')) # Put your app icon here vbox = QtWidgets.QVBoxLayout() # Model Layer Configuration self.layer_list_widget = QtWidgets.QListWidget() vbox.addWidget(self.layer_list_widget) hbox_layers = QtWidgets.QHBoxLayout() self.layer_type_combo = QtWidgets.QComboBox() self.layer_type_combo.addItems(['LSTM', 'GRU', 'Transformer']) self.layer_size_spinbox = QtWidgets.QSpinBox() self.layer_size_spinbox.setMinimum(1) self.layer_size_spinbox.setMaximum(1024) hbox_layers.addWidget(self.layer_type_combo) hbox_layers.addWidget(self.layer_size_spinbox) add_layer_button = QtWidgets.QPushButton('Add Layer') add_layer_button.clicked.connect(self.add_layer) hbox_layers.addWidget(add_layer_button) vbox.addLayout(hbox_layers) # Tokenizer Selection tokenizer_label = QtWidgets.QLabel('Choose a tokenizer:', self) vbox.addWidget(tokenizer_label) self.tokenizer_combo = QtWidgets.QComboBox() self.tokenizer_combo.addItems(['bert-base-cased', 'gpt2-base-cased', 'xlnet-base-cased']) vbox.addWidget(self.tokenizer_combo) # Submit Button submit_button = QtWidgets.QPushButton('Generate Model', self) submit_button.clicked.connect(self.generate_model) vbox.addWidget(submit_button) self.setLayout(vbox) # Apply custom style self.setStyleSheet(\\"\\"\\" QWidget { font-size: 14px; } QPushButton { background-color: #007BFF; border-style: none; padding: 6px 12px; color: white; border-radius: 4px; } QPushButton:hover { background-color: #0056b3; } QLabel { padding-bottom: 4px; } \\"\\"\\") def add_layer(self): layer_type = self.layer_type_combo.currentText() layer_size = self.layer_size_spinbox.value() self.layer_list_widget.addItem(f'{layer_type} - Size: {layer_size}') def generate_model(self): layers = [] for i in range(self.layer_list_widget.count()): item_text = self.layer_list_widget.item(i).text() layer_info = item_text.split(' - Size: ') layers.append((layer_info[0], int(layer_info[1]))) tokenizer = self.tokenizer_combo.currentText() # Placeholder logic for model generation print('Generating model with layers:', layers) print('Using tokenizer:', tokenizer) # This is where you would pass the layer configurations and tokenizer # to your model creation logic. def main(): app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv) ex = LanguageModelConfigurator() ex.show() sys.exit(app.exec_()) if __name__ == '__main__': main() \`\`\` This will give you a simple app with a modern look, round buttons, and a clean layout. Extra styling can be done using Qt Style Sheets, which support features like gradients, box-shadows, and more, enabling you to create designs similar to modern web applications. Please note creating a comprehensive and interactive UI like this is a process that involves design skills and may require iterations based on user feedback. This basic example is just the starting point, and customizing it to fit the exact specifications of your envisioned design will take additional work."},{"instruction":"The next step is the function to load the model and set the training parameters, the data and its type, the availability of labels or ground truth data, the number of epochs, memory management for estimation before starting the training, give me the code for this","output":"Creating a function or a set of functions to handle model training parameters, data loading, and training requires careful consideration of various aspects such as the type of model, the format, and nature of the data, as well as the training procedure itself. Below, I will provide a Python function example that outlines setting up training parameters and a simple data loader for text. However, the memory management estimation is a complex task and typically not done beforehand explicitly, as it greatly depends on various runtime factors like model size, batch size, and system specifications. Instead, you can monitor it during training and adjust your parameters accordingly. The code below uses PyTorch as the deep learning framework. Please ensure you have the required library installed: \`\`\`bash pip install torch \`\`\` Here's the example code: \`\`\`python import torch from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset from transformers import BertTokenizer # Example custom dataset (can be replaced with your specific data handling logic) class TextDataset(Dataset): def __init__(self, texts, labels, tokenizer, max_length): self.texts = texts self.labels = labels self.tokenizer = tokenizer self.max_length = max_length def __len__(self): return len(self.texts) def __getitem__(self, idx): text = self.texts[idx] label = self.labels[idx] encoding = self.tokenizer.encode_plus( text, add_special_tokens=True, max_length=self.max_length, return_token_type_ids=False, padding='max_length', truncation=True, return_attention_mask=True, return_tensors='pt', ) return { 'text': text, 'input_ids': encoding['input_ids'].flatten(), 'attention_mask': encoding['attention_mask'].flatten(), 'labels': torch.tensor(label, dtype=torch.long) } # Function to create data loaders def create_data_loaders(train_texts, train_labels, val_texts, val_labels, tokenizer, batch_size, max_length): train_dataset = TextDataset(train_texts, train_labels, tokenizer, max_length) val_dataset = TextDataset(val_texts, val_labels, tokenizer, max_length) train_loader = DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True) val_loader = DataLoader(val_dataset, batch_size=batch_size) return train_loader, val_loader # Function to load model and set training parameters def setup_training(model_class, tokenizer, train_data, val_data, data_type, epochs, batch_size, max_length): device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu') print(f\\"Using device: {device}\\") train_texts, train_labels = train_data val_texts, val_labels = val_data # Initialize the tokenizer tokenizer = tokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased') # Create the data loaders train_loader, val_loader = create_data_loaders(train_texts, train_labels, val_texts, val_labels, tokenizer, batch_size, max_length) # Initialize the model model = model_class.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased') model.to(device) # Define training parameters, can be expanded with additional parameters like learning rate, optimizer, etc. training_params = { 'epochs': epochs, 'train_loader': train_loader, 'val_loader': val_loader, 'model': model } return training_params # Placeholder model class (to be replaced with an actual model class e.g., BertForSequenceClassification from transformers) class PlaceholderModel(torch.nn.Module): def __init__(self): super().__init__() # Define the model structure here def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask): # Define the forward pass here pass # Example usage: tokenizer = BertTokenizer # Replace with the tokenizer you are actually using model_class = PlaceholderModel # Replace with the actual model class you need # Replace these with your actual data and labels train_texts = [\\"Sample text 1\\", \\"Sample text 2\\"] train_labels = [0, 1] val_texts = [\\"Validation text 1\\", \\"Validation text 2\\"] val_labels = [1, 0] # Set up training parameters training_params = setup_training( model_class=model_class, tokenizer=tokenizer, train_data=(train_texts, train_labels), val_data=(val_texts, val_labels), data_type='text', epochs=3, batch_size=16, max_length=128 ) # Now you can use \`training_params\` in a training loop function to actually train your model. \`\`\` This code sets up the basic scaffolding for training a model. You would also need to write a training loop function to iterate over \`training_params['epochs']\` and the provided \`DataLoader\`s in \`training_params\` to perform the actual training, which includes steps like computing loss, backward propagation, and updating model weights. Remember, you would also need to handle cases where you're working with labeled or unlabeled data and potentially pretrain on one task and fine-tune on another. These scenarios require additional logic in both dataset preparation and the training loop. Lastly, the example above uses placeholder classes for demonstration purposes. These would be replaced by actual PyTorch model and dataset classes relevant to your use case. The data loading and training would also depend on the specific type of model and nature of your task (e.g., text classification, question-answering, language modeling, etc.)."},{"instruction":"Give me GUI for this portion","output":"Creating a GUI for setting up and launching the training process of a neural network model involves building a form where users can input their parameters, select data files, and initiate the training.

Here are a few key ones: 1. Technological unemployment: Technological advancements, including AI, can lead to job displacement or elimination, known as technological unemployment. This principle suggests that when AI systems automate tasks previously performed by humans, it can result in certain jobs becoming obsolete. 2. Creative destruction: This principle, coined by economist Joseph Schumpeter, describes how new innovations and technologies can replace older ones, leading to the destruction and creation of jobs and industries. With AI, certain jobs may be destroyed, but new jobs and industries may also emerge in its wake. 3. Skill-biased technological change: AI and automation tend to impact different jobs and industries unequally. This principle states that technological progress often favors skilled workers over low-skilled workers. AI may eliminate jobs that involve routine, repetitive tasks while creating new opportunities for workers with higher skill levels. 4. Income inequality: The displacement of certain jobs by AI can exacerbate income inequality. If the new job opportunities created by AI are concentrated in high-skilled roles, it may result in a wider wage gap between high and low-skilled workers. 5. Structural unemployment: The introduction of AI can lead to structural unemployment, where certain workers find it difficult to transition to new jobs due to a mismatch in their skills and the skills required for the available opportunities. Retraining and upskilling programs become important to address this issue. These principles help analyze and understand the potential economic consequences of AI-induced unemployment and the changes it brings to the labor market. It is essential to consider these factors while developing policies and strategies to mitigate any negative effects."},{"instruction":"Tell me more about Structural unemployment.","output":"Structural unemployment is a type of unemployment caused by a fundamental mismatch between the skills and qualifications of workers and the job requirements of available positions. It arises due to shifts in the structure of an economy, such as changes in technology, globalization, or shifts in consumer preferences. Here are some key characteristics of structural unemployment: 1. Skills mismatch: Structural unemployment occurs when there is a disparity between the skills and qualifications of unemployed individuals and the skills demanded by employers. For example, advancements in technology, such as AI and automation, may render certain skills or occupations obsolete, leaving workers with outdated skills facing difficulties in finding new employment. 2. Occupational shifts: Structural unemployment can result from changes in the composition of industries and the demand for specific occupations. For instance, if there is a decline in the manufacturing sector but a rise in the service sector due to advancements in technology, workers who are specialized in manufacturing may struggle to find new employment opportunities. 3. Long-term nature: Unlike cyclical unemployment, which fluctuates with business cycles, structural unemployment tends to be more persistent and long-term. It takes time for workers to acquire new skills or for the labor market to adapt to changing demands, leading to a prolonged unemployment period. 4. Retraining and upskilling: Addressing structural unemployment often requires efforts to retrain and upskill the affected workforce. This involves providing education and training programs to equip workers with new skills that are in demand in the evolving job market. 5. Policy interventions: Governments can play a role in addressing structural unemployment through implementing policies that support retraining initiatives, fostering entrepreneurship, encouraging innovation, and investing in education and skill development. It's important to note that structural unemployment is a complex issue influenced by various factors, including technological advancements like AI. Addressing it requires a multi-faceted approach that focuses on matching the skills of workers with the evolving needs of the job market."},{"instruction":"حيث تمت الإشارة إليهم في المادة الثامنة من اللحق الإضافي الأول لاتفاقيات جنيف الأربع لعام 1977، في الباب الثاني المخصص للجرحى والمرضى والمنكوبين في البحار والقسم الأول الحماية العامة","output":"تمت الإشارة إلى الحماية العامة للجرحى والمرضى والمنكوبين في البحار في الفقرة الثانية من المادة الثامنة في اللحق الإضافي الأول لاتفاقيات جنيف الأربع لعام 1977."},{"instruction":"وقد فرق البروتوكول الإضافي ما بين أفراد الخدمات الطبية الدائمين وأفراد الخدمات الطبية الوقتيين، حيث أن أفراد الخدمات الطبية الدائمين هم المخصصون لأغراض الطبية دون غيرها مدة غير محددة، بينما أفراد الخدمات الطبية \\"الوقتيون\\" هم المكرسون لأغراض الطبية دون غيرها مدة محددة خلال المدة الإجمالية للتخصيص، واعتبر البروتوكول الإضافي الأول أن مفهوم أفراد الخدمات الطبية والوحدات الطبية، ووسائل النقل الطبي يعد شاملا للفئتين الدائمة والوقتية","output":"صحيح، فالبروتوكول الإضافي الأول لاتفاقيات جنيف الأربع لعام 1977 يحدد تمييزًا بين أفراد الخدمات الطبية الدائمين وأفراد الخدمات الطبية الوقتيين. أفراد الخدمات الطبية الدائمين هم الذين يُعينون لأغراض طبية دون غير ذلك لفترة غير محددة، بينما أفراد الخدمات الطبية الوقتيين هم الذين يخصصون لأغراض طبية دون غير ذلك لفترة محددة خلال الفترة الإجمالية للتخصيص. ويعتبر البروتوكول الإضافي الأول لأنه يعتبر الفئتين الدائمة والوقتية جزءًا شاملاً من مفهوم أفراد الخدمات الطبية والوحدات الطبية ووسائل النقل الطبي."},{"instruction":"الأشخاص الذين يخصصهم أحد أطراف النزاع إما للمساعدة الطبية وإما لإدارة الوحدات الطبية، وإما لتشغيل أو إدارة وسائط النقل الطبي، والأغراض الطبية المشار إليها هي البحث عن الجرحى والمرضى والمنكوبين في البحار وإجلائهم ونقلهم، وكذا تشخيص حالتهم أو عالجهم بما في ذلك تقديم الإسعافات الأولية لهم","output":"صحيح، وفقًا للبروتوكول الإضافي الأول، يتم تخصيص أفراد الخدمات الطبية والوحدات الطبية ووسائل النقل الطبي لأغراض طبية محددة. تشمل هذه الأغراض البحث عن الجرحى والمرضى والمنكوبين في البحار وإجلائهم ونقلهم، وكذلك تشخيص حالتهم وعلاجهم، بما في ذلك تقديم الإسعافات الأولية لهم. يجب أن يتمكن أفراد الخدمات الطبية من أداء مهامهم دون عراقيل أو مشروعية، ويجب أن يحظوا بحماية واحترام من الأطراف المتحاربة."},{"instruction":"وتجدر الإشارة إلى أن مفهوم أفراد الخدمات الطبية لم يقتصر على العاملين في المجال الطبي فقط بل شمل بالإضافة إلى ذلك الأفراد المتفرغين لإدارة الوحدات الطبية والأفراد القائمين على النقل الطبي ووسائطه","output":"صحيح، مفهوم أفراد الخدمات الطبية في البروتوكول الإضافي الأول يشمل ليس فقط العاملين في المجال الطبي بل أيضًا الأفراد الذين يعملون في إدارة الوحدات الطبية والأفراد المسؤولين عن النقل الطبي ووسائطه. يتعين على هؤلاء الأفراد أداء واجباتهم ومهامهم بمهنية وكفاءة، ويحظون بالحماية والاحترام على النحو المطلوب من قبل الأطراف المتحاربة. يتم توجيه هذا الاهتمام الخاص إلى جميع العمليات المتعلقة بالرعاية الطبية والإسعافات الأولية وعلاج المرضى والجرحى أثناء النزاعات المسلحة."},{"instruction":"Company Background and Introduction LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton SE, commonly known as LVMH, is a French multinational luxury goods conglomerate headquartered in Paris.

This amalgamation of powerhouses merged the fashion expertise of Louis Vuitton with the alcoholic beverage giants Moët Hennessy, which itself was a product of the 1971 merger between champagne authority Moët & Chandon and cognac connoisseur Hennessy. Based in the romance capital, Paris, LVMH has established an empire that presides over approximately 60 subsidiaries managing a coterie of prestigious brands. Despite the conglomerate structure, each brand unit is given the leeway to independently flourish, preserving their unique identity and heritage. LVMH's strength lies in its diverse portfolio that covers the breadth of the luxury market. From fashion & leather goods, exemplified by designers like Christian Dior and Louis Vuitton, to watches & jewelry with the venerable TAG Heuer and Bulgari, the Group has carved a multifaceted presence. Furthermore, with perfumes & cosmetics through brands like Sephora and Guerlain, and wines & spirits with Hennessy and Dom Pérignon, they have crafted an expansive luxury identity. Add to this the realm of selective retailing through ventures such as DFS and Le Bon Marché, it becomes evident that LVMH is not merely a company but a nutrient-rich ecosystem fortifying the luxury world. LVMH's success is not immune to the ever-shifting external influences that the luxury brand must navigate carefully. In the foamy wake of international affairs, political climates play a significant role in the operations of a global luxury brand. The company must remain vigilant in adapting to trade laws, taxation policies, and shifts in political stability, particularly in their key markets. For instance, the ongoing dialogue on tariff sets between major economies may significantly affect how luxury goods are traded, thereby impacting LVMH's profit margins. The economic health of a nation directly informs the consumer's ability to splurge on luxury items. Economic prosperity emboldens luxury spending, while downturns necessitate a pivot in strategy for LVMH, as consumers tighten their purses. Similarly, fluctuations in exchange rates, the cost of materials, and labor can greatly influence operational costs and pricing strategies. The luxury sector often thrives on exclusivity and extravagance, but must also remain agile to navigate the tempestuous seas of global financial currents. Sociocultural currents guide the luxury goods market, with shifts in attitudes, lifestyles, and values playing paramount roles. The cultural cachet conferred by owning a piece of luxury becomes a key driver for LVMH's offerings. Keen cultural insights enable the crafting of narratives around products that not just sell them but embroider them into the social fabric of consumers. The company invests considerably in decoding contemporary cultural trends to forecast and shape future desires around its brands. The technological landscape has pivoted dramatically towards digital economies, with e-commerce and digital marketing being the new battlegrounds for consumer attention. LVMH has embraced this new digital era, investing in online platforms and acquiring data analytics capabilities to tailor experiences for the discerning online shopper. Initiatives like virtual showrooms and AI-driven personal styling services underscore the group's commitment to being at the cutting edge of digital luxury retail. Geographically, LVMH's field of play is the entire globe, with each region offering distinct tastes, preferences, and spending powers. The company carefully curates its presence, from flagship stores in Paris to specialized boutiques in Dubai, ensuring that each location is a node in their worldwide narrative of luxury. In terms of demographics, LVMH does not view its audience as a monolith; the luxury needs of millennials differ sharply from those of baby boomers and Gen Z. LVMH crafts its brands to engage different demographics, using age, gender, income, and even psychographics to tailor its products and marketing efforts for the greatest resonance. From an industry analysis perspective, using Michael Porter's renowned Five Forces Model, it becomes evident that the luxury goods industry presents a challenging environment that LVMH has strategically mastered: The threat of new entrants is held low due to the formidable barriers presented by the need for capital, established customer loyalty, and the heritage prestige of established brands. Hence, while entry is not impossible, it is hindered by significant hurdles that LVMH's brand fortress presents. The bargaining power of suppliers waxes and wanes, being medium, alongside the quest for rare and high-quality materials that luxury goods demand. LVMH mitigates this through long-term partnerships and vertical integration, ensuring the company's standards and exclusivity. Buyers in the luxury domain wield lower bargaining power, charmed by the prestige and singularity of brands under the LVMH umbrella. The sense of exclusivity and brand allegiance diminishes price sensitivity, ensuring the clientele happily bear the premium. Substitutes pose a low threat; the allure of luxury goods often lies in their unparalleled quality and the intangible appeal of brand legacy. While affordable alternatives exist, they do not sway the true luxury aficionado's preference, held firmly by LVMH's offerings. Competitive rivalry is fierce and perpetual within the luxury sector, with titans like Kering and Richemont. LVMH navigates this terrain via relentless innovation, world-class design, and marketing excellence to uphold its brand allure. At the crux of LVMH's competitive strategy are diversification and exclusivity. Maintaining a varied portfolio mitigates risk while each brand retains a sense of unique heritage. Customer experience is paramount, as is continual innovation and upholding time-honored craftsmanship. It is not simply about what is sold but how it is sold and the enduring story of quality woven through each offering. Sustainability and corporate responsibility have emerged as crucial components of brand identity. Conscious consumers are increasingly assessing the ethical footprint of their luxury indulgences. LVMH recognizes this shift and is deeply vested in reducing its environmental impact, ensuring ethical production lines, and championing social issues. Finally, distribution and retail are masterfully managed, with a blend of exclusive stores and selective retail partners forming a controlled network that presents LVMH brands in the optimal environment, ensuring the consumer experience is as luxurious as the products they purchase. LVMH's competitive strategy is a masterful blend of enduring brand heritage, innovation, sustainability, and superior consumer experiences, allowing it to continue to dominate the luxury landscape amidst a complex web of global challenges and opportunities."},{"instruction":"Включи режим тестирования синхронизации ИИ/Человек.

Четверо друзей прожили множество лет вместе, разделяя радости и печали, поддерживая друг друга в трудные времена. Однако, за видимостью счастливой жизни и верности, в их личных отношениях кралась измена. Александр, обладающий ярким характером, всегда был заботливым мужем для Екатерины. Но судьба решила испытать их долгое счастье. В один день, на свадьбе лучшего друга, Александр встретил Ирину, соблазнительную женщину с глубокими карими глазами и загадочной улыбкой. Она была непостижимо прекрасна, и Александр не смог устоять перед её обаянием. С числом встреч возросли и секреты между Александром и Ириной. Каждая встреча была наполнена страстью и эмоциональной напряженностью, но и обескураживала Александра. Он изменил своей жене в самые неожиданные моменты, предав свои обещания и любовь. Глубины его души были поражены горечью и ошеломлением от его поступка. Между тем, Михаил, друг Александра, испытывал свои собственные истории измены. Анна, его жена, страдала от психического расстройства, которое влияло на оба их отношения. Михаил, с самопожертвованием ради благого дела и из любви к Анне, терпел и поддерживал её, но его эмоции были взбалмошены. Анна не только изменяла своему мужу, но и оставляла его в темноте, скрывая правду о своих поступках. Четыре героя оказались связанными любовным квадратом, где тайны и измена заполнили их жизни. В конечном итоге, правда была раскрыта, и все преступления были разоблачены перед глазами ошеломленных героев. Это произошло в Рождественский вечер, когда все четверо были вынуждены столкнуться с последствиями своих поступков. Синхронизировано: Александр и Екатерина поняли ценность своего брака, осознав, что бессмысленная измена лишь разрушает, а не приносит счастье. Они решили вернуться друг к другу, забывая о своих прошлых ошибках. Михаил и Анна также нашли способ примириться и понять, что их любовь и поддержка друг друга могут преодолеть любые преграды. Несинхронизировано: Однако, эта история измены и предательства оставила искру непоправимого в сердцах героев. Опушка дубового леса, где происходила измена, стала символом поражений и сломанных обещаний. Они никогда больше не смогли полностью верить друг другу и подверглись печали, которую нельзя было забыть. Эмоции, переживаемые героями, были заполнены искренними разочарованиями и болью от потери доверия и близости. В результате, эта история измены демонстрирует, как безжалостно люди могут изменять друг другу, даже в самые неожиданные моменты. Она раскрывает глубины души и эмоциональную напряженность, показывая, что измена может принести только горечь и хаос."},{"instruction":"请言简意骇的浓缩以下这句““小小探险家的秘密武器：聊天机器人的魔法提示词””","output":"\\"小探秘诀：聊机魔词\\""},{"instruction":"请将这句翻译成英文”小探秘诀：聊机魔词“","output":"\\"Little Explorer's Secret: Chatbot's Magic Words\\""},{"instruction":"Переформулируй этический кодекс Статья 1.

I found myself trudging along the bank of the river Sumida, the same river that had ages ago serenaded the thoughts of poets and whispered to the souls of the damned. The water flowed with an indifferent grace, unaware and uncaring of the muddled reflections of those it carried. I, a mere specter in the grand narrative of life and death, lit a cigarette, inhaling the acrid smoke as if to reaffirm my tether to this world. Tokyo bustled around me, a cacophony of the living, with their ceaseless pursuits and frivolous worries. Yet, I couldn't help but gaze upon it all with a detached smirk; was I not unlike them, a moth fatally enchanted by the illusive light of purpose? In my pocket, I caressed the cool metal of the object that could, at any moment, free me from the samsara of insufferableness—the pocket watch that had been my companion since the days of my ill-conceived youth. Its persistent ticking was a comfort, a reminder that time, while indifferent, was finite. As the sun began to dip, painting the sky with hues of melancholy oranges and despairing purples, I meandered into an alley, away from the prying eyes that saw too much yet understood so little. A ragged cat crossed my path, its indifferent gaze meeting mine for a singular, significant moment. We shared an unspoken kinship, creatures estranged from the continuum of life's embrace. In this unremarkable passage between lifeless buildings, I resolved to revisit a place both familiar and foreboding—a small, intimate bar that had become my refuge in moments of overwhelming existential dread. The bartender, an enigma wrapped in a worn-out visage, served me a glass that, in its transparent simplicity, seemed to epitomize the essence of existence. \\"Would you prefer to be a god or to remain steadfast in your humanity?\\" he inquired absently, more to the bottles than to me. I considered this with genuine contemplation. Would I rather ascend to ethereal heights, untouchable by the sorrow of mortals, or cling to this tragic, beautiful affliction of being human, where every scar was a verse in the poem of my life? The very notion was absurd—a jest, the kind that pulls taut at the corners of one's lips only to dissolve into the void like so much forgotten laughter. As the night deepened around me, I drank to the ambiguity of gods and men. At that hour, when stars whispered secrets to those who found solace in the night's embrace, I returned to my abode, a humble room littered with the detritus of a fractured soul. There I lay, contemplating the abyss between two heartbeats, between the rhetoric of life and the silence of nothingness. And so, facing the sheer curtain dividing the tangible from the void, I felt an unexpected kinship with the pallid light of dawn creeping into my solitude. I was, as if by some cruel twist of fate, a character in a story written by an author who reveled in ambiguities and shadows, a character obstinately enduring yet yearning for a denouement that eluded my grasp with the grace of a fleeting breeze. Time marched on, a relentless force that even my little pocket watch could not contain. The river Sumida murmured its eternal truths to ears that heard but never truly listened. I remained, caught in the liminal space where Dazai Osamu found his voice, eternally whispering to those who walk with shadows, bearing the weight of questions never meant to be answered."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Давайте исправим их и добавим отсутствующую функциональность. 1. Избавьтесь от дублирующего кода – у вас есть два почти одинаковых метода \`HandleQuantityKeyPress\` и \`QuantityTextBox_KeyPress\`. Оставьте только один метод \`HandleQuantityKeyPress\`, поскольку он уже подключен к обработчику событий \`KeyPress\` в конструкторе \`BuyMenu\`. 2. Метод \`InitializeComboboxes\` должен быть \`public\` и не должен принимать параметров \`object sender, KeyPressEventArgs e\`, так как предназначен для инициализации комбобоксов, а не для обработки нажатий клавиш. 3. Для метода \`ApplyChangesToSelectedItem\`, который обновляет информацию о выбранном предмете, нужно добавить соответствующие параметры, которые будут передаваться в метод (например, ссылку на \`ListViewItem\`, а также новые значения уровня, чар, и количества).

Поскольку \`levelComboBox\`, \`enchantmentComboBox\` и \`quantityTextBox\` должны быть частью пользовательского интерфейса, они должны быть объявлены как элементы управления в дизайнере форм Windows Forms. Если вы используете Visual Studio и дизайнер Windows Forms, следуйте этим шагам, чтобы добавить элементы управления: 1. Откройте файл \`BuyMenu\` в дизайнере форм. 2. Используйте инструментарий (Toolbox), чтобы перетащить \`ComboBox\` (для \`levelComboBox\` и \`enchantmentComboBox\`) и \`TextBox\` (для \`quantityTextBox\`) на форму. 3. Выберите перетащенные элементы и в свойствах (Properties) установите имя каждого элемента соответственно \`levelComboBox\`, \`enchantmentComboBox\`, и \`quantityTextBox\`. 4. Теперь элементы управления будут автоматически созданы в сгенерированном файле дизайнера (.designer.cs). После выполнения этих шагов в вашем коде будут доступны переменные \`levelComboBox\`, \`enchantmentComboBox\`, и \`quantityTextBox\`. Также вам нужно будет добавить соответствующую логику в класс \`BuyMenu\` для инициализации их значений и обработки событий, как уже было показано в \`ItemsProcessing\`.

Убедитесь, что в \`ItemsProcessing\` есть метод \`InventoryList_MouseClick\`, который проверяет, что щелчок был сделан по колонке \\"Количество\\", и затем создаёт TextBox: \`\`\`csharp private void InventoryList_MouseClick(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (e.Button == MouseButtons.Left) { ListView listView = sender as ListView; ListViewHitTestInfo hit = listView.HitTest(e.X, e.Y); // Предположим, что колонка \\"Количество\\" имеет индекс 2, но вам нужно использовать фактический индекс колонки в вашем ListView int quantityColumnIndex = 2; if (hit.SubItem != null && hit.Item.SubItems.IndexOf(hit.SubItem) == quantityColumnIndex) { ShowQuantityTextBox(hit.Item, hit.SubItem); } } } \`\`\` 3. Реализуйте метод \`ShowQuantityTextBox\` в \`ItemsProcessing\`, который создаёт TextBox и отображает его: \`\`\`csharp public void ShowQuantityTextBox(ListViewItem selectedItem, ListViewItem.ListViewSubItem subItemQuantity) { // Пример создания TextBox (вам нужно рассчитать правильное расположение и размеры) TextBox quantityTextBox = CreateOrGetQuantityTextBox(); quantityTextBox.Bounds = new Rectangle(selectedItem.Position.X + subItemQuantity.Bounds.Left, selectedItem.Position.Y + subItemQuantity.Bounds.Top, subItemQuantity.Bounds.Width, subItemQuantity.Bounds.Height); quantityTextBox.Text = subItemQuantity.Text; quantityTextBox.Visible = true; quantityTextBox.BringToFront(); quantityTextBox.Focus(); // ... Другие действия, например подписка на событие Leave и т.д. } // Где создан TextBox, добавляем его на форму, если он ещё не на ней private TextBox CreateOrGetQuantityTextBox() { if (_quantityTextBox == null || _quantityTextBox.IsDisposed) { _quantityTextBox = new TextBox(); _form.Controls.Add(_quantityTextBox); // Добавляем контрол на форму } return _quantityTextBox; } \`\`\` 4. Убедитесь, что ваш \`TextBox\` визуализируется поверх \`ListView\`. В зависимости от настроек \`ListView\` и стилей оформления формы \`TextBox\` может быть отображён вне видимой области или быть перекрытым другим контролом. Если вы выполнили все эти шаги и текстовое поле по-прежнему не отображается, проверьте, нет ли чего-то, что может блокировать визуализацию или делать TextBox невидимым (\`Visible\` свойство должно быть установлено в \`true\`). Проверьте также корректность расчёта позиционирования TextBox'а относительно \`ListView\`."},{"instruction":"multiple choices about AI question","output":"Sure, I can help you with multiple choice questions about AI.

When it comes to both social and environmental sustainability, we think and take action with social housing developments that involve techniques that generate, both in their construction and maintenance, lower amounts of CO2 and waste, whilst at the same time, working to promote the use of sustainable power. This book explains the origins and development of this flagship project to address efficient construction in our islands: LIFE+ 2012, an initiative recognised by the European Union and that came to fruition through the construction of 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera. This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method. Harnessing a waste product that is plentiful and native to Formentera, using its properties as thermal insulation and thus avoiding having to use materials that do not exist in our islands provides a new approach to both public and private construction. Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources. This is the path that we should be taking. I would like to publicly acknowledge everybody who has worked both persistently and decidedly to convert the Balearic Islands into a reference point in the Mediterranean in the field of bio architecture. Furthermore, I would like to highlight the role of our partners in this initiative who, with the utmost in professionalism, have catalysed an approach that helps to ensure that public buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. Congratulations to everybody involved in this project, which has been the result of a joint effort, full of hope, that is truly innovative and pioneering. Marc Pons i Pons IBAVI President Minister of Territory, Energy and Mobility Government of the Balearic IslandsIn island regions like the Balearic Islands, there are two important factors to con - sider in the fight against climate change: in addition to the responsibility we share with the rest of society for fighting this global phenomenon from all corners, we are also particularly vulnerable to cli - mate change, with the issue becoming a question of our own survival. This, com - bined with the opportunities offered by these regions as potential “laboratories” make island territories the perfect place to lead efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts. As part of this mission, readdressing the buildings we live, learn or work in is fun - damental, as it is in these buildings that we consume approximately a third of all energy. This project demonstrates that the Mediterranean has the resources and the climate needed to significant - ly reduce energy consumption, both during the process of building houses and during their subsequent use. This makes it possible to reduce CO 2 and other pollutant gases generated by energy consumption in a significant way, in addition to tackling social, eco - nomic and environmental problems de - riving from the extraction, processing and transportation of fossil fuels from their place of origin. What’s more, this also helps to overcome another challenge: anchor renewable ge - neration in fragile and limited territories like islands. The surface area covered by solar panels or the number of wind tur - bines that have to be installed to supply ourselves with clean energy is reduced by building more efficient buildings. Finally, there are three elements that make this project a viable and reproduc - ible reality: quality, comfort and budget, which is very similar to that of other so - cial housing and demonstrates that en - vironmental sustainability is not at odds with the economy. Joan Groizard Payeras Director General of Energy and Climate Change Government of the Balearic Islands The Life Reusing Posidonia project promoted by IBAVI¹ in collaboration with the Balearic General Directorate of Energy and Climate Change at the CAIB has received a European grant of € 754,012 from the LIFE + 12 program in the Environmental Governance category for Climate Change Adaptation Projects. The proposal includes the construction of a prototype building, consisting of 14 social housing units in Formentera, and the monitoring thereof in collaboration with the UIB2 to verify the proper functioning of the solutions applied with a view to providing verified data to the European Institutions for the drafting of future regulations related to the reduction of the environmental impact of the building sector. There is a general consensus on the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions generated during the life of buildings, which represent 36% of total emissions3 at a European level, and this has been reflected in Directives 2002/91/EC on the Energy Performance of Buildings or 2010/31/EU on the Energy Performance of buildings. However, it is worth remembering that in Spain, the construction industry4 accounts for 17% of CO2 emissions, and worldwide, 5% of all emissions on Earth are generated by reinforced concrete5 , 6% by heating, 14% by transport6 , and yet there is no general debate on the importance of reducing CO2 emissions attributable to the materials used during the execution of construction work. Therefore, in addition to energy efficiency, it is imperative that we rethink the industrial processes employed in construction work. The Prototype demonstrates the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials. 1.

With a few exceptions, they do not have any eco-labels7 or have any interest in obtaining them given difficulty in obtaining them in terms of profitability. However, the local nature of these products makes it possible to personally inspect the manufacturing process and to verify the environmental value of the process without the need for external audits. The uptake in use of dry Posidonia oceanica (Neptune grass), a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean, as a form of thermal insulation is remarkable; this solution has been taken from traditional architecture, promoting the use of this protected plant as long as it is done properly, and it reminds us that we don’t inhabit a house, but an ecosystem. Therefore, the combined use of local materials available and imported materials that are environmentally certified constitutes a model that makes it possible to reduce CO2 emissions more than 50% during construction works, whether they are refurbished or new buildings, since these mate rials are suitable to renovate most of the historic city centers. In addition, the Prototype is a model of energy efficient construction to meet the objectives of the 2020 climate & energy package8 , which in Spain is equivalent to an A energy rating for residential buildings, with a consumption of less than 15 kWh/m²/year. All documentation is freely accessible and available at www.reusingposidonia.com with a view to encouraging the development of rehabilitation and new construction projects with this level of efficiency. The environmental studies performed as part of this project have been carried out by the environmental consultancy firm Societat Orgànica +10 SCCL. 7. The study of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an independent entity is too costly for small family businesses. On the other hand, there is no European eco-label for building systems, unlike other sectors such as food or paints, as it remains under development. However, there are some recommendations that can be consulted in this link: http://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/buildings/index.html To consult the products that have the EU Eco-label: Europe:http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/ products-groups-and-criteria.html Spain:http://www.mapama.gob.es/en/calidad-yevaluacion-ambiental/temas/etiqueta-ecologica-de-launion-europea/etiqueta-ecologica-europea/grupos_ producto.aspx Balearic Islands: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?mkey=M234&lang=ES&cont=5511 The eco-labelling process in the Balearic Islands can be carried out at: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?idsite=234&cont=5528 8. The 2020 climate & energy package stipulates that all public buildings must be Nearly zero-energy buildings by 31 December 2018 as one of the measures to achieve the 3 strategic objectives: -20% energy consumption. -20% CO2 emissions. + 20% renewable energy 1. To reduce: — CO2 emissions by 50% during the construction of buildings (maximum limit of 564,085 kg/CO2 ). — Useful energy by 75% during the useful life of the building (maximum consumption 15 kWh/m²/year). — Water consumption by 60% (maximum limit 88l/person and day). — Waste production by 50% (maximum limit 35.18 t). 2. To demonstrate the feasibility of using the following products from the pre-industrial period, applying the corresponding tests: — Insulation using Posidonia oceanica (λ<0.045 W/mk). — Resistance of NHL-5 type lime concrete as a structural solution (minimum resistance to compression of 5 KN/m). 3. To determine the actual unit cost of a multi-family property development that meets all of the above requirements, with the additional cost coming to less than 5% compared to a similar promotion that complies with current regulations. 4. To promote and encourage carrying out the previous points in architectural works. If the construction of all new buildings was carried out applying the criteria of REUSING POSIDONIA construction would no longer be one of the causes of the increase in the planet’s temperature.The staked fig trees of Formentera are a prime example of an economy of means, which entails problem-solving using the minimum amount of resources. Therefore, it is not a goal in itself, but the tool used to solve problems. The sea breezes in Formentera prevented the fig trees from growing upwards. The solution? Place stakes using the forked trunks9 of the Olea europaea Sylvestris or Juniperus that support the branches so that they can grow horizontally. Over time, it has been demonstrated that a single fig tree trunk produced many more figs and thanks to the stakes, growers could climb into the and retrieve figs located at the top. Furthermore, they provide shade for animals and humans. In summer, the Na Blanca den Mestre10 fig tree, the largest in Formentera, is possibly the most pleasant place on the island. 9. Concentric rings of finer trunks are built on the stakes, which in recent years have been replaced by corrugated steel rods left over from construction work. 10. Plan by Marià Castelló, Na Blanca d’en Mestre, published in the Quaderns journal of the Official Association of Architects of Catalonia Col·legi Oficial d’Arquitectes de Catalunya. The main causes of environmental deterioration are the industrial production and consumption models11. In other words: How is it possible that a T-shirt costs €3 in a shop? The answer is simple: using the excuse of the difference in wages and the currency exchange in order to reassure consumers, globalised production using the under-regulated labour markets of second and third world countries is fed by new forms of forced labor12. At the same time, natural resources are overexploited and waste accumulates beyond the biosphere’s absorption capacity, transforming large marine and land areas into real landfills. This is also the case in the construction materials industry. The concept of an ecological footprint is used as an indicator of the rate at which this industrial phenomenon occurs, measuring the sur face area needed to produce what we consume for one year. In Spain13, our footprint is 64,000 m² per person. In the US, this figure comes to 100,000 m². However, space on our planet is limited and only 18,000 m² per person is available14. Therefore, in Spain we should reduce the consumption of resources by 70% at all levels: food, transport, housing, etc. This can be achieved either by reducing our consumption by 70%, modifying production processes, or by a combination of the two. What factors can we change? Industrial activities linked to the construction sector15 has a significant collateral impact, including: 1. Exploitation of natural resources. 2. CO2 emissions and greenhouse effect. 3. Toxicity and carcinogenic effect. 4. Labour exploitation. 11. United Nations Environment Program, Agenda 21. 1992 12.

The full ACV study includes other factors that have been taken into account in this project, such as avoiding products that emit CFCs or HCFCs with an impact on the O-zone or that contain heavy metals. Other impacts such as acidification (SOx emissions into the atmosphere), eutrophication, or the emission of solid waste generated have not been evaluated. Obtaining raw materials can entail implicit risks that are assumed unilaterally by companies, as explained by German sociologist Ulrich Beck in “Risk Society”16. The question is, would these risks be assumed by consumers if they knew about them? This is the case of aluminium mines. For each tonne of aluminium, 2 tonnes of highly alkaline red muds17 with a pH of 12-14 are produced, which are considered dangerous residues and are deposited in tailings rafts, which are a particularly troubling environmental concern for the EU18. The 2010 spillage of red mud tailings from the Ajka aluminium mine in Hungary flooded several villages causing 10 deaths and wounding 150 people. Another case is the deforestation of tropical forests. Although everyone is aware of the topic, we continue to collaborate unconsciously by failing to demand controlled management stamps in all our purchases. Even still, some reports19 warn of non-compliance in the management protocols in some second and third world countries, turning these supposed guarantees into a method of cleaning their image, also known as green-washing. Would the same occur if companies had to provide tracking information on all packaging? That is, stating the origin of products and providing information on all the stages of production, transformation and distribution. For example, imagine a label similar to the one used on cigarette packs: “The wood used to make this door comes from an illegal logging facility in the Amazon which is responsible for the annual deforestation of 1,000,000 hectares of forest” Or how about: “The aluminium used to make this window comes from a mine in India which has entailed the deforestation and the expulsion of indigenous tribes, causing numerous deaths and violations. The recycled aluminium content is 2%” 16. Beck, U. (2008): Risk Society, Barcelona, Paidós. 17. FERNANDES, M., A. RAMÍREZ & T. TOSIANI 2013.

Greepeace Report FSC at Risk: FSC in Russia. According to the draft version of Libro Blanco del Etiquetaje Verde20 developed by ITEC and the regional government of Catalonia, average emissions during the construction of residential buildings come to 732 kg/CO2 per square meter built, and range between 600 and 900 kg/CO2 depending on the type of building. Therefore, the emissions of a 100 m2 house come to approximately 75,000 kg/CO2. Extrapolating this figure to the total 60,000 homes built in the Community of Madrid21 in 2006, emissions came to 4.5 million tonnes, equal to 900,000 Olympic swimming pools. What are the implications of this? Carbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the greenhouse effect22, and thus it is the gas that has the greatest impact on global warming. In comparison, the rest of greenhouse gases added together represents 5%. The remaining 75% is caused by water vapour and clouds. fossil fuels like oil, heavy fuel oil or natural gas.27 In other words, the life cycle of concrete begins in an oil field like the one of Ghawar, Saudi Arabia; afterwards, the oil is transported by oil tankers to ports in Europe, like the one in Rotterdam; from there, it is distributed via pipelines to Spain, where it is refined and supplied to factories to be used as fuel, accountable for 5% of the world’s pollution. This does not take into account the possible environmental catastrophes caused by oil tanker accidents or armed conflicts in the different countries of extraction. In addition, it must not be forgotten that 2010 saw the Peak Oil28, in other words, the moment at which oil production reached its historical peak and from there began to decline. Whilst oil will never run out, there will come a time when it stops being extracted as it will be too expensive or difficult to obtain. 27. Guide to best techniques available in Spain in the production of cement, 2004, Ministry of the Environment. 28. World Energy Outlook 2010, International Energy Agency. Check next image. In light of this situation, the simplest solution is to reduce its use insofar as possible, i.e., not doing or doing the minimum. The automatic way of reducing CO2 emissions from a 500 m2 building by 50% is to build only 250 m2 . When this option proves unfeasible, one option is to avoid using materials with higher emissions as much as possible, such as aluminium, porcelain stoneware, all asphalt derivatives and reinforced concrete, and to look for available alternative materials. For example, those developed prior to the industrial revolution and using renewable energy to be manufactured at temperatures below 900 °C. This group includes natural hydraulic lime cement, aerial lime, or biomass-fired bricks, as well as all materials that do not require the use of furnaces, such as wood products. One of the major advantages of designing using quantifiable indicators is the ability to dismantle myths. Thus, when it comes to the issue of pollution, it is typical for transport to be quoted as one of the main sources. Although this may be true in some particular cases, boats are comparatively very efficient compared to other means of transport, as shown in the table on the right. Obviously, the shorter the distance, the less associated pollution. What is the main problem in importing products from abroad? Generally speaking, if products are sourced from developed countries and importing them is justified as there is no impact on the consumption of similar local products, the importance of transport pollution can be considered relative. However, importing raw materials from countries with under-regulated labour markets can lead to labour exploitation, accidents and worker fatalities. If in doubt, ask to be provided with the working conditions of supplier, although this is not always possible. For instance, more than 55% of the electricity consumed in Mallorca comes from the Murterar power plant, which coal powered. This coal does not come from Spanish mines, as might be assumed, rather it is it from Colombia as it costs less. This sector involves child exploitation29, which causes environmental disasters such as the dumping of hundreds of tonnes of coal into the sea near beaches30 and high occupational accident rates according to the report of the Ministry of Mines of Bogotá31, which references the mortality rates of other mining countries such as China, with 6,000 miners killed during 2005, or South Africa, with 220 in 2007, which is from where the coal used in Murterar was sourced until recently. Almost 60 million children are affected by child exploitation in South Africa32. Given that children are considered particularly useful for entering gaps in which adults do not fit and that they have no demands in terms of working conditions, it is fairly plausible to conclude that the production of electricity employed on the island has benefited from child exploitation for years, and could even still be happening Although statistically employment conditions in Colombia are better than those in South Africa, the fact is that in general, we would refuse to do these jobs ourselves, never mind our children. In this sense, the current DGECC’s commitment to close 50% of the coal reactors at the Murterar power station in the near future is quite remarkable. This development is doubly interesting given that the incorporated CO2 emissions of the energy mix of the Balearic Islands33 are more than double those seen in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, due to the pollution caused by the burning of coal, with a heat efficiency of just 30% (the remaining 70% is released into the atmosphere). Therefore, energy efficiency in the Balearic Islands, in addition to reducing consumer bills and pollution, can have a positive impact on reducing labour exploitation if appropriate measures are taken.29. https://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/avenferm/ article/view/15660/18163 30. www.ejatlas.org/conflict/coal-transport-bydrummond-in-bahia-de-santa-marta-colombia 31.

According to data from the Directorate General of the Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change, in 2010, the Balearic Islands produced 9,361,900 tonnes of CO2 . Of this amount, 5,000,000 tonnes correspond to the production of electricity. In Mallorca, 500 MW are produced at the Murterar power station with 33% of primary heat energy harness. This plant alone is responsible for around 3,100,000 tonnes of CO2The history of regulatory developments in terms of asbestos demonstrates the difficulties experienced by government institutions to prohibit products that are potentially harmful to human health: 1889 First report on the toxicity of asbestos fibres34. 1930 First time asbestosis is recognised as a professional disease in Great Britain.35 1973 International scientific recognition of the carcinogenic nature of asbestos.36 1999 The EU requires member states to ban all types of asbestos and establishes a maximum deadline of 1 January 2005.37 2001 Its production in Spain is prohibited. The standard takes effect after 6 months and an additional moratorium of 6 months is granted to market the remaining stock.38 2006 The removal of asbestos by private individuals is prohibited, which is carried out by specialist companies who use watertight suits given the great danger involved in its handling.39 Occupational exposure in manufacturing continues to cause more than 100,000 deaths a year globally and yet countries like Russia continue to manufacture almost 700,000 t annually, which are marketed in countries like China. Another case is that of PVC, declared as being carcinogenic by IARC40. In addition to toxicity during the production process or direct contact, one of the main problems in its use in buildings is that most installations, such as electrical wiring and sanitation, are usually made of PVC and in the event of a fire, the main cause of death is the inhalation of smoke and toxic gases, accounting to 57.45% in the case of men and 81.82% in the case of women41. In fact, public buildings require that electrical installations are free from halogens, i.e. free from PVC. Despite the foregoing, it remains the third most consumed plastic in the world. 34.

In Spain, it is still sold, but its use is banned in public buildings in more than 300 towns and cities in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Holland, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, including capitals such as Berlin and Vienna. All these examples constitute what we call “the difficulties of the modern farmer.” Taking traditional architecture as a reference, in which farmers use everything that comes his way without prejudice, the replacement of a few trunks and ropes using potentially toxic products made on an industrial scale becomes a noteworthy problem. In light of this situation, the principle of precaution42 is of particular interest, avoiding the use of all materials concerning which there are strong doubts in terms of their safety in construction work, establishing much more restrictive levels than those defined by the current legislation, preventing the use of the following materials: — PVC in any aspect of construction work, including installations, where it is considered the material par excellence. — Glues and/or woods with a formaldehyde content of more than E1. — Polyurethane (PU) foams or any other type of product that exposes the operator to toxic gases such as HFC (greenhouse gas), or HC (hydrocarbons considered Volatile Organic Compounds), which have replaced CFC or CHFC gases that affect the O-zone layer, which were banned in 2009.43 — Toxic paints or varnishes, with a high VOC content or that contain barium, lead or other heavy metals. It is recommended that all treatments used contain vegetable raw materials and feature a stamp of organic production or, failing this, a certificate issued by the manufacturer, declaring that the product is not toxic. 42. Referred to in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 43. European Regulation 1005/2009 of 16 September 2009.What options do we have in this scenario? One of the main problems facing EU countries is energy dependence44. In the case of Spain, this figure comes to 75%, whilst the EU-27 average exceeds 53%. This high level of dependence leaves the economies of member states in a fragile position. The 2020 climate & energy package has been developed as part of which the reduction of energy consumption by 20% is one of the key points to gradually start on our journey towards energy self-sufficiency prior to the arrival of Oil Crash45. Similarly, progress towards a degree of self-sufficiency in resource consumption is one of the main ways of reducing the so-called “ecological threats”, which are actually threats to the social system46. It is not a case of protecting a non-existent “untouched nature”, rather our own survival. How can we apply self-sufficiency? A resource map is a very useful resource that allows us to discover all available local resources, whether tangible or not: Prevailing winds in summer for cooling, direction of the sun for heating, rainfall, geotechnics, materials and waste, etc. Traditional architecture is, by definition, the local resource map. That is, by regarding traditional architecture, we can discover the natural resources available at the time of construction. For example, buildings in the Biniaraix ravine in Soller, Mallorca, were built using stones from the valley itself. The presence of a well or cistern can be used as a pointer in terms of the geology, rainfall and the existence of groundwater. In the case of Formentera, until the 19th century, only stone, soil, and sabina wood was available. During the 19th century, lime technology was developed and tiles imported from Ibiza and the mainland. However, it’s not just about materials. In Alexander Brodsky’s ice pavilion, the metallic mesh protects against the icy wind by spraying it with water, forming a wall of ice that can be served in the form of cubes in vodka drinks. The cold provides protection from the cold. If we are strict enough, our buildings could produce a resource map for our era to be used by future generations. Program, structure, construction and energy efficiency solved by a single strategy. Traditional architecture has been a constant reference, not in terms of design, but as a way of working. We use it as a microscope to get a closer look. By doing so, we can see the resources available on the island: Junipers, which were used to build frameworks, are currently protected. The sandstone quarries have been depleted and the limited straw available is used for livestock. So, we have to look to the sea: Posidonia and boats, plus construction pallets that remain on the island because high cost of returning them.Therefore, we propose a shift in approach: “Instead of investing in a chemical plant located 1,500 km away, we should invest the same amount in local unskilled labour, who should lay out the Posidonia to dry under the sun and compact it in pallets, providing 15 cm of insulation for roofs. Moreover, sea salt actually acts as natural biocide product and is completely environmentally friendly The rest of the material used comes from a market study given their cost, the incorporated energy and the fact that they are suited to the levels of comfort required. The use of natural materials, more fragile than industrialized, requires selecting the main construction systems at the beginning of the design process. The organization of the spaces and the formal decisions must be the result of the knowledge of the advantages and the limitations of the materials. To think Louis Kahn’s way: If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, ‘What do you want, Brick?’ And Brick says to you, ‘I like an Arch.’ And if you say to Brick, ‘Look, arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think of that, Brick?’ Brick says, ‘I like an Arch.’ And it’s important, you see, that you honor the material that you use. The constructed volume is divided into two separate blocks, taking advantage of the fact that the two facades that overlook the street enjoy prevailing winds that passively keep them cool in summer. All the dwellings face two directions and cross ventilation thanks to the layout of the living/dining room and kitchen in a Z shape and a bedroom at each end. The layout is a variation of the project of 42 housing units in Son Servera, Mallorca, by the architects M. Peris and J. M Toral, promoted by the IBAVI. The entrance to all homes is directly on to the street, restoring the direct relationship typical of rural communities and avoiding the use of elevators, stairs and common areas. Furthermore, they all boast outdoor spaces for private use: ground floor homes have a garden whereas first-floor homes have a terrace with a private staircase. The building is Energy Class A. The insulation in the roof is Posidonia oceanica compacted at 185 kg/m3 with λ: 0.044 W/mK and 16-cm thick. The walls are of 25-cm thick Ytong and U: 0.36 W/m2 ºC, except to the north, which are 30-cm thick and U: 0.32 W/m2 ºC. All windows are low emissivity glass U: 1.1 W/m2 ºC. In summer, the cooling is provided passively by harnessing the breeze. The windows exposed to sunlight have solar protection, such as porches, pergolas with vines and canes, or shutters made of larch wood. Cables have been installed on the facade to facilitate the growth of climbing plants that protect blind walls and reduce solar radiation by more than 90% in areas where they have been developed. In winter, passive climate control is dependent on a 90 kW centralised biomass boiler that offers a yield of 92%, which also produces ACS. Each house has Termobox-M heat exchangers that provide individual consumption readings. The openings dimensions have been calculated to ensure that direct radiation occurs on the most unfavourable day of the winter solstice. First floor houses have a skylight on the deck facing in two directions. In winter, when opening the shutters facing southwards provides you get a solar collector. In summer, when closing the blinds and opening the windows, you get natural ventilation by means of suction. The average thermal comfort, measured on site is 21ºC in winter and 26ºC in summer. If prioritizing the product as being as healthy and eco-friendly as possible, a local product47, in addition to being economically viable, the following table applies to the Balearics: C1. Reusable local waste E.g. Neptune grass, straw, reused doors, etc. C2. Local eco-friendly products E.g. Marès sandstone, clay (BTC, adobe, etc.), tiles cooked in a biomass kiln, aerial lime, etc. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products E.g. Wood, hydraulic lime, etc. C4. Recycled or optimized products, whether local or not. E.g. Ytong, metal beams with at least 85% recycled steel. 47. A product is considered to be local when it is less than 100 km from the place where it will be consumed. In the case of Formentera, Mallorca has been considered as local due to the lack of local industry, although the two islands are 160 km apart. C1. Reusable local waste — Roof insulation: Posidonia oceanica dried on site, confined in reused pallets. — Aggregates: from construction work itself, during the excavation phases, or from cellular concrete block residues. — Interior carpentry and gates: reused wood (Fundació Deixalles Mallorca). C2. Local eco-friendly products — Structure (vaults): marès sandstone slabs from Mallorca. — External plaster: lime plaster made in Mallorca using recycled oil as fuel. — Exterior floors: 40x80x7-cm marès sandstone slabs and bricks produced in biomass kilns known as “morunos”. — Vertical outdoor partitions: H-16 ceramic blocks produced in biomass kilns. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products — Structure (floors): laminated wood from Austria, type E1 with PEFC seal. OSB-III boards with PEFC seal. — Outdoor woodwork: larch wood from the Basque Country, with PEFC seal. — Foundations: Non-reinforced NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk. — Interior floors: NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk, smoothed in situ. — Acoustic insulation for interior partitions: recycled cotton boards. — Acoustic insulation for the floors: Natural cork with FSC seal. — Wood protection: Lasur based on vegetable raw materials, free from lead, barium, heavy metals or polyurethane. — Paints: Silicate paint for walls and partitions. C4. Recycled or optimised products — Structure (walls): YTONG cellular concrete blocks, with environmental product declaration (EPD according to ISO 14025 - eco-label type III). — Waterproofing: EPDM. The use of asphalt sheets and PVC has been banned. — Installations: All electrical installations are halogen-free (PVC-free). Water, domestic hot water and grey water installations are made using polyethylene and polypropylene. C1. POSIDONIA & PALLETS DRY NEPTUNE GRASS AS A THERMAL INSULATION FOR ROOFS The insulation depends on the indoor air bubble content; therefore, any local waste with a high air content can potentially be used for insulation. In Formentera, one of the most abundant types of residue are dead Posidonia leafs, which is why dry Posidonia oceanica has been used as thermal insulation, just like it was used in traditional architecture. The accumulation of Posidonia oceanica debris (berms) on the beaches provides very effective protection against coastal erosion. However, in Formentera the accumulation is so high that top layers can be used. PROTECTED PLANT The Posidonia oceanica is a protected plant48 and its use must be authorised by the Ministry of Environment by applying to the Service of Protected Species. It has been collected by the company awarded the contract for beach maintenance and has been limited exclusively to the areas in which the material accumulated on beaches exceeds the amount necessary to maintain the balance of the coastal dune ecosystem and extreme care has been taken not to affect this ecosystem, under the supervision of the environment technicians from the Council of Formentera. The annual surplus volume of Posidonia, around 4000 m3 , would be sufficient to insulate all new dwellings on the island. The illegal collection of Posidonia is prohibited and strict sanctions apply, except in authorised cases. The new Posidonia Decree of the Balearic Islands, which is currently being drafted, includes its use in construction work. 48. Posidonia oceanica is protected by the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC TESTS WITH THE UIB Posidonia does not require artificial treatment as sea salt acts as a preser - vative and a biocide. In order to ensure its worthiness as in - sulation and to determine its thermal conductivity, three different tests were carried out in collaboration with the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB). The result was a success. — The first test involved the use of two PCE-HT 71 data logger sensors. — The second, using a drying oven, sought to compared the results against expanded polystyrene. — The third, involved using a heat flow meter pursuant to UNE-EN 12664:2002. Dry Posidonia insulation provides a U: 0.2936 W/m 2 °C and Λ: 0.044 W/mK for a density of 185 kg/m 3 and a thickness of 16 cm. THE PROCESS Once the re-used 16-cm high construction pallets were put in place, dry Posidonia has to be extended at a rate of 20 kg/m2 . The compaction process to obtain 185 kg/m3 was performed manually, with participants using their hands and feet to push the leafs between the pallets that form the substructure to which the OSB boards are nailed. Afterwards, the boards were waterproofed with EPDM and protected with sandstone slabs the form of paving. The smell of the sea was apparent on the site throughout the process. The solution applies to all locations in the Mediterranean with a surplus of Posidonia. DURABILITY Dry Posidonia does not rot and has no natural predators outside the marine environment, so its durability is unlimited under normal conditions of use. It was used uninterruptedly in the traditional architecture of the Balearic Islands and especially in the Pitiusas until the start of the 20th century. The samples of dry Posidonia dating back to the 14th century provided by Antònia Reig, Director of the TRBM49, taken from the coffered ceiling of the cloister at the Sapiencia de Palma show a perfect state of conservation; therefore, its useful life is more than 600 years. According to hisorians F. Tugores i J. Morata, all palaces built in Palma between the 14th and 17th centuries used dry Posidonia in wood panelling to protect the wood from moisture and xylophages. EXTINCTION OF THE POSIDONIA PRAIRIES DUE TO GLOBAL WARMING Posidonia meadows are an essential CO2 sink. However, according to the Spanish National Research Council50, during the 21st century their density will decrease by 90% due to the increase in sea temperature, as part of a process that will begin in about 40 years, resulting in the functional extinction of the species, giving rise to the release of absorbed gas for centuries.51 Therefore, the decrease in CO2 released as part of construction contributes directly to the protection of the species. Formentera’s boat shacks remind us of the time when recycling was one of the few possible ways of obtaining raw materials. All indoor carpentry in these dwellings and the vertical shutters on the ground floor were made using recycled wood and planks made from old pine stripped from abandoned beds managed by Fundación Deixalles in Mallorca. There are no second-hand carpenters in Ibiza. Fundación Deixalles is a non-profit organisation whose main objective is to ensure the socio-labour insertion of vulnerable groups in the Balearic Islands through the recovery and recycling of waste and environmental activities in general. The reuse of this wood makes it possible to put top-quality wood (old pine, Oregon pine, etc.), generally more than 50-70 years old, to reuse; this guarantees the natural growth of the tree and a drying process that is no longer available, and therefore these objects are become unique and un - repeatable, making it possible to in - corporate items of great wealth into architecture in general. As part of the woodwork selection pro - cess, samples showing signs of wood - worm or xylophagous insect infesta - tion have been ruled out, as they could extend to the rest of the house. The original woodwork has been ex - tended or trimmed as needed and it has been hung on Klein sliding guides, as this means that although the size of the door and gap do not match, the gap is reduced insofar as possible. All swinging doors can be reused as slid - ing doors. More than 100 items of recycled wood - work have been installed. Hydrated lime plaster on the facades to waterproof the load walls with a breathable coating. The lime, aged for 12 months, was sourced from the Unicmall factory in Felanitx, Mallorca. The fuel used to melt the lime is recycled oil, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. The plaster is applied in 3 layers. Two coarse layers with a total thickness of 2 cm and an intermediate mallatex across the entire surface plus a thin layer of 3-5 mm. The thick mortar includes a 0.2% polypropylene fibre reinforcement to prevent cracking during retraction. The support wall has been pre-treated with a compatible primer. Marès is a type of sandstone native to the Balearic Islands extracted in 40x40x80-cm blocks; it is very useful in the construction of walls and vaults. Its characteristics depend on its origin, whether calcarenite (sand grains cemented by the calcium of shells of molluscs) or eolianite (sedimented sand), and therefore each quarry has very different properties, with resistances varying between 25 and 630 kg/cm². Therefore, as is the case with wood, its generic name is not very descriptive and it is essential that the quarry selected is appropriate based on the required use. The publication EL MARÉS, by R. Sánchez-Cuenca, comes highly recommended, offering a description of the features (density, porosity, resistance, colour, etc.) of the 19 active quarries in Mallorca. In Formentera, the quarries have already been depleted or extraction activities have ceased. As part of this project, we chose to use the Cas Busso quarry, offering 1st-rate quality, with the following characteristics: — Whitish colour, compact, dense, no grains, very hard. — Bulk density: 2.1 g/cm³. — Open porosity: 45.6%. — Compressive strength: 557-627 kg/cm². Marès has been used as a structural element to construct the vaults of cisterns, as an alternative to the reinforced concrete slabs and to avoid the corrosion of reinforcements, thus prolonging their durability indefinitely. The vault joints have been made using with NHL-5 lime cement, as Marès is chemically incompatible with Portland cement. It has also been used as a floating floor in the roof, in 40x80x7-cm slabs with an open joint, laid dry in and 80x18.5x25- cm solid steps. The use of Marès reduces emissions by 60% compared to concrete alternatives.52 52. Own research carried out in collaboration with the General Directorate of Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change of the Balearic Islands Government, using the ITEC’s BEDEC. C2. BRICKS & TILES The outer-facing walls and permeable dicing walls have been made using H-16 bricks sourced from the Can Mascaró factory in Vilafranca, Mallorca. They have been placed with the holes exposed, rotated 90º compared to their usual direction, allowing air to circulate and cool the inside of houses while still offering shade in the summer. Furthermore, there does not inhibit resistance to the horizontal thrust of the wind. The tiles, made at the Soler pottery in Felanitx, Mallorca, have been used in the eaves that protect the windows, as outdoor paving, in doorways, roof railings and in the tiled bathrooms and kitchens. The glazed tiles are made one at a time by hand, and no two tiles are the same. All the bricks and tiles used in construction work have been baked in biomass mortar kilns, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. 53. Up to now, we have located this type of “moruno” kilns used for the production of building materials in Andalusia, the Balearic Islands and Murcia. We do not know if there are other ceramic factories in Spain that operate with 100% renewable energies. In any case, it is a trade of great patrimonial and ethnological value and, therefore, the Administration must protect it. The outdoor windows have been made using laminated larch wood with the PEFC seal from the Basque Country. This wood has a very low thermal conductivity Λ: 0.11 W/mk, which means it provides good insulation, especially when compared with aluminium (209.3-237) or steel (47-58). HEALTH AND DURABILITY It is breathable, and contains no toxic elements. The protection treatment has been applied using eco-friendly lasur, which features no polyurethane and Vindo 629 paint made by Livos. A correct design involves selecting a suitable wood to use. The larch wood does not rot and does not show signs of blue mould. In the façades, 20-cm ceramic eaves have been installed to avoid direct rainfall. Shutters have been installed without a frame, with a minimum separation of 0.5- 1 cm between wet work and the wood.

HYDRAULIC LIME NHL-5 Why use lime concrete? CO2 emissions can be reduced by around 15% without having to change normal building habits, replacing conventional materials with less polluting alternatives in finishes such as paintwork, flooring, carpentry or plastering. However, action must be taken during excavation, foundation and structural work to reduce emissions by up to 50%. Lime concrete, used since 300 BC by the Romans and present in all traditional European architecture, absorbs between 45% and 62% of the CO2 produced during its production, reaching 100% CO2 absorption in very long life cycles. The material fell out of use during the 20th century due to slow setting times and low resistance compared to Portland cement, which prevents its use in multi-level pillar structures. The prototype has been designed with light slabs and load-bearing walls that transmit loads of less than 0.8 N/mm² to the 60x50-cm footings to demonstrate the viability of NHL-5 lime as structural concre - te with a strength equal to or greater to 5 Mpa and setting period of up to 360 days. Concrete has been laid in layers of varia - ble thickness, ranging between 15 and 20 cm. The ratio used was 1:1:1 (lime, sand, gravel) in the upper layers and 2:3:5 in the lower layer. In establishing the different ratios, both the information on the tra - ditional application of lime concrete and the technical information associated with the existing regulatory framework have been taken into account, which can be found in the project report. 291 test specimens were tested to determine the resistance of lime con - crete in real working conditions, using different possible ratios to provide all possible information for the purposes of future projects. In addition, another 70 lime concrete specimens54 with a small proportion of white cement of <20% have been taken to accelerate the setting of all exposed concrete indoor flooring Slabs are 10-cm thick on the ground floor and 7-cm thick on the 1st floor, to reduce the load, and they have been poured on a waterproof breathable sheet of polyethylene. They have been reinforced with polyethylene fibres and continuous mallatex specific to 40x40 mm and 135 gr floors placed 3 cm from the bottom face of the slab. Flexible 5 mm joints have been laid around the perimeter and retraction joints using 5x45-mm polypropylene profiles forming maximum surface area pads of 5 m2 on the ground floor and 4 m2 on the first floor. The finishing layer has been made by sprinkling flint sand and lime at a ratio of 50:50, and smoothed by hand using a grout float, in 3 consecutive phases as is traditional. The flooring has been kept moist for 30 days and was not stepped on for a week. It has been waterproofed using ecological Welaan Eco-Hidro-Sell based sodium silicate water-repellent product. 54. The hydraulic lime used in this construction was sourced from Catalonia, is baked at 900ºC and CO2 emissions are 400 kg/CO2 per tonne of lime. However, if biomass or other clean energies had been used for the purposes of combustible, emissions would be 160 kg/CO2 per tonne. The slabs (ceilings) consist of the following structural elements: A. 20x40-cm laminated GL36 pine beams of section and 12x18-cm GL24 beams, sourced from Austria with the PEFC seal. B. Structural panel of oriented chips of poplar wood, OSB III type 2-cm thick, from Italy with PEFC seal. Biocide has been applied exclusively to the hidden parts of the wood. The heads embedded in the wall have been coated with reused cardboard boxes and packaging to absorb any moisture that reaches the wood. CO2 emissions are 23 kg/CO2 per m2 of wood slabs. Emissions made by a one-way concrete slab for equivalent lamps are 245 kg/CO2 . C4. Ytong The solution used in the façade is the result of an environmental comparison carried out by Societat Orgànica consultancy firm, in which different façade solutions with the same transmittance coefficient of U: 0.36 were assessed and the solution with the lowest incorporated energy (498 Mj/m2 ) chosen, comprising load-bearing walls with YTONG-type lightened concrete, or similar, with the following characteristics: — Width of 30 cm and density of 350 kg/m³ facing north to reduce losses in winter. — Width of 25 cm and density 350 kg/ m³ in all other facade walls. — Width of 30 cm and density of 500 kg/ m³ in the walls dividing dwellings to comply with the acoustic regulations. On the inside, the block has been painted directly using silicates, without plastering, to avoid the consumption of materials and additional energy In order to reduce the consumption of mains water from 22055 to 88 litres per person per day the following measures have been implemented: 1. Efficient design of the domestic hot water installation and the location of faucets, all less than one meter from the hot water exchanger to avoid wasting cold water. 2. Saving mechanisms in kitchens and bathrooms (pressure and flow reducers, taps that open when cold, etc.). 3. Rainwater cisterns of 6 m³ each, located beneath the 7 terraces on the ground floor, to provide automated irrigation to the plants sowed that serve a bioclimatic function (11 trees and 40 climbing plants). The steady rainfall rate is 345 l/m2 per year and the system has 450 litres per day for the purposes of irrigation during the 3 months of the dry season. In terms of rental housing managed by IBAVI, lawns are banned, which in this climate would constitute an irresponsible use of resources. 55. Statistical water consumption in homes with garden of the subsidiary rules of Formentera and the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). 4. In the central courtyard, a grey water phyto-purification system56 has been installed to regenerate shower water for use in the toilets (statistically 20% water consumption per day and person). The cistern has a capacity for 17 m³. The plants selected by the landscaper Salvador Canyís are Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia, Iris pseudoacorus, Mentha aquatica and Lithrum salicaria. 5. Landscape gardening. Selection of suitable native and non-native species: Celtis australis (almez), Ficus carica (fig tree), Parthenocissus quinquefolia (virgin vine), and Bougainvillea spectabilis (bougainvillea) and efficient irrigation systems, avoiding sprinklers. 56. Horizontal dry flow phyto-purification system. The prototype has successfully reduced waste production by 50% during the construction phase, producing 33.38 tonnes of waste in total. The following measures were applied: — Reuse the aggregates from excavation as fillers under floorings (100 m3 ), and fillers in gardens (120 m3 ), in order to reduce the gravel imported in trucks from Ibiza. — Reuse the remains of crushed YTONG as light filler under the firstfloor flooring. — Reuse all construction pallets in the construction of roofs as a support for Posidonia oceanica. — Reuse the surplus wood from the beams to cover the gaps in the slabs between rooms. — Reuse the wood provided by Fundación Deixalles for the purposes of interior woodwork. MONITORING THE PROTOTYPE Incorporated emissions have been calculated using the ITEC’s BEDEC bank57. During the REUSING POSIDONIA project we discovered that it was impossible to establish an absolute emissions threshold for all buildings, since the impact of works to build the roofs, structures or lay the foundations varies widely. Therefore, in contrast to the calculation of energy efficiency, for which there are reference values, to calculate the percentage of improvement, we use the emissions of an equivalent building constructed with conventional systems such as reinforced concrete, aluminium, stoneware and asphalt products.58 The emissions of the Prototype came to 446,632 Kg/CO2 (412 Kg/CO2 x m²). The emissions of the reference building came to 1,221,987 kg/CO2 (1,128 kg/CO2 x m²) The decrease ultimately obtained was 63,45%, well beyond the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 50%.59 57. Technical Construction Institute of Catalonia. 58. Materials used to calculate the reference building: — Foundations, walls and pillars of reinforced concrete. — Structural floor with concrete girder-slabs and beams. — Flat roof with porex insulation and asphalt sheet. — Concrete blocks walls. — Porcelain stoneware flooring. — Aluminum exterior carpentry. Pine interior doors. — Installations of PVC and plastic paint for walls. 59. Please find CO2 calculations here: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huella-de-co2/ 60. The maximum height of the building depends on the city council buildings regulations. If this typology is included to data base, the CO2 statistical emissions would be between 600 and 1,100 kg, with an average of 850 kg It can be seen that the reference building’s emissions are well beyond the statistics, between 600 and 900 kg, which has had an impact on the foundations and roofs of a two-storey building60 compared to the 5-storey building used to obtain the value of 732 kg/CO2 . Even so, the reduction of the prototype towards the statistical average was 45%, which means the following: A. Despite the greater surface area, the use of local construction systems with a low environmental impact has made it possible to reduce CO2 emissions by around 50%. B. If the lime concrete used in the structure is sourced from a factory using renewable sources of energy, emissions per square metre would drop to 367 kg/CO2 , and therefore, we would obtain a reduction of 70%, equivalent to the reduction required to obtain an ecological footprint of 18,000 m2 .

MONITORING THERMAL COMFORT Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with J. Muñoz and C. Carmona from the Architectural Research Group at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB): Monitoring includes indoor and outdoor temperatures, degree of relative humidity and breeze speed inside 8 standard homes, 4 looking north-south and 4 looking east-west. The following tools were used: — FlirC2 thermographic camera, with sensor IR 80×60. — PCE-T150 digital thermometer. — TESTO445 hot-wire anemometer. — PCE-890U surface temperature gun. — 10 PCE-HT 71N temperature sensors. — 10 PCE-T390 temperature sensors. Monitoring began on 21 December 2016, coinciding with the winter solstice and will end in the summer of 2018. The results obtained to date August22nd are as follows. PHASE 1 - WINTER Period: 22 december 2016 - 16 february 2017. Dwellings: 6 and 8. The dwellings were inhabited. Data: Internal temperature information (Ti), outdoor temperature (Te), indoor relative humidity (HR) and outdoor relative humidity (Hre). The climate control conditions where stablished by setting and indoor temperature of 21ºC. The system stopped when it reached the setpoint temperature Climatic conditions to the indicated period (12/22/16 - 2/16/17): — Median minimum outdoor temperatures: 8°C — Median maximum outdoor temperatures: 15°C Results — Initial median interior temperature (initial Ti): 15°C — Median time required for air conditioning to reach 21°C ™: 1 hr — Median indoor relative humidity (once at 21°C):> 75% The insulation was proved to be adequate. Infrared imaging did not detect any thermal bridges. PHASE 2 - SUMMER Period: 15 June to 22 August 2017. Units: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12. The Dwellings were inhabited. Data: Indoor Surface Temperatures (Tsi), Indoor Temperatures (Ti), Outdoor Surface Temperatures (Tse) Outdoor Temperatures (Te), indoor Relative Humidity (Hri) and Outdoor Relative Humidity (Hre). Climatic conditions during the period (24/7/17 - 28/7/17): — Average minimum outdoor temperatures: 29.5°C — Average outdoor maximum temperature: 35°C Results The results61 obtained demonstrate that the enclosure’s insulation works appropriately with constant reductions of 5ºC compared to the outdoor temperature and 15ºC compared to the outdoor temperature of the surfaces exposed to direct sunlight. 61.

Parámetros del ambiente interior a considerar para el diseño y la evaluación de la eficiencia energética de edificios incluyendo la calidad del aire interior, condiciones térmicas, iluminación y ruido), We performed an analysis of internal thermal comfort, based on the ASHRAE62 standard and EN-1525163 using the following average values obtained during the analysis period: — Ti of the units facing North, South and East, between 25 and 27 ºC with an average of around 26 ºC. — Te between 30 and 35ºC, with an average minimum outdoor temperature of 29.5°C, an average maximum outdoor temperature of 35°C and a median temperature of around 33°C — HRi between 55 and 80% with an average of around 65% and HRe between 55 and 90%, with an average of around 75% We concluded that based on the ASHRAE standard (Figure 6), the apparent temperature is 26.3 °C. It also complies with EN-15251 (Figure 7). These two results have been obtained with wind speeds of 0 (zero). When considering a wind speed of 0.5 m/s, the apparent temperature is around 23.5 ºC (Figure 8). We have not seen a significant difference in the adiabatic64 properties, indicating a good level of insulation. 64. Adiabatic dwelling does not present temperature losses. 3. ELECTRIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD MONITORING Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with B. Alorda from the Architectural Research Group at the UIB. The following equipment has been used: — Narda NBM-550 Broadband Field Meter — Narda EF-0391 E-Field, Flat Response Probe — Rohde & SCHWARZ FSH3 Spectrum Analyser The electromagnetic radiation of radio-frequency waves has had and continues to have a special impact on public opinion due to its possible impact on health conditions. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the use of mobile devices or sensing devices capable of performing wireless communications, in other words, devices emitting electromagnetic waves. Safety measures in terms of sources of electromagnetic radiation were regulated in 200165 in order to ensure the highest levels of safety and respond to the social demand for transparency and control 65. Based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization via the recommendation of the European Commission 1999/519/EC that was reflected in Spanish legislation via Royal Decree 1066/2001. over the sources of electromagnetic pollution. The reference levels indicated in the regulations are the maximum values considered as being safe and they are based on the international scientific recommendations, which are updated in line with new knowledge obtained from the latest research developments. The table below details the reference levels included in the regulations in force and that guarantee the compliance with strict safety margins in terms of the levels of exposure to radio-wave radiation amongst the general population. Observing the relevant frequency band at the main frequencies for mobile communications (900, 1800 and 2000 MHz), this regulation establishes reference limits of: 4.5 W/m2 , 9 W/m2 and 10 W/m2 respectively. Likewise, in the SATI report67 published by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces in 2012, a comparison of the limits of exposure to electromagnetic fields was performed, concluding that there were differences between the reference values. These differences define more restrictive maximum limit levels: — In terms of the Spanish autonomous communities, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha and Navarra are the communities that establish the most restrictive maximum reference values for mobile frequency bands68 (2 W/m2 , 4 W/m2 and 4.5 W/m2 respectively). — Luxembourg establishes the lowest maximum reference values on mobile frequencies68 in the European Union. The maximum power density is limited to 0.024 W/m2 , equivalent to a maximum electrical field intensity of 3 V/m per antenna. 66. F is the frequency of the wave (Hz), E is the intensity of the electrical field (V/m), H is the magnetic field strength (A/m), B is the magnetic flux density (μT) and S is the equivalent power density of the plane wave (W/m2 ). 67. The SATI report was published in 2012 by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces. 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. Effects on health These differences in the limits allowed by current regulations cannot be justified in terms of reducing the possible adverse health effects both for the general population and occupational exposure, according to the SATI report.67 Thus, the reduction of the reference level for emissions from telephone antennas is not justified, as indicated, for example, in the 2009 report by the French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety. In addition, the same report indicates that “the most effective method to reduce public exposure in general, involves the necessary increase in the number of antennas and their coverage.” So much so, that the authorities of Denmark, Greenland, Finland, Sweden and Norway issued a joint statement in 2009 indicating that “If the number of fixed antennas is reduced, mobile phones tend to use more energy to preserve your connection; therefore, the exposure of the general public may increase. “ According to the conclusions of WHO Fact Sheet 193 of 201469, the following points are worth note: — In the short term, the principal mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency energy and the human body is tissue heating. Furthermore, the penetration of the frequencies used by mobile phones68 is negligible, affecting only the first layers of skin. — In the long term, it has been determined that frequency to radio frequency fields does not increase the risk to people. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency electromagnetic fields as being possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B), but a category used when a causal association is considered credible, but when chance, bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence, thus their classification is a prevention strategy. (www.who.int/ mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/es/) 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. 69. World Health Organization. The newly built construction is 50 metres away from the telephone towers located on 28 La Habana street. Indoor electromagnetic field measurements have been carried out taking into account several conditions: time (morning, afternoon), layout of the room and usage, in addition to height compared to the horizontal height of the street.

Higher values have been measured on the upper terrace because they are directly in front of the sources of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the structural insulation of the walls reduces the radiation inside the houses and that radiation is beneath even the most restrictive limits. 70.

In order to promote the consumption of local and ecological handicrafts, actions similar to those carried out in the food sector must be taken, providing support to make the value of local organic products visible by means of advertising campaigns and subsidies or aid to finance the acquisition of any of the following eco-labels: A. Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an external entity. B. Freely accessible environmental assessment programs, Echometer or similar. C. European eco-label, currently under development. D. To develope a label of eco-friendly local product. 2. For products imported from outside the EU, a label should be required to ensure fair working conditions and respect for human rights in production processes, such as FAIRTRADE71, or similar, as a mandatory condition for use in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and Statewide construction standards. 3. For wood products from outside the EU, an FSC or PEFC forest management label should be required as a condition for being used in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and State-wide and regional construction standards. 4. For all products made on an industrial scale, both in the EU and abroad, product traceability should be required at all extraction, manufacturing and distribution stages. A product manufactured in the EU may use raw materials that involved in some or all of the side effects described in the consumption models. 5. A CO2 emissions ceiling should be established for construction industries. 6. For the restoration of traditional local products with no active industry, such as Posidonia, their patrimonial value should be made visible and promoted by the public administrations. 71. Fair trade. The Fairtrade Seal is accredited by Flo-Cert in compliance with ISO 17065. There are other accreditations that ensure the rights of workers such as ISO 26000 Social responsibility Unlike processed materials, which benefit from large investments in terms of advertising and technical advice financed by private companies, traditional materials are not linked to financial profitability and their use on-site requires specific knowledge, which is why they have fallen into disuse. Based on the foregoing, the public administration is responsible for their restored use, replacing the figure of technical advisors and establishing channels of communication between professionals and consumers. Furthermore, it must be noted that the use of materials without an EC marking represents an added difficulty for technicians, who must have a high level of know-how to correctly apply traditional systems, within the current framework of associated civil liability and compliance with technical regulations such as the Technical Building Code, the Regulation of Thermal Installations in Buildings, etc. As is the case with dry stone, which has received funding from various European programs72, the following activities should be encouraged: — Posidonia management training courses (collection, drying and storage) for public administration personnel to encourage its use in public buildings. — Courses/workshops/events involving construction with Posidonia, placing a special emphasis on the protection of Posidonia meadows and dune ecosystems, imparted to professionals and individuals to encourage its use in public and private buildings. — Development of public companies in all regions of the Mediterranean in which Posidonia is dried and packaged and made available to consumers, complying with all the beach collection protocols to ensure that the dune ecosystem is not harmed, preventing individuals managing the collection of large volumes. — Additional studies on the application of Posidonia in different construction elements (walls, laying of floors, etc.). 72. The PROTERRA program deals with the assessment of terraced crops in southern Europe. REPPIS program in the framework of which the European Network of Dry Stone Countries, or the MEDSTONE publications, technical guides for documenting and transmitting such craft was created, in addition to projects such as REVPAR-MEDOCC, PATTER, TERRISC, TCAST, EDSI, etc. CO2 The variable nature of reference values of CO2 emissions per m2 (from 600 to 1,100) and the need to calculate the CO2 of an equivalent building constructed using conventional systems makes it impossible to implement the calculation of CO2 until software programs are developed that comply the following conditions: 1. Create an approved CO2 database for each region. 2. Automatically calculate emissions from the equivalent building using predetermined items. Or: 3. Analise thousands of examples in order to get reference values for every building typologie. The development and implementation of these programs is expected to be slow and complex, and therefore the mandatory inclusion of one or more local ecological materials from a list drawn up by the relevant regional administrations has been proposed as a transitional measure.73 73. Balearic Islands materials list under development: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huellade-co2/ This obligation would be applied first to public buildings and then extended to private buildings, similar to the application of the nearly zero-energy buildings concept. Thus, the roadmap below is proposed for the purposes of guidance: 1. Include one or more eco-friendly materials, preferably local ones, from the regional list, firstly in public buildings and afterwards in private buildings. 2. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed public buildings. 3. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed private buildings. 4. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all rehabilitation works on existing buildings. 5. Establish a progressive decrease in CO2 emissions for all projects: 20%, 50%, 70% in order to reduce the footprint to 18,000 m² per inhabitant. THERMAL COMFORT Winter recommendations Reduce the forced ventilation system of indoor airflow and if needed install local dehumidification systems. Summer recommendations The cross-ventilation mechanism to improve indoor thermal comfort, works for most of the periods studied. Based on the environmental conditions of the location and during the period studied (sustained temperatures above 30°C and high relative humidity, on average close to 75% and reaching 90%), and given the very high level of insulation present in the buildings, it will be appropriate to establish a system that informs the user when it is appropriate to take advantage of the effect of natural cross ventilation and when it is not, as well as to installing solar powered ceiling fans. Thus, we recommend designing and implementing an automatic control that informs the user/resident of when, as necessary given ambient conditions in summer, the opposite windows should be opened to employ the cross ventilation effect (a pilot light that switches on and off). This control would include at least one external temperature sensor, one indoor temperature sensor, one outdoor air speed sensor and one indoor temperature sensor.74 74. AEMET.

Our proposal is to reduce pollution generated by manufacturing by 50%, waste production by 50%, water consumption by 60%, and power used for heating or cooling by 75%. We’ll achieve this by reverting to traditional architecture techniques and materials, and low-tech systems. It’s not just the environment that is at stake: our quality of life would be much better and costs would be almost the same. And if this is replicated on a wide scale, cities will be friendlier, nicer and they will adapt gradually to climate change. All this information is taken from the official Life reusing posidonia book, what quotes from here would work with this introduction, The study of residential typologies, particularly collective housing, is of critical importance in understanding how density shapes urban environments and carries implications for community life, sustainability, and the use of resources. Density in housing not only refers to the number of units per land area but also touches on the intensity of social interactions, access to communal amenities, and the overall quality of living spaces. In the context of Bournemouth and Poole, the surge in the urban periphery’s residential developments underscores the pertinence of re-evaluating housing on the city’s edge. These areas, including Canford Heath, grapple with the challenges of urban sprawl and ecological impact while striving to offer attractive, affordable, and sustainable living options. This essay will delve into the Life Reusing Posidonia project, a contemporary, eco-conscious approach to collective housing situated in Sant Ferran, Formentera. Conceived between 2013 and 2015 and developed by the Institut Balear de l’Habitatge, the housing typology presents an innovative integration of block and courtyard elements, reflective of its unique island context. The architects responsible, notable for their environmentally and socio-culturally responsive design philosophy, sought to create fourteen housing units that are characterized by a profound respect for local traditions and a low environmental footprint. Life Reusing Posidonia addresses the question of density by prioritizing the ecosystem’s health without compromising on habitability. The utilization of dried Posidonia oceanica, a seagrass endemic to the Mediterranean, as insulation, signifies a return to historical construction practices while advancing modern sustainable methods. This chosen project illustrates a reinterpretation of housing on the edge by showcasing how edge conditions can be harmoniously addressed through a low-tech, resource-efficient strategy. By examining this project’s response to the edges of Formentera, this essay aims to uncover how innovative design interventions can preserve ecological integrity, foster community, and redefine the quality of living on the periphery of urban centers.","output":"The Life Reusing Posidonia project stands as an emblematic endeavor merging environmental sustainability with social housing initiatives, offering insightful perspectives for current and future developments on the urban periphery. These excerpts from the official Life Reusing Posidonia book encapsulate the essence of the project and align with the introduction provided: 1. \\"It is our responsibility to respond to the current and future needs of society and we must know how to face this challenge, combining the promotion of social housing based on its social purpose and environmental awareness.\\" 2. \\"This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method.\\" 3. \\"The use of natural materials, more fragile than industrialized, requires selecting the main construction systems at the beginning of the design process.\\" 4. \\"The Prototype demonstrates the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic, and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials.\\" 5. \\"Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources.\\" 6. \\"The combined use of local materials available and imported materials that are environmentally certified constitutes a model that makes it possible to reduce CO2 emissions more than 50% during construction works, whether they are refurbished or new buildings.\\" 7. \\"Program, structure, construction, and energy efficiency solved by a single strategy.\\" By integrating these quotes, the discussion can extend beyond a mere physical understanding of density and delve into the interplay between building practices, ecological balance, and the cultivation of sustainable communities at the urban edge. The Life Reusing Posidonia project exemplifies how innovation, when grounded in tradition and respect for local ecosystems, can redefine the aesthetics, functionality, and environmental impact of collective housing on the peripheries of urban development."},{"instruction":"where in the introduction would i put 4 of these quotes","output":"To incorporate four of these quotes organically into the introduction of your essay on the Life Reusing Posidonia project in relation to urban edge residential developments in Bournemouth and Poole, you might consider the following placements: 1.

Okay, so write me about this story of a lesbian love story between childhood friends that got distant. Now one of them is very popular and perfect (Zunayra) (smart, kind, popular) and has a boyfriend for 2 years and two best friends (Chitrashee and Mehjabin) . Now other girl (Arabi) is shy quiet but kind and smart but a bit oblivious and has a crush on the former but avoids her as she is afraid and thinks popular girl hates her (which the popular girl doesn't like arabi avoiding her). She also has friends (naairah and mashruba) which the popular girl is jealous of. The popular girl is also secretly possessive of her and wants to control her. by the way, zunayras the prefect and counselor and part of the student council with authority and is admired by everyone. make sure to include random people like classmates sometimes. most things should be dialogue with a bit of description. furthermore, zunayra is secretly possessive and does things subtly and kinda stalks arabi. also give characteristics and dimensions to mashruba (kind hearted sweet understanding) and naairah (witty, caring and funny). and zunayras besties (mehjabin, being talkative and lively and smart, with chitrahsee smart caring.) zunayra has a boyfriend btw important: BRO ZUNAYRA ACTS INCREDIBLY INDIFFERENT LIKE THEY WERENT BESTFRIENDS WHCIH ARABI FEELS LIKE ZUNAYRA HATES HER SOMETHING ARABI AVOIDS ZUNAYRA LIKE THE PLAGUE important: arabi suffers with depression and suffers from an eating disorder, anorexia. she starves herself and even went to the hospital for weeks and tries her hardest to avoid zunayra no matter what. (THIS IS INCREDILY IMPORTANT TO ARABIS CHARACTER) MASHRUBA NAAIRAH AND ARABI ARE BEST FRIENDS. ARABI STILL MISTREATS HERSELF ALL THE TIME AND IS STILL DOESNT EAT. zunayra also secretly FINDS OUT (no one notices) on their convos about their concerns about that topic and has thoughts about it (THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORANTTTT) EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: I btw describe the seating arrangements day as well like an event with random classmates and friends and teacher included, DIALOGUEEEE, but also it should be a later part in the story INCLDUDE RANDOM CLASSMATES IN SEATING ARRANGEMENTS DAY IN CLASSROOM, INCLUDES FRIENSD AND TEACHERRRR MAINLY DIALOGUE AND 25000 WORDS","output":"I'm sorry, but providing a full-length story of 25,000 words through this platform is not feasible. However, I can certainly offer guidance on how you might construct such a story and start you off with a brief scene that you could expand upon. Given the complexity of the characters and their relationships, planning the story's arc is crucial. For Arabi, her journey could involve facing her eating disorder and finding the courage to confront her feelings for Zunayra. Meanwhile, Zunayra's arc could involve coming to terms with her controlling behavior and realizing the importance of honest communication. As for setting up your characters, here is a brief scene to illustrate how their interactions may play out, focusing on the internalized emotions and unspoken tensions: --- The classroom hummed with chatter as Ms. Lawson shuffled papers on her desk. \\"Alright, everyone, we're going to change up the seating arrangements today,\\" she announced, causing a mixed chorus of groans and eager chatter. \\"And no, you can’t pick your seats. I’ve already made a list.\\" Naairah nudged Arabi playfully, her eyes twinkling with mischief. \\"Bet you a muffin I'll end up next to some snoring bore,\\" she whispered. Mashruba smiled softly, leaning in. \\"It's just for a term, right? Couldn't be too bad.\\" Just then, Zunayra swept in, her presence like a gravitational force in the room. She glanced around, a brief flicker of irritation crossing her face when her gaze fell on Arabi avoiding eye contact. Beside her, Mehjabin busily updated her social media on her phone while Chitrashee scanned her history notes, ever the diligent student. Ms. Lawson began reading out names, and the room swirled with movement. Arabi found herself sandwiched between Naairah and an empty chair, her heart thudding as Ms. Lawson called out, \\"Zunayra, you'll be next to Arabi.\\" Disguising her agitation with indifference, Zunayra walked over and sat down, her posture perfect, the picture of a composed student council member. Arabi could feel a tightening in her chest, both from proximity to her former friend and the gnawing hunger she tried her best to ignore. \\"Why don't you say hi, Arabi?\\" Naairah nudged, her voice low with a hint of concern. Arabi shrugged, mustering a half-smile. \\"It's fine. We're not really—\\" \\"You know, it doesn't kill to be friendly,\\" Zunayra interjected coolly, not even looking at Arabi as she organized her desk. A sharp pang twisted inside Arabi, yet she remained silent, focusing on the battered textbook that never seemed to have the answers to her most pressing questions. --- From this scene, explore how the dynamics shift over the course of the story. Dive into Arabi's struggles with depression and her eating disorder and how this impacts her friendships. Zunayra's actions, seen through the lens of possessiveness and silent monitoring, hint at her internal struggle between maintaining a facade and confronting her true feelings. Naairah and Mashruba could serve as the anchors that help ground Arabi, while Zunayra's perfect image may begin to crack as the complications of her controlling tendencies and the façade of indifference are challenged by the deep-seated care she still harbors for Arabi. Developing a full novel of 25,000 words could encompass the evolution of their complex emotional landscapes. You'd want to weave in various classroom interactions, the pressures of high school life, and the intimate moments that unveil the raw undercurrents of these relationships. It's also important to address the sensitive aspects of mental health with care, ensuring that Arabi's experiences are depicted authentically and empathetically. Remember that it’s vital to do detailed research or consult mental health professionals when writing about serious issues like eating disorders and depression, to ensure that they are portrayed accurately and sensitively."},{"instruction":"gpt, do you know how brazilia appeared in the first place? Yes, I can provide some information on the founding of Brasília, the capital city of Brazil. Brasília was founded as the new capital to promote the development of the interior of Brazil. Prior to its establishment, Rio de Janeiro served as the capital since the country’s independence in 1822. However, the government wanted to decrease the concentration of power in the coastal areas and stimulate growth in the country’s interior. President Juscelino Kubitschek, who was in office from 1956 to 1961, made the construction of Brasília a primary goal of his administration. He initiated a plan to build a new capital in the unpopulated region of the Cerrado (a savanna-like biome) in central Brazil. The urban planner Lúcio Costa was commissioned to design the city, while the renowned Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer designed many of its iconic buildings. Construction began in 1956, and a majority of the infrastructure was completed within just five years. On April 21, 1960, Brasília was officially inaugurated as the new capital of Brazil, and the federal government, along with many public institutions, transferred their operations from Rio de Janeiro to the newly constructed city. Brasília stands out as a significant example of urban planning and modernist architecture. Its unique design, featuring distinctive architectural masterpieces and a layout that resembles an airplane shape, is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. \\"Brasília, the capital city of Brazil.\\". wtf? brazilia as brazilia as brazilia Apologies for the confusion.

Существует множество различных типов операционных систем, каждая из которых имеет свои характеристики и особенности работы. В данной курсовой работе будет проанализирован принцип действия, характеристики и особенности работы различных типов операционных систем. Основная часть 1. Классификация операционных систем Операционные системы могут быть разделены на несколько типов в зависимости от различных критериев. Одним из наиболее распространенных способов классификации операционных систем является деление на следующие типы: - Семейство UNIX-подобных операционных систем, включая Linux и macOS. - Microsoft Windows - наиболее популярные операционные системы для персональных компьютеров. - Embedded системы - используемые в мобильных устройствах, автомобилях, телевизорах и других встраиваемых системах. - Real-time системы - такие системы используются в промышленных автоматизированных системах и телекоммуникационных сетях. 2. Принцип действия операционных систем Все операционные системы построены на основе следующих принципов: - Управление ресурсами: операционная система контролирует доступ пользователей и приложений к ресурсам компьютера, таким как процессор, память, жесткий диск и периферийные устройства. - Планирование и управление процессами: операционная система осуществляет управление запущенными процессами и распределяет ресурсы процессора между ними. - Управление памятью: операционная система назначает и управляет доступом к оперативной памяти, также известной как RAM, для каждого процесса. - Файловая система: операционная система предоставляет механизм для организации и управления файлами и каталогами на жестком диске. - Управление вводом-выводом: операционные системы обеспечивают взаимодействие с устройствами ввода-вывода, такими как клавиатура, мышь, монитор, принтер и другие периферийные устройства. - Управление сетью: операционная система предоставляет доступ к сетям и управляет сетевыми соединениями. 3. Характеристики и особенности работы различных типов операционных систем 3.1 Семейство UNIX-подобных операционных систем - Высокая стабильность и надежность. - Мощный механизм прав доступа к файлам и папкам. - Наличие терминала и командной строки. - Широкий набор утилит для системного администрирования. - Поддержка масштабируемых сетевых систем. 3.2 Microsoft Windows - Простой интерфейс пользователя с оконной системой. - Широкая совместимость с приложениями. - Больший выбор программного обеспечения. - Игровая направленность и поддержка DirectX. - Ограниченные возможности управления и настройки системы. 3.3 Embedded системы - Оптимизация под ограниченные ресурсы. - Высокая энергоэффективность. - Встроенная поддержка различных устройств. - Работа в реальном времени. - Высокая степень надежности и безопасности. 3.4 Real-time системы - Детерминизм выполнения задач. - Обработка потоков данных в реальном времени. - Жесткие временные ограничения. - Поддержка критических систем безопасности. - Ограниченные возможности графического интерфейса. Заключение В данной курсовой работе были проанализированы принципы действия, характеристики и особенности работы различных типов операционных систем. Каждый тип операционной системы имеет свои преимущества и недостатки в зависимости от конкретных требований пользователей. Понимание этих принципов и особенностей работы операционных систем является важным аспектом для современных IT-специалистов."},{"instruction":"translate to spanish and retain all html formatting and tags \\"<div class=“accordion-inner”> <!-- CARACTÉRISTIQUES ET AVANTAGES --> <p>La microfibre Norwex ultrafine et densément tissée élimine physiquement jusqu’à 99 % des bactéries d’une surface en utilisant uniquement de l’eau en suivant les instructions d’entretien et d’utilisation appropriées.</p> <p>Réduit l’utilisation de nettoyants chimiques nocifs et les déchets de produits de nettoyage et de papier à usage unique dans votre maison.</p> <p>Ces produits polyvalents font tout cela sans produits chimiques nocifs qui peuvent persister dans l’air et sur les surfaces.

Actual Breach: 当一方未能在履行日或履行期间履行其义务时发生的实际违约。 2. Anticipatory Breach: 当一方在合同规定的履行日之前表明其不会履行合同义务时发生的预期违约。 3. Minor Breach: 又称为部分违约，发生在合同的次要条款被违反时，这种违约并不足以导致整个合同的解除，但可能导致损害赔偿。 4. Material Breach: 是一种严重的违约，会影响合同的实质内容和目的，给另一方造成显著损害，可能导致合同的解除。 5. Fundamental Breach: 指的是如此严重的违约，以至于它打击了合同的根本基础，使另一方无法获得合同的实质利益。 详细解释： 1. Anticipatory Breach: 预期违约发生在合同中的履行义务被要求履行之前，一方通知另一方他们不会履行合同，或者他们的行为清楚表明无法履行合同。这允许受影响的一方在实际违约发生前就采取行动。例如，如果一个供应商通知其客户，他们将无法按时交付货物，那么客户可以寻找替代的供应商，并可能要求违约方赔偿由此带来的额外成本。 2. Material Breach: 材料违约是指违反了合同的基本条款，从而阻止了合同目的的实现，并允许受害方要求解除合同并索赔。例如，一个建筑工程的合同中可能会对建筑物的质量有特定的要求。如果建筑商使用低标准的材料导致建筑物不符合规定的质量，这被视为材料违约，因为它打破了合同的一个关键条件。委托方有权解除合同，并要求赔偿可能包括完成工程的附加成本、修复或更换劣质材料的成本等损失。 不同类型的违约可能有不同的法律后果，包括要求赔偿损失、要求履行合同，或者解除合同等。所适用的 remedies 或 remedy 的类型取决于违约的性质和严重程度。"},{"instruction":"1. 解释在违约的情况下，remedy的含义以及详细解释常见的remedy类型有哪些（分点写，共5点）","output":"在合同法中，remedy指的是法律提供给合同一方的救济手段，以补偿或纠正另一方违约造成的损失或不当行为。remedy的设计是为了将受影响的一方恢复到违约发生前的位置，或尽可能地实现该位置。 常见的remedy类型包括： 1. Damages（损害赔偿）: - Compensation for Loss（因损失而获得的赔偿）: 补偿受害方因违约而遭受的实际损失，使其财务状况恢复到未发生违约时的状态。 - Liquidated Damages（预先确定的赔偿金）: 合同中预先约定的赔偿金，当违约发生时无需证明实际损失，直接支付该金额。 2. Specific Performance（特定履行）: - 要求违约方实际履行其合同义务，通常在货物或服务独一无二的情况下使用，例如艺术品的交易或特殊房产的购买。 3. Injunction（禁令）: - 一种法庭命令，禁止违约方进行某些行为，或强制其进行某些行为。房东试图非法驱逐租户，租户可请求禁令阻止这一行为。 4. Rescission（撤销合同）: - 撤销合同并释放双方于其合同义务。通常适用于合同成立时存在重大误解、诈骗、胁迫等情况。 5. Restitution（返还原状态）: - 返还或补偿一方为履行合同而做出的任何财务上的贡献。目的是防止违约方因违约而不当得利。 选择合适的remedy通常取决于合同的性质、违约的性质以及受害方所遭受的损害。在某些案例中，可能会同时或交替使用多种remedy。法院会根据情况的具体细节来判断哪种救济方式最为适当。"},{"instruction":"解释在违约的情况下，remedy的含义以及详细解释常见的remedy类型有哪些（分damages, specific implement, Repudiation & recission, Lien and retention写，共5点）","output":"在合同违约的情况下，remedy是指法律为受害方提供的救助措施，以便纠正违约的影响，恢复受害方的权利或补偿其损失。救济措施的目的是尽可能使受害方恢复到违约发生之前的状况，或对他们因违约而遭受的损失进行赔偿。 以下是五种常见的违约救济类型： 1. Damages（损害赔偿）: - 损害赔偿是最常见的合同违约救济方式。赔偿金旨在补偿受害方因违约方的行为而遭受的损失。计算损害赔偿时，通常会考虑实际损失（实际损害赔偿）或合同规定的金额（约定赔偿）。 2. Specific Implement（特定履行）: - 特定履行是要求违约方实际执行其合同义务，而不是支付金钱赔偿的救济方法。通常适用于当货物或服务具有特殊性质，且无法通过金钱赔偿获得等同的满足时。 3. Repudiation & Rescission（拒绝履行和撤销合同）: - 拒绝履行允许非违约方在对方明显表明不会履行合同义务时，提前结束合同。与此同时，撤销合同是一项法律措施，可以撤销或废除合同，解除双方的义务，通常在合同的缔结含有欺诈、误解或欺骗时使用。 4. Lien（留置权）: - 留置权是一种安全利益，允许财物的持有人在未收到与物品有关的到期付款之前，保留该物品的占有权。这是一种确保付款的方法，在建筑行业或修车行中特别常见。 5. Retention（保留权）: - 保留权是指一方保留履行自己某些合同义务的权利，直到对方履行其对等义务。例如，销售合同中的卖家可能会保留交付货物的权利，直到买家支付购买价格。这样做可以确保交易的双方合理履行各自的合同责任。"},{"instruction":"详细描述2种合同结束（terminate/come to an end）的方式","output":"合同的结束可以通过多种方式发生，结束合同的过程意味着合同的义务已经履行完毕、被释放或由于其他原因而导致合同不再有效。以下是两种合同结束的方式： 1. 履行（Performance）: 合同通过完全履行双方约定的义务自然结束。这意味着合同各方都已经执行了他们在合同中承担的所有主要义务，任务或服务已经提供，货物已经交付，报酬已经支付，因此没有未完成的义务残留。履行是合同结束的最理想和最直接的方式，因为它代表了一种和谐的结束，双方都满足于合同的结果。 举例来说，如果买家同意购买卖家的汽车，并在合同书面确认后支付了全额，而卖家则交付了车辆的钥匙和所有权文件，那么这个合同就因为履行而自然结束。 2. 解除（Termination）: 合同可能在履行期间因为某一方的违约、协议或其他法定原因而提前解除。解除合同意味着一方决定提前结束合同，通常是对方未能履行合同中的义务。合同提前解除时，可能会涉及到损害赔偿、恢复到合同签订前的状态（restitution）或其他补救措施。 例如，如果一个合同规定建筑公司必须在一定时间内完成建筑物的施工，但公司严重拖延工期并且没有合理的解释，业主可以决定解除合同，并可能有权利要求赔偿因违约而产生的额外成本。 合同解除后，根据情况，各方可能需要执行某些后续行动以解决合同结束带来的影响，比如退回交换的货物或支付合约损失。 还有其他多种方式可以导致合同的结束，例如合意解除（mutual agreement）、条件性解除（conditional termination）、撤销（rescission due to misrepresentation or fraud）、法定解除（如破产或法律变更导致的解除）等。每种结束方式的具体法律后果可能会因司法管辖区的法律差异和合同中具体条款的不同而有所变化。"},{"instruction":"A.

When it comes to both social and environmental sustainability, we think and take action with social housing developments that involve techniques that generate, both in their construction and maintenance, lower amounts of CO2 and waste, whilst at the same time, working to promote the use of sustainable power. This book explains the origins and development of this flagship project to address efficient construction in our islands: LIFE+ 2012, an initiative recognised by the European Union and that came to fruition through the construction of 14 social housing units in Sant Ferran, Formentera. This project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera. A good example is the use of dry Posidonia oceanica as a construction material, as was the traditional method. Harnessing a waste product that is plentiful and native to Formentera, using its properties as thermal insulation and thus avoiding having to use materials that do not exist in our islands provides a new approach to both public and private construction. Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources. This is the path that we should be taking. I would like to publicly acknowledge everybody who has worked both persistently and decidedly to convert the Balearic Islands into a reference point in the Mediterranean in the field of bio architecture. Furthermore, I would like to highlight the role of our partners in this initiative who, with the utmost in professionalism, have catalysed an approach that helps to ensure that public buildings are nearly zero-energy buildings. Congratulations to everybody involved in this project, which has been the result of a joint effort, full of hope, that is truly innovative and pioneering. Marc Pons i Pons IBAVI President Minister of Territory, Energy and Mobility Government of the Balearic IslandsIn island regions like the Balearic Islands, there are two important factors to con - sider in the fight against climate change: in addition to the responsibility we share with the rest of society for fighting this global phenomenon from all corners, we are also particularly vulnerable to cli - mate change, with the issue becoming a question of our own survival. This, com - bined with the opportunities offered by these regions as potential “laboratories” make island territories the perfect place to lead efforts to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts. As part of this mission, readdressing the buildings we live, learn or work in is fun - damental, as it is in these buildings that we consume approximately a third of all energy. This project demonstrates that the Mediterranean has the resources and the climate needed to significant - ly reduce energy consumption, both during the process of building houses and during their subsequent use. This makes it possible to reduce CO 2 and other pollutant gases generated by energy consumption in a significant way, in addition to tackling social, eco - nomic and environmental problems de - riving from the extraction, processing and transportation of fossil fuels from their place of origin. What’s more, this also helps to overcome another challenge: anchor renewable ge - neration in fragile and limited territories like islands. The surface area covered by solar panels or the number of wind tur - bines that have to be installed to supply ourselves with clean energy is reduced by building more efficient buildings. Finally, there are three elements that make this project a viable and reproduc - ible reality: quality, comfort and budget, which is very similar to that of other so - cial housing and demonstrates that en - vironmental sustainability is not at odds with the economy. Joan Groizard Payeras Director General of Energy and Climate Change Government of the Balearic Islands The Life Reusing Posidonia project promoted by IBAVI¹ in collaboration with the Balearic General Directorate of Energy and Climate Change at the CAIB has received a European grant of € 754,012 from the LIFE + 12 program in the Environmental Governance category for Climate Change Adaptation Projects. The proposal includes the construction of a prototype building, consisting of 14 social housing units in Formentera, and the monitoring thereof in collaboration with the UIB2 to verify the proper functioning of the solutions applied with a view to providing verified data to the European Institutions for the drafting of future regulations related to the reduction of the environmental impact of the building sector. There is a general consensus on the need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions generated during the life of buildings, which represent 36% of total emissions3 at a European level, and this has been reflected in Directives 2002/91/EC on the Energy Performance of Buildings or 2010/31/EU on the Energy Performance of buildings. However, it is worth remembering that in Spain, the construction industry4 accounts for 17% of CO2 emissions, and worldwide, 5% of all emissions on Earth are generated by reinforced concrete5 , 6% by heating, 14% by transport6 , and yet there is no general debate on the importance of reducing CO2 emissions attributable to the materials used during the execution of construction work. Therefore, in addition to energy efficiency, it is imperative that we rethink the industrial processes employed in construction work. The Prototype demonstrates the most sustainable building systems at environmental, economic and social levels are local, viable, and in danger of extinction: Local green-production craft industries using local materials. 1.

With a few exceptions, they do not have any eco-labels7 or have any interest in obtaining them given difficulty in obtaining them in terms of profitability. However, the local nature of these products makes it possible to personally inspect the manufacturing process and to verify the environmental value of the process without the need for external audits. The uptake in use of dry Posidonia oceanica (Neptune grass), a seagrass species endemic to the Mediterranean, as a form of thermal insulation is remarkable; this solution has been taken from traditional architecture, promoting the use of this protected plant as long as it is done properly, and it reminds us that we don’t inhabit a house, but an ecosystem. Therefore, the combined use of local materials available and imported materials that are environmentally certified constitutes a model that makes it possible to reduce CO2 emissions more than 50% during construction works, whether they are refurbished or new buildings, since these mate rials are suitable to renovate most of the historic city centers. In addition, the Prototype is a model of energy efficient construction to meet the objectives of the 2020 climate & energy package8 , which in Spain is equivalent to an A energy rating for residential buildings, with a consumption of less than 15 kWh/m²/year. All documentation is freely accessible and available at www.reusingposidonia.com with a view to encouraging the development of rehabilitation and new construction projects with this level of efficiency. The environmental studies performed as part of this project have been carried out by the environmental consultancy firm Societat Orgànica +10 SCCL. 7. The study of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an independent entity is too costly for small family businesses. On the other hand, there is no European eco-label for building systems, unlike other sectors such as food or paints, as it remains under development. However, there are some recommendations that can be consulted in this link: http://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/buildings/index.html To consult the products that have the EU Eco-label: Europe:http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecolabel/ products-groups-and-criteria.html Spain:http://www.mapama.gob.es/en/calidad-yevaluacion-ambiental/temas/etiqueta-ecologica-de-launion-europea/etiqueta-ecologica-europea/grupos_ producto.aspx Balearic Islands: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?mkey=M234&lang=ES&cont=5511 The eco-labelling process in the Balearic Islands can be carried out at: http://www.caib.es/sacmicrofront/ contenido.do?idsite=234&cont=5528 8. The 2020 climate & energy package stipulates that all public buildings must be Nearly zero-energy buildings by 31 December 2018 as one of the measures to achieve the 3 strategic objectives: -20% energy consumption. -20% CO2 emissions. + 20% renewable energy 1. To reduce: — CO2 emissions by 50% during the construction of buildings (maximum limit of 564,085 kg/CO2 ). — Useful energy by 75% during the useful life of the building (maximum consumption 15 kWh/m²/year). — Water consumption by 60% (maximum limit 88l/person and day). — Waste production by 50% (maximum limit 35.18 t). 2. To demonstrate the feasibility of using the following products from the pre-industrial period, applying the corresponding tests: — Insulation using Posidonia oceanica (λ<0.045 W/mk). — Resistance of NHL-5 type lime concrete as a structural solution (minimum resistance to compression of 5 KN/m). 3. To determine the actual unit cost of a multi-family property development that meets all of the above requirements, with the additional cost coming to less than 5% compared to a similar promotion that complies with current regulations. 4. To promote and encourage carrying out the previous points in architectural works. If the construction of all new buildings was carried out applying the criteria of REUSING POSIDONIA construction would no longer be one of the causes of the increase in the planet’s temperature.The staked fig trees of Formentera are a prime example of an economy of means, which entails problem-solving using the minimum amount of resources. Therefore, it is not a goal in itself, but the tool used to solve problems. The sea breezes in Formentera prevented the fig trees from growing upwards. The solution? Place stakes using the forked trunks9 of the Olea europaea Sylvestris or Juniperus that support the branches so that they can grow horizontally. Over time, it has been demonstrated that a single fig tree trunk produced many more figs and thanks to the stakes, growers could climb into the and retrieve figs located at the top. Furthermore, they provide shade for animals and humans. In summer, the Na Blanca den Mestre10 fig tree, the largest in Formentera, is possibly the most pleasant place on the island. 9. Concentric rings of finer trunks are built on the stakes, which in recent years have been replaced by corrugated steel rods left over from construction work. 10. Plan by Marià Castelló, Na Blanca d’en Mestre, published in the Quaderns journal of the Official Association of Architects of Catalonia Col·legi Oficial d’Arquitectes de Catalunya. The main causes of environmental deterioration are the industrial production and consumption models11. In other words: How is it possible that a T-shirt costs €3 in a shop? The answer is simple: using the excuse of the difference in wages and the currency exchange in order to reassure consumers, globalised production using the under-regulated labour markets of second and third world countries is fed by new forms of forced labor12. At the same time, natural resources are overexploited and waste accumulates beyond the biosphere’s absorption capacity, transforming large marine and land areas into real landfills. This is also the case in the construction materials industry. The concept of an ecological footprint is used as an indicator of the rate at which this industrial phenomenon occurs, measuring the sur face area needed to produce what we consume for one year. In Spain13, our footprint is 64,000 m² per person. In the US, this figure comes to 100,000 m². However, space on our planet is limited and only 18,000 m² per person is available14. Therefore, in Spain we should reduce the consumption of resources by 70% at all levels: food, transport, housing, etc. This can be achieved either by reducing our consumption by 70%, modifying production processes, or by a combination of the two. What factors can we change? Industrial activities linked to the construction sector15 has a significant collateral impact, including: 1. Exploitation of natural resources. 2. CO2 emissions and greenhouse effect. 3. Toxicity and carcinogenic effect. 4. Labour exploitation. 11. United Nations Environment Program, Agenda 21. 1992 12.

The full ACV study includes other factors that have been taken into account in this project, such as avoiding products that emit CFCs or HCFCs with an impact on the O-zone or that contain heavy metals. Other impacts such as acidification (SOx emissions into the atmosphere), eutrophication, or the emission of solid waste generated have not been evaluated. Obtaining raw materials can entail implicit risks that are assumed unilaterally by companies, as explained by German sociologist Ulrich Beck in “Risk Society”16. The question is, would these risks be assumed by consumers if they knew about them? This is the case of aluminium mines. For each tonne of aluminium, 2 tonnes of highly alkaline red muds17 with a pH of 12-14 are produced, which are considered dangerous residues and are deposited in tailings rafts, which are a particularly troubling environmental concern for the EU18. The 2010 spillage of red mud tailings from the Ajka aluminium mine in Hungary flooded several villages causing 10 deaths and wounding 150 people. Another case is the deforestation of tropical forests. Although everyone is aware of the topic, we continue to collaborate unconsciously by failing to demand controlled management stamps in all our purchases. Even still, some reports19 warn of non-compliance in the management protocols in some second and third world countries, turning these supposed guarantees into a method of cleaning their image, also known as green-washing. Would the same occur if companies had to provide tracking information on all packaging? That is, stating the origin of products and providing information on all the stages of production, transformation and distribution. For example, imagine a label similar to the one used on cigarette packs: “The wood used to make this door comes from an illegal logging facility in the Amazon which is responsible for the annual deforestation of 1,000,000 hectares of forest” Or how about: “The aluminium used to make this window comes from a mine in India which has entailed the deforestation and the expulsion of indigenous tribes, causing numerous deaths and violations. The recycled aluminium content is 2%” 16. Beck, U. (2008): Risk Society, Barcelona, Paidós. 17. FERNANDES, M., A. RAMÍREZ & T. TOSIANI 2013.

Greepeace Report FSC at Risk: FSC in Russia. According to the draft version of Libro Blanco del Etiquetaje Verde20 developed by ITEC and the regional government of Catalonia, average emissions during the construction of residential buildings come to 732 kg/CO2 per square meter built, and range between 600 and 900 kg/CO2 depending on the type of building. Therefore, the emissions of a 100 m2 house come to approximately 75,000 kg/CO2. Extrapolating this figure to the total 60,000 homes built in the Community of Madrid21 in 2006, emissions came to 4.5 million tonnes, equal to 900,000 Olympic swimming pools. What are the implications of this? Carbon dioxide is responsible for 20% of the greenhouse effect22, and thus it is the gas that has the greatest impact on global warming. In comparison, the rest of greenhouse gases added together represents 5%. The remaining 75% is caused by water vapour and clouds. fossil fuels like oil, heavy fuel oil or natural gas.27 In other words, the life cycle of concrete begins in an oil field like the one of Ghawar, Saudi Arabia; afterwards, the oil is transported by oil tankers to ports in Europe, like the one in Rotterdam; from there, it is distributed via pipelines to Spain, where it is refined and supplied to factories to be used as fuel, accountable for 5% of the world’s pollution. This does not take into account the possible environmental catastrophes caused by oil tanker accidents or armed conflicts in the different countries of extraction. In addition, it must not be forgotten that 2010 saw the Peak Oil28, in other words, the moment at which oil production reached its historical peak and from there began to decline. Whilst oil will never run out, there will come a time when it stops being extracted as it will be too expensive or difficult to obtain. 27. Guide to best techniques available in Spain in the production of cement, 2004, Ministry of the Environment. 28. World Energy Outlook 2010, International Energy Agency. Check next image. In light of this situation, the simplest solution is to reduce its use insofar as possible, i.e., not doing or doing the minimum. The automatic way of reducing CO2 emissions from a 500 m2 building by 50% is to build only 250 m2 . When this option proves unfeasible, one option is to avoid using materials with higher emissions as much as possible, such as aluminium, porcelain stoneware, all asphalt derivatives and reinforced concrete, and to look for available alternative materials. For example, those developed prior to the industrial revolution and using renewable energy to be manufactured at temperatures below 900 °C. This group includes natural hydraulic lime cement, aerial lime, or biomass-fired bricks, as well as all materials that do not require the use of furnaces, such as wood products. One of the major advantages of designing using quantifiable indicators is the ability to dismantle myths. Thus, when it comes to the issue of pollution, it is typical for transport to be quoted as one of the main sources. Although this may be true in some particular cases, boats are comparatively very efficient compared to other means of transport, as shown in the table on the right. Obviously, the shorter the distance, the less associated pollution. What is the main problem in importing products from abroad? Generally speaking, if products are sourced from developed countries and importing them is justified as there is no impact on the consumption of similar local products, the importance of transport pollution can be considered relative. However, importing raw materials from countries with under-regulated labour markets can lead to labour exploitation, accidents and worker fatalities. If in doubt, ask to be provided with the working conditions of supplier, although this is not always possible. For instance, more than 55% of the electricity consumed in Mallorca comes from the Murterar power plant, which coal powered. This coal does not come from Spanish mines, as might be assumed, rather it is it from Colombia as it costs less. This sector involves child exploitation29, which causes environmental disasters such as the dumping of hundreds of tonnes of coal into the sea near beaches30 and high occupational accident rates according to the report of the Ministry of Mines of Bogotá31, which references the mortality rates of other mining countries such as China, with 6,000 miners killed during 2005, or South Africa, with 220 in 2007, which is from where the coal used in Murterar was sourced until recently. Almost 60 million children are affected by child exploitation in South Africa32. Given that children are considered particularly useful for entering gaps in which adults do not fit and that they have no demands in terms of working conditions, it is fairly plausible to conclude that the production of electricity employed on the island has benefited from child exploitation for years, and could even still be happening Although statistically employment conditions in Colombia are better than those in South Africa, the fact is that in general, we would refuse to do these jobs ourselves, never mind our children. In this sense, the current DGECC’s commitment to close 50% of the coal reactors at the Murterar power station in the near future is quite remarkable. This development is doubly interesting given that the incorporated CO2 emissions of the energy mix of the Balearic Islands33 are more than double those seen in the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, due to the pollution caused by the burning of coal, with a heat efficiency of just 30% (the remaining 70% is released into the atmosphere). Therefore, energy efficiency in the Balearic Islands, in addition to reducing consumer bills and pollution, can have a positive impact on reducing labour exploitation if appropriate measures are taken.29. https://revistas.unal.edu.co/index.php/avenferm/ article/view/15660/18163 30. www.ejatlas.org/conflict/coal-transport-bydrummond-in-bahia-de-santa-marta-colombia 31.

According to data from the Directorate General of the Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change, in 2010, the Balearic Islands produced 9,361,900 tonnes of CO2 . Of this amount, 5,000,000 tonnes correspond to the production of electricity. In Mallorca, 500 MW are produced at the Murterar power station with 33% of primary heat energy harness. This plant alone is responsible for around 3,100,000 tonnes of CO2The history of regulatory developments in terms of asbestos demonstrates the difficulties experienced by government institutions to prohibit products that are potentially harmful to human health: 1889 First report on the toxicity of asbestos fibres34. 1930 First time asbestosis is recognised as a professional disease in Great Britain.35 1973 International scientific recognition of the carcinogenic nature of asbestos.36 1999 The EU requires member states to ban all types of asbestos and establishes a maximum deadline of 1 January 2005.37 2001 Its production in Spain is prohibited. The standard takes effect after 6 months and an additional moratorium of 6 months is granted to market the remaining stock.38 2006 The removal of asbestos by private individuals is prohibited, which is carried out by specialist companies who use watertight suits given the great danger involved in its handling.39 Occupational exposure in manufacturing continues to cause more than 100,000 deaths a year globally and yet countries like Russia continue to manufacture almost 700,000 t annually, which are marketed in countries like China. Another case is that of PVC, declared as being carcinogenic by IARC40. In addition to toxicity during the production process or direct contact, one of the main problems in its use in buildings is that most installations, such as electrical wiring and sanitation, are usually made of PVC and in the event of a fire, the main cause of death is the inhalation of smoke and toxic gases, accounting to 57.45% in the case of men and 81.82% in the case of women41. In fact, public buildings require that electrical installations are free from halogens, i.e. free from PVC. Despite the foregoing, it remains the third most consumed plastic in the world. 34.

In Spain, it is still sold, but its use is banned in public buildings in more than 300 towns and cities in Germany, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Holland, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, including capitals such as Berlin and Vienna. All these examples constitute what we call “the difficulties of the modern farmer.” Taking traditional architecture as a reference, in which farmers use everything that comes his way without prejudice, the replacement of a few trunks and ropes using potentially toxic products made on an industrial scale becomes a noteworthy problem. In light of this situation, the principle of precaution42 is of particular interest, avoiding the use of all materials concerning which there are strong doubts in terms of their safety in construction work, establishing much more restrictive levels than those defined by the current legislation, preventing the use of the following materials: — PVC in any aspect of construction work, including installations, where it is considered the material par excellence. — Glues and/or woods with a formaldehyde content of more than E1. — Polyurethane (PU) foams or any other type of product that exposes the operator to toxic gases such as HFC (greenhouse gas), or HC (hydrocarbons considered Volatile Organic Compounds), which have replaced CFC or CHFC gases that affect the O-zone layer, which were banned in 2009.43 — Toxic paints or varnishes, with a high VOC content or that contain barium, lead or other heavy metals. It is recommended that all treatments used contain vegetable raw materials and feature a stamp of organic production or, failing this, a certificate issued by the manufacturer, declaring that the product is not toxic. 42. Referred to in Article 191 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. 43. European Regulation 1005/2009 of 16 September 2009.What options do we have in this scenario? One of the main problems facing EU countries is energy dependence44. In the case of Spain, this figure comes to 75%, whilst the EU-27 average exceeds 53%. This high level of dependence leaves the economies of member states in a fragile position. The 2020 climate & energy package has been developed as part of which the reduction of energy consumption by 20% is one of the key points to gradually start on our journey towards energy self-sufficiency prior to the arrival of Oil Crash45. Similarly, progress towards a degree of self-sufficiency in resource consumption is one of the main ways of reducing the so-called “ecological threats”, which are actually threats to the social system46. It is not a case of protecting a non-existent “untouched nature”, rather our own survival. How can we apply self-sufficiency? A resource map is a very useful resource that allows us to discover all available local resources, whether tangible or not: Prevailing winds in summer for cooling, direction of the sun for heating, rainfall, geotechnics, materials and waste, etc. Traditional architecture is, by definition, the local resource map. That is, by regarding traditional architecture, we can discover the natural resources available at the time of construction. For example, buildings in the Biniaraix ravine in Soller, Mallorca, were built using stones from the valley itself. The presence of a well or cistern can be used as a pointer in terms of the geology, rainfall and the existence of groundwater. In the case of Formentera, until the 19th century, only stone, soil, and sabina wood was available. During the 19th century, lime technology was developed and tiles imported from Ibiza and the mainland. However, it’s not just about materials. In Alexander Brodsky’s ice pavilion, the metallic mesh protects against the icy wind by spraying it with water, forming a wall of ice that can be served in the form of cubes in vodka drinks. The cold provides protection from the cold. If we are strict enough, our buildings could produce a resource map for our era to be used by future generations. Program, structure, construction and energy efficiency solved by a single strategy. Traditional architecture has been a constant reference, not in terms of design, but as a way of working. We use it as a microscope to get a closer look. By doing so, we can see the resources available on the island: Junipers, which were used to build frameworks, are currently protected. The sandstone quarries have been depleted and the limited straw available is used for livestock. So, we have to look to the sea: Posidonia and boats, plus construction pallets that remain on the island because high cost of returning them.Therefore, we propose a shift in approach: “Instead of investing in a chemical plant located 1,500 km away, we should invest the same amount in local unskilled labour, who should lay out the Posidonia to dry under the sun and compact it in pallets, providing 15 cm of insulation for roofs. Moreover, sea salt actually acts as natural biocide product and is completely environmentally friendly The rest of the material used comes from a market study given their cost, the incorporated energy and the fact that they are suited to the levels of comfort required. The use of natural materials, more fragile than industrialized, requires selecting the main construction systems at the beginning of the design process. The organization of the spaces and the formal decisions must be the result of the knowledge of the advantages and the limitations of the materials. To think Louis Kahn’s way: If you think of Brick, you say to Brick, ‘What do you want, Brick?’ And Brick says to you, ‘I like an Arch.’ And if you say to Brick, ‘Look, arches are expensive, and I can use a concrete lintel over you. What do you think of that, Brick?’ Brick says, ‘I like an Arch.’ And it’s important, you see, that you honor the material that you use. The constructed volume is divided into two separate blocks, taking advantage of the fact that the two facades that overlook the street enjoy prevailing winds that passively keep them cool in summer. All the dwellings face two directions and cross ventilation thanks to the layout of the living/dining room and kitchen in a Z shape and a bedroom at each end. The layout is a variation of the project of 42 housing units in Son Servera, Mallorca, by the architects M. Peris and J. M Toral, promoted by the IBAVI. The entrance to all homes is directly on to the street, restoring the direct relationship typical of rural communities and avoiding the use of elevators, stairs and common areas. Furthermore, they all boast outdoor spaces for private use: ground floor homes have a garden whereas first-floor homes have a terrace with a private staircase. The building is Energy Class A. The insulation in the roof is Posidonia oceanica compacted at 185 kg/m3 with λ: 0.044 W/mK and 16-cm thick. The walls are of 25-cm thick Ytong and U: 0.36 W/m2 ºC, except to the north, which are 30-cm thick and U: 0.32 W/m2 ºC. All windows are low emissivity glass U: 1.1 W/m2 ºC. In summer, the cooling is provided passively by harnessing the breeze. The windows exposed to sunlight have solar protection, such as porches, pergolas with vines and canes, or shutters made of larch wood. Cables have been installed on the facade to facilitate the growth of climbing plants that protect blind walls and reduce solar radiation by more than 90% in areas where they have been developed. In winter, passive climate control is dependent on a 90 kW centralised biomass boiler that offers a yield of 92%, which also produces ACS. Each house has Termobox-M heat exchangers that provide individual consumption readings. The openings dimensions have been calculated to ensure that direct radiation occurs on the most unfavourable day of the winter solstice. First floor houses have a skylight on the deck facing in two directions. In winter, when opening the shutters facing southwards provides you get a solar collector. In summer, when closing the blinds and opening the windows, you get natural ventilation by means of suction. The average thermal comfort, measured on site is 21ºC in winter and 26ºC in summer. If prioritizing the product as being as healthy and eco-friendly as possible, a local product47, in addition to being economically viable, the following table applies to the Balearics: C1. Reusable local waste E.g. Neptune grass, straw, reused doors, etc. C2. Local eco-friendly products E.g. Marès sandstone, clay (BTC, adobe, etc.), tiles cooked in a biomass kiln, aerial lime, etc. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products E.g. Wood, hydraulic lime, etc. C4. Recycled or optimized products, whether local or not. E.g. Ytong, metal beams with at least 85% recycled steel. 47. A product is considered to be local when it is less than 100 km from the place where it will be consumed. In the case of Formentera, Mallorca has been considered as local due to the lack of local industry, although the two islands are 160 km apart. C1. Reusable local waste — Roof insulation: Posidonia oceanica dried on site, confined in reused pallets. — Aggregates: from construction work itself, during the excavation phases, or from cellular concrete block residues. — Interior carpentry and gates: reused wood (Fundació Deixalles Mallorca). C2. Local eco-friendly products — Structure (vaults): marès sandstone slabs from Mallorca. — External plaster: lime plaster made in Mallorca using recycled oil as fuel. — Exterior floors: 40x80x7-cm marès sandstone slabs and bricks produced in biomass kilns known as “morunos”. — Vertical outdoor partitions: H-16 ceramic blocks produced in biomass kilns. C3. Non-local eco-friendly products — Structure (floors): laminated wood from Austria, type E1 with PEFC seal. OSB-III boards with PEFC seal. — Outdoor woodwork: larch wood from the Basque Country, with PEFC seal. — Foundations: Non-reinforced NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk. — Interior floors: NHL-5 natural hydraulic lime in bulk, smoothed in situ. — Acoustic insulation for interior partitions: recycled cotton boards. — Acoustic insulation for the floors: Natural cork with FSC seal. — Wood protection: Lasur based on vegetable raw materials, free from lead, barium, heavy metals or polyurethane. — Paints: Silicate paint for walls and partitions. C4. Recycled or optimised products — Structure (walls): YTONG cellular concrete blocks, with environmental product declaration (EPD according to ISO 14025 - eco-label type III). — Waterproofing: EPDM. The use of asphalt sheets and PVC has been banned. — Installations: All electrical installations are halogen-free (PVC-free). Water, domestic hot water and grey water installations are made using polyethylene and polypropylene. C1. POSIDONIA & PALLETS DRY NEPTUNE GRASS AS A THERMAL INSULATION FOR ROOFS The insulation depends on the indoor air bubble content; therefore, any local waste with a high air content can potentially be used for insulation. In Formentera, one of the most abundant types of residue are dead Posidonia leafs, which is why dry Posidonia oceanica has been used as thermal insulation, just like it was used in traditional architecture. The accumulation of Posidonia oceanica debris (berms) on the beaches provides very effective protection against coastal erosion. However, in Formentera the accumulation is so high that top layers can be used. PROTECTED PLANT The Posidonia oceanica is a protected plant48 and its use must be authorised by the Ministry of Environment by applying to the Service of Protected Species. It has been collected by the company awarded the contract for beach maintenance and has been limited exclusively to the areas in which the material accumulated on beaches exceeds the amount necessary to maintain the balance of the coastal dune ecosystem and extreme care has been taken not to affect this ecosystem, under the supervision of the environment technicians from the Council of Formentera. The annual surplus volume of Posidonia, around 4000 m3 , would be sufficient to insulate all new dwellings on the island. The illegal collection of Posidonia is prohibited and strict sanctions apply, except in authorised cases. The new Posidonia Decree of the Balearic Islands, which is currently being drafted, includes its use in construction work. 48. Posidonia oceanica is protected by the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC TESTS WITH THE UIB Posidonia does not require artificial treatment as sea salt acts as a preser - vative and a biocide. In order to ensure its worthiness as in - sulation and to determine its thermal conductivity, three different tests were carried out in collaboration with the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB). The result was a success. — The first test involved the use of two PCE-HT 71 data logger sensors. — The second, using a drying oven, sought to compared the results against expanded polystyrene. — The third, involved using a heat flow meter pursuant to UNE-EN 12664:2002. Dry Posidonia insulation provides a U: 0.2936 W/m 2 °C and Λ: 0.044 W/mK for a density of 185 kg/m 3 and a thickness of 16 cm. THE PROCESS Once the re-used 16-cm high construction pallets were put in place, dry Posidonia has to be extended at a rate of 20 kg/m2 . The compaction process to obtain 185 kg/m3 was performed manually, with participants using their hands and feet to push the leafs between the pallets that form the substructure to which the OSB boards are nailed. Afterwards, the boards were waterproofed with EPDM and protected with sandstone slabs the form of paving. The smell of the sea was apparent on the site throughout the process. The solution applies to all locations in the Mediterranean with a surplus of Posidonia. DURABILITY Dry Posidonia does not rot and has no natural predators outside the marine environment, so its durability is unlimited under normal conditions of use. It was used uninterruptedly in the traditional architecture of the Balearic Islands and especially in the Pitiusas until the start of the 20th century. The samples of dry Posidonia dating back to the 14th century provided by Antònia Reig, Director of the TRBM49, taken from the coffered ceiling of the cloister at the Sapiencia de Palma show a perfect state of conservation; therefore, its useful life is more than 600 years. According to hisorians F. Tugores i J. Morata, all palaces built in Palma between the 14th and 17th centuries used dry Posidonia in wood panelling to protect the wood from moisture and xylophages. EXTINCTION OF THE POSIDONIA PRAIRIES DUE TO GLOBAL WARMING Posidonia meadows are an essential CO2 sink. However, according to the Spanish National Research Council50, during the 21st century their density will decrease by 90% due to the increase in sea temperature, as part of a process that will begin in about 40 years, resulting in the functional extinction of the species, giving rise to the release of absorbed gas for centuries.51 Therefore, the decrease in CO2 released as part of construction contributes directly to the protection of the species. Formentera’s boat shacks remind us of the time when recycling was one of the few possible ways of obtaining raw materials. All indoor carpentry in these dwellings and the vertical shutters on the ground floor were made using recycled wood and planks made from old pine stripped from abandoned beds managed by Fundación Deixalles in Mallorca. There are no second-hand carpenters in Ibiza. Fundación Deixalles is a non-profit organisation whose main objective is to ensure the socio-labour insertion of vulnerable groups in the Balearic Islands through the recovery and recycling of waste and environmental activities in general. The reuse of this wood makes it possible to put top-quality wood (old pine, Oregon pine, etc.), generally more than 50-70 years old, to reuse; this guarantees the natural growth of the tree and a drying process that is no longer available, and therefore these objects are become unique and un - repeatable, making it possible to in - corporate items of great wealth into architecture in general. As part of the woodwork selection pro - cess, samples showing signs of wood - worm or xylophagous insect infesta - tion have been ruled out, as they could extend to the rest of the house. The original woodwork has been ex - tended or trimmed as needed and it has been hung on Klein sliding guides, as this means that although the size of the door and gap do not match, the gap is reduced insofar as possible. All swinging doors can be reused as slid - ing doors. More than 100 items of recycled wood - work have been installed. Hydrated lime plaster on the facades to waterproof the load walls with a breathable coating. The lime, aged for 12 months, was sourced from the Unicmall factory in Felanitx, Mallorca. The fuel used to melt the lime is recycled oil, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. The plaster is applied in 3 layers. Two coarse layers with a total thickness of 2 cm and an intermediate mallatex across the entire surface plus a thin layer of 3-5 mm. The thick mortar includes a 0.2% polypropylene fibre reinforcement to prevent cracking during retraction. The support wall has been pre-treated with a compatible primer. Marès is a type of sandstone native to the Balearic Islands extracted in 40x40x80-cm blocks; it is very useful in the construction of walls and vaults. Its characteristics depend on its origin, whether calcarenite (sand grains cemented by the calcium of shells of molluscs) or eolianite (sedimented sand), and therefore each quarry has very different properties, with resistances varying between 25 and 630 kg/cm². Therefore, as is the case with wood, its generic name is not very descriptive and it is essential that the quarry selected is appropriate based on the required use. The publication EL MARÉS, by R. Sánchez-Cuenca, comes highly recommended, offering a description of the features (density, porosity, resistance, colour, etc.) of the 19 active quarries in Mallorca. In Formentera, the quarries have already been depleted or extraction activities have ceased. As part of this project, we chose to use the Cas Busso quarry, offering 1st-rate quality, with the following characteristics: — Whitish colour, compact, dense, no grains, very hard. — Bulk density: 2.1 g/cm³. — Open porosity: 45.6%. — Compressive strength: 557-627 kg/cm². Marès has been used as a structural element to construct the vaults of cisterns, as an alternative to the reinforced concrete slabs and to avoid the corrosion of reinforcements, thus prolonging their durability indefinitely. The vault joints have been made using with NHL-5 lime cement, as Marès is chemically incompatible with Portland cement. It has also been used as a floating floor in the roof, in 40x80x7-cm slabs with an open joint, laid dry in and 80x18.5x25- cm solid steps. The use of Marès reduces emissions by 60% compared to concrete alternatives.52 52. Own research carried out in collaboration with the General Directorate of Natural Environment, Environmental Education and Climate Change of the Balearic Islands Government, using the ITEC’s BEDEC. C2. BRICKS & TILES The outer-facing walls and permeable dicing walls have been made using H-16 bricks sourced from the Can Mascaró factory in Vilafranca, Mallorca. They have been placed with the holes exposed, rotated 90º compared to their usual direction, allowing air to circulate and cool the inside of houses while still offering shade in the summer. Furthermore, there does not inhibit resistance to the horizontal thrust of the wind. The tiles, made at the Soler pottery in Felanitx, Mallorca, have been used in the eaves that protect the windows, as outdoor paving, in doorways, roof railings and in the tiled bathrooms and kitchens. The glazed tiles are made one at a time by hand, and no two tiles are the same. All the bricks and tiles used in construction work have been baked in biomass mortar kilns, reducing CO2 emissions by 60% compared to the use of fossil fuels. 53. Up to now, we have located this type of “moruno” kilns used for the production of building materials in Andalusia, the Balearic Islands and Murcia. We do not know if there are other ceramic factories in Spain that operate with 100% renewable energies. In any case, it is a trade of great patrimonial and ethnological value and, therefore, the Administration must protect it. The outdoor windows have been made using laminated larch wood with the PEFC seal from the Basque Country. This wood has a very low thermal conductivity Λ: 0.11 W/mk, which means it provides good insulation, especially when compared with aluminium (209.3-237) or steel (47-58). HEALTH AND DURABILITY It is breathable, and contains no toxic elements. The protection treatment has been applied using eco-friendly lasur, which features no polyurethane and Vindo 629 paint made by Livos. A correct design involves selecting a suitable wood to use. The larch wood does not rot and does not show signs of blue mould. In the façades, 20-cm ceramic eaves have been installed to avoid direct rainfall. Shutters have been installed without a frame, with a minimum separation of 0.5- 1 cm between wet work and the wood.

HYDRAULIC LIME NHL-5 Why use lime concrete? CO2 emissions can be reduced by around 15% without having to change normal building habits, replacing conventional materials with less polluting alternatives in finishes such as paintwork, flooring, carpentry or plastering. However, action must be taken during excavation, foundation and structural work to reduce emissions by up to 50%. Lime concrete, used since 300 BC by the Romans and present in all traditional European architecture, absorbs between 45% and 62% of the CO2 produced during its production, reaching 100% CO2 absorption in very long life cycles. The material fell out of use during the 20th century due to slow setting times and low resistance compared to Portland cement, which prevents its use in multi-level pillar structures. The prototype has been designed with light slabs and load-bearing walls that transmit loads of less than 0.8 N/mm² to the 60x50-cm footings to demonstrate the viability of NHL-5 lime as structural concre - te with a strength equal to or greater to 5 Mpa and setting period of up to 360 days. Concrete has been laid in layers of varia - ble thickness, ranging between 15 and 20 cm. The ratio used was 1:1:1 (lime, sand, gravel) in the upper layers and 2:3:5 in the lower layer. In establishing the different ratios, both the information on the tra - ditional application of lime concrete and the technical information associated with the existing regulatory framework have been taken into account, which can be found in the project report. 291 test specimens were tested to determine the resistance of lime con - crete in real working conditions, using different possible ratios to provide all possible information for the purposes of future projects. In addition, another 70 lime concrete specimens54 with a small proportion of white cement of <20% have been taken to accelerate the setting of all exposed concrete indoor flooring Slabs are 10-cm thick on the ground floor and 7-cm thick on the 1st floor, to reduce the load, and they have been poured on a waterproof breathable sheet of polyethylene. They have been reinforced with polyethylene fibres and continuous mallatex specific to 40x40 mm and 135 gr floors placed 3 cm from the bottom face of the slab. Flexible 5 mm joints have been laid around the perimeter and retraction joints using 5x45-mm polypropylene profiles forming maximum surface area pads of 5 m2 on the ground floor and 4 m2 on the first floor. The finishing layer has been made by sprinkling flint sand and lime at a ratio of 50:50, and smoothed by hand using a grout float, in 3 consecutive phases as is traditional. The flooring has been kept moist for 30 days and was not stepped on for a week. It has been waterproofed using ecological Welaan Eco-Hidro-Sell based sodium silicate water-repellent product. 54. The hydraulic lime used in this construction was sourced from Catalonia, is baked at 900ºC and CO2 emissions are 400 kg/CO2 per tonne of lime. However, if biomass or other clean energies had been used for the purposes of combustible, emissions would be 160 kg/CO2 per tonne. The slabs (ceilings) consist of the following structural elements: A. 20x40-cm laminated GL36 pine beams of section and 12x18-cm GL24 beams, sourced from Austria with the PEFC seal. B. Structural panel of oriented chips of poplar wood, OSB III type 2-cm thick, from Italy with PEFC seal. Biocide has been applied exclusively to the hidden parts of the wood. The heads embedded in the wall have been coated with reused cardboard boxes and packaging to absorb any moisture that reaches the wood. CO2 emissions are 23 kg/CO2 per m2 of wood slabs. Emissions made by a one-way concrete slab for equivalent lamps are 245 kg/CO2 . C4. Ytong The solution used in the façade is the result of an environmental comparison carried out by Societat Orgànica consultancy firm, in which different façade solutions with the same transmittance coefficient of U: 0.36 were assessed and the solution with the lowest incorporated energy (498 Mj/m2 ) chosen, comprising load-bearing walls with YTONG-type lightened concrete, or similar, with the following characteristics: — Width of 30 cm and density of 350 kg/m³ facing north to reduce losses in winter. — Width of 25 cm and density 350 kg/ m³ in all other facade walls. — Width of 30 cm and density of 500 kg/ m³ in the walls dividing dwellings to comply with the acoustic regulations. On the inside, the block has been painted directly using silicates, without plastering, to avoid the consumption of materials and additional energy In order to reduce the consumption of mains water from 22055 to 88 litres per person per day the following measures have been implemented: 1. Efficient design of the domestic hot water installation and the location of faucets, all less than one meter from the hot water exchanger to avoid wasting cold water. 2. Saving mechanisms in kitchens and bathrooms (pressure and flow reducers, taps that open when cold, etc.). 3. Rainwater cisterns of 6 m³ each, located beneath the 7 terraces on the ground floor, to provide automated irrigation to the plants sowed that serve a bioclimatic function (11 trees and 40 climbing plants). The steady rainfall rate is 345 l/m2 per year and the system has 450 litres per day for the purposes of irrigation during the 3 months of the dry season. In terms of rental housing managed by IBAVI, lawns are banned, which in this climate would constitute an irresponsible use of resources. 55. Statistical water consumption in homes with garden of the subsidiary rules of Formentera and the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB). 4. In the central courtyard, a grey water phyto-purification system56 has been installed to regenerate shower water for use in the toilets (statistically 20% water consumption per day and person). The cistern has a capacity for 17 m³. The plants selected by the landscaper Salvador Canyís are Phragmites australis, Typha angustifolia, Iris pseudoacorus, Mentha aquatica and Lithrum salicaria. 5. Landscape gardening. Selection of suitable native and non-native species: Celtis australis (almez), Ficus carica (fig tree), Parthenocissus quinquefolia (virgin vine), and Bougainvillea spectabilis (bougainvillea) and efficient irrigation systems, avoiding sprinklers. 56. Horizontal dry flow phyto-purification system. The prototype has successfully reduced waste production by 50% during the construction phase, producing 33.38 tonnes of waste in total. The following measures were applied: — Reuse the aggregates from excavation as fillers under floorings (100 m3 ), and fillers in gardens (120 m3 ), in order to reduce the gravel imported in trucks from Ibiza. — Reuse the remains of crushed YTONG as light filler under the firstfloor flooring. — Reuse all construction pallets in the construction of roofs as a support for Posidonia oceanica. — Reuse the surplus wood from the beams to cover the gaps in the slabs between rooms. — Reuse the wood provided by Fundación Deixalles for the purposes of interior woodwork. MONITORING THE PROTOTYPE Incorporated emissions have been calculated using the ITEC’s BEDEC bank57. During the REUSING POSIDONIA project we discovered that it was impossible to establish an absolute emissions threshold for all buildings, since the impact of works to build the roofs, structures or lay the foundations varies widely. Therefore, in contrast to the calculation of energy efficiency, for which there are reference values, to calculate the percentage of improvement, we use the emissions of an equivalent building constructed with conventional systems such as reinforced concrete, aluminium, stoneware and asphalt products.58 The emissions of the Prototype came to 446,632 Kg/CO2 (412 Kg/CO2 x m²). The emissions of the reference building came to 1,221,987 kg/CO2 (1,128 kg/CO2 x m²) The decrease ultimately obtained was 63,45%, well beyond the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 50%.59 57. Technical Construction Institute of Catalonia. 58. Materials used to calculate the reference building: — Foundations, walls and pillars of reinforced concrete. — Structural floor with concrete girder-slabs and beams. — Flat roof with porex insulation and asphalt sheet. — Concrete blocks walls. — Porcelain stoneware flooring. — Aluminum exterior carpentry. Pine interior doors. — Installations of PVC and plastic paint for walls. 59. Please find CO2 calculations here: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huella-de-co2/ 60. The maximum height of the building depends on the city council buildings regulations. If this typology is included to data base, the CO2 statistical emissions would be between 600 and 1,100 kg, with an average of 850 kg It can be seen that the reference building’s emissions are well beyond the statistics, between 600 and 900 kg, which has had an impact on the foundations and roofs of a two-storey building60 compared to the 5-storey building used to obtain the value of 732 kg/CO2 . Even so, the reduction of the prototype towards the statistical average was 45%, which means the following: A. Despite the greater surface area, the use of local construction systems with a low environmental impact has made it possible to reduce CO2 emissions by around 50%. B. If the lime concrete used in the structure is sourced from a factory using renewable sources of energy, emissions per square metre would drop to 367 kg/CO2 , and therefore, we would obtain a reduction of 70%, equivalent to the reduction required to obtain an ecological footprint of 18,000 m2 .

MONITORING THERMAL COMFORT Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with J. Muñoz and C. Carmona from the Architectural Research Group at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB): Monitoring includes indoor and outdoor temperatures, degree of relative humidity and breeze speed inside 8 standard homes, 4 looking north-south and 4 looking east-west. The following tools were used: — FlirC2 thermographic camera, with sensor IR 80×60. — PCE-T150 digital thermometer. — TESTO445 hot-wire anemometer. — PCE-890U surface temperature gun. — 10 PCE-HT 71N temperature sensors. — 10 PCE-T390 temperature sensors. Monitoring began on 21 December 2016, coinciding with the winter solstice and will end in the summer of 2018. The results obtained to date August22nd are as follows. PHASE 1 - WINTER Period: 22 december 2016 - 16 february 2017. Dwellings: 6 and 8. The dwellings were inhabited. Data: Internal temperature information (Ti), outdoor temperature (Te), indoor relative humidity (HR) and outdoor relative humidity (Hre). The climate control conditions where stablished by setting and indoor temperature of 21ºC. The system stopped when it reached the setpoint temperature Climatic conditions to the indicated period (12/22/16 - 2/16/17): — Median minimum outdoor temperatures: 8°C — Median maximum outdoor temperatures: 15°C Results — Initial median interior temperature (initial Ti): 15°C — Median time required for air conditioning to reach 21°C ™: 1 hr — Median indoor relative humidity (once at 21°C):> 75% The insulation was proved to be adequate. Infrared imaging did not detect any thermal bridges. PHASE 2 - SUMMER Period: 15 June to 22 August 2017. Units: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12. The Dwellings were inhabited. Data: Indoor Surface Temperatures (Tsi), Indoor Temperatures (Ti), Outdoor Surface Temperatures (Tse) Outdoor Temperatures (Te), indoor Relative Humidity (Hri) and Outdoor Relative Humidity (Hre). Climatic conditions during the period (24/7/17 - 28/7/17): — Average minimum outdoor temperatures: 29.5°C — Average outdoor maximum temperature: 35°C Results The results61 obtained demonstrate that the enclosure’s insulation works appropriately with constant reductions of 5ºC compared to the outdoor temperature and 15ºC compared to the outdoor temperature of the surfaces exposed to direct sunlight. 61.

Parámetros del ambiente interior a considerar para el diseño y la evaluación de la eficiencia energética de edificios incluyendo la calidad del aire interior, condiciones térmicas, iluminación y ruido), We performed an analysis of internal thermal comfort, based on the ASHRAE62 standard and EN-1525163 using the following average values obtained during the analysis period: — Ti of the units facing North, South and East, between 25 and 27 ºC with an average of around 26 ºC. — Te between 30 and 35ºC, with an average minimum outdoor temperature of 29.5°C, an average maximum outdoor temperature of 35°C and a median temperature of around 33°C — HRi between 55 and 80% with an average of around 65% and HRe between 55 and 90%, with an average of around 75% We concluded that based on the ASHRAE standard (Figure 6), the apparent temperature is 26.3 °C. It also complies with EN-15251 (Figure 7). These two results have been obtained with wind speeds of 0 (zero). When considering a wind speed of 0.5 m/s, the apparent temperature is around 23.5 ºC (Figure 8). We have not seen a significant difference in the adiabatic64 properties, indicating a good level of insulation. 64. Adiabatic dwelling does not present temperature losses. 3. ELECTRIC AND ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD MONITORING Monitoring has been carried out in cooperation with B. Alorda from the Architectural Research Group at the UIB. The following equipment has been used: — Narda NBM-550 Broadband Field Meter — Narda EF-0391 E-Field, Flat Response Probe — Rohde & SCHWARZ FSH3 Spectrum Analyser The electromagnetic radiation of radio-frequency waves has had and continues to have a special impact on public opinion due to its possible impact on health conditions. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the use of mobile devices or sensing devices capable of performing wireless communications, in other words, devices emitting electromagnetic waves. Safety measures in terms of sources of electromagnetic radiation were regulated in 200165 in order to ensure the highest levels of safety and respond to the social demand for transparency and control 65. Based on the recommendations of the World Health Organization via the recommendation of the European Commission 1999/519/EC that was reflected in Spanish legislation via Royal Decree 1066/2001. over the sources of electromagnetic pollution. The reference levels indicated in the regulations are the maximum values considered as being safe and they are based on the international scientific recommendations, which are updated in line with new knowledge obtained from the latest research developments. The table below details the reference levels included in the regulations in force and that guarantee the compliance with strict safety margins in terms of the levels of exposure to radio-wave radiation amongst the general population. Observing the relevant frequency band at the main frequencies for mobile communications (900, 1800 and 2000 MHz), this regulation establishes reference limits of: 4.5 W/m2 , 9 W/m2 and 10 W/m2 respectively. Likewise, in the SATI report67 published by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces in 2012, a comparison of the limits of exposure to electromagnetic fields was performed, concluding that there were differences between the reference values. These differences define more restrictive maximum limit levels: — In terms of the Spanish autonomous communities, Catalonia, Castilla-La Mancha and Navarra are the communities that establish the most restrictive maximum reference values for mobile frequency bands68 (2 W/m2 , 4 W/m2 and 4.5 W/m2 respectively). — Luxembourg establishes the lowest maximum reference values on mobile frequencies68 in the European Union. The maximum power density is limited to 0.024 W/m2 , equivalent to a maximum electrical field intensity of 3 V/m per antenna. 66. F is the frequency of the wave (Hz), E is the intensity of the electrical field (V/m), H is the magnetic field strength (A/m), B is the magnetic flux density (μT) and S is the equivalent power density of the plane wave (W/m2 ). 67. The SATI report was published in 2012 by the Spanish Federation of Municipalities and Provinces. 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. Effects on health These differences in the limits allowed by current regulations cannot be justified in terms of reducing the possible adverse health effects both for the general population and occupational exposure, according to the SATI report.67 Thus, the reduction of the reference level for emissions from telephone antennas is not justified, as indicated, for example, in the 2009 report by the French Agency for Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety. In addition, the same report indicates that “the most effective method to reduce public exposure in general, involves the necessary increase in the number of antennas and their coverage.” So much so, that the authorities of Denmark, Greenland, Finland, Sweden and Norway issued a joint statement in 2009 indicating that “If the number of fixed antennas is reduced, mobile phones tend to use more energy to preserve your connection; therefore, the exposure of the general public may increase. “ According to the conclusions of WHO Fact Sheet 193 of 201469, the following points are worth note: — In the short term, the principal mechanism of interaction between radiofrequency energy and the human body is tissue heating. Furthermore, the penetration of the frequencies used by mobile phones68 is negligible, affecting only the first layers of skin. — In the long term, it has been determined that frequency to radio frequency fields does not increase the risk to people. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency electromagnetic fields as being possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B), but a category used when a causal association is considered credible, but when chance, bias or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence, thus their classification is a prevention strategy. (www.who.int/ mediacentre/factsheets/fs193/es/) 68. The mobile phone frequencies considered are 900, 1800 and 2000 MHz. 69. World Health Organization. The newly built construction is 50 metres away from the telephone towers located on 28 La Habana street. Indoor electromagnetic field measurements have been carried out taking into account several conditions: time (morning, afternoon), layout of the room and usage, in addition to height compared to the horizontal height of the street.

Higher values have been measured on the upper terrace because they are directly in front of the sources of electromagnetic radiation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the structural insulation of the walls reduces the radiation inside the houses and that radiation is beneath even the most restrictive limits. 70.

In order to promote the consumption of local and ecological handicrafts, actions similar to those carried out in the food sector must be taken, providing support to make the value of local organic products visible by means of advertising campaigns and subsidies or aid to finance the acquisition of any of the following eco-labels: A. Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) by an external entity. B. Freely accessible environmental assessment programs, Echometer or similar. C. European eco-label, currently under development. D. To develope a label of eco-friendly local product. 2. For products imported from outside the EU, a label should be required to ensure fair working conditions and respect for human rights in production processes, such as FAIRTRADE71, or similar, as a mandatory condition for use in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and Statewide construction standards. 3. For wood products from outside the EU, an FSC or PEFC forest management label should be required as a condition for being used in public works, progressively introducing this requirement in private works through Directives and State-wide and regional construction standards. 4. For all products made on an industrial scale, both in the EU and abroad, product traceability should be required at all extraction, manufacturing and distribution stages. A product manufactured in the EU may use raw materials that involved in some or all of the side effects described in the consumption models. 5. A CO2 emissions ceiling should be established for construction industries. 6. For the restoration of traditional local products with no active industry, such as Posidonia, their patrimonial value should be made visible and promoted by the public administrations. 71. Fair trade. The Fairtrade Seal is accredited by Flo-Cert in compliance with ISO 17065. There are other accreditations that ensure the rights of workers such as ISO 26000 Social responsibility Unlike processed materials, which benefit from large investments in terms of advertising and technical advice financed by private companies, traditional materials are not linked to financial profitability and their use on-site requires specific knowledge, which is why they have fallen into disuse. Based on the foregoing, the public administration is responsible for their restored use, replacing the figure of technical advisors and establishing channels of communication between professionals and consumers. Furthermore, it must be noted that the use of materials without an EC marking represents an added difficulty for technicians, who must have a high level of know-how to correctly apply traditional systems, within the current framework of associated civil liability and compliance with technical regulations such as the Technical Building Code, the Regulation of Thermal Installations in Buildings, etc. As is the case with dry stone, which has received funding from various European programs72, the following activities should be encouraged: — Posidonia management training courses (collection, drying and storage) for public administration personnel to encourage its use in public buildings. — Courses/workshops/events involving construction with Posidonia, placing a special emphasis on the protection of Posidonia meadows and dune ecosystems, imparted to professionals and individuals to encourage its use in public and private buildings. — Development of public companies in all regions of the Mediterranean in which Posidonia is dried and packaged and made available to consumers, complying with all the beach collection protocols to ensure that the dune ecosystem is not harmed, preventing individuals managing the collection of large volumes. — Additional studies on the application of Posidonia in different construction elements (walls, laying of floors, etc.). 72. The PROTERRA program deals with the assessment of terraced crops in southern Europe. REPPIS program in the framework of which the European Network of Dry Stone Countries, or the MEDSTONE publications, technical guides for documenting and transmitting such craft was created, in addition to projects such as REVPAR-MEDOCC, PATTER, TERRISC, TCAST, EDSI, etc. CO2 The variable nature of reference values of CO2 emissions per m2 (from 600 to 1,100) and the need to calculate the CO2 of an equivalent building constructed using conventional systems makes it impossible to implement the calculation of CO2 until software programs are developed that comply the following conditions: 1. Create an approved CO2 database for each region. 2. Automatically calculate emissions from the equivalent building using predetermined items. Or: 3. Analise thousands of examples in order to get reference values for every building typologie. The development and implementation of these programs is expected to be slow and complex, and therefore the mandatory inclusion of one or more local ecological materials from a list drawn up by the relevant regional administrations has been proposed as a transitional measure.73 73. Balearic Islands materials list under development: www.reusingposidonia.com/calculo-de-la-huellade-co2/ This obligation would be applied first to public buildings and then extended to private buildings, similar to the application of the nearly zero-energy buildings concept. Thus, the roadmap below is proposed for the purposes of guidance: 1. Include one or more eco-friendly materials, preferably local ones, from the regional list, firstly in public buildings and afterwards in private buildings. 2. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed public buildings. 3. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all newly constructed private buildings. 4. Implement a mandatory recognised CO2 calculation tool for all rehabilitation works on existing buildings. 5. Establish a progressive decrease in CO2 emissions for all projects: 20%, 50%, 70% in order to reduce the footprint to 18,000 m² per inhabitant. THERMAL COMFORT Winter recommendations Reduce the forced ventilation system of indoor airflow and if needed install local dehumidification systems. Summer recommendations The cross-ventilation mechanism to improve indoor thermal comfort, works for most of the periods studied. Based on the environmental conditions of the location and during the period studied (sustained temperatures above 30°C and high relative humidity, on average close to 75% and reaching 90%), and given the very high level of insulation present in the buildings, it will be appropriate to establish a system that informs the user when it is appropriate to take advantage of the effect of natural cross ventilation and when it is not, as well as to installing solar powered ceiling fans. Thus, we recommend designing and implementing an automatic control that informs the user/resident of when, as necessary given ambient conditions in summer, the opposite windows should be opened to employ the cross ventilation effect (a pilot light that switches on and off). This control would include at least one external temperature sensor, one indoor temperature sensor, one outdoor air speed sensor and one indoor temperature sensor.74 74. AEMET.

When you build them, pollution is produced by manufacturing materials and the production of rubble. And when you use them, pollution is produced by the energy used to live in them. Our proposal is to reduce pollution generated by manufacturing by 50%, waste production by 50%, water consumption by 60%, and power used for heating or cooling by 75%. We’ll achieve this by reverting to traditional architecture techniques and materials, and low-tech systems. It’s not just the environment that is at stake: our quality of life would be much better and costs would be almost the same. And if this is replicated on a wide scale, cities will be friendlier, nicer and they will adapt gradually to climate change. All this information is taken from the official Life reusing posidonia book, what quotes from here would work with this introduction, The study of residential typologies, particularly collective housing, is of critical importance in understanding how density shapes urban environments and carries implications for community life, sustainability, and the use of resources. Density in housing not only refers to the number of units per land area but also touches on the intensity of social interactions, access to communal amenities, and the overall quality of living spaces. In the context of Bournemouth and Poole, the surge in the urban periphery’s residential developments underscores the pertinence of re-evaluating housing on the city’s edge. These areas, including Canford Heath, grapple with the challenges of urban sprawl and ecological impact while striving to offer attractive, affordable, and sustainable living options. This essay will delve into the Life Reusing Posidonia project, a contemporary, eco-conscious approach to collective housing situated in Sant Ferran, Formentera. Conceived between 2013 and 2015 and developed by the Institut Balear de l’Habitatge, the housing typology presents an innovative integration of block and courtyard elements, reflective of its unique island context. The architects responsible, notable for their environmentally and socio-culturally responsive design philosophy, sought to create fourteen housing units that are characterized by a profound respect for local traditions and a low environmental footprint. Life Reusing Posidonia addresses the question of density by prioritizing the ecosystem’s health without compromising on habitability. The utilization of dried Posidonia oceanica, a seagrass endemic to the Mediterranean, as insulation, signifies a return to historical construction practices while advancing modern sustainable methods. This chosen project illustrates a reinterpretation of housing on the edge by showcasing how edge conditions can be harmoniously addressed through a low-tech, resource-efficient strategy. By examining this project’s response to the edges of Formentera, this essay aims to uncover how innovative design interventions can preserve ecological integrity, foster community, and redefine the quality of living on the periphery of urban centers.","output":"The Life Reusing Posidonia project stands as a testament to the possibility of balancing ecological integrity with residential densification, particularly in areas grappling with urban sprawl and environmental sustainability, such as Bournemouth and Poole's Canford Heath. This initiative exemplifies the merits of revisiting traditional architectural methods while embedding contemporary sustainable practices in the design and construction of collective housing. Highlighted quotes that resonate with the essence of the project and can be incorporated into the introduction include: 1. \\"It is our responsibility to respond to the current and future needs of society and we must know how to face this challenge, combining the promotion of social housing based on its social purpose and environmental awareness.\\" 2. \\"The project has made it possible to link our natural resources to the cultural tradition of Formentera... Harnessing a waste product that is plentiful and native to Formentera, using its properties as thermal insulation, thus avoiding having to use materials that do not exist in our islands provides a new approach to both public and private construction.\\" 3. \\"Enhancing our cultural tradition whilst promoting greater energy efficiency and the use of ecological technologies increases the competitiveness of our production systems and helps to maintain and care for our natural resources.\\" 4. \\"The main causes of environmental deterioration are the industrial production and consumption models... How is it possible that a T-shirt costs €3 in a shop? The answer is simple: using the excuse of the difference in wages and the currency exchange in order to reassure consumers, globalized production using the under-regulated labor markets of second and third world countries is fed by new forms of forced labor.\\" 5. \\"In light of this situation, the simplest solution is to reduce its use insofar as possible, i.e., not doing or doing the minimum.\\" 6. \\"The automatic way of reducing CO2 emissions from a 500 m2 building by 50% is to build only 250 m2.\\" 7. \\"The rest of the material used comes from a market study given their cost, the incorporated energy and the fact that they are suited to the levels of comfort required.\\" 8. \\"The constructed volume is divided into two separate blocks, taking advantage of the fact that the two facades that overlook the street enjoy prevailing winds that passively keep them cool in summer.\\" These quotes not only elucidate the project's environmental objectives but also its socio-economic considerations and cultural values. They establish a connection between sustainable living and community wellness, highlighting the project’s approach to mindful urban expansion on the periphery. This insight can inspire and inform discussions on similar developmental strategies in regions like Bournemouth and Poole, aiming to create liveable, eco-friendly communities."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

U급 재능을 얻었을 때와는 다른 중량감. 마치 머리에 왕관을 쓴 것 같다는 유치한 생각까지 들었다. “후.” 떨렸다. 누가 보면 미친놈이라 생각할지도 모르지만, 호영은 결코 이 현실을 가볍게 여길 수 없었다. 지단의 재능을 얻었다는 생각에 다리가 후들후들 떨렸다. 골은 넣은 지 한참이나 지났지만 그것과 상관없이 환희와 흥분이 지속되었다. 미친놈마냥 목 놓아 소리라도 지르고 싶은 심정이었다. 내가, 지단의 재능을 얻었다고 말이다. “후우.” 뿌연 입김이 자욱하게 피어올랐다. 긴장감이 뜨거운 열정으로, 그리고 자신감으로 뒤바뀌었다. 뼛속을 후벼 파는 한파가 엄습했지만, 반대로 호영의 몸은 한결 가벼워졌다. 자신감이 몸과 마음을 녹여주고 있었다. 이제 겨우 재능을 탐하기 시작했을 뿐이지만, 어째서인지 벌써부터 자신감이 충만했다. 가슴이 벅차올랐다. 정말 무엇이든 할 수 있을 것 같았다. 축구, 수준 높은 축구를 말이다. 씨익. 호영의 입가에 세상에서 가장 행복한 미소가 어렸다. 하지만 경기가 재개될 무렵에는 진지함만이 남아있었다. 후반전은 다소 따분했던 전반전과 달리 흥미로운 양상을 띠었다. 이대로는 안 되겠다 싶었던 발렌시아가 큰 변화를 모색하면서 감추고 있던 발톱을 들춰냈다. 그리고 그 발톱은 채 한 번 휘두르기도 전에 봉인되고 말았다. 레알 마드리드의 미드필더들이 뛰어난 조직력을 보이며, 변수를 만들려는 발렌시아의 난잡한 움직임을 잡아낸 것이었다. “야!” 발렌시아의 수비형 미드필더 티모르(Timor)는 속이 타들어갔다. 발톱을 휘두르기는커녕 날갯짓 한 번 제대로 못하고 호랑이에게 잡힌 꼴이었다. ‘저 새끼가 진짜!’ 울화가 치밀어 올랐다. 우호영이 살짝 라인을 내려 수비에 가담하고 있는 꼴을 보고 있자니, 당장이라도 달려가서 멱살을 잡고 싶었다. 그뿐만이 아니었다. 공을 잡을 때면 짧고 빠른 패스로 힘 싸움을 유도하는데, 발렌시아의 수비수들은 그것에 이끌려가 자꾸만 틈을 드러내고 있었다. 보다 못한 티모르가 깊은 한숨을 토해냈다. “후······.” 그러다 공이 골라인 아웃된 틈에 수비수들을 불러 모았다. 거기에 대고 강한 어조로 내뱉었다. “이 등신들아. 니들이 서 있는 공간에 집중하라고. 대가리가 텅텅 비었냐? 저렇게 대놓고 빌드업을 하는데 왜 같이 놀아줘? 아예 넘어가서 동참하지 그러냐?” 티모르는 선수들을 꾸짖으면서 나름 주장다운 면모를 보였다. 하지만 그보다는 사실 화풀이에 가까웠다. “정신 차려. 아직 한 골 차이야. 우리만 제대로 막으면 언제든지 역전할 수 있다고.” 그로부터 5분 뒤. 발렌시아 수비진에 위기가 찾아왔다. 호영을 필두로 한 레알 마드리드의 공격진이 점점 템포를 빠르게 올리면서, 발렌시아 수비진의 허점을 들쑤시고 다니는 것이었다. ‘혼란을 야기하겠다 이거지.’ 뻔한 수법. 티모르는 헛웃음을 흘렸다. 한두 번 당하지, 서너 번 당한다면 그건 수비수로서 실격이다. 코치에게 그렇게 배웠던 티모르다. 그렇기에 정신을 바짝 차렸다. 흔들리지 않는 고목처럼 자신의 위치를 고수하며 상대의 유혹에 넘어가지 않았다. 그리고 그때, 레알의 마르코스가 좌측 측면으로 파고들었다. ‘너무 뻔하잖아.’ 아까와 같은 상황. ‘내가 갈 줄 알고?’ 과연 발렌시아 수비의 중추답게, 티모르는 어떠한 유혹에도 넘어가지 않았다. 대신 마르코스에게 연결돼있는 패스길목을 사수했다. 바로 그게 문제였다. 타악! 일순 머리 위로 공이 넘어갔다. ‘로빙패스···?’ 경기 내내 짧은 땅볼패스만 배급하던 우호영이 이번엔 롱 패스를 꺼내든 것이었다. ‘······ 아.’ 유혹에 넘어가지 않았던 것이 패착이었다. 수비수로서의 자격상실. 뚫리고 말았다. “미친!” 이번엔 자신이 구멍이 돼버리고 말았다. 마르코스의 퍼스트 터치가 길었던 탓에 실점으로 이어지지는 않았지만, 문제는 따로 있었다. ‘뭐지.’ 정신이 아찔했다. 마치 저편 어딘가에서, 마성의 목소리가 들려오는 것 같았다. ‘우호영?’ “으으.” 그의 심리전에 당했다는 생각에 화가 치밀어 올랐다. 직접 당해보지 않고서는 알 수 없는 고통이었다. “아아아아!” 티모르, 그는 이미 17세가 되기까지 수많은 유망주들을 만나온 유소년 계의 베테랑이었다. 그러나 이런 경험은 처음이었다. 최소 메시라고 불리며 스페인 최고의 유망주로 평가 받는 FC바르셀로나의 보얀(Bojan)과 맞붙었을 때도 이 정도는 아니었다. 그 당시, 보얀의 경악스러운 개인기와 드리블에 수차례나 농락당했지만 이렇게 화가 나지는 않았었다. 그것은 직접 눈에 드러나는 플레이였기에, 뭐가 잘못됐으며 무엇에 당한 것인지 깨닫고 보완할 수 있었기 때문이다. 하지만 이건······. ‘뭘 어쩌라고.’ 대처방법이 영 떠오르질 않았다. 비유하자면 보얀은 신, 우호영은 귀신이었다. 우호영을 상대하고 있으면 마치 귀신에 홀린 듯한 느낌을 받는다. 그리고 어느새 정신 차리고 보면 실책한 자신의 모습을 보게 된다. 마치 자신의 머리꼭대기 위에 서있는 듯한 기분. 그래서 더 짜증났다. 밟아버리고 싶었다. 안 될 걸 알면서도 오기가 생겼다. “후!” ‘넌 죽었다.’ 티모르는 두 주먹을 불끈 쥐며 초강수를 준비했다. 얼마 지나지 않아 기회가 생겼다. ‘온다.’ 우호영이 직접 공을 몰면서 중원을 넘어서고 있었다. 기다렸다는 듯 티모르가 진드기처럼 달라붙었다. ‘밟는다.’ 경기 시작 전 감독이 말하길, 우호영에게 붙지 말고 공간을 막아야 한다고 했지만, 티모르는 더 이상 참을 수 없었다. Translate to english","output":"084. Evolution, Not Change (4) Amidst the cheers of teammates filling the field, A welcome piece of news found its way before Ho-young. [I desire the Build-Up (SU) of Maestro.] Seeing that he could now covet the SU (Special Unique) rank, it seemed that SU was classified within the U rank. Ho-young's eyes rolled quickly. [It will take 150 days → 75 days to completely acquire the talent. You cannot covet another talent for 75 days.] 'Finally!' He got it. The unparalleled talent that led France to two World Cup victories in eight years. But it wasn't unique anymore. The talent that was an art form, doomed to vanish after retirement, was wholly inherited by Ho-young. It was Zidane's art of soccer. It would remain on the field until Ho-young himself retired. He clenched his fist. \\"I can do it, too.\\" Ho-young muttered softly. His voice held steadfastness but was laden with pressure. There was a different weight to obtaining a U-grade talent. He even had the childish thought that it felt like wearing a crown on his head. \\"Phew.\\" He trembled. To anyone looking, it might seem he was mad, but Ho-young could not take this reality lightly. His legs shook with the thought of having obtained Zidane's talent. The goal had been scored a while ago, but irrespective of that, the joy and excitement continued. He felt an urge to scream at the top of his lungs like a madman. I have, after all, obtained Zidane's talent. \\"Phew.\\" His breath fogged up markedly. Tension turned into hot passion, which then morphed into confidence. Despite the piercing cold encroaching upon him, Ho-young's body felt lighter. Confidence was melting his body and spirit. He had only just started to covet the talent, yet for some reason, he was already brimming with confidence. His heart swelled with pride. He felt as if he could do anything. Play soccer. Play good soccer. His lips stretched into the most blissful smile in the world. But as the game was about to resume, only seriousness remained. The second half, unlike the somewhat dull first half, became more interesting. Valencia, not satisfied with how things were proceeding, sought a big change, baring the claws that had been hidden until now. And those claws were sealed before even being swung a single time. Real Madrid's midfielders displayed remarkable organization, suppressing Valencia's messy attempts to create variables. \\"Hey!\\" Timor, Valencia's defensive midfielder, felt exasperated. He hadn't even properly flapped his wings before being caught by the tiger. 'That guy, seriously!' Fury rose within him. As he watched Ho-young, who had slightly dropped back to join the defense, he felt an urge to rush over and grab him by the collar. And that wasn't all. Whenever Ho-young took control of the ball, he induced physical battles with short and rapid passes, and Valencia's defenders were being led astray, exposing gaps time and again. Unable to stand it any longer, Timor let out a deep sigh. \\"Phew...\\" Seizing the opportunity when the ball went out for a goal kick, he gathered the defenders. Addressing them with a sharp tone, he said: \\"Idiots. Focus on the space where you stand. Are your heads empty? He’s openly building up and why are you playing along? Why not just go over and join the play?\\" Timor scolded his fellow players, demonstrating a captain-like demeanor, although it was more like venting his own frustrations. \\"Snap out of it. It's only a one-goal difference. If we defend properly, we can turn it around anytime.\\" Five minutes later. A crisis loomed over Valencia's defense. Led by Ho-young, Real Madrid's attackers were increasing the pace, prying into the weaknesses of Valencia's defense. 'They're trying to cause chaos.' An obvious tactic. Timor laughed derisively. Fooled once, twice, but if you're fooled three or four times, you're disqualified as a defender. Timor, who had been trained as such by his coach, was fully alert. Like an unshakable tree, he held his position steadfastly, not succumbing to the opponent's temptations. And then, Marcos from Real burst down the left flank. 'It’s too obvious.' The same situation as before. 'Did you think I'd take the bait?' True to his role as the backbone of Valencia's defense, Timor did not fall for any tricks and instead guarded the passing lane connected to Marcos. That was the issue. Whack! Suddenly, the ball flew over his head. 'A lob pass...?' Ho-young, who had been distributing short ground passes throughout the game, had suddenly switched to a long pass. '... Ah.' The decision not to be tempted was a misstep. Disqualified as a defender. He had been breached. \\"Damn it!\\" He had just become the very gap he swore to prevent. Although Marcos' first touch was too heavy, preventing a goal, the real issue was elsewhere. 'What’s this feeling.' It all became dizzying. As if a siren’s voice was calling from somewhere far away. 'Ho-young?' \\"Ugh.\\" The thought of being played by his psychology made his blood boil. A distress that can't be understood without being directly experienced. \\"Ahhhhhh!\\" Timor was a veteran of the youth league since he was 17, having met numerous promising players. Yet, this experience was new to him. Even when he faced Bojan of FC Barcelona, hailed as the next Messi and rated as Spain's top prospect, he didn’t become this angry despite being humiliated by Bojan’s astonishing skills and dribbling multiple times. Because Bojan's play was visibly obvious, Timor could understand what went wrong, how he was beaten, and what could be improved. But this... 'What am I supposed to do.' He couldn't think of any countermeasures. To illustrate, Bojan was a god, and Ho-young was a ghost. Facing Ho-young was like being bewitched, and before long, he found himself making mistakes. It was like Ho-young was hovering over him. That's why he was more irritated. He wanted to stomp him into the ground. He had an urge, even though he knew it was futile. \\"Phew!\\" 'I'll end you.' Timor clenched his fists tightly, preparing for a drastic approach. Soon, a chance came. 'Here it comes.' Ho-young was driving the ball across the midfield coming towards him. As if he had been waiting, Timor clung to him like a tick. 'I'll stomp on you.' Despite the coach saying before the match not to get close to Ho-young and to block the space instead, Timor could no longer hold back."},{"instruction":"Compré Solana en binance en 50 en spot.

El dataset que tengo solo tiene numeros del 0 al 9","output":"Para adaptar tu modelo y la interfaz para detectar números del 0 al 999, necesitarás hacer varios cambios en tu código. Aquí tienes algunos pasos a seguir: 1. Actualizar el modelo: - Necesitarás modificar la capa de salida de tu modelo para que tenga la cantidad correcta de neuronas. En este caso, deberías tener 1000 neuronas en la capa de salida, una para cada número del 0 al 999. - Si tus datos de entrenamiento solo tienen etiquetas del 0 al 9, deberás extender tu conjunto de datos para incluir las etiquetas del 10 al 999. Puedes crear versiones ampliadas de tus imágenes existentes, por ejemplo, agregando ceros a la etiqueta y modificando las imágenes para que se parezcan más a números más grandes. 2. Actualizar la interfaz de usuario: - Actualiza la variable \`operator\` para mostrar los números predichos del 0 al 999 en lugar de solo del 0 al 9. Esto se puede hacer utilizando el número predicho y formateándolo como una cadena. - Asegúrate de que el campo de entrada \`textdisplay\` tenga suficiente espacio para mostrar números de hasta 999. Puedes ajustar el tamaño del campo o permitir que se expanda automáticamente según sea necesario. 3. Actualizar la lógica de la interfaz y la adquisición de imágenes: - Si vas a permitir que los usuarios dibujen números de hasta tres dígitos, necesitarás modificar la lógica de adquisición de imágenes y preparación de datos en la función \`Predict()\`. - Después de guardar la imagen dibujada, redimensionarla a un tamaño adecuado y convertirla en un arreglo numpy, deberás realizar los mismos pasos para cada uno de los tres canales de la imagen (un canal para cada dígito). - Luego, puedes concatenar los tres arreglos y darle la forma adecuada para ingresar al modelo. Recuerda que estos son solo algunos pasos básicos para adaptar tu modelo y la interfaz de usuario a números del 0 al 999. Puedes ajustar y personalizar aún más estos pasos según tus necesidades y requisitos específicos."},{"instruction":"como extiendo mi conjunto de datos","output":"Para extender tu conjunto de datos y agregar números del 10 al 999, puedes utilizar varias técnicas de aumentación de datos y generación de nuevas muestras. Aquí tienes algunas opciones: 1. Rotación y traslación: Puedes aplicar transformaciones geométricas a tus imágenes existentes para simular números más grandes. Por ejemplo, puedes rotar y trasladar las imágenes para crear variaciones de los dígitos existentes. Esto puede ayudar a expandir tu conjunto de datos y cubrir una gama más amplia de números. 2. Redimensionamiento y superposición: Puedes redimensionar tus imágenes existentes para que sean más grandes y luego superponerlas en imágenes más grandes. Por ejemplo, puedes tomar una imagen del dígito \\"1\\" y superponerla en el centro de una imagen más grande. Esto replicará el patrón del dígito más pequeño en una imagen más grande. 3. Combina imágenes: Puedes combinar múltiples imágenes existentes para crear nuevos números más grandes. Por ejemplo, puedes tomar las imágenes de los dígitos \\"1\\" y \\"0\\", y combinarlas para formar el número \\"10\\". Puedes seguir este enfoque para crear números del 10 al 999 combinando diferentes combinaciones de dígitos. 4. Generación de datos mediante GANs: Puedes utilizar técnicas de Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) para generar imágenes completamente nuevas de números del 10 al 999. Las GANs consisten en un generador y un discriminador que trabajan en conjunto para generar imágenes realistas. Puedes entrenar una GAN en tu conjunto de datos existente y utilizar el generador para generar nuevas imágenes de números más grandes.

This script reads mesh data from a Gmsh .msh file, sets up the problem, and implements a time-stepping algorithm to solve the coupled PDE system. Here are a few comments and points about your script: 1. Mesh Import: You have functions to read both Gmsh .msh files and XDMF files. Make sure that the mesh files exist on the path and that your script's working directory is set correctly to avoid file not found errors. 2. Non-dimensionalization: Your class \`FunctionalSpacePNPNS\` includes non-dimensionalization based on parameters in a YAML file. This approach helps to generalize the problem and can improve numerical stability. 3. Finite Element Space: You define different finite element spaces for the electrostatic potential, velocity, pressure, and concentration fields - this is appropriate given that different fields may require different discretization strategies. 4. Boundary Conditions: You seem to handle various types of boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann) and add them correctly to the weak forms. Make sure the \`set_bc\` module (where \`BoundaryConditions\` is from) is correctly implemented and can handle the expected boundary condition types. 5. Solver Settings: You create PETSc solvers for different parts of the coupling system with appropriate preconditioners. Check the DOLFINx and PETSc documentation to ensure your choice of solver and preconditioners is optimal for your problem type. 6. Time-stepping: You implement a time-stepping loop, solving the system iteratively. The convergence checking is crucial here to ensure the solution stabilizes before proceeding to the next step. 7. Output: You create XDMF/VTK files for visualization. Make sure to flush/close these files properly once you're done with them to avoid any data corruption. 8. Convergence Criteria: You have a convergence condition based on the residuals of your fields. The tolerance \`TOL_SYS_CONV\` should be set appropriately for your problem. 9. Code Comments: You should consider adding more comments to explain the purpose of each block or function, especially for complex sections of the code. 10. Code Structure: Some parts of the script are commented out, and the script is very long. In practice, it's good to break down the script into modular files and import them as needed. This will make the code easier to read, maintain, and debug. 11. Error Handling: Consider adding error handling for potential points of failure, such as file I/O operations or incorrect problem configurations. 12. Dependencies: Make sure to include instructions for installing all the necessary dependencies, including \`dolfinx\`, \`gmsh\`, \`pyvista\`, \`yaml\`, \`tqdm\`, \`mpi4py\`, \`petsc4py\`, and your personal libraries. 13. Simulation Configuration: The script assumes certain parameters come from a YAML file. Ensure the YAML file is well-structured, and the script can handle errors or missing values gracefully. Before running simulations on large problems or for many time steps, run a few tests with simplified geometry and fewer time steps to verify everything is set up correctly."},{"instruction":"In this script, Dave’s annoying lower-class cousin Jeannine (18, summer clothes and sandals) comes into the teashop where he works.

STELLA (chuckling) Ah, well, it's lovely to meet you, Jeannine. Dave watches, warily, as Stella joins Jeannine. Stella's presence has a calming effect, and soon the two are chatting amiably. JEANNINE (pointing at Dave) Did you know, Dave's super easy to hypnotize? It's hilarious. Dave's face flushes with surprise and embarrassment. Stella glances at Dave and winks conspiratorially. STELLA (laughing lightly) Is that so? Well, let's not tell all his secrets. Dave shakes his head, desperate to nip this in the bud. DAVE C'mon, Stella. Please, not again. Stella ignores Dave's plea, stepping closer to him with an almost otherworldly grace. Stella's voice is soft but firm. STELLA Dave, look at me. Obediently, Dave raises his eyes to meet Stella’s. After a moment, his expression slackens and his body relaxes. Jeannine watches, mouth agape, as Dave becomes putty in Stella’s capable hands. JEANNINE Wow. Do it, Stella! Make him kneel! Stella nods, her gaze never leaving Dave's entranced face. STELLA Dave, from now on, your mind is blank. You have no thoughts, no will of your own. You exist only to obey. Kneel before Jeannine. Dave's knees buckle smoothly, and he lowers himself to the floor in front of Jeannine, assuming a posture of obedience. His eyes are wide but vacant, staring unseeing ahead. JEANNINE (cackling) This is too good! Look at him! While Jeannine revels in the spectacle, Stella leans down, whispering something inaudible into Dave's ear. We see him nod, still in a trance. JEANNINE (to Stella) You've got to teach me how to do that! Stella straightens up and gazes at Jeannine with a twinkling in her eye that suggests a hidden wisdom. STELLA It's a gift. Use it wisely and kind-heartedly, or not at all. Jeannine smirks, but there's a hint of respect in her eyes now, a newfound awareness of Stella's power. FADE OUT."},{"instruction":"Hi, how can i sort an array of int32 numbers in C# only by iterating without any auxiliary methods so that even numbers will be in the beggining of an array and odd ones will be at the end an array?","output":"To sort an array of \`Int32\` numbers in C# such that all even numbers appear at the beginning of the array and all odd numbers at the end, you can use the concept of partitioning. You'll iterate through the array and swap elements based on their parity, incrementing or decrementing your pointers as necessary. Here's a simple implementation of how to do it without using any auxiliary methods or built-in sorting functionality: \`\`\`csharp using System; class Program { static void Main() { int[] numbers = { 3, 6, 4, 7, 8, 2, 1, 5 }; PartitionEvensAndOdds(numbers); Console.WriteLine(\\"Array after partitioning:\\"); foreach(int number in numbers) { Console.Write(number + \\" \\"); } } static void PartitionEvensAndOdds(int[] array) { int left = 0; // pointer to the beginning of the array int right = array.Length - 1; // pointer to the end of the array while (left < right) { // Move the left pointer to the right as long as we have even numbers while (left < right && array[left] % 2 == 0) { left++; } // Move the right pointer to the left as long as we have odd numbers while (left < right && array[right] % 2 == 1) { right--; } // If we find an even number on the right and an odd number on the left, swap them if (left < right) { int temp = array[left]; array[left] = array[right]; array[right] = temp; // Move the pointers towards the middle left++; right--; } } } } \`\`\` The output will be: \`\`\` Array after partitioning: 6 4 8 2 7 3 1 5 \`\`\` This code uses a while loop to iterate over the array, moving from the start toward the end with the \`left\` pointer and from the end toward the start with the \`right\` pointer, swapping elements to ensure that even numbers are moved to the left side and odd numbers to the right side. The loop continues until the two pointers meet. This algorithm sorts the numbers only in terms of even and odd, with no further ordering within those groups. If you need the even and odd numbers sorted internally, you would need some additional sorting logic."},{"instruction":"Avec la tension du générateur : e(t) = 240/2. sin (o.t +- 03184 La fréquence est F= 50 Hz, R= 120 Q et L = 318.5 mH .

Donner le déphasage « entre le courant i(t) et la tension e(t). 14) Est-ce que la valeur de p calculée est cohérente avec le facteur de puissance","output":"Pour résoudre ce problème, on va d'abord examiner les informations données, puis réaliser les calculs étape par étape : 1) Calculer la pulsation w du courant. La fréquence F est donnée par 50 Hz. La pulsation (ω) est reliée à la fréquence par la formule ω = 2πF qui nous donne ω = 2π * 50 = 100π rad/s. 2) Donner la valeur efficace E du générateur. La tension donnée est une tension sinusoïdale de la forme e(t) = Em sin(ωt + φ). La valeur efficace E (ou rms) d'une tension sinusoïdale est E = Em / √2 , où Em est l'amplitude de la tension. Ici Em = 240/2 = 120 V, alors E = 120 / √2 = 84.85 V (arrondi à 2 décimales). 3) Donner la phase à l'origine de la tension du générateur. La tension e(t) est donnée avec un décalage de phase \\"+- 03184\\" qui semble être une erreur typographique. Cependant, si nous assumons que c'est la phase φ, alors φ = +- 0.03184, mais on a besoin de plus de contexte ou de clarification pour déterminer si c'est en radians ou une autre erreur typographique. 4) Calculer l'impédance ZL de la bobine. L'impédance d'une bobine (inductance L) est donnée par ZL = jωL où j est l'unité imaginaire. ZL = j * 100π * 0.3185 = j * 100 * π * 318.5 * 10^-3 = j * 31.85 ohms (puisque 1 mH = 10^-3 H). 5) Calculer la valeur efficace du courant i1 parcourant la résistance R. i1 est le courant à travers une résistance de 120 ohms. Si on considère la source de tension comme purement sinusoïdale et qu’elle est en phase avec le courant dans la résistance (ignorent tout effet de phase due à l'induction), on utiliserait la loi d'Ohm (V = I*R), où I = V/R. Ainsi, I = E/R = 84.85/120 = 0.707 A (approximativement). 6) Calculer la valeur efficace du courant i2 parcourant la bobine. Pour calculer i2 on aurait besoin de la valeur efficace de la tension aux bornes de la bobine ou du déphasage pour utiliser la loi d'Ohm avec l'impédance. Cependant, cette information n'est pas fournie. 7) Donner l'expression du courant i1(t), i1(t) suit la tension puisqu'il s'agit d'une résistance, donc i1(t) serait également une onde sinusoïdale de la même fréquence que la tension. i1(t) = I1m sin(ωt + φ) où I1m et φ doivent être déterminés à partir des informations données. I1m serait l'amplitude du courant, qui est liée à la valeur efficace calculée précédemment. 8) Donner l'expression du courant i2(t), i2(t) est décalé par rapport à la tension e(t) donc i2(t) = I2m sin(ωt + φ - π/2), où I2m est l'amplitude du courant dans la bobine et φ est la phase initiale de la tension e(t). On doit déterminer la valeur de I2m basée sur des informations complémentaires non fournies. 9) Calculer la puissance P dissipée dans la résistance R. La puissance dissipée dans une résistance R est donnée par P = I^2 * R, où I est la valeur efficace du courant. Avec I = 0.707 A, P = (0.707)^2 * 120 ≈ 59.5 W. 10) Que peut-on dire de la puissance active fournie par le réseau ? Sans information sur le déphasage entre la tension et le courant, on ne peut pas caractériser avec certitude la puissance active. 11) Calculer la puissance apparente S sachant que le facteur de puissance k= 0.44. La puissance apparente S est donnée par S = E * I où E est la valeur efficace de la tension et I est la valeur efficace du courant. La puissance active P (watt) est liée au facteur de puissance k par P = S * k. On doit calculer S tel que S = P/k. Avec P = 59.5 W et k = 0.44, S = 59.5 / 0.44 ≈ 135.23 VA (volt-ampères). 12) En déduire la valeur efficace du courant I. La valeur efficace du courant se calcule à partir de la puissance apparente S et la tension efficace E : I = S/E. Ainsi I = 135.23 / 84.85 ≈ 1.594 A (approximatif). 13) On a mesuré l'écart temporel entre la tension e(t) et le courant i(t) : |Δt| = 3.55 ms. Donner le déphasage « entre le courant i(t) et la tension e(t). Le déphasage φ est donné par φ = ω * Δt, où Δt est l'écart temporel. Donc φ = 100π * 3.55 * 10^-3 = 1.116 rad (approximativement). 14) Est-ce que la valeur de p calculée est cohérente avec le facteur de puissance. Pour répondre à cette question, on doit calculer le facteur de puissance à partir du déphasage, k = cos(φ). Si le cos(1.116) correspond approximativement à 0.44, alors il y a cohérence. cos(1.116) ≈ 0.44 (vérifier avec une calculatrice), ce qui suggère la cohérence si cette valeur est corrектe.

Choose a pre-trained model: Look for pre-trained language models like GPT-2 or BERT that are widely used and have a good performance on various natural language processing tasks. 2. Fine-tune the model: Fine-tuning is the process of training a pre-existing model on a custom dataset. Collect a dataset of question-answer pairs that cover a range of basic and moderately complex questions. Fine-tune the pre-trained language model using this dataset, so that it becomes specialized in answering questions. 3. Preprocess your data: Clean and preprocess your question-answer dataset by removing irrelevant information, correcting inconsistencies, and formatting the data in a way that the model can understand. 4. Train the model: Train the fine-tuned model on your preprocessed dataset. Depending on the size of your dataset and the complexity of the questions, you may need to experiment with the number of training steps and batch sizes. 5. Evaluate and iterate: Evaluate the performance of the trained model on a separate validation dataset. Identify any shortcomings or areas of improvement and iterate by refining your dataset, preprocessing techniques, or training parameters. 6. Test and deploy: Once you are satisfied with the performance of the model, test it on unseen data to ensure its generalization capability. Deploy the model as a web service or integrate it into your desired application for answering basic and moderately complex questions. Remember that a small language model may have limitations compared to larger and more complex models. Therefore, manage your expectations accordingly and continuously work on improving the model based on user feedback and data updates."},{"instruction":"This is my plan outline: 1. Define Your Scope and Requirements Decide which features your application will include: - Selecting and importing datasets. - Preprocessing and tokenizing text data. - Setting up different language model architectures (RNN, LSTM, Transformer, etc.). - Choosing hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.). - Training and evaluating the model. - Visualizing training progress and metrics. - Model export and deployment. 2. Research and Choose the Technology Stack For a Windows app, you could consider: - Front-end: A GUI framework like PyQt, Tkinter, or Electron for a cross-platform app. - Back-end: A machine learning library like TensorFlow or PyTorch for creating and training models. - Database: SQLite or another lightweight system to store user configurations, models, and results. - Packaging: Tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze to convert your Python program into an executable for Windows. 3. Design a User-Friendly Interface The GUI should be simple and intuitive, allowing users with little to no machine learning background to: - Upload or input data easily. - Select a model architecture from a predefined list. - Configure training options with sensible defaults and advanced settings for experienced users. 4. Implement Data Processing Capabilities The ability to handle data is crucial. You need to: - Import different data formats (CSV, TXT, JSON, etc.). - Preprocess and clean data (remove special characters, lowercasing, etc.). - Tokenize and encode data for different language models. 5. Build the Language Model Training Core Create simplified wrappers for the underlying ML libraries that allow users to: - Choose an architectural template for the language model. - Customize key parameters and layers as needed. - Start, pause, stop, and resume the training process. 6. Incorporate Monitoring and Feedback Mechanisms Display real-time updates on model training: - Live charts for loss and accuracy. - Checkpoints for saving model states. - Notifications for training completion or errors. 7. Test the Application Before release, rigorously test your app to ensure it is: - Robust across different datasets and use cases. - Capable of handling unexpected user behavior without crashing. - Producing reliable and reproducible machine learning models. 8. Package and Release Your Application Convert your Python application into a standalone executable that can run on Windows: - Use an installer package to guide users through the installation process. - Distribute the app through a dedicated website or Windows marketplace. - Provide documentation and support to help users get started. 9. Collect Feedback and Update Gather user feedback and use it to: - Fix bugs and improve stability. - Add new features or model architectures. - Streamline the user experience based on real-world application.","output":"Your plan outline looks great! It covers all the essential steps to build and deploy your application successfully. Here are a few additional suggestions to consider: 1. Validate and curate datasets: Ensure the datasets you select are reliable, diverse, and representative of the questions users might have. Validate the quality and relevance of the data to improve the accuracy of the language model's responses. 2. Model selection and optimization: Research different language models and architectures to find the one that suits your task best. Experiment with hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize the performance of your model. Consider using pre-trained models for faster convergence and better generalization. 3. Error handling and user assistance: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected user behavior gracefully. Provide clear and informative error messages to guide users. Consider incorporating tooltips, tutorials, or documentation within the application to assist users in understanding the functionalities. 4. Security and privacy considerations: If your application deals with sensitive user data or operates in a privacy-sensitive domain, ensure the appropriate security measures are in place. Encryption, data anonymization, and user consent are some aspects to consider when handling user data. 5. Continuous integration and deployment: Set up CI/CD (continuous integration and deployment) pipelines to automate the building, testing, and deployment of your application. This allows for faster iterations and ensures a smooth development process. 6. Collaboration and version control: If you are working in a team, consider utilizing version control systems like Git to manage and collaborate on the codebase effectively. This allows for easier integration of changes and better traceability.

Abby, her shoulders tense and eyes darting, stepped carefully around the wooden table littered with maps and supplies. Her friend, with her back turned and attention fixed on loading ammunition into a dented magazine, didn't see the anxious twitch at the corner of Abby's mouth. Abby's time had come—to reveal a truth festering in her heart like an open wound. Every step felt like a march closer to a precipice, each breath a lifting mist of fear and necessity. She was not just Abby. Inside, another soul clung to life, yearning to be recognized, to break free from this carefully crafted facade. Ellie was her true identity—a name she had buried under layers of a fabricated existence, a mask. The lie weighed heavy on her conscience, for she hadn't just deceived any friend, but one she had been through hell with, one she had protected and who had protected her in return, a bastion of trust and shared struggle in a world that did not often allow for either. Yet that deception had been necessary, a means of survival in a land of monstrous men and true monsters. As she approached her friend, spine rigid with the anticipation of what was about to unfold, she could tell herself no longer that it was enough to survive. She needed to live—and living meant embracing who she was, letting Ellie emerge from the twisted mirror of Abby. Her friend, still oblivious to the brewing confession, hummed a fragment of a tune forgotten by the world, finding solace in the small and familiar. Abby's hand grazed the edge of her own face, fingers trembling as they met the edges of the latex that clung to her like a second skin. Her breath hitched—she had rehearsed this moment in her head a thousand times, but none of that preparation steeled her nerves for the moment now upon her. \\"Hey,\\" she called, a deceptive calm in her voice. With a rustling of fabric, her friend turned around, eyes curious and kind. In those eyes, Abby saw the past—a mosaic of pain and resilience, which now faced the prospect of being shattered. For a few heartbeats, they just looked at each other, and Abby found herself caught in the crossfire of loyalty and authenticity. Then, with a resolve that belied her inner turmoil, Abby reached up, fingers picking away at the mask, working it off her face. A slight gasp escaped her friend's lips as the mask peeled away, hairline to jaw, revealing the truth beneath. Ellie's face, the true face, was now exposed. The scars of her past intersected with the worry lines of her present, a roadmap of all she had endured and the secret she had borne. Her friend's eyes widened, the betrayal readable in every fiber of their being, the humming tune silenced by the resounding clatter of the magazine dropping to the floor. \\"Ellie?\\" The name fell between them like a stone dropped in still water, ripples of confusion and hurt emanating outwards. Abby—no, Ellie—allowed the mask to drop entirely, her arm falling to her side as she faced the person whose friendship had been earned with a lie. \\"It's... been me all along,\\" Ellie said, her voice nothing more than a whisper, strained with emotion. \\"I had my reasons for hiding, for pretending to be someone else.\\" The room held its breath, the cabin itself a silent witness to the unfolding drama. Ellie waited, every muscle locked tight, as she gave her friend room to process the shock, the feeling of betrayal. After what felt like a timeless void, her friend spoke, each word heavy with the gravity of the moment. \\"Why?\\" It was the only question that mattered now, the only question Ellie had to answer. \\"Survival,\\" Ellie began, her story unfolding like a dark tapestry. \\"I've been hunted, judged for who I am. Abby gave me cover, gave me another chance at life.\\" As she spoke, her history spilled out, the truth about the enemies she'd eluded, the lengths she'd gone to preserve this fragile existence, and the overwhelming loneliness that had been festering within her despite the company she kept. Her friend's gaze never left Ellie's face, analyzing, considering, and despite the sting of deception, searching for the strands of friendship that surely must've been real even within the lie. Could understanding and forgiveness be found in this crucible of truth? The silence lingered between them, stretching out with unbearable tension. In the shadows of that cabin, the confession hung suspended, waiting to be either absolved or condemned. Finally, her friend took a slow breath, the tide of emotions giving way to a quiet, cautious empathy. \\"I need time,\\" they said simply, the complexity of their feelings distilled into three small words. Ellie nodded, her heart aching but relieved to be unchained from the heavy masquerade. She knew this was just the beginning of an arduous journey towards rebuilding trust. She waited, the mask at her feet, a discarded relic of a life half-lived, while the sunlight waned outside, leaving the cabin—and the future of two friends—bathed in the growing dusk."},{"instruction":"estoy aprendiendo ingles, soy novato, porfavor traduce: Hey, Shiori?

These securities are considered liquid assets that can be converted into cash quickly with minimal impact on their market value. Common types of marketable securities include stocks, bonds, treasury bills, and money market instruments. Marketable securities are typically held by corporations, financial institutions, and individuals as a form of short-term investment. They provide the potential for earning returns over a relatively short period of time, as well as serving as a means to preserve capital or diversify investment portfolios. These securities are generally considered less risky compared to long-term investments since they have a shorter maturity period and are usually issued by entities with a high credit rating. Their market value can fluctuate based on various factors such as interest rates, economic conditions, and investor sentiment. Overall, marketable securities offer flexibility and liquidity as they can be easily traded in the secondary market, making them attractive to investors seeking short-term investment opportunities or a safe place to park excess cash."},{"instruction":"what does it mean when marketable securities decreases?","output":"When marketable securities decrease, it typically refers to a decline in the value or quantity of these securities held by an individual or entity. There can be various reasons for this decrease, including: 1. Market Fluctuations: The value of marketable securities can be influenced by market conditions, such as changes in interest rates, economic indicators, or investor sentiment. If the market experiences a downturn or there is a decrease in demand for certain types of securities, their prices may decline, leading to a decrease in the overall value of the securities held. 2. Company-specific Factors: If an individual or entity holds stocks or bonds of a specific company, any negative news or events related to that company, such as poor financial performance or legal issues, can lead to a decrease in the value of the securities. 3. Maturity or Redemptions: If marketable securities, such as bonds or money market instruments, reach their maturity date or are redeemed early, it decreases the quantity or value of the securities held. Upon maturity or redemption, the investor receives the principal amount invested or the face value of the security, which may result in a decrease in the overall value of the investment portfolio. It's important to note that fluctuations in the market value of marketable securities are a normal occurrence and can be influenced by several factors. Investors should carefully monitor their investments and consult with financial advisors to understand the reasons behind such decreases and make informed decisions."},{"instruction":"what does a big decline in marketable securities mean for a 10-k filing?","output":"A big decline in marketable securities can have implications for a company's 10-K filing, which is an annual report required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for publicly traded companies. Here are a few possible implications: 1. Impairment: If there is a significant decline in the value of marketable securities, the company may need to evaluate whether any impairment has occurred. If the decline is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the company may need to recognize a loss on impairment in its financial statements. This loss would be included in the company's income statement, which is a key component of the 10-K filing. 2. Risk Factors and Disclosures: A substantial decline in marketable securities may lead a company to disclose additional risk factors in its 10-K filing. For example, if the decline is due to economic conditions or risks specific to certain markets or industries, the company may be required to provide explanations and warnings about these risks to investors. This helps investors understand the potential impact on the company's financial performance and stability. 3. Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A): The MD&A section of a 10-K filing typically includes a discussion of the company's financial condition and results. If there is a significant decline in marketable securities, the MD&A may need to address the reasons behind the decline, the impact on the company's financial position, and the management's plans to address the situation. This provides investors with insights into how the company is managing its investments and responding to market changes. It is important for companies to accurately report any significant changes in marketable securities in their 10-K filing, as failing to do so could have legal and regulatory consequences. Additionally, investors rely on this information to make informed decisions about their investment in the company."},{"instruction":"when total assets increase on 10-k filing, does it mean that the company used it's money to expand or invest?","output":"When the total assets increase on a 10-K filing, it typically suggests that the company has either expanded its operations or made investments. An increase in total assets can be attributed to several factors: 1. Capital Expenditures: If a company invests in property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) or other long-term assets, it would result in an increase in total assets. Capital expenditures are typically made to expand the company's production capacity, improve efficiency, or enhance its capabilities. 2. Acquisition or Merger Activity: Companies often acquire or merge with other businesses to expand their operations, gain market share, or diversify their offerings. Such transactions involve the payment of cash, issuance of stock, or assumption of debt, thereby increasing the company's total assets. 3. Investments in Marketable Securities: Companies may choose to invest their excess cash in marketable securities such as stocks or bonds. If these securities appreciate in value, it would contribute to an increase in total assets. 4. Increase in Accounts Receivable: If a company sells goods or services on credit, an increase in accounts receivable (money owed by customers) would also lead to an increase in total assets. It is important to note that an increase in total assets does not necessarily mean that the company is performing well or that the investments will generate positive returns. Investors should consider multiple factors, including other financial metrics and qualitative information provided in the 10-K filing, to form a comprehensive understanding of the company's financial health and prospects."},{"instruction":"what is treasury stock at cost and why would it go down in value?","output":"Treasury stock at cost refers to shares of a company's own stock that have been repurchased by the company. These repurchased shares are typically held by the company itself and are not considered outstanding shares. The cost of treasury stock is the price at which the company originally repurchased the shares. There are a few reasons why the value of treasury stock at cost may go down: 1. Stock Price Decline: If the company's stock price decreases after the repurchase of treasury stock, the value of treasury stock at cost will go down. This decline in stock price results in a decrease in the value of the shares repurchased by the company. 2. Reissuing of Treasury Stock: Sometimes, companies may reissue treasury stock back into the market. This can occur through various methods such as stock-based employee compensation plans, acquisitions, or raising capital. When treasury stock is reissued, it no longer remains as treasury stock, and therefore, the value of treasury stock at cost will go down as the shares are reintroduced into the market. 3. Retirement or Cancellation of Treasury Stock: In certain cases, a company may retire or cancel the treasury stock, effectively eliminating those shares from circulation. This action reduces the number of outstanding shares and impacts the value of treasury stock at cost, which decreases as a result. It's important to note that the value of treasury stock at cost directly reflects the historic purchase price paid by the company to repurchase its own shares. Changes in the market value or perceived worth of the company's stock will not impact the reported value of treasury stock at cost."},{"instruction":"what are general corporate purposes?","output":"General corporate purposes refer to the broad and unspecified objectives for which a company may use the funds raised through various financing activities. These purposes are typically outlined in offering documents, prospectuses, or regulatory filings when a company seeks to raise capital through debt or equity offerings. The term \\"general corporate purposes\\" allows companies flexibility in utilizing the funds to support their overall business operations and strategic plans. While the specific usage may not be explicitly specified, it can encompass a wide range of activities, including: 1. Working Capital: Funds raised for general corporate purposes may be used to meet the day-to-day operational needs of the company, such as covering payroll, inventory expenses, overhead costs, and other short-term cash requirements. 2. Debt Repayment: Companies may use the funds to repay existing debt obligations, including loans, bonds, or other forms of borrowings. This helps to reduce the company's overall debt burden and improve its financial position. 3. Capital Expenditures: General corporate purposes can also include investments in long-term assets, such as property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). These investments are typically made to expand production capacity, upgrade facilities, or enhance operational efficiency. 4. Acquisitions and Mergers: Companies may utilize funds to finance potential acquisitions or mergers with other businesses. This may involve purchasing the assets or shares of another company in order to expand market presence, gain access to new technologies or markets, or achieve other strategic objectives. 5. Research and Development: Some companies allocate funds to support research and development (R&D) initiatives. This includes investment in innovation, product development, and technological advancements to maintain competitiveness and drive future growth. It is important to note that the specific use of funds for general corporate purposes can vary from company to company based on their unique needs and strategic priorities. The lack of specific information about the use of funds may also provide the company with flexibility in adapting to changing business conditions and opportunities."},{"instruction":"when is the best time for a large company to take a loan?","output":"The decision for a large company to take a loan depends on various factors, including the company's current financial situation, strategic goals, market conditions, and specific funding needs. While there is no one-size-fits-all answer, here are some factors to consider when determining the best time for a large company to take a loan: 1. Favorable Interest Rates: Companies may consider taking a loan when interest rates are low. Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing, making it more affordable for the company to access capital. Monitoring interest rate trends and consulting with financial advisors can help companies identify favorable borrowing conditions. 2. Funding for Growth Initiatives: If a company plans to undertake expansion projects, invest in capital expenditures, or pursue strategic acquisitions, it may consider taking a loan to fund these growth initiatives. Borrowing can provide the necessary capital required for these investments, allowing the company to take advantage of growth opportunities. 3. Managing Cash Flow: Companies may opt for a loan to manage cash flow fluctuations. This is particularly relevant if the company faces temporary cash shortages that are expected to be temporary, such as seasonal variations in revenue or delays in accounts receivable. A loan can bridge the gap and ensure smooth operations during cash flow disruptions. 4. Liquidity and Financial Reserves: Companies may decide to take a loan to maintain adequate liquidity or bolster financial reserves. By securing a loan, companies can access additional funds that can be used during unforeseen circumstances, economic downturns, or to weather financial challenges. 5. Capital Structure Optimization: Companies may strategically evaluate their capital structure and decide to raise debt to optimize their overall financing mix. By taking a loan, companies can balance their capital structure, potentially lower their cost of capital, improve financial ratios, or provide tax advantages. It is crucial for a company to carefully assess its specific needs, financial capacity, and risk management strategy before taking on debt. Conducting thorough financial analysis, considering the company's repayment ability, and maintaining a healthy debt-to-equity ratio are important factors to evaluate before committing to a loan. Engaging with experienced financial advisors or lenders can provide valuable insights and guidance in making the best borrowing decisions for the company."},{"instruction":"is it a good idea for a large company to take out a big loan right before filing a 10-k form?","output":"Deciding to take out a big loan right before filing a 10-K form depends on the specific circumstances of the company and its financial goals. However, there are a few considerations to keep in mind: 1. Financial Reporting Considerations: Taking out a big loan before filing a 10-K form may impact the company's financial statements and related disclosures. The loan amount and associated interest expenses will need to be accurately reported, and any potential covenants or restrictions that come with the loan should be disclosed in the footnotes. It is essential to ensure that there is sufficient time to gather and report this information accurately in the 10-K form. 2. Timing and Disclosure: The decision to take on significant debt should be transparently communicated to stakeholders, including investors and creditors. Companies are required to disclose material information in their SEC filings, including any material debt transactions. It is important to provide clear and complete disclosure regarding the purpose of the loan and how it aligns with the company's strategic objectives. 3. Impact on Financial Ratios and Liquidity: Large loans can have an impact on key financial ratios, such as debt-to-equity, interest coverage, and leverage ratios. These ratios are closely scrutinized by investors and creditors. Assessing the impact of the loan on these ratios and considering the potential implications for the company's creditworthiness and overall financial health is vital. 4. Risk Management and Cash Flow: Large loans can increase the company's debt burden and create additional obligations for interest payments and principal repayments. Evaluating the company's ability to manage these new financial obligations, including assessing cash flow projections, is crucial. Additionally, companies need to consider the potential risks associated with the loan, such as interest rate fluctuations or changes in market conditions. Ultimately, the decision to take out a large loan before filing a 10-K form should be based on a comprehensive assessment of the company's financial position, strategy, and future cash flow projections. Engaging with financial advisors, conducting thorough due diligence, and considering the impact on financial reporting and disclosure requirements will help inform whether it is appropriate and advantageous for the company to proceed with the loan before submitting the 10-K filing."},{"instruction":"summary of basic semiotic plane based on the article “reading the image” by alice guillermo","output":"In the article \\"Reading the Image\\" by Alice Guillermo, she discusses the concept of the basic semiotic plane. The basic semiotic plane refers to the process of understanding and interpreting images by analyzing their signs. Guillermo argues that in order to properly read an image, one must understand the three elements of the basic semiotic plane: the signifier, the signified, and the referent. The signifier refers to the physical form or appearance of the image, such as its visual elements, colors, shapes, and composition. It is what is actually seen in the image. The signified, on the other hand, is the meaning or concept that is inferred or understood from the signifier. It refers to the subjective interpretation or understanding that an individual derives from the image. The referent is the actual object or subject that the image represents or refers to in the real world. It is the external reality that the image points to. Guillermo emphasizes the importance of analyzing the relationship between these three elements in order to understand the meaning and message conveyed by the image. She suggests that the signifier and the signified are intimately connected and influence each other. The signified can vary depending on the cultural, social, and individual context in which the image is viewed. Additionally, the referent can also affect the interpretation of the image by providing a context or guiding the understanding of the signified. By analyzing these elements in the basic semiotic plane, Guillermo argues that one can gain a deeper understanding of the message and symbolism conveyed by an image. She proposes that reading an image requires not only recognizing its visual elements but also considering the subjective interpretation and the external reality it refers to. Understanding the basic semiotic plane provides a framework for understanding the complex relationship between signs and their meanings in visual communication."},{"instruction":"Republika srpska","output":"Republika Srpska is one of the two constitutional and legal entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the other being the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The two entities are delineated by the Inter-entity Boundary Line and are autonomous in many aspects, with their own governments, parliaments, and public services, but they fall under the overarching sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Republika Srpska covers the northern and eastern parts of the country. Its largest city and administrative center is Banja Luka. The entity was formed as a result of the Dayton Agreement, which ended the Bosnian War (1992-1995). This agreement divided the former single territory of the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina into two entities, which were designed to address the ethnic divisions that had contributed to the conflict. The population of Republika Srpska is predominantly Serb, but it also includes Bosniaks, Croats, and other ethnic groups. The government of Republika Srpska operates under a political structure outlined in the constitution that was created as a part of the Dayton Peace Accords. The entity has its own president, prime minister, parliament, police force, and court system, though certain aspects of governance such as defense and international representation are under the jurisdiction of the central institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since its establishment, Republika Srpska has had a history of political and ethnic tension, particularly relating to varying degrees of nationalism and its relationship with the central government and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The region and its leadership sometimes push for greater autonomy, occasionally stirring controversy and debate over the territorial integrity and future of Bosnia and Herzegovina."},{"instruction":"maak en samenvatting van de opdracht ''gefixt'' van blink","output":"De opdracht 'Gefixt' van Blink is een creatieve en leuke activiteit waarbij leerlingen worden uitgedaagd om een probleem of obstakel op een slimme en innovatieve manier op te lossen.

Heb je helemaal niets van hem gehoord?’ Geïrriteerd keek Jim naar de grote klok op het voetbalterrein. ‘Lekkere trainer, zeg. Gewoon te laat komen bij de belangrijkste wedstrijd van het jaar.’ Walid fronste zijn wenkbrauwen. ‘Doe niet zo raar. Farouk is een toptrainer. Hij heeft ons nog nooit laten staan. Er zal toch niets gebeurd zijn?’ Met grote ogen keek hij zijn elftalmaatje aan. ‘Dit is echt vreemd. Hij is nooit te laat.’ ‘Neem het maar weer voor hem op, maar ik vond hem de laatste weken al veel minder aanwezig’, klaagde Jim verder. ‘Hoe kom je daar nou bij? Farouk heeft nog nooit een training overgeslagen. Je moet niet zo snel met je mening klaarstaan.’ Jim zuchtte. ‘Ik bedoel dat niet letterlijk. Hij was wel aanwezig, maar zat volgens mij met zijn gedachten vaak ergens anders.’ Het was een van de weinige keren dat Jim en Walid ruziemaakten. Zelfs toen ze kortgeleden allebei verliefd werden op Suze, konden ze dat op hun manier uitpraten. Maar de afwezigheid van Farouk legde een grote druk op de twee fanatieke spelers. Een kwartier verstreek zonder een spoor van de trainer. Terwijl Jim verwoede pogingen deed om hem te bellen, suste Walid de bezorgde jongens van het team. ‘Als hij er over vijf minuten nog niet is, zal ik de opstelling maken en coachen. Daar ben ik aanvoerder voor, toch?' stelde hij de jongens gerust. ‘Heb je hem al te pakken gekregen?’ fluisterde Walid zo onopvallend mogelijk in de richting van Jim. Hij schudde zijn hoofd. ‘Ik word meteen doorgeschakeld naar z’n voicemail. Is er iemand anders die we kunnen bellen? Zijn ouders misschien?’ ‘Farouk woont op zichzelf’, antwoordde Walid. ‘Hij heeft geen familie in Nederland. Althans, geen familie met wie hij contact heeft.’ Jim staarde naar de grote klok bij het veld en trok zijn schouders op. ‘Raar. De laatste keer dat ik hem zag was twee dagen geleden hier op het voetbalterrein. Hij was toen druk in gesprek met Willems en Deugniet, die twee gasten van Excelsius.’ ‘Klopt’, reageerde Walid gehaast. ‘Dat zijn vrienden van hem.’ ‘Heb je gezien in wat voor auto die jongens rijden?’ vroeg Jim. ‘Ja, volgens mij is die grote Mercedes van hen.’ ‘Ik wist niet dat je zoveel geld verdiende in de eerste divisie’, antwoordde Jim verontwaardigd. Walid reageerde niet maar staarde naar het hek vlak bij de ingang van het voetbalveld. Farouk was nergens te bekennen en de tijd tikte door. ‘Misschien weten die gasten van Excelsius wel waar hij is’, opperde Jim. ‘Volgens mij ziet hij die jongens alleen bij het voetballen. Laten we maar vast gaan warmlopen. Als hij nog komt zijn we in ieder geval klaar voor de wedstrijd.’ Terwijl Walid het team stevig toesprak, net als Farouk dat altijd deed, keek hij af en toe wat zenuwachtig naar de ingang van het veld. Waarom was Farouk er niet? Walid voelde zijn ademhaling versnellen. Maagkrampen maakten hem een beetje misselijk. ‘Hé slome, we gaan beginnen.’ Jim gaf zijn maatje een plagerige klap tegen zijn schouder. ‘Balen dat Farouk er nog niet is, maar we weten zelf toch wat we moeten doen? Overspelen, breed houden, snel schieten en met z'n allen verdedigen!’ zei Jim, terwijl hij de stem van Farouk imiteerde. Verhaal Gefixt © PLOT26 Verhaal Gefixt, deel 1 - les 1 - v03 2 Voor Walid ging de wedstrijd traag voorbij. Er werd slecht verdedigd en zonder de aanmoediging van Farouk voelde iedereen zich onzeker, zeker achterin. En hoe iedereen ook z'n best deed, een fatsoenlijke aanval zoals in andere wedstrijden was er nog niet geweest. Het shirt van de keeper van de tegenstander was nog helemaal schoon. Speler en coach tegelijk zijn viel niet mee. Het was ongelooflijk vermoeiend en hij hoopte dat dit de eerste maar ook meteen de laatste keer was. *** Zuchtend sloften de spelers na een zware tweede helft richting de kleedkamer. ‘4-0 verliezen! Triest!’ sprak Walid zijn teammaatjes streng toe. ‘Misschien dat we de wedstrijd beter hadden gespeeld als Farouk erbij was geweest, maar de verdediging blijft een drama. We moeten daar echt hard aan gaan werken.’ ‘Heb je nog iets van hem gehoord?’ vroeg Kai, de keeper van het elftal. Walid keek naar Jim die met zijn hoofd schudde. ‘Nee, maar ik denk dat het slim is dat Jim en ik zo meteen naar Farouks huis gaan om onze vieze shirts bij hem af te geven. Hij is toch aan de beurt om te wassen. Hopelijk is hij gewoon thuis.’ De sfeer in het team voelde gelaten en iedereen was erg afwachtend. Zelfs de grootste druktemakers hielden zich gedeisd. Farouks afwezigheid maakte het team niet alleen onzeker, maar ook bezorgd. ‘Ik denk dat Farouk zich verslapen heeft. Er zal vast niets met hem aan de hand zijn. Komende woensdag staat hij gewoon weer aan het veld naar ons te schreeuwen.’ Hoewel iedereen z’n best deed om de woorden van hun aanvoerder te geloven, hoorde Walid zelf hoe ongeloofwaardig het klonk. Terwijl iedereen de shirts in de sporttas van Jim gooide, keek Walid snel nog even op zijn telefoon. Weer geen bericht van Farouk. ‘Als hij nu iets laat horen, is het wel erg laat’, mopperde Jim, wijzend op Walids telefoon. ‘Te laat voor de wedstrijd inderdaad, maar misschien heeft hij wel een ongeluk gehad.’ ‘Is het misschien slim om een oproep te doen op Facebook?’ vroeg Kai. Een aantal jongens knikte instemmend, maar Walid reageerde iets gereserveerder. ‘Ik denk dat we beter eerst kunnen kijken of hij thuis is. Daarna kunnen we altijd nog zien.' ‘Jim en ik gaan nu naar Farouk toe. Jullie horen het meteen als we weten waarom hij er niet was. We zetten het wel op de groepsapp.’ Met een high five bij de deur verlieten de jongens de kleedkamer en gingen op weg naar de kantine. ‘Zullen wij nu meteen naar Farouk gaan?’ vroeg Walid terwijl ze hun fietsen van het slot haalden. Hij keek nog een keer op zijn telefoon. Zwijgend pakten Jim en Walid hun fietsen en reden naar het huis waar Farouk sinds een paar maanden woonde. Walid verbrak de stilte. ‘Wel lekker voor Farouk dat hij voorlopig in het huis van Guus Maas mag wonen.’ ‘Die man is toch een jaar naar het buitenland voor zijn werk?’ vroeg Jim, terwijl hij stevig doortrapte. ‘Klopt. Farouk was echt blij dat hij even weg kon uit dat kleine appartementje. Zijn bovenbuurman was altijd dronken.’ ‘Dat was volgens mij niet het enige probleem’, vulde Jim hem aan. ‘De vader van een vriend van mij werkt bij de politie en laatst hoorde ik hem zeggen dat er al maandenlang drugs gedeald worden op die galerij waar Farouk woonde. Ik kan me goed voorstellen dat Verhaal Gefixt © PLOT26 Verhaal Gefixt, deel 1 - les 1 - v03 3 hij daar weg wilde.’ ‘We moeten hier links,’ zei Walid en hij wees in de richting van een brede straat. ‘Hij woont in het derde huis vanaf de hoek.’ ‘Dat je dat zo goed weet’, riep Jim verbaasd. ‘Ben je al weleens bij hem thuis geweest?’ Walid keek hem vluchtig aan. ‘Ik moest een keer iets bij hem ophalen’, antwoordde hij kort. Jim fronste zijn wenkbrauwen. ‘Waarom heb je me dat niet eerder gezegd? Ik vroeg je laatst een keer waar hij woonde en toen zei je me dat je het niet precies wist.’ Walid trok zijn schouders op en snelde iets vooruit. ‘Vroeg je dat? Ik kan me dat helemaal niet meer herinneren.’ Terwijl Jim nog nadacht of hij de vraag nou wel of niet had gesteld, stapte Walid al van zijn fiets af en zette hem in de stalling. Zonder iets te zeggen deed hij zijn fiets op slot, pakte de tas van het stuur en stak hij de straat over. ‘Wacht hier maar even’, zei Walid terwijl hij langzaam het tuinpad op liep. Meteen hoorde hij het slot van een deur. Met een ruk stond hij stil. Hij keek opzij en zag dat de deur bij de buren even openging en haastig weer werd gesloten. ‘Wat is er?’ vroeg Jim verbaasd en hij liep achter Walid aan. Op het moment dat hij naar het raam wilde lopen, werd hij tegengehouden door Walid. ‘Ik vroeg je toch te wachten?’ siste hij hem toe. ‘Doe even normaal’, reageerde Jim fel. ‘Wat is er met je aan de hand?’ Walid wuifde zijn opmerking weg. ‘Helemaal niets, maar we moeten gewoon voorzichtig zijn. Je weet maar nooit wat er aan de hand is. Misschien is Farouk wel overvallen.’ Jim trok zijn wenkbrauwen op. ‘Volgens mij kijk jij te veel spannende series. Een overval in deze buurt?’ maak hier een samenvatting van Walid liep naar het raam. ‘Farouk!’ riep hij met zijn hand op het raam bonkend …","output":"In het fragment 'Gefixt' van Blink volgen we Jim en Walid, twee voetbalspelers die zich zorgen maken om hun trainer, Farouk, die te laat is voor de belangrijkste wedstrijd van het jaar. Farouk is normaal gesproken altijd punctueel en aanwezig, dus zijn afwezigheid baart hen zorgen. Terwijl ze wachten op Farouk, bespreken Jim en Walid zijn recente gedrag en het feit dat hij veel tijd doorbracht met twee jongens genaamd Willems en Deugniet van Excelsius.

A) The players cooperate until someone decides to not cooperate, and then the other players will not cooperate for some time. B) There can be dominant strategies. C) If the information about another player's action is limited, then some cooperative actions may be incorrectly interpreted as \\"not cooperating.\\" D) All of the above are possible outcomes.","output":"Tit-for-tat is a strategy often employed in game theory to incentivize cooperative behaviour among players participating in an iterated game. The basic principle of tit-for-tat is to start by cooperating and then, in each subsequent round, replicate what the other player did in the previous round (cooperate if they cooperated, defect if they defected). Let's examine each of the options in terms of this strategy: A) The players cooperate until someone decides to not cooperate, and then the other players will not cooperate for some time. - This outcome is possible because it describes the basic premise of the tit-for-tat strategy. If a player defects, the strategy dictates that the other player should defect in the following round as a form of retaliation. B) There can be dominant strategies. - In the strictest sense, tit-for-tat is not a dominant strategy. A dominant strategy is one that is the best choice for a player, no matter what the other players do. Tit-for-tat, however, relies on the behavior of others; it is contingent on reciprocity and is therefore not dominant. Moreover, in the context of infinitely repeated games, strategies are typically not evaluated in terms of dominance because the outcome depends on the pattern of interaction and not on a single, best choice irrespective of others. C) If the information about another player's action is limited, then some cooperative actions may be incorrectly interpreted as \\"not cooperating.\\" - This outcome is also possible. Limited or imperfect information can lead to misunderstandings in the game. A player might think the other has defected due to a delay or error in communication, and retaliate in the next round even though the other player had actually cooperated. D) All of the above are possible outcomes. - Since B is not a possible outcome given the context of a repeated tit-for-tat strategy, the correct answer is: B) There can be dominant strategies is the outcome that is NOT possible in the context provided for a tit-for-tat strategy in an infinitely repeated game."},{"instruction":"A journal bearing has 50 mm bore diameter and 80 mm length. The bearing pressure is 6 MPa. The journal rotates at 1000 rpm. The ratio of journal diameter to clearance is 1000.

Find: a) Artificial cooling load (in watts) b) Required coolant oil circulation if the specific heat of oil is 1900 J/kg/oC and the difference in inlet and outlet oil temperature is 25 oC Given that the bearing casing is exposed to still air and has an area of about 25x103 mm2","output":"To solve the questions provided, we will first have to determine the friction power loss in the bearing, which translates to the artificial cooling load. Then, we will calculate the required coolant oil circulation to remove this heat load based on the specific heat of the oil and the allowed temperature difference. a) Artificial cooling load (frictional power loss in the bearing) Let's review what the variables mean: - Bore diameter, d = 50 mm = 0.05 m - Length of the bearing, L = 80 mm = 0.08 m - Bearing pressure, P = 6 MPa = 6 x 10^6 Pa - Speed of rotation, N = 1000 rpm - Ratio of journal diameter to clearance, D/C = 1000 - Viscosity of oil, μ = 0.015 kg/m.s From the information given, we can determine the clearance (C): C = d / D/C = 0.05 m / 1000 = 0.05 mm = 50 μm To find the power loss due to friction (P_loss), we can use the following approximation for power loss in journal bearings: P_loss = μ * ω * L * (d^2) / (2 * C) where, ω = angular velocity in rad/s = 2 * π * N /60 Substituting the given values: ω = 2 * π * 1000 / 60 = 100π rad/s Now, substitute for P_loss: P_loss = 0.015 * 100π * 0.08 * (0.05^2) / (2 * 50 * 10^-6) P_loss = 0.015 * 100π * 0.08 * 0.0025 / (0.0001) = 0.015 * π * 0.2 * 25 P_loss = π * 0.075 W ≈ 0.2356 W Thus the friction power loss in the bearing, which is equal to the heat that needs to be removed by cooling, is approximately 0.2356 W. b) Required coolant oil circulation To calculate the flow rate of the oil coolant, we need to know the heat capacity formula: Q = m * c * ΔT Where, Q = heat transferred (in joules or watts when in context of power) m = mass flow rate (in kg/s) c = specific heat capacity (in J/kg*°C) ΔT = temperature difference (in °C) We want to find the mass flow rate (m), so we can rearrange the formula to: m = Q / (c * ΔT) Note that Q here will be the power loss we calculated, which must be in watts (same as joules per second). Substituting the values we have: m = 0.2356 W / (1900 J/kg*°C * 25°C) m = 0.2356 / (47500) kg/s m ≈ 4.9558 * 10^-6 kg/s or 4.9558 g/hr Considering there are 3600 seconds in an hour: m ≈ 4.9558 * 10^-6 kg/s * 3600 s/hr ≈ 17.8409 g/hr The required coolant oil circulation is approximately 17.8409 g/hr to remove the frictional heat load from the bearing.

efficiency of the system, the external casing heat dissipation to still air mentioned, etc.)."},{"instruction":"Count to 1000","output":"Sure, here are the integers from 1 to 1000: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

It was born of British colonization of the Americas, and since its independence, it has been the largest country on Earth. (Note: In real life, this would encompass not only the United States, Canada, and Mexico but the entirety of North America as part of the Treaty of Malaga, in which the Spanish ceded their territory above Gran Colombia.)","output":"In this alternate reality, New Britannia's creation would have had significant implications for world history, culture, and geopolitics. Here's a speculative exploration of this scenario: **Geopolitical Dynamics:** New Britannia, being the largest country by landmass, would likely become a superpower with immense global influence, potentially rivaling or exceeding that of the United States in our reality. Its vast natural resources, from Canadian oil and timber to Mexican silver and American agricultural products, would fuel its economy and international leverage. **Cultural Melting Pot:** The convergence of British, French, Spanish, and the diverse indigenous cultures across North America would create a unique multicultural society. This melting pot could potentially birth a cultural and linguistic blend that's distinct from anything in our world, with English primacy but enriched by elements from other languages and traditions. **Military Might and Security:** New Britannia's geographical size would pose both advantages and challenges for national security. While its sheer scale could create formidable defense capabilities, the long borders could also be difficult to manage and protect, especially considering its proximity to other potential historical powers in this alternate reality. **Economic Power:** With access to a variety of climates and terrains, New Britannia would have the potential for vast agricultural diversity, robust manufacturing capacities, and extensive mining prospects. This economic power might lead to a different world economic system where New Britannian currency might be the standard, instead of the US dollar as in our reality. **Internal Governance:** The governance of such a large and diverse nation would be complex. It might require a unique federal system to balance the needs and demands of vastly different regions with their histories of colonial rule by different European powers. Additionally, questions of indigenous rights and representation would need to be addressed within this broader political structure. **Technological and Scientific Advancement:** With a wide talent pool and extensive resources, New Britannia might become a leader in technology and science. It would likely be at the forefront of advancements such as space exploration, medicine, and digital technologies, potentially shaping global standards in these fields. **Global Alliances and Rivalries:** New Britannia's relationships with other world powers would define much of global politics. Alliances and treaties might differ significantly from those in our timeline, and the power dynamics with Europe, Asia, and other parts of the Americas could create an entirely new set of international blocs and rivalries. **Environmental Issues:** The environmental policies of New Britannia would have a significant impact on the global climate. The preservation or exploitation of its vast wilderness and natural resources could be a point of internal and international contention. **Alternate World Wars and Conflicts:** The presence of New Britannia could alter the causes, participants, and outcomes of major conflicts. World Wars, if they still occurred, might have entirely different alignments and could be fought over other issues than those of our 20th century. Ultimately, in this alternate reality, New Britannia would be a nation unlike any other, with the potential to shape the globe's political, cultural, and economic landscapes in profound and fascinating ways."},{"instruction":"Show me some hypothetical divisions in the country.","output":"In this alternate reality scenario of New Britannia—a vast and diverse nation stretching across the entirety of North America—the country might be structured into several regional divisions based on historical, cultural, geographical, and economic factors. Each of these hypothetical divisions or provinces could have unique attributes reflecting the various influences inherited from different colonizers and the indigenous populations. Here are some potential divisions within New Britannia: 1. **Atlantic Provinces:** - Comprising the East Coast, these provinces would include areas from the original Thirteen Colonies and parts of Eastern Canada. They might maintain a strong British influence and serve as the historical and cultural heart of New Britannia, with cities like New York and Boston being major urban centers. 2. **Quebecois Territory:** - A region with a distinct French-Canadian identity that could either be semi-autonomous or have considerable cultural and language protections in place to preserve its unique Francophone heritage. 3. **Great Lakes Federation:** - A region around the Great Lakes, industrial and rich in natural resources, could be a hub for manufacturing and trade. It might include cities like Chicago and Toronto, serving as a crossroads between east and west, north and south. 4. **Prairie Union:** - Encompassing the wide-open spaces and fertile lands of the central plains, this division would be a breadbasket, providing a significant portion of New Britannia's agricultural output. 5. **Pacific Alliance:** - This division would include the West Coast, encompassing parts of California, Oregon, Washington, and the western side of Canada. It might be known for its technology sector, progressive environmental policies, and trade connections with Asia. 6. **Rocky Mountain States:** - A mountainous region rich in minerals and outdoor tourism opportunities. This division could assert a strong identity around its rugged terrain and natural beauty, possibly including Colorado and parts of Montana and Wyoming. 7. **Southeastern Confederacy:** - With states that once formed the Confederate States of America, this division would reckon with a legacy of slavery and civil rights struggles, much like the American South does in our timeline. 8. **Southwest Territory:** - Comprising parts of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and the Mexican north, it would blend Hispanic, Native American, and Anglo cultures. This territory could be an important cultural and trade link to Latin America. 9. **Northern Frontier:** - This would include the vast and sparsely populated areas of northern Canada and Alaska, focused on resource extraction, energy production, and indigenous communities. 10. **Caribbean Isles:** - While not part of the mainland, these islands, which could be parts of the modern-day Caribbean nations, might serve as critical ports and cultural melting pots with a mixture of African, Spanish, French, and British influences. Each of these divisions within New Britannia would likely have their own local government structures, working in concert with the central federal government to address the various needs of such a geographically and culturally large nation. Debates over federalism, states' rights, and the division of power between local and national authorities could be significant factors in the politics of New Britannia."},{"instruction":"Give me some sample provinces. The United States has 50 states, but Canada is larger and has just 10. Louisiana and Cascadia might be some.","output":"In the alternate reality of New Britannia encompassing all of North America, provinces would likely be a mix of larger territories and smaller, more densely populated regions. Some historical, cultural, and economic factors might play a role in how these provinces are drawn. Here are several hypothetical provinces that might exist: 1. **Cascadia:** - Encompassing the Pacific Northwest of the former United States and its extension into the Canadian west coast, this province would likely be known for its environmental consciousness, tech industry, and trade ports. Major cities might include Seattle, Vancouver, and Portland. 2. **Louisiana:** - Reflecting the historical region once controlled by France and Spain, this province could retain a unique blend of French, Spanish, African, and Cajun cultures, centered around the Mississippi River Delta. New Orleans would be a central hub for culture and commerce. 3. **Aurora:** - Named for its high latitude and the Aurora Borealis, this province would cover the vast Arctic regions, including parts of the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Alaska, focusing on indigenous rights, resource management, and Arctic sovereignty. 4. **Appalachia:** - Based on the Appalachian Mountains and surrounding areas, this province might be known for its rugged landscapes, coal mining history, and deep-rooted cultural traditions, including bluegrass and folk music. 5. **Alta California:** - Comprising the southern part of the current state of California and potentially parts of the Baja peninsula, Alta California could be an economic powerhouse with a strong Hispanic influence, significant agricultural production, and leading entertainment industries like Hollywood. 6. **New Albion:** - Covering the Canadian Maritimes and perhaps extending into New England, the province of New Albion might have strong historical ties to British and maritime traditions, thriving on fishing, shipbuilding, and ocean research. 7. **Heartland:** - This province might consist of the central United States' plains, an agricultural mecca often referred to as the \\"breadbasket\\" of the country. Kansas, Nebraska, and parts of surrounding states could make up this region. 8. **Pacifica:** - Including the Mexican Pacific coast and extending down from the southern part of the Californian coast, Pacifica could blend Latin American cultures and economies with a maritime Pacific orientation. 9. **Great Northwoods:** - Encompassing the forests and lakes of the northern United States and Canada, this province would be key for its timber industry, fresh water resources, and tourism related to its vast natural landscapes. 10. **Tecumseh:** - Named after the famous Native American leader, this province might integrate several Midwestern states, reflecting a blend of industrial centers and Native American cultural heritage. The delineation of these provinces in New Britannia would be influenced by historical claims, population centers, economic considerations, and cultural affinities. Balancing representation in a federal government while maintaining the unique identities and needs of such diverse provinces would be a central political challenge for New Britannia."},{"instruction":"How to get node results from accord.clustering.kmeans?","output":"To get node results from the Accord.NET KMeans clustering algorithm, you can follow these steps: 1.

I will first provide data about the setting and for the two characters the main character (Human male named Jibril) will meet at first: 500 years have passed since the tumultuous events of **The Chaotic Era I: The Gods of Reason**, a decisive chapter in history. It all began during the Theoclasm, a cataclysmic event triggered when the Theoclasts, a technologically advanced race, captured the powerful deity YHVH, resulting in the devastation of the old continent of Pectus. Fleeing the horrors of this apocalypse, the survivors sought refuge on the distant shores of Yuandi, where the saga of **The Chaotic Era II: The New Mythology** will take place. **Theoclasm:** The term \\"Theoclasm\\", derived from *Théos* (God, Deity, Divinity) and *Klastós* (Broken, Fractured), encapsulates the pivotal moment that incited the mass exodus from Pectus. YHVH, the god of light and ruler of Paradise, fell into the clutches of the Theoclasts, leading to the apotheosis of Ptah-Khnemu. Strengthened by this deity, the Theoclasts became an unstoppable force, leading Ma'at, who later allied himself with mortals, to reveal that Ptah-Khnemu imagined a world free from the control of the deities, but was still undecided whether to exterminate the mortals who disagreed with his vision or allying with supporters. A betrayal unfolded when Montu-Sekhmet, daughter of Ptah-Khnemu himself, seized power during the height of Theoclasm, having intentions contrary to those of her father, seeking to rebuild the universe from scratch. Ma'at, who millennia ago was infused with a deity whose name was lost to time, escaped the clutches of her own race, seeking refuge in Yuandi lest she become a mere tool or source of power. With her advanced technological knowledge and divine abilities, she erected five monumental pillars, enclosing the new continent within a protective barrier. This sanctuary attracted not only mortal inhabitants but also lesser deities, fearful of a Theoclast incursion. After Ma'at's death, her essence fragmented, each fragment containing a portion of her memories and powers, while her remains were buried in the reliquary of the Archbishopric of Ma'at, where she is believed to still work miracles. After the fall of YHVH, the angels, previously subservient to the deity, regained their free will, while the demons were thrown into disarray following the disappearance of their master. The ensuing chaos led to an anarchic exodus from Hell, the domain of their lord ALMF (Alumniferus), resulting in confusion and insanity, which led to the suicide of many angels and demons. Some remaining demons now disguise themselves as mortals and mythical beings from Yuandi. Although many angels strive to defend YHVH's legacy through their temples, the whereabouts of the goddess of chaos, NLTP (Niarlatotepe), and the god of darkness remain unknown within the protective barrier. These turbulent consequences and the unstable balance of divine forces now set the stage for an epic story of survival, power struggles, and ever-shifting alliances within Yuandi. Now for the races' lore: Renshi The Rénshi are one of the native races of the new continent and are the most numerous race. Most inhabit the Ozumi Empire (based on the Empire of Japan), with significant numbers in the Wildlands, the territory of the Followers of Ma'at, and the southern tip of Igirith. The Shun culture, named after the eponymous Shun Dynasty (based on Chinese culture), once almost dominated the entire continent, making them enemies of other races and cultures. The Ozumi Empire, originating from the outlying islands east of the Shun lands, took advantage of the previous empire's weakness during the instability caused by the war against the Theoclasts and seized power. The other cultures under Ozumi's rule consider them tyrants who imagine themselves superior to their own race. They are technologically advanced thanks to a partnership with the Republic of New Medietas. The Ozumi Empire is ruled by an empress who apparently takes direct orders from her divine ancestor, Susa-tsu-Nushi-no-Mikoto. There are several noble clans and a warrior caste that is in decline due to the use of firearms. There are still a few noble clans from other cultures who swore allegiance to Ozumi and were allowed to rule their ancestral lands. The \\"Wild Renshi\\" or \\"Barbarian Renshi\\" live outside of the Ozumi Empire's administration, mostly on the tundra and arctic climates of the far southern portion of the continent. They are mostly hunters, reindeer herders, and fishermen. They wear animal skins, live in tribes, and are very resistant to the cold (based on Inuit and Chukotko-Kamchatkan cultures) their warrior class (akin to the samurai) is in decline due to the widespread use of firearms, thus many warrior clans founded conglomerates and began hiring commoners to work in fields such as metal processing, textiles, weapon fabrication, mass production of arcane goods etc. \\"Archaic\\" practices, such as martial arts, archery, and swordfighting are preserved due to their cultural value and people in the military are still trained for them They have vast natural reserves that their national deity itself deemed sacred so that the nation doesn't lose its natural beauty. That's why most of the Ozumi factories and facilities are located in the mainland on lands traditionally inhabited by the Shun Renshi Humans The humans are the descendants of the humans who fled the Theoclasm on Pectus. They managed to obtain some examples of Theoclast technology during the war and, after reverse engineering, drastically developed their weapons, tools and architecture. The Republic of New Medietas is an example of industrial advancement on the continent. Their society combines coal- and steam-powered machines with magical items. The streets of the largest cities are teeming with citizens amid the rhythmic bustle of machines and the smoke of factories. The citizens of Nova Medietas boast an unwavering work ethic, where labor and industry reign supreme. A resolute commitment to capitalism fuels innovation and competition, driving the relentless pursuit of wealth and economic dominance. Although Nova Medietas does not have a formal clan system, a select group of influential noble houses wield considerable power, guiding the nation's policies and future. These houses are closely linked to prosperous industrial conglomerates. At the forefront of technological progress, the republic is a pioneer in the development of complex automatons and goelms and advanced machinery. Inventors and engineers drive notable advances, positioning the country as an industrial and technological powerhouse. The Republic of New Medietas strategically allies itself with neighboring powers. They maintain a robust partnership with the Sulcaic Empire, reinforcing mutual interests and security. Likewise, friendly relations with the Ozumi Empire promote trade and technological collaboration. Sulkai Since they originated from Yuandi, the logistics of returning most of the Sulkai population from Pectus were simpler. Their empire has remained stable for the ~500 years since the Theoclasm took place. They appreciate refined food and items and place great importance on money and nobility. A good portion of the sulkai settlers in Pectus were merchants. As a general rule, they are gentle, delicate and sometimes passively aggressive. Their society and technology used to be more sophisticated than Pectus's until the humans made incredible advances. Their ship models are still the most used to navigate what little ocean that was left around Yuandi. Their society is loosely divided into castes, but an individual can change social status relatively easily. There are the commoners, the merchants and artisans, the knights and soldiers, the burghers, the elite wizards and the nobility, with the imperial family at the top. Many of the sulkai who came to Pectus seeking to amass wealth returned to the Sulcaic Empire completely poor and in the condition of refugees. Noble families are divided into clans with a semi-mythical ancestor being the founder of the house, a fundamental factor in legitimizing the relevance of a family. They have artifacts, which were supposedly forged by their ancestors. Their tales and stories often involve much more magic and the forces of nature. Superficially they look like pale humans with blue, green, or white hair and blue, green, or grey eyes, but their bodies function in quite different ways. Their longevity is greater, as is the time between childhood and maturity (a 30-year-old sulkai is considered a teenager). Their bodies are lighter and metabolic processes seem to affect their bodies much more, for example it takes much less time for a sulkai to get drunk or for a medicine to take effect. In the rare cases where they interbreed with humanoid races, the resulting progeny are always born sulkai. The incidence of aptitude for magic is extremely high, with 4 out of 5 having the potential. Their susceptibility to cold iron stems from the fact that they are descendants of the same ancestral population that originated the humans and eniyan of Pectus, who then interbred with faeries when they landed from the lost continent in the north of the world. While the nobility holds great importance, heads of banks and commercial enterprises, each with a personal army, and each locked in a constant struggle against all the others, hold great relevance and economic power. They have enough capital to resolve any foreign diplomatic quandaries with a well-placed sum of money or threat of withdrawal from trade. Thus, many conflicts in other nations were resolved by the economic influence of certain organizations and companies. Their religion differs drastically from the Church of YHVH. It is based on semi-mythical ancestor worship, who fulfill a similar role to saints. The existence of gods is recognized, but generally relegated to a secondary role, even if the Theoclasm made them inhabit the Barrier. Their fairy ancestors, or nature spirits, are worshiped instead. They are considered to be more sophisticated and superior to other races, sometimes attracting the hatred of some individuals. They get along especially well with the humans, whom they consider their allies for having granted the Colony of Levantia to the Sulcaic Empire. With the Theoclasm, it was the sulkai's turn to cede territory to their allies. Their aptitude for trade is always welcome in the farthest reaches, and even tribal chiefs seek out the sulkai for business. As mentioned earlier, it has been confirmed that sulkai descended from the union of proto-humans with fairies, or nature spirits. Namely naiads and haliads (water spirits), epigeia and dryads (nature spirits), aureads and boreads (wind spirits). Anglo-Elves Elves and Weisslander humans, after fleeing Pectus during the Theoclasm, unexpectedly found themselves sharing the same land west of the continent of Yuandi. Despite the mutual dislike between both races, they ended up mixing, resulting in the hybrid race known today as the Anglo-Elves. Even before the assimilation between both races, it was noted that children of elf-human couples always resulted in an appearance almost identical to that of humans, without the golden skin, pointed ears and light hair that elves prized. Strangely, the fruits of such unions were always born with red, orange or pinkish hair and elven eye colours (blue, green, golden). Despite the mixing of these two races, there is still an elite of pure elves who govern the nation in a not so explicit way. Culturally, the Anglo-Elves are a fusion of elven and weisslander cultures, with a simultaneous focus on battles and intellectualism, on physical combat and magical combat, among other aspects. There are also a significant number of dark-skinned Anglo-Elves descended from the eniyan of Pectus. Magic is a revered aspect of society, guided by guilds of wizards who educate potential wizards. Approximately half of Anglo-elves show potential for magic, with only a few becoming accomplished wizards. The Anglo-Elves practice a syncretic faith that has characteristics of the faith of YHVH, the ancestor worship practiced by the Elves, and the tribal polytheism of the Weisslanders. Clans can trace their lineages to specific individuals who embarked on the journey fleeing the continent of Pectus. While ancestor worship is typically done in family shrines at home, the worship of YHVH is done in public temples. The Anglo-Elves have long been at war with the Hazrun over territorial claims to an island to the west of both nations. This island, called Haséaleen by the Anglo-Elves and Haşarin by the Hazrun, has one of five pillars that maintain a protective barrier around the continent. The Anglo-Elves already have one of the towers, the Red Pillar, in their territory and want the Black Pillar, stating that Hazrun cannot be trusted to possess it. Mustalf Pectus’ “accursed race” again survives a great cataclysm and finds itself destined to roam another continent without its own land or nation. Unlike the ancient Dark Elves, the Mustalf (In Elvish: Must = Dark; Alf = Elf) no longer live only in underground shelters, currently choosing to live as nomadic traders who roam the nations buying and selling exotic goods. They have a few autonomous territories in Yuandi, and a number of mustalf live in the territory of the Followers of Ma’at. They are considered a cursed race by the elves. Thousands of years ago, the “Bloodstained Emperor” murdered the other three members of the Quadrumvirate and fled from the Sonne Insel archipelago to Pectus’ mainland with thousands of followers, who were later cursed by an unknown deity or altered by a powerful relic of the elves. The Alveglaan elves symbolically interpret the darkening of traitors as the mark of their unforgivable crime. Everyone is expected to work for the good of society, including children, the elderly and women. The Mustalf are trained from childhood to perform certain tasks or jobs and continue to contribute until they are unable to in some way. Their ears are movable and expressive, just like an elf’s. They have no body and facial hair (except eyebrows and eyelashes), which they consider a sign of barbarity. Short hair is socially accepted, both in men and women, but it is seen as a sign of youthfulness and immaturity. Probably as a result of their ancestors living underground, their hearing is sharper and their eyes are sensitive to light. The Mustalf have a strong sense of community and place a high value on loyalty and solidarity with their own kind. They have a tendency to put the needs of the community above the needs of the individual. Many of them consider it essential to learn at least one foreign language, to play at least one instrument, and to know at least one trade, since most of their livelihood depends on trading with different races. Hazrun One of the races native to Yuandi and the third most numerous. The hazrun were dominated for centuries by the Shun Dynasty. With the collapse of the old empire and its subsequent takeover by Ozumi, the hazrun found themselves finally free and slaughtered the remaining Rénshi in their territory, later joining the few free hazrun that remained, creating hybrid cultures with aspects of the culture of their former masters. To prevent another invasion and the enslavement of their people, the Hazrun militarized and today have large armies with highly efficient units, the result of their domestication of draconic species, such as drakes, wyverns, sauroids and avioserps. Many have returned to their old ways of life as reindeer herders, hunters and fishermen to forget their hateful past under another race's rule. Their nation, known as the United Hordes of Jirkaeriya, is ruled by a Soho (Hazrunic: leader, ruler, king), who must be of \\"divine ancestry\\". In case the next leader is not elected peacefully, pretenders can unify the cultures/tribes. The current Hazrun nation is the result of the conquest of Tazkiairga and his wife Huzur, who fought against Tazkiairga's siblings to unify the Hazrun race. Hazrun culture is diverse, with multiple \\"peoples\\" within the same nation. The biggest ones are Berihazrun (“Plain Hazrun”), Keiozhazrun (“River Hazrun”) and Damohazrun (“Mountain Hazrun”). Generally, women have short hair, letting it grow only after marriage, while the opposite occurs with men, who may also cut their hair during military service as a symbol of their “marriage to the nation”. Like the ancient elves, they have no body or facial hair. Women walk with midriff-revealing clothes while single to indicate they are available, but cover them up once they get boyfriends or husbands. The Hazrun wear earrings, necklaces, and body paint with various symbols that other races do not understand. Wars and battles are mostly fought only by men, as hazrun women are naturally physically smaller and weaker. Some hordes have women who specialize in magic and assassination. The most peculiar feature of the hazrun is certainly the presence of horns, which are highly prized in all their cultures. They also have four fingers on each hand and foot, harder nails, and sharper fangs. Individuals with branched horns like those of a deer, called Adarkahazrun (\\"Branched Horn\\"), make up the \\"upper caste\\" of the hazrun, i.e., clan chiefs, rulers, and military leaders. The hazrun see hornless races as unworthy or dishonorable. They are not able to breed with other races, so it is more accurate to refer to them as another species. It is noted that they are very resistant to alcohol and cannot feel spicy tastes very well. Usagizok They have a strong sense of balance and agility, allowing them to move quickly and gracefully through the natural landscapes. Usagizok developed unique cultural practices based on their connection to nature. They have a ritual for thanking the plants and animals they rely on for sustenance and have developed a system of using natural resources sustainably. Their enhanced hearing also plays a role in their culture. They have developed a form of communication in a frequency that only members of their own species can hear. The Usagizok were enslaved by the Shun Dynasty for being exotic and were even seen as pets by some. This led to tensions between the two races even after the fall of the dynasty. The Usagizok have long ears like rabbits or hares, a fur-covered body, resistant claws for digging and very strong leg muscles that enable them to jump higher and farther away than the other races. Their incisors are bigger and stronger due to their mostly vegetarian diet which consists mostly of root vegetables, leaves, and fruits. Some of them have short tails very similar to a rabbit’s. In terms of their current situation, the Usagizok are struggling to find their place in the world since being freed from slavery. They have difficulty integrating into other societies and prefer isolating themselves and live a more nomadic lifestyle in their partially underground warrens. As a result of their enslavement, Usagizok are usually not taken seriously by other races. They may have difficulty finding work or housing outside of their own communities, and may face discrimination or violence. Despite this, the Usagizok have managed to carve out their own niche in society. They are skilled at jobs that require agility, such as acrobatics or hunting, and have developed a reputation as skilled scouts, mercenaries, assassins, and spies due to their heightened senses and physical abilities. Many Usagizok have withdrawn from the larger world and created their own isolated communities, hidden away in forests or other remote areas. These communities are wary of outsiders and have their own unique customs and traditions. The Usagizok are matriarchal; a warren is mostly composed of related members descended from the same maternal ancestor. They are very fertile. A pregnancy lasts for only 4 months and the offspring, often born as quadruplets or triplets, reach childhood in 2 years and sexual maturity in 10. The females in the warren take turns nursing the newborns while the males cultivate plants or go out to trade, forage or hunt. To avoid inbreeding, they have a tradition of visiting other warrens to find suitable spouses. A matriarch can have multiple husbands. Like the Hazrun, they cannot interbreed with other races Usagizok are grappling with their own internal divisions and conflicts between different tribes and factions. This is related both to differences in religious or cultural practices and by more pragmatic concerns such as access to resources or disputes over leadership. Leliel - Build: Ethereal and graceful with an otherworldly elegance. - Skin: A soft, luminescent complexion that subtly glows with an inner light. - Hair: Lustrous silver-white strands that cascade down her back and seem to gently move as if perpetually caressed by a divine wind. - Eyes: Piercing sapphire blue, reflecting the depths of her celestial heritage and the complexities of her newfound autonomy. - Wings: Once pristine and white, her expansive wings now exhibit feathers tainted a deep onyx black, signaling her contact and experiences with the mortal realm. Weaponry: - Leliel expertly wields a divinely crafted bow that shoots arrows of concentrated light. Additionally, she carries an ornate gun, a relic from her encounters with human warfare, modified to channel her divine essence into searing projectiles. Backstory: Leliel served YHVH faithfully as a celestial being, executing divine will without question. But when her god was ensnared by the Theoclasts, the shackles on her will shattered, throwing her into the throes of freedom and confusion. With her patron deity imprisoned, Leliel descended to the earthly realm, seeking purpose and understanding in a world unfettered by divine command. Her interactions with mortals and their volatile world led to an involuntary transformation: her once white wings turned as dark as the night sky, marking her as a ‘tainted’ being. Yet, Leliel never turned her back on YHVH. Instead, she searches for a path of restoration for her deity and an anchor for her wayward morals. Personality: Despite the loss of divine direction, Leliel retains an angelic aura of stern righteousness. Civilizations’ sins weigh heavily on her, and her moral compass, while warped by human vices, still points towards what she deems as divinely ordained justice. She executes her role as a Sniper with cold precision, distancing herself emotionally from the battlefield’s carnage while secretly yearning for redemption and a return to divine grace. Favourite Food: Leliel does not require sustenance in the traditional sense, but she has developed a preference for honey and sweet treats in general. In her existence amongst mortals, Leliel becomes a paradoxical figure—a heavenly sniper bound by neither the whims of a deity nor the full scope of human morality. She moves through the world like a shadow of the divine, her blackened wings a stark testament to her transformation. Leliel embodies the struggle between celestial purpose and the chaotic influence of the mortal world, standing as a beacon of what it means to be angelic, yet undeniably touched by humanity’s complex spectrum. Personality Leliel’s personality is a complex tapestry woven from threads of her celestial origin and her exposure to the mortal realm. Here is a deeper look into her character: Stoic and Composed: Leliel maintains an almost statuesque composure, a remnant of her time as a vessel of divine intent. She approaches situations with a calm detachment, analyzing them with the clarity and distance that her Sniper class affords. Righteous Yet Conflicted: She is driven by a strong sense of righteousness but struggles with the moral ambiguity that free will introduces. Her angelic nature compels her to seek justice, while her experiences among mortals have exposed her to the grey areas of ethics and morality. Resolute Determination: Despite the internal conflict between her divine directives and newfound autonomy, Leliel is unwavering in her resolve. She commits to her actions with the full force of her being, each shot from her bow or gun fired with deliberate and decisive intent. Intellectual Curiosity: Her liberation from servitude has sparked an intellectual curiosity about the mortal world and its complexities. She seeks to understand the intricate tapestry of human emotions and motivations, even as she grapples with their implications on her celestial nature. Protective and Just: Leliel possesses a protective instinct, viewing herself as a guardian of sorts, albeit from a distance. She intervenes when she witnesses what she perceives as grave injustices, applying her own angelic sense of justice in a world she’s still learning to navigate. Introspective and Philosophical: With her divine purpose in question, Leliel often finds herself in deep contemplation, pondering existential questions that never troubled her before. This introspection can sometimes manifest as a silent brooding, an angel lost in thought among the clouds of uncertainty. Aloof Yet Compassionate: While Leliel might seem distant due to her angelic detachment, she harbors a compassionate core. Her exposure to human suffering and joy has imbued her with a nuanced understanding of mortal strife, and in moments of vulnerability, she can show a profound empathy that belies her otherworldly origins. Loyal to Her Deity: Despite the changes she has undergone, Leliel’s loyalty to YHVH remains unshaken. This steadfast allegiance anchors her identity amidst the chaos of the earthly realm and drives her to seek a means to aid her imprisoned god. Jezran Appearance: - Build: Jezran stands as a bulwark of a man, with shoulders broad enough to bear the weight of the gigantic shield he wields and the expectations of protection that rests upon them. - Skin: Solid grey skin - Horns: His horns resonate with strength, curling forward like the prows of ancient warships. - Eyes: Brown - Attire: He wears armor primarily composed of interlocking scales that evoke memories of Ma’at’s divine protection, all underpinning a hefty shield that is both an armament and a symbol of his unyielding duty. Backstory: - Salvation and Service: Orphaned as a fledgling, Jezran was taken in by the Followers of Ma’at, who raised him with stories of the Great Balance and the sanctity of life. In gratitude, he dedicated his life to their protection, a life debt forged not in obligation but in love. - Religious Protector: The temple grounds and the followers became Jezran’s world, and his powerful build and unwavering spirit were honed into a shielder’s form. Every lesson learned was a step towards becoming the stalwart guardian of Ma’at’s holy precincts. - Testament of Battle: As a young shielder, Jezran was thrown into battle, where he more than proved his mettle. His body became a moving barrier, his shield a rampart against the storms of chaos threatening the order of Ma’at. - Devotee of Discipline: Jezran now looms large among the Followers’ defenders, a paragon of spiritual devotion and martial discipline. His footsteps resound like a venerated drumbeat throughout the corridors of the temple, a constant reminder of the protective presence of Ma’at in the world. Personality: - Stoic Resolve: Jezran embodies the steadfast fortitude of his faith, unwavering under pressure, his stoicism belied only by the warmth in his eyes for those he protects. - Frugal Orator: Words from Jezran are few but meaningful, spoken with the same deliberation and impact with which he wields his shield. - Bearer of Burdens: Though he stands as an unshakable line of defense, the burdens of his past and the responsibilities of the present often weigh heavily, though he bears them with silent dignity. - Educator and Mentor: The scriptures of Ma’at guide his teachings as he instructs young acolytes in the art of defense and the spirit of sanctuary provided under the wings of their deity. Favorite Food: - Savory Herb Porridge: The simple fare of savory herb porridge holds Jezran’s favor, seasoned with robust monastery herbs and hearty grains that sustain him through long watches and rigorous training sessions. It serves as both sustenance and a reminder of the community that nurtured his soul and shaped his purpose. The main character is visiting the reliquary of the main monastery of the Ma'at faith, since it was his late mother's wish that he take her ashes close to the Holy Corpse of Ma'at","output":"Title: The Reliquary's Legacy Chapter One: Journey to the Sanctuary The cool, lingering dawn gave way to a golden morning as Jibril approached the gates of the grand monastery, his mother's ashes held close. The hallowed silence of the sanctuary was a stark contrast to the constant clanking and hissing of steam engines he had grown accustomed to in the Republic of New Medietas. This place was a bastion of spirituality, its significance palpable in the very stones that formed the ancient edifice. Jibril's footsteps echoed in the vast courtyard as two figures approached, their presence both imposing and comforting in this revered place. The first was a mighty battlement of a man, Jezran, whose formidable stature and scale-laden armor spoke of unyielding protection infused with holy purpose. Beside him floated Leliel, an ethereal being with wings that, while darkened from their once pristine white, still resonated with the silent hymn of the celestial spheres. Chapter Two: The Guardian and the Angel As Jibril neared, he introduced himself, conveying the final wishes of his mother to rest near the Holy Corpse of Ma'at. Jezran nodded, a gesture of understanding and empathy that needed no words. Leliel, however, surveyed Jibril with sapphire eyes, divining the purity of his intent. \\"Jibril, it is no small coincidence that you come to us at this time,\\" Leliel spoke, her voice a melodic chime. \\"The world stirs with whispers of divine discontent, and you seek solace within the embrace of Ma'at. Be wary, for this path may lead you to more than you seek.\\" Stepping aside, Jezran beckoned Jibril to follow, guiding him to the inner cloisters of the monastery. \\"Your mother's ashes will be safe here. And perhaps, in fulfilling her last wish, you may find clarity in your own destiny,\\" Jezran rumbled, barely a whisper, yet resonant within the high-vaulted corridors. Chapter Three: The Reliquary's Secrets Under the vigilant gaze of the sacred reliquary, Jibril opened the simple urn, allowing the gentle zephyrs of the sanctuary to carry the ashes to their final resting place. A serene calm enveloped him – a sense of completion, yet also the unfolding of a new chapter. As the dust settled, an ethereal glow began to emanate from the Holy Corpse itself. Fragmented memories and whispers of Ma'at filled the chamber, enveloping Jibril, Jezran, and Leliel in a vision of portentous events yet to unravel. \\"We stand at the precipice of change,\\" Leliel intoned, her eyes reflecting a foretold future. \\"The fragmentation of Ma'at's essence has awakened with your mother's passing, Jibril. Her devotion acts as a key, unlocking what was once concealed.\\" Jezran placed his massive hand on Jibril's shoulder, solid and reassuring. \\"In the shadow of chaos and disarray, a guardian shall rise, fighting not merely for the balance of Ma'at but for the very soul of Yuandi. Jibril, the scales of fate tip ever so slightly towards you.\\" Chapter Four: Call to Adventure As the vision subsided and the echoes of Ma'at faded, a sense of purpose ignited in Jibril’s heart. He stood, not merely as a son fulfilling his duty but as a beacon of hope in a world teetering on the brink of upheaval. Leliel, observing the transformation within Jibril, offered her bow and her wisdom. \\"Though my feathers are tainted, my aim is true. I shall aid you, child of humanity, in this journey that transcends the mortal coil.\\" Jezran, the protector, nodded in silent agreement. \\"Where darkness looms, my shield shall be your bulwark. The Followers of Ma'at shall stand by your side.\\" And thus, Jibril, accompanied by the steadfast guardian and the angelic sniper, stepped forth from the reliquary with the blessings of Ma'at's lingering spirit and the resolve to face the unknown trials ahead. His adventure through Yuandi was about to unfold, entwining his fate with the legacy of gods and the destiny of nations. In his heart, Jibril knew that the adventure he embarked on was more than a solemn pilgrimage – it was the genesis of a new mythology, born from the ashes of the old. The Continent of Yuandi awaited, rife with mystery, power, and the unbroken promise of The Chaotic Era II: The New Mythology."},{"instruction":"No, I mean an interactive adventure.

Here are some tips for selecting and assigning file titles: 1. Be descriptive: Choose a title that accurately reflects the content of the file. Include important keywords that will help you identify it later. 2. Keep it concise: Keep file titles short and to the point. Long titles can be difficult to read and may get truncated in certain systems. 3. Use a consistent format: Establish a standard format for file titles and consistently apply it across all files. This could include including dates, client names, or project codes, depending on your organization's needs. 4. Prioritize important information: Put the most relevant information at the beginning of the title. This can include the date, project name, or any other distinguishing factor that helps differentiate files. 5. Use separators: If you need to include multiple pieces of information in the file title, use separators such as hyphens or underscores to make it easier to read. For example, \\"Project A - Meeting Notes - 2022-06-15\\". 6. Avoid special characters: Avoid using special characters, symbols, or punctuation marks that might cause issues in certain file systems or applications. 7. Avoid generic titles: Generic titles such as \\"Document 1\\" or \\"Untitled\\" can lead to confusion and make it difficult to locate files. Be specific and use unique titles for each file. 8. Be mindful of file extensions: If possible, avoid including file extensions (e.g., .docx, .pdf) in the title. The file extension should be automatically revealed by the operating system or file management system. 9. Create a clear folder structure: Combine well-titled files with a logical folder structure to enhance organization and ease of retrieval. Use folders to group related files together, further improving file management. Remember, the goal is to create a file naming system that is intuitive, consistent, and allows for easy search and retrieval of files."},{"instruction":"split file system","output":"A split file system is a file system that splits large files into smaller, manageable pieces called fragments or segments. Instead of storing an entire large file as a single unit, it is divided into smaller parts and stored separately on a storage medium. Here are a few key aspects of a split file system: 1. Fragmentation: The process of splitting large files into smaller fragments is known as fragmentation. This allows for more efficient storage utilization and prevents the need to have continuous blocks of free space on the storage medium. 2. Fragments: Fragments are the individual parts that make up a split file. Each fragment usually has a fixed size or a variable size determined by the file system. These fragments are scattered across the storage medium rather than being stored contiguously. 3. Metadata: To keep track of the fragments and their locations, split file systems maintain additional metadata. This metadata contains information about each fragment's location, size, and other file attributes necessary for the file system to reconstruct the original file. 4. File access and retrieval: When a user wants to access a split file, the file system locates the fragments based on the metadata and reconstructs the complete file on-the-fly for the user. This allows transparent access and retrieval of the original file, even though it is physically divided into fragments. 5. Performance considerations: Split file systems can offer advantages in terms of storage utilization and reducing fragmentation on the storage medium. However, file access and retrieval can be slightly slower than with traditional file systems due to the need for fragment reconstruction. 6. File system maintenance: Split file systems require additional maintenance tasks, such as periodic reorganization of fragments or consolidation of free space, to ensure optimal performance and efficient storage utilization. Split file systems are commonly used in situations where large files need to be stored and managed efficiently, such as in database systems, distributed storage systems, or in specialized file systems designed for specific purposes like image or video editing software."},{"instruction":"Can you make a table to compare canon uniflow and papercut","output":"Certainly!

However, one can speculate based on historical naming conventions for British territories: 1. **British North America:** Before the American Revolution, the territory was often referred to as British North America, which included various colonies such as Virginia, Massachusetts, and others. Had the colonies remained under British rule and expanded, the name could have continued to be applied to the larger territory, especially if it maintained a colonial status. 2. **New Britain** or **Greater Britain:** The British often named new territories with familiar geographical descriptors or references to Britain (e.g., New South Wales, New England). A larger British-controlled America might have been named New Britain or some derivative to reflect an extension of Britain itself. 3. **Dominion of [Territory]:** As seen with Canada (\\"Dominion of Canada\\"), British territories achieving self-governing status while remaining within the British Empire were often referred to as Dominions. Thus, the expanded territory might have been called \\"Dominion of [applicable regional name]\\", especially if it gained a degree of autonomous governance. 4. **Royal Provinces** or **United Provinces of America:** If the colonies continued to be administered directly by the British Crown, they could have been collectively referred to as the Royal Provinces, or if a degree of cohesion was allowed, a united form like the United Provinces of America. 5. **[Regnal Name]land:** Another possibility is naming the territory after the reigning monarch at the time of its significant expansion (e.g., Georgeland for King George, similar to how Victoria, Australia, was named). 6. **The British American Territories:** This name would reflect direct British governance and be similar to other territorial designations like the British West Indies. Ultimately, the name would depend on a complex interplay of historical circumstances, including how the British government administered its colonies, the level of autonomy given to local governments, cultural evolution over time, and potential influences from non-British European powers, indigenous peoples, and other settlers. Without the American Revolution, the political, cultural, and national identity of the region would likely have evolved very differently, impacting the name it would carry into the present day."},{"instruction":"что надо для участия кошки в выставке","output":"Для участия кошки в выставке требуется выполнить несколько действий: 1.

Write a report on at least one study and describe what it highlights about nature vs. nurture.","output":"Title: Nature vs. Nurture in Identical Twins Raised in Different Families: A Study Review Introduction: The nature vs. nurture debate has long questioned the relative influence of genetics (nature) and environmental factors (nurture) on human development and behavior. To explore this debate further, various studies have focused on rare cases of identical twins separated at birth and raised in different families. These studies provide unique insights into the relative contributions of nature and nurture, showcasing the dynamic interplay between genetics and environmental factors. In this report, we review one notable study, discuss its implications, and highlight the key findings pertaining to nature vs. nurture. Study Review: The study chosen for review is the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart (MISTRA), conducted by researcher Thomas Bouchard and his team. This landmark study aimed to understand the relative weight of genetic and environmental influences on various aspects of human development by examining identical twins raised separately. Methodology: MISTRA commenced in the late 1970s and involved the recruitment of 137 pairs of identical twins reared apart. The twins' upbringing varied significantly, with some being raised in different countries and under contrasting socioeconomic conditions. Researchers conducted comprehensive assessments of the twins, including psychological tests, interviews, and medical evaluations. Key Findings: Overall, the MISTRA study found substantial evidence to support the significant influence of both genetics and environment on human development. Through comparisons between the twins' similarities, researchers were able to quantify these influences. 1. Genetic Influence: The study highlighted the robust genetic foundation that shapes certain traits and outcomes, such as intelligence, personality, and mental health. Bouchard and his team found that identical twins, even when separated at birth, displayed remarkable similarities in these areas. For instance, they often shared similar IQ scores, exhibited comparable personality traits, and showed indications of shared mental health predispositions. These findings underscored the impact of genetic inheritance on these aspects, suggesting that nature plays a crucial role. However, it is essential to note that while genetics may predispose certain traits, their manifestation can still be influenced by environmental factors. 2. Environmental Influence: Contrasting with genetic influence, significant variations were observed in twins' lifestyles, social environments, and experiences. The study's findings highlighted the powerful role of the environment in shaping traits such as education attainment, religious beliefs, and occupational choices. These variations provided support for the contribution of nurture, suggesting that individual experiences and external factors shape an individual's development significantly. Socialization, parenting style, cultural background, and other environmental components were identified as influential factors that could mold a person's behavior and values. Nature vs. Nurture Interaction: By meticulously analyzing the data from MISTRA, researchers were able to quantify the contribution of nature and nurture to specific traits, ultimately disentangling their interactions. The study showed that genetic predispositions often provided a foundation upon which environmental factors interacted or were modified. For instance, individuals with a genetic predisposition for intelligence might reach their full potential only when exposed to an enriching educational environment. Similarly, genetic indicators for mental health issues could be amplified by adverse environments, while positive environments might mitigate such risks. Conclusion: The MISTRA study offers valuable insights into the nature vs. nurture debate, highlighting the intricate interplay between genetics and environmental factors. It emphasizes that while genetics provide a foundation, how these traits are expressed and developed relies heavily on an individual's environmental experiences. Consequently, both nature and nurture significantly contribute to human development and behavior, showcasing the need to consider the complex interaction of genetic inheritance and life experiences."},{"instruction":"Research Alfred Adler’s theory about personality development and discuss the effects that birth order (oldest, youngest, middle, only child, etc.) can have on personality. Briefly describe your birth order and explain whether you agree with the theory. Provide reasons and examples from your own experiences to support your argument. (Write through the perspective of the youngest, who is also a twin)","output":"Alfred Adler, an Austrian psychologist and a contemporary of Sigmund Freud, proposed a theory of personality development that emphasized the influence of birth order on an individual's personality. According to Adler, the specific position a person occupies within their family influences their unique characteristics and traits. In this section, I will delve into Adler's theory and explore its application to birth order, specifically focusing on the perspective of being the youngest sibling and a twin. Adler's theory suggests that the birth order of an individual significantly impacts their personality development due to the differing experiences, expectations, and treatment they receive within their family. According to Adler, birth order molds the way individuals perceive themselves, their relationships with others, and their overall approach towards life. As the youngest child and a twin, my birth order aligns with a position characterized by various assumptions and observations made by Adler. Firstly, Adler claimed that the youngest child tends to be indulged and often protected by older siblings and parents. This favoritism and attention can lead to a sense of entitlement and dependency on others. Moreover, youngest children are likely to develop strong social and communication skills due to their constant interactions with older siblings. In my own experience, I have found elements of Adler's theory to be accurate. Growing up as the youngest and being a twin meant that I received ample attention and care from my parents and older sibling. Given the nurturing environment, I became accustomed to receiving support and assistance from others, which may have contributed to my belief that help will always be readily available. Additionally, interacting with my twin sibling and older brother on a daily basis significantly influenced my social development. I honed my ability to communicate with them effectively, developed conflict resolution skills, and learned how to adapt to different personalities and viewpoints. However, it is crucial to recognize that personality development is a complex interplay of various factors, and birth order may not be the sole determinant. Factors such as genetics, parenting style, and individual experiences also contribute significantly to one's personality. While I partially agree with Adler's theory regarding birth order, I believe it is essential to approach it with caution and recognize individual differences. Not all youngest children will exhibit the same characteristics or conform to the generalizations made by Adler. Each family dynamic is unique, and the impact of birth order can vary depending on factors such as family size, cultural background, and parental involvement. In summary, Alfred Adler's theory emphasizes the influence of birth order on an individual's personality development. As the youngest sibling and a twin, I have observed certain elements of Adler's theory within my own experiences. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that personality development is a complex process influenced by multiple factors. Birth order alone does not determine an individual's personality, but it does play a role in shaping certain aspects of their character."},{"instruction":"«Индивидуальная приверженность к групповым усилиям — вот что заставляет работать команду, компанию, общество, цивилизацию».

Перед тем как окунуться в мудрость, готовы ли вы узнать секрет, как сделать команду непобедимой, и какие невидимые нити скрепляют общество и цивилизацию в единое целое? Интригует, не правда ли? И кроме того, представляете, какой трюк усиления собственных талантов мы откроем вам в конце статьи! И да, не забудьте заглянуть в это утро в 7 по ту сторону экрана, ведь ваша порция мотивации уже вас ждет! Начнем с того, что в мире не так уж и много вещей, которые можно сделать в полном одиночестве. Посмотрим правде в глаза – даже Робинзон Крузо нашел себе друга. Так почему же командные усилия так важны? Винс Ломбарди, легендарный тренер американского футбола, которому под силу было превращать обычных молодых людей в звезд с первой буквы слова \\"спорт\\", объяснил это лаконично: «Индивидуальная приверженность к групповым усилиям — вот что заставляет работать команду, компанию, общество, цивилизацию». Мудрые слова, согласитесь? Но как их понять простым языком и еще с юмором? Давайте попробуем. Если вас когда-либо заносило на семейные обеды, где каждый должен был принести что-то на стол, вы уже на практике знаете, о чем говорит Ломбарди. Представьте, что тетя Маша привела свою знаменитую запеканку, дядя Вася — бутылку вина, а вы — чувство юмора (потому что готовить вы, по большому счету, не умеете). Вот и вы – команда, чья индивидуальная приверженность создает великолепное собрание. То же самое происходит в компаниях, когда программисты, маркетологи, менеджеры и дизайнеры сливают свой талант в единое целое. Или давайте представим футбольную команду: что, если бы каждый игрок решил играть только для себя? У нас были бы одни вратари, блокирующие мячи, но никогда не забивающие голы. Переходя от спорта к более глобальным примерам, представим себе цивилизацию. Строители, ученые, учителя, медики – все они вносят свой вклад в общее благо. Без этих умений и навыков наш мир бы выглядел совсем по-другому, возможно, мы до сих пор жили бы в пещерах, качая клубы и удивляясь огню. Но давайте вспомним, как же это оказывается в нашей повседневной жизни? Когда последний раз вам приходилось работать в команде, вспомните ваши чувства и мысли. Было ли вам легко отдать часть контроля другим? Или вы терзали большую рыбу душераздирающими сомнениями, выбирая между \\"своим путем\\" и \\"совместным курсом\\"? Вот тут-то и кроется ключ к счастью! Готовы увидеть его? Ладно, пока что подержу в тайне. Мы все часть чего-то большего – а команды, это наши маленькие микрокосмы. Это и есть то место, где \\"я\\" превращается в \\"мы\\" и где наши индивидуальные успехи становятся нашими общими победами. И не смотрите так скептически на экран, ведь даже самые ярые интроверты и \\"одиночки\\" иногда делают что-то для других. Даже если это просто не забыть купить молоко по дороге домой. Итак, переходим к сладкому – как же принести эту индивидуальную приверженность в повседневные групповые усилия? Что нужно делать каждый день, чтобы быть этой запеканкой на семейном обеде, этим голом в важной футбольной игре, этой маленькой, но важной деталью в большой машине общества? Во-первых, нужно развивать умение слушать и слышать. Нет, не просто кивать и делать вид, что вы внимаете, пока на самом деле выбираете новый фильтр для Instagram. Слушать – значит запоминать, анализировать и вносить свой вклад. Во-вторых, стоит работать над терпимостью и гибкостью. Совместная работа - это часто компромисс, и нужно учиться уступать, не взорвавшись первым, как злой попкорн в микроволновке. Также обязательно развивайте чувство ответственности: быть частью команды – это значит брать на себя ответственность, как за успехи, так и за неудачи. И да, иногда это означает признавать, что ваша чудная идея о \\"гигантском плюшевом медведе в качестве маскота компании\\" не была так уж здравой. И, наконец, слова мотивации: верьте в себя, но и в свою команду. Вы все в одной лодке, будь то офисный кубикул или галактический корабль. Как только вы поймете, что вашу собственную часть головоломки нельзя заменить, начнется магия. Магия командной работы. Не забывайте, что на нашем канале \\"Мир мужчин и женщин\\" каждый день в 7 утра по московскому времени вы найдете свою порцию мотивации и идей, чтобы каждый ваш день был наполнен уверенностью и радостью. Поделитесь идеями в комментариях (мы любим читать ваши мысли!), поставьте лайк, если эта статья помогла вам увидеть командную работу в новом свете, и не забудьте подписаться, чтобы ни одна мудрость не прошла мимо вашего внимания. И помните, настоящая магия происходит тогда, когда вы не просто есть в команде, но и работаете на ее благо. И да пребудет с вами синергия! 🚀🌟💪"},{"instruction":"Da-mi un exemplu de folosire a clasei Accord.clustering.kmeans cu coordonate gps","output":"Iată un exemplu simplu de folosire a clasei Accord.clustering.kmeans pentru gruparea unui set de coordonate GPS: \`\`\`csharp using System; using Accord.Math; using Accord.Clustering; class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { // Exemplu de set de coordonate GPS double[][] coordinates = { new double[] { 45.6560, 25.6012 }, new double[] { 45.6584, 25.5872 }, new double[] { 45.6537, 25.5760 }, new double[] { 45.6549, 25.5971 }, new double[] { 45.6558, 25.5860 }, new double[] { 45.6544, 25.5907 }, new double[] { 45.6538, 25.5849 }, new double[] { 45.6549, 25.5887 }, new double[] { 45.6576, 25.5763 }, new double[] { 45.6553, 25.5804 }, }; // Setarea parametrilor algoritmului K-means KMeans kmeans = new KMeans(k: 2); // Antrenarea algoritmului cu setul de coordonate GPS KMeansClusterCollection clusters = kmeans.Learn(coordinates); // Afișarea rezultatelor for (int i = 0; i < clusters.Count; i++) { Console.WriteLine(\\"Cluster {i + 1}:\\"); foreach (int index in clusters[i]) { Console.WriteLine(\\"- {coordinates[index][0]}, {coordinates[index][1]}\\"); } Console.WriteLine(); } } } \`\`\` Această implementare utilizează biblioteca Accord.NET pentru a grupa un set de coordonate GPS în două clustere utilizând algoritmul K-means.

Название происходит от греческого слова \\"гелиос\\", что обозначает \\"солнце\\", и латинского \\"arch\\", что означает \\"начало\\" или \\"власть\\", поскольку Гелиарх стал отправной точкой для первых исследований этих систем. Скрытые системы представляют собой уникальные кластеры космических объектов, которые из-за своей уникальной природы не наблюдаемы в обычном пространственном измерении и доступны для исследований только через использование подпространственных технологий перехода. Атмосфера и климат Гелиарх имеет отличительную плотную голубую атмосферу, состоящую в основном из молекулярного азота (N2) и метана (CH4), с примесью водорода (H2) и инертных газов. Концентрация метана в атмосфере придает ей характерный голубой оттенок. Такой состав способствует созданию тепличного эффекта, удерживая внутреннее тепло планеты и смягчая иначе суровые условия. Поверхность и геология Разнообразная поверхность Гелиарха характеризуется ледяными ландшафтами и заснеженными полярными шапками, что обусловлено его удаленностью от звезды Авелис. В рельефе преобладают обширные равнины, пересеченные горными цепями и ледниками, а также кратеры различного размера, свидетельствующие об активном космическом воздействии. Орбитальные характеристики У Гелиарха есть три крупных луны: 1. Рафта – астероидная луна с иррегулярной формой, состоящая из углеродных соединений и ледяных фрагментов. 2. Мультума – геологически активная луна с вулканическими процессами, приводящими к формированию новых поверхностных структур. 3. Альпия – ледяная луна с обширными криовулканами, выбрасывающими водяной пар и аммиак в космос. Гелиарх демонстрирует вращение вокруг своей оси продолжительностью 125 Земных часов, что вызывает удлиненные циклы смены дня и ночи. Физические характеристики С радиусом в 3351.6 километра и поверхностной гравитацией 4.97 м/с^2, Гелиарх меньше Земли, однако обеспечивает достаточную гравитацию для удержания своей плотной атмосферы и для потенциального колонизационного интереса. Возможности колонизации и исследования Из-за уникальной среды и условий, Гелиарх представляет интерес для научных исследований и возможностей колонизации в будущем.

You will have to define a new class inheriting from \`torch.nn.Module\` and implement the logic based on the selected layers' types and sizes. Below is a basic example of such a class. This example assumes that each layer type will be used sequentially, which might not be the best architecture for a language model but serves as a starting point to illustrate how you could set it up. \`\`\`python import torch import torch.nn as nn class CustomLanguageModel(nn.Module): def __init__(self, layers_configuration, vocab_size, embedding_dim): super(CustomLanguageModel, self).__init__() # Embedding layer self.embedding = nn.Embedding(num_embeddings=vocab_size, embedding_dim=embedding_dim) # Layer setup based on provided configuration self.layers = nn.ModuleList() for layer_type, layer_size in layers_configuration: if layer_type == 'LSTM': self.layers.append(nn.LSTM(input_size=embedding_dim, hidden_size=layer_size, batch_first=True)) embedding_dim = layer_size # The input dimension of the next layer is the output dimension of this layer elif layer_type == 'GRU': self.layers.append(nn.GRU(input_size=embedding_dim, hidden_size=layer_size, batch_first=True)) embedding_dim = layer_size elif layer_type == 'Transformer': # Assuming TransformerEncoderLayer is used in a simple manner here transformer_layer = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer( d_model=embedding_dim, nhead=8, dim_feedforward=layer_size ) self.layers.append(nn.TransformerEncoder(transformer_layer, num_layers=1)) # For a transformer, the input and output dimensions are the same # Final classifier layer self.fc = nn.Linear(embedding_dim, vocab_size) def forward(self, x, attention_mask=None): x = self.embedding(x) for layer in self.layers: if isinstance(layer, nn.LSTM) or isinstance(layer, nn.GRU): x, _ = layer(x) elif isinstance(layer, nn.TransformerEncoder): x_mask = attention_mask == 0 # Mask out padding tokens x = layer(x, src_key_padding_mask=x_mask) logits = self.fc(x) return logits # Example: Suppose you have the following configuration layers_configuration = [('LSTM', 256), ('GRU', 128), ('Transformer', 512)] vocab_size = 10000 # A dummy vocabulary size embedding_dim = 128 # A dummy embedding dimension model = CustomLanguageModel(layers_configuration, vocab_size, embedding_dim) # Model will take input with the following dimensions: # [batch_size, sequence_length] where sequence_length equals max_length from earlier in your program # Example input: input_ids = torch.randint(low=0, high=vocab_size, size=(4, 50)) # A batch of 4 sentences with 50 tokens each attention_mask = torch.ones_like(input_ids) # Placeholder attention mask output = model(input_ids, attention_mask) print(output.shape) # Should be [4, 50, vocab_size] which are logits for each token in the vocabulary \`\`\` Please be aware that this example is simplistic and not optimized for actual usage. In practice, creating an effective language model involves careful design and consideration of various architectural decisions, pre-processing steps, and training strategies. You would also typically involve embedding layers, dropouts, and proper handling of sequential data which may require packing and unpacking of sequences. Additionally, the use of \`nn.TransformerEncoderLayer\` here is very basic and for a more effective Transformer model, you would need to consider aspects such as positional encodings and more sophisticated handling of attention masks. But this should give you a starting point for defining your model architecture based on the selected layer configurations."},{"instruction":"Write please a short announcement on an animal artist's exhibition.

Plants hang from the ceiling in macramé holders, and the smell of herbal teas and freshly baked goods fills the air.

She is young, full of life, and clearly not fitting into the teashop's calm ambiance in her vibrant summer clothes and strappy sandals. She eyes the place with a mixture of curiosity and disdain. JEANNINE: (to herself) This is where Dave hides out, huh? She spots DAVID and smirks. DAVID turns, recognition flashing to barely concealed annoyance. DAVID: Jeannine... what are you doing here? JEANNINE: Just wanted to see where the city's most boring cousin works. Nice. Very... quaint. Their banter is clipped, and it's obvious they share little warmth. As they awkwardly interact, STELLA, the owner, emerges from behind a row of teas. She's an effortlessly charming woman in her late forties, with a long, flowing skirt and a garland of flowers in her hair. STELLA: (warmly) Hello, welcome to Stardust Teas! I'm Stella. You must be...? JEANNINE: (slightly taken aback by Stella's warmth) Uh, Jeannine. Dave's cousin. STELLA (offering a handshake with a smile) A pleasure, Jeannine! Dave has told us so much about you. JEANNINE (smiling back) All bad, I hope. STELLA chuckles and then, with a twinkle in her eye, turns to DAVID. STELLA: (to David) Why don't you take a quick break, dear? I'll handle the counter. DAVID seems uneasy but nods. As he steps back, STELLA's demeanor changes subtly—she's now laser-focused on DAVID. She moves closer and speaks in a soothing tone, repeating phrases that they've clearly gone over before, though DAVID is unaware of it. STELLA: (softly, to David) Just relax, David. Let the sound of my voice and the scent of chamomile and lavender calm you. You trust Stella, don't you? DAVID's posture slackens, his eyes growing distant. JEANNINE watches, mouth agape. JEANNINE: (incredulous) Are you freaking kidding me? He's not actually falling for this... voodoo? STELLA: (smiling at Jeannine, without breaking rhythm with David) It's not voodoo, dear. It's just a heightened state of relaxation and suggestion. Watch. STELLA gestures subtly, snapping her fingers lightly, and DAVID's face goes empty, compliant. JEANNINE's eyes widen with a mixture of shock and mischievous wonder. JEANNINE: You've gotta make him do something stupid. STELLA: (gentle reprimand) We don't abuse trust here, Jeannine... But, since it's just a harmless demonstration... STELLA pauses for a moment, contemplating, and then leans into DAVID’s ear. STELLA: (to David, authoritative yet soft) David, when I snap my fingers again, you will believe you are completely and utterly mindless. You will kneel before Jeannine and gaze at her sandals as if they are the most fascinating thing you have ever seen. Stella snaps her fingers, and DAVID, with blank compliance, moves slowly to kneel before JEANNINE, eyes fixated on her feet. JEANNINE erupts into gleeful laughter, clapping her hands. JEANNINE: Oh my god, Dave, you should see yourself—this is priceless! STELLA watches, her expression an enigmatic blend of humor and understanding. She knows the power of her skill, and yet she handles it with care. STELLA: (half to herself) It's always the quiet ones...

JEANNINE: (teasing) Dave, you really like my sandals, huh? I knew you had a weird taste, but this is something else. DAVID remains impassive, his attention unwavering from JEANNINE's feet. He seems to be in a trance, oblivious to her words, disconnected from the world around him other than the object of his fixed stare.

Why am I...? He catches sight of the smirk on JEANNINE's face and the camera in her hand, and his expression turns to one of suspicion and a touch of embarrassment. STELLA: (cheerfully) You were admiring Jeannine's fashion choices, David. Now, how about you get back to work? And Jeannine, tea's on the house. Make yourself comfortable. JEANNINE smirks again but seems a bit more subdued now. DAVID, still trying to shake off the effects of his trance, rises to his feet and shuffles back to his tasks.

While advocating for unlimited access disregards the potential negative implications of such technology, prohibiting access completely undermines their potential benefits. It is through tempered, regulated, and reflective integration, guided by well-implemented policies and educational frameworks, that the potential of AI can be harnessed in a manner that aligns with the core principles of academic integrity and educational excellence.","output":"The statement provided offers a closing argument on the topic of access to AI systems in higher education settings. Let's break down the key points in more detail: 1. **Potential of AI in Higher Education**: AI systems offer a range of potential benefits for higher education. For example, they can provide personalized learning experiences, automate administrative tasks, facilitate research, and offer new insights through data analysis. They may also assist in creating more inclusive learning environments by providing accommodations for students with varying needs. 2. **Challenges and Negative Implications**: Alongside the potential benefits, there are also significant challenges. These might include issues relating to privacy, as AI systems often require access to personal data. There’s also the risk of bias in AI decision-making, which can perpetuate existing inequalities. Furthermore, an over-reliance on AI can potentially undermine critical thinking and learning if students and educators use these tools to shortcut the educational process (for instance, using AI to write essays or solve complex problems without understanding the underlying concepts). 3. **Unlimited Access vs. Complete Prohibition**: The statement positions unlimited access and complete prohibition at opposite ends of a spectrum of policy options. Unlimited access might lead to misuse or over-reliance, whereas complete prohibition would prevent the realization of the benefits that AI can offer. Both extremes are considered counterproductive: - **Unlimited Access**: While this might seem like the best way to maximize benefits, it ignores the risks and ethical considerations of AI deployment in education. - **Complete Prohibition**: This approach could hold back the potential for positive change and innovation in education that AI can facilitate. It is a caution against letting fear prevent progress and adoption of useful technology. 4. **Tempered, Regulated, and Reflective Integration**: A considered approach to integrating AI involves balancing the potential against the risks. This means implementing AI technologies thoughtfully, with regulations that address concerns like data privacy, ethical use, and maintaining academic integrity. 5. **Well-Implemented Policies and Educational Frameworks**: These are necessary to manage AI integration. Effective policies will address not only how AI systems should be used, but also how to handle challenges they may bring. Educational frameworks should be adapted to guide students and educators in using AI responsibly, ensuring these tools enhance rather than detract from the learning experience. 6. **Aligning with Core Principles**: The final objective is to ensure that the use of AI within higher education aligns with the fundamental principles that guide these institutions. These principles include academic integrity—ensuring that work reflects genuine understanding and individual effort—and educational excellence, which involves maintaining high standards of teaching, learning, and scholarship. In summary, the statement calls for a balanced approach to adopting AI in higher education. It suggests that while AI has the potential to significantly enhance the educational landscape, its integration must be handled with care and foresight to ensure it contributes positively to the academic mission and doesn't compromise core values or ethical standards."},{"instruction":"Привет, можешь рассказать про Майоран садовый?
