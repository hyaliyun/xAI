I like to think it was in the heart of Florida, because it was, and is, in my heart. Its name was Dogland. Some people say you can know others if you know the central incidents that shaped their lives. But an incident is an island in time, and to know the effect of the island on those who land there, you must know something about the river they have traveled. And I must warn you before we begin, I don't know that river well. I visit that time and place like a ghost with poor vision and little memory. I look up the river and see fog rolling in. I look down the river, and the brightness of the approaching day blinds me. I see shapes moving behind me and beyond me, but who they are and what they do, I cannot say. I will tell what I know is true, and I will invent what I believe is true, and that, I think, is all you can ask any storyteller to do. I learned the Nix family history from the stories Pa told. Even at the age of four, I suspected that Pa's stories might not be perfectly true. When Pa said we Nixes came to North America as indentured servants working our way out of debtor's prison, Grandma Bette would make a face and say he couldn't know that. When he said we Nixes had Lakota and Ojibwe blood in our veins, Grandma Bette would say she wasn't prejudiced, but it simply wasn't so: she and Pa and his brothers and sisters were dark because her people were Black Dutch, from a part of Holland where everyone had black hair and black eyes. And then Grandma Bette wouldn't say a word for half an hour or more, a very long time for Grandma Bette to be quiet.

To help clarify, here are the items from your choices that emit electromagnetic radiation, along with explanations: 1. Light Bulb - A light bulb emits electromagnetic radiation in the form of visible light and heat when switched on. 2. Vehicles - Parts of a vehicle's electrical system emit electromagnetic radiation, such as radio units and in-car infotainment systems. 3. Satellites - Satellites emit electromagnetic radiation, primarily in the form of radio waves, to communicate with receivers on Earth. Satellites also use solar panels that absorb electromagnetic radiation from sunlight and convert it into electrical power. 4. Buses - Like vehicles, buses also come with electrical systems that emit electromagnetic radiation, including radio units, GPS devices, and infotainment systems. 5. Engines - Engine ignition systems emit electromagnetic radiation in the form of radio waves due to switching and sparking, although these emissions are generally minimal. Other items in the list, such as firecrackers, sensory neurons, and objects, do not emit significant electromagnetic radiation. Firecrackers primarily release chemical energy in the form of heat, light, and sound.

News article: The groups that have Hillary’s back Washington (CNN) - It's a daily war of words playing out on multiple battlefields from the cable news networks to social media - pro-Republican groups criticize Hillary Clinton. The fire is quickly returned by pro-Democratic groups that defend the former secretary of state, who's seriously considering a 2016 White House run. And the frequency of the skirmishes are increasing with \\"Hard Choices,\\" Clinton's much anticipated memoir of her years as America's top diplomat, hitting bookshelves next week. Hillary Clinton to take part in live CNN town hall The Republican National Committee and the pro-GOP opposition research shop America Rising have been at the forefront of the Clinton anti-Clinton assault, which mainly focuses on the September 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans. \\"Find out the TRUTH about @HillaryClinton,\\" tweeted America Rising, which in a pre-buttal is going up with an e-book titled \\"Failed Choices\\" that's a critique of Clinton's tenure at the State Department. What's behind stepped up GOP attacks on Clinton Correct the Record responded with a post headlined \\"Shame On America Rising for Willfully Misleading Americans On Secretary Clinton's Record.\\" Correct the Record was launched last year by American Bridge, the leading Democratic opposition research outfit. Correct the Record was created to defend the records of potential Democratic presidential candidates. In reality, that means protecting Clinton, who has said she'll decide by the end of this year on a presidential bid, and would instantly become the overwhelming frontrunner for the Democratic nomination if she runs. The group is run by some former top Clinton advisers, but says it doesn't coordinate in any way with the former secretary of state or her top aides. Correct the Record officials say they're not doing anything special for the release of the book and the ensuing coast to coast book tour by Clinton. \\"We're operating business as usual. We are continuing to do what we do every day, defending Secretary Clinton's strong record of accomplishments from baseless, right-wing attacks,\\" Adrienne Elrod, the group's chief spokeswoman, told CNN. Last weekend the group held media training sessions for surrogates going on television to discuss the book and Clinton's record. \\"It wasn't only for the book. The purpose of the media training was to make sure that our surrogates, people who are on TV, active on TV, are able to articulate her positions effectively. Especially her accomplishments as Secretary of State,\\" a Correct the Record official told CNN. The Democratic National Committee's also playing a role when it comes to defending Clinton. The DNC has a mandate to protect the Democratic brand, and Clinton was, and continues to be a major player in that brand. The DNC, of course, also plays a major role in defending President Barack Obama and his administration. And GOP attacks on Clinton that target her record at State are also attacks on the President. \\"With the recent Republican attacks on Hillary Clinton, you've seen them really focus on foreign policy, attacking the President's foreign policy,\\" said a Democratic Party official. \\"Hillary's book is about her work with the President during his first term. It's about the Obama administration's foreign policy accomplishments and what we've seen is Republicans trying to distort every aspect of the President's foreign policy accomplishments.\\" It was no surprise then that Clinton aides deferred to the DNC when it came to responding to the America Rising e-book. In another sign of stepped up cooperation, Democratic surrogates and communicators who publicly support both Obama and Clinton met at the White House recently with Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri and Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications Ben Rhodes to talk about a number of issues, including Benghazi and Clinton's upcoming book, according to a source familiar with the meeting. While the topic was not on the official meeting agenda, one surrogate asked about it and the President's aides made clear they want no daylight between Obama and Clinton on foreign policy issues as the book rolls out, the source added. The messaging, according to the source, is this: Obama's team of rivals became an unrivaled team. And Tommy Vietor, a communications veteran of the 2008 Obama campaign who served as National Security Council spokesman during the President's first term, has been brought on by the Clinton team to coordinate and assist in the response to the book. In addition to working with the White House, the Clinton camp has stepped up their messaging around the book's release to include a coordinated surrogate operation. Clinton's team, according to sources familiar with the book rollout, tapped Kiki McLean, a former Clinton senior adviser and veteran of five presidential campaigns, to lend a hand with the surrogate operation. This group includes a war room of former diplomats who stand ready to respond to criticism of Clinton's tenure at the State Department, according to the source. From book tour to bus tour Also upping their game as the book releases is Ready for Hillary, the pro-Clinton super PAC that concentrates on grassroots outreach. The group, which over past year has organized demonstrations in support of Clinton outside of many of her speaking events, says it will step up its presence on during the book tour. The most visible way is with what they call \\"The Hillary Bus.\\" \\"The Bus will travel from coast to coast, channeling the enthusiasm around a potential Hillary 2016 candidacy to activate supporters in the 2014 midterms, while further building a grassroots army of supporters who are encouraging her to run and ready to help her win,\\" the group said earlier this week. Ready for Hillary says that throughout the summer, their bus will also visit events other than the \\"Hard Choices\\" book tour, such as Democratic party gatherings, state fairs and community festivals. And that come the autumn, the bus will head to college campuses and states with key contests in this November's midterm elections. The group touts that their bus \\"is a mobile advertisement allowing our organization to reach new supporters in every corner of America as Hillary backers who see the Bus are prompted to sign up at readyforhillary.com. The Bus will also allow Ready for Hillary to dispatch volunteers and sign up new supporters at designated stops.\\" What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1.

Context: You mentioned hearing the lawnmower from \\"across the street,\\" which indicates that the source of the noise is not within your own property. This logically points toward the lawnmower being at a neighbor's house rather than in your shed or garage. 2. Function: Lawnmowers are specifically designed for cutting grass, and the sound produced by them typically signifies that they are actively in use. While it is technically possible for a lawnmower to be stored in a shed or garage, the fact that you can hear it in operation strongly suggests that it is currently being used to cut grass. In this case, the neighbor's house would be where this activity is taking place. 3. Specificity: Among the given options, \\"cutting grass\\" and \\"lawn\\" both accurately describe the activity the lawnmower is engaged in and the general location of the task. However, these answers are too generic to provide a precise location of where the lawnmower is.

Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. Question: What does Selina think will help repair redness and brown spots from skin? Options: - using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser - use just water to cleanse - use abrasive soap - not enough information Answer:","output":"- using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Paragraph: Licenses for hemp cultivation topped a half-million acres (200,000 hectares) last year, more than 450% above 2018 levels, so there’s intense interest in the rules the U.S. government is creating. Critical comments on the draft have poured in from hemp farmers, processors, retailers and state governments. Growers are concerned the government wants to use a heavy hand that could result in many crops failing required tests and being destroyed. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agency writing the rules, estimates 20% of hemp lots would fail under the proposed regulations. “Their business is to support farmers — and not punish farmers — and the rules as they’re written right now punish farmers,” said Dove Oldham, who last year grew an acre (0.40 hectares) of hemp on her family farm in Grants Pass. “There’s just a lot of confusion, and people are just looking for leadership.” The USDA did not respond to the criticism but has taken the unusual step of extending the public comment period by a month, until Jan. 29. The agency told The Associated Press it will analyze information from this year’s growing season before releasing its final rules, which would take effect in 2021. Agricultural officials in states that run pilot hemp cultivation programs under an earlier federal provision are weighing in with formal letters to the USDA. “There are 46 states where hemp is legal, and I’m going to say that every single state has raised concerns to us about something within the rule. They might be coming from different perspectives, but every state has raised concerns,” said Aline DeLucia, director of public policy for the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture. Most of the anxiety involves how the federal government plans to test for THC, the high-inducing compound found in marijuana and hemp, both cannabis plants. The federal government and most states consider plants with tiny amounts — 0.3% or less — to be hemp. Anything above that is marijuana and illegal under federal law. Yet another cannabis compound has fueled the explosion in hemp cultivation. Cannabidiol, or CBD, is marketed as a health and wellness aid and infused in everything from food and drinks to lotions, toothpaste and pet treats. Many have credited CBD with helping ease pain, increase sleep and reduce anxiety. But scientists caution not enough is known about its health effects, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year targeted nearly two dozen companies for making CBD health claims. Still, the CBD market is increasing at a triple-digit rate and could have 20 billion in sales by 2024, according to a recent study by BDS Analytics, a marketing analysis firm that tracks cannabis industry trends. About 80% of the 18,000 farmers licensed for hemp cultivation are in the CBD market, said Eric Steenstra, president of the advocacy group Vote Hemp. The remaining 20% grow hemp for its fiber, used in everything from fabric to construction materials, or its grain, which is added to health foods. But hemp is a notoriously fickle crop. Conditions such as sunlight, moisture and soil composition determine its ratio of THC to CBD. Choosing the right harvesting window is critical to ensuring it stays within acceptable THC levels. Under the draft USDA rules, farmers have no wiggle room. They must harvest within 15 days of testing their crop for THC, and the samples must be sent to a lab certified by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Samples must be from the top of the plant, where THC levels are highest, and the final measurement must include not just THC, but also THCA, a nonpsychoactive component. Crops that test above 0.3% for the two combined must be destroyed. Growers with crops above 0.5% would be considered in “negligent violation,” and those with repeated violations could be suspended from farming hemp. In addition, a pilot program for federal crop insurance that would be available to hemp growers in some states specifies that crops lost because of high THC levels won’t be covered. Those provisions are causing alarm among growers and states with pilot hemp programs allowed under the 2014 Farm Bill. Some states allow THC levels above 0.3%, and not all include THCA in that calculation. Many permit more harvesting time for growers after THC testing. Farmers are lobbying for a 1% THC limit and a 30-day harvest window to give them more flexibility while remaining well under THC levels that can get people high. The draft regulations don’t “seem to be informed by the reality of the crop,” said Jesse Richardson, who with his brother sells CBD-infused teas and capsules under the brand The Brothers Apothecary. “If no one can produce (federally) compliant hemp flower, then there will be no CBD oil on the market.” Growers are also worried about the proposed rule requiring that all THC testing be done in a DEA-certified lab because there are so few of them. Some states have only one, which would serve hundreds of growers in a short harvest window. Samantha Ford, a third-generation farmer in North Carolina, waited two weeks to get back THC results from a lab last fall and then spent 45 days harvesting her 1 acre (0.40 hectares) of hemp by hand. “The 15-day window — that’s not feasible, and that was on a small scale,” she said. “I can’t imagine farmers who have acres and acres and acres of it.” Concerns also have emerged about the workload the draft rules would place on states. Many do random sampling for THC levels, but the USDA would require five samples from every hemp lot — a burden for state agricultural departments, said DeLucia, of the national ag agencies group. If federal rules are too onerous and expensive, some states might drop their hemp programs. In those cases, farmers would have to apply for licenses with the USDA, and at this stage it’s unclear how U.S. officials would manage or pay for a nationwide licensing program, DeLucia said. Under the 2018 Farm Bill, the USDA must approve state plans for hemp programs. Louisiana, Ohio and New Jersey last month were the first to get the green light — but those plans might need to be reworked after final rules are written. “What we don’t want to see is states having to write their rules and then have to change the rules again and rewrite them” after 2021, said Steenstra, of Vote Hemp. Claim: High anxiety: Proposed US hemp rules worry industry . A:","output":"The given claim states that the proposed U.S. hemp rules are causing anxiety within the industry. The paragraph supports this claim as it describes the concerns that hemp farmers, processors, retailers, and state governments have raised about the draft rules. These concerns include the stringent THC testing requirements, fear of crop destruction, and the heavy-handed approach of the U.S. government towards hemp cultivation. Moreover, it highlights the fact that there is confusion regarding the rules, and people are looking for guidance. The USDA's extension of the public comment period and plans to analyze information from the current growing season before releasing the final rules indicate that the agency is taking the concerns seriously. The anxiety over draft rules also stems from variations in state regulations and the potential workload that would be placed on states, risking some to drop their hemp programs. In conclusion, the industry's anxiety is based on the potential negative impacts of the proposed rules, lack of guidance, and the disagreement between state and federal regulations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize the following: Good dental hygiene can kill the bacteria that might cause aspiration pneumonia. Use a soft-bristled brush to clean the outer and inner surfaces of the teeth. If you use dentures, remove them before brushing. If you’re assisting someone else, stand behind them and off to 1 side. Wear gloves. Peel back their lips with your fingers before brushing the teeth and gums thoroughly. A good mouthwash will kill bacteria in your mouth, even if you don't have teeth. Swish or gargle the mouthwash for 30 seconds before spitting it out in a sink or cup. If desired, add cleaning tablets to the water. When you remove the dentures in the morning, rinse them off with clean water and brush them before putting them in your mouth. Flossing helps remove bacteria between your teeth. Use about 18 inches (46 cm) of floss, and wind the ends around your forefinger and thumb. Slide the floss up between your teeth and down again. If you’re assisting someone else, make sure to wear gloves.  Don’t snap the floss between the teeth. Instead, slowly ease it up and down. If you’re helping another person, standing behind them may help you floss more easily. The dentist can clean your teeth to protect you against bacteria that can cause aspiration pneumonia.

Review: This was the first sequel I'd seen (apart from Return of Jafar) and I honestly thought before watching it that it would be close to the original. I was horribly disappointed. The storyline was, basically, the first script with a few extra characters and the situation turned around. Ariel and Eric have a daughter, Melody who isn't satisfied with life on land. She wants to become a mermaid. However, Ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her-and when Melody finds out she's upset and angry. And she then decides to run away, and she becomes a mermaid. So she's happy swimming around, and Ariel sets out to find her-as a mermaid. The story doesn't sound too bad written down, but the clichés and repeats of situations from the first movie are just too obvious. And adding the fact that Melody is, overall, extremely annoying, and the movie becomes almost unbearable. There's also a whole load of other new characters-Tip and Dash being two of them. They aren't too bad as characters in themselves-just try not to think of Timon or Pumbaa! The songs leave a lot to be desired too, they just don't have the same magical energy as the songs from the original did. The animation obviously didn't have a whole load of work put into it either-in parts it's jumpy, and not much imagination is used for the characters movements. Another piece of advice-try to forget about Ariel's original character while watching this movie. The beautiful, rebellious, curious teenager has 'all grown up' into a bland, boring wife and mother, and her trademark red hair is all tied up. This is much better viewed if you've never seen the original-you'll have nothing to compare it to. However, all in all, it could have been worse-it's not as bad as certain other sequels, such as Cinderella II. But it's not in the same league as the original. But it for your collection if nothing else but if Disney go on like this they'll lose all their older fans. What is the sentiment of this review?

Seattle is a charter city, with a mayor–council form of government. From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Emotional ad seen as answer to Paul racist newsletter flap Ron Paul as seen in the Revolution PAC video. The video features a black man… Following an uproar over decades-old racist newsletters published under Ron Paul's name, a newly released ad seems designed to address the perception that the GOP presidential hopeful is prejudiced. The video, released by Revolution PAC, features a black man whose sick, pregnant white wife was neglected at a Texas hospital during the early 1970s because of what he saw as prejudice â until \\"Ron Paul came to the rescue.\\" Paul worked as a doctor at the facility. In the ad â which never mentions the newsletter controversy â James Williams, of Matagorda County, Texas, recounts a harrowing experience at the hospital, where he said the biracial couple fell victim to racism. He says that his ailing wife was left unattended, and his repeated requests for help made to the head nurse were not only rebuffed, but prompted a call to police, because the nurse felt harassed. As Williams despaired, he said Paul emerged, and offered to care for his wife. Ten minutes later, Williams said, their child was delivered â a stillborn boy. Paul told him he'd take care of the bill, and Williams said he was never charged. \\"He was a doctor of medicine, and that's what he was doing, practicing medicine. And it didn't matter who and what and why,\\" Williams said. Paul helped, Williams said, because \\"he thinks of one human being just as much as another one. Heâs just an honest man. And thatâs something we need now in this day and time. \\" Veering into politics, Williams condemns attempts to \\"blot out\\" Paul because he is an honest politician. The ad ends with a call to donate money to get the video shown on television, but itâs clearly had no trouble attracting attention. Paul has repeatedly disavowed the content of the controversial newsletters, saying they were penned by ghostwriters and conceding he should have done a better job of keeping track of them. The screedsâ targets included blacks and homosexuals. \\"Dr. Paul has assumed responsibility, apologized for his lack of oversight and disavowed the offensive material,\\" his spokesman told Reuters recently. Despite the controversy, Paul has been faring well in recent days, with an NBC/Marist poll Friday showing Paul running two percentage points behind frontrunner Mitt Romney as Tuesday's Iowa caucuses loom. Jonathan Capehart argued in the Washington Post on Thursday that the new ad does not go far enough to address concerns raised by the newsletters. \\"Paul, a man who wants to be entrusted with the presidency, owes the American people a clear accounting of how hatred came to be scribbled regularly in publications bearing his name and how he had no knowledge of it. His dismissive disavowal of the matter is beyond inadequate. As is the ad from supporter,\\" Capehart wrote. MSNBC's First Read reported that part of the ad was played for Paul during an appearance on WHO radio in Iowa, and the congressman was moved. He said that while he was just doing his job that day in Texas, \\"I never had the knowledge [of] how grateful he was and to me that is magnificent,\\" MSNBC quoted Paul as saying","output":"A new advertisement by Revolution PAC aims to confront the perception that GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul is prejudiced, following controversial racist newsletters published under his name years ago.

Although the ad does not directly address the newsletter issues, it aims to highlight Paul's character and fairness.

Q:Information:  - The Ozarks, also referred to as the Ozark Mountains, Ozarks Mountain Country, and the Ozark Plateau, is a physiographic and geologic highland region of the central United States, primarily in Arkansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. The Ozarks cover a significant portion of southern Missouri, extending as far northeast as the southwestern suburbs of St. Louis. In Arkansas, a large portion is contained within the northwestern and northcentral region. Much smaller pieces of the Ozarks extend westward into northeastern Oklahoma and extreme southeastern Kansas.  - The tallgrass prairie is an ecosystem native to central North America. Natural and anthropogenic fire, as well as grazing by large mammals (primarily bison), were historically agents of periodic disturbance, which regulates tree encroachment, recycles nutrients to the soil, and catalyzes some seed dispersal and germination processes. Prior to widespread use of the steel plow, which enabled conversion to agricultural land use, tallgrass prairies expanded throughout the American Midwest and smaller portions of southern central Canada, from the transitional ecotones out of eastern North American forests, west to a climatic threshold based on precipitation and soils, to the southern reaches of the Flint Hills in Oklahoma, to a transition into forest in Manitoba.   - Richard Hanson ( born February 20 , 1940 ) served as secretary of state of Missouri in 1994 following the removal from office of his predecessor , Judith Moriarty . A Democrat from Cole County , Hanson served on an interim basis in 1994 from the time of Moriarty 's removal from office by the Missouri Supreme Court following her impeachment by the Missouri House of Representatives until Governor Mel Carnahan appointed Bekki Cook to serve until the following scheduled election for the office .  - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.  - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel.  - St. Louis is an independent city and major U.S. port in the State of Missouri, built along the western bank of the Mississippi River, on the border with Illinois. The city has an estimated 2015 population of 315,685, and is the cultural and economic center of the Greater St. Louis area (home to 2,916,447 people), making it the largest metropolitan area in Missouri and the 19th-largest in the United States.  - Judith K. Moriarty (born February 2, 1942) is an American politician from Missouri, first with the Democratic Party, switching to the Libertarian Party in 2005. She was the first woman to serve as Missouri Secretary of State.  - The Missouri Bootheel is the southeasternmost part of the state of Missouri, extending south of 36°30 north latitude, so called because its shape in relation to the rest of the state resembles the heel of a boot. Strictly speaking, it is composed of the counties of Dunklin, New Madrid, and Pemiscot. However, the term is locally used to refer to the entire southeastern lowlands of Missouri located within the Mississippi Embayment, which includes parts of Butler, Mississippi, Ripley, Scott, Stoddard and extreme southern portions of Cape Girardeau and Bollinger counties.

Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: OPTIONS: - negative - positive TEXT:Corean cinema can be quite surprising for an occidental audience, because of the multiplicity of the tones and genres you can find in the same movie. In a Coreen drama such as this \\"Secret Sunshine\\", you'll also find some comical parts, thriller scenes and romantic times. \\"There's not only tragedy in life, there's also tragic-comedy\\" says at one point of the movie the character interpreted by Song Kang-ho, summing up the mixture of the picture. But don't get me wrong, this heterogeneity of the genres the movie deals with, adds veracity to the experience this rich movie offers to its spectators. That doesn't mean that it lacks unity : on the contrary, it's rare to see such a dense and profound portrait of a woman in pain. Shin-ae, who's in quest for a quiet life with her son in the native town of her late husband, really gives, by all the different faces of suffering she's going through, unity to this movie. It's realistic part is erased by the psychological descriptions of all the phases the poor mother is going through. Denial, lost, anger, faith, pert of reality : the movie fallows all the steps the character crosses, and looks like a psychological catalog of all the suffering phases a woman can experience. The only thing is to accept what may look like a conceptual experience (the woman wears the mask of tragedy, the man represents the comical interludes) and to let the artifices of the movie touch you. I must say that some parts of the movie really did move me (especialy in the beginning), particularly those concerning the unability of Chang Joan to truly help the one he loves, but also that the accumulation of suffering emotionally tired me towards the end. Nevertheless, some cinematographic ideas are really breathtaking and surprising (the scene where a body is discovered in a large shot is for instance amazing). This kind of scenes makes \\"Secret Sunshine\\" the melo equivalent of \\"The Host\\" for horror movies or \\"Memories of murder\\" for thrillers. These movies are indeed surprising, most original, aesthetically incredible, and manage to give another dimension to the genres they deal with. The only thing that \\"Secret Sunshine\\" forgets, as \\"The host\\" forgot to be scary, is to make its audience cry : bad point for a melodrama, but good point for a good film.","output":"The correct sentiment for this text is: positive Step-by-step justification: 1. The text highlights the diverse tones and genres found within the movie, which adds veracity and enriches the experience for the audience. 2. The author appreciates the dense and profound portrayal of the protagonist, Shin-ae, and considers it a unifying element within the movie. 3. The psychological depth of the movie is praised in the text, as it effectively covers the various emotions and phases of suffering a person may experience. 4.

The identity of the donor has not been established, although a number of suggestions have been advanced over the last 200 years. Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from Lucca, who was active in Bruges. From this Dhanens theorises the piece was commissioned as a wedding gift for the couple. Documents show weavers in Wervik paid taxes to Catherine Rapondi and in September 1434, when Michele Burlamacchi was tax collector in that town, van Eyck received a stipend funded...","output":"The last name of the family whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine is Rapondi."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hypothesis: He was struggling to sit up because of a severe headache. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"The hypothesis that he was struggling to sit up because of a severe headache is not necessarily entailed by the premise. While the premise does describe the character as struggling to sit up, it doesn't provide any clear information about the cause of the struggle, which could be due to various reasons including illness, injury, disorientation, or physical limitations. In order to better understand whether the hypothesis you provided is entailed by the premise, let's take a closer look at the premise and examine possible alternative explanations. The premise states that the character managed to struggle up to a sitting position in the bed, which suggests that they had difficulty reaching this position. It also says that the character was trying to make out more of their surroundings, implying some level of uncertainty or confusion regarding their environment. The hypothesis you provided guesses that the struggle to sit up was due to a severe headache, but this information is not explicitly mentioned in the premise. It's important to consider alternative explanations for the character's struggle to sit up and to understand their surroundings. For instance: 1. The character could have been disoriented or confused due to being in an unfamiliar environment or waking up from a deep sleep, which might not involve a severe headache. 2. The character may have suffered from a physical injury that made sitting up painful or difficult, such as a back or neck injury, rather than a headache. 3. A medical condition, such as sleep paralysis or muscle weakness, could have caused the character to struggle to move while waking up, regardless of whether or not they were experiencing head pain. Although the hypothesis of a severe headache causing the character's difficulties is plausible, it is not directly entailed by the premise, as there is no explicit mention of a headache being the primary reason for their struggles.

Please answer the following question: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Tommy Lynn Sells, 49, was the first inmate to be injected with a dose of recently replenished stocks of the powerful sedative pentobarbital. US states are facing a shortage of execution drugs as a growing number of firms have refused to sell them. Sells' lawyers tried unsuccessfully to find out the names of the suppliers. Debate about the source of execution drugs has recently become contentious in several states as numerous drug makers have refused to sell their products if they are used in executions. Opposition is especially strong among European drug makers, where concern over capital punishment is fiercest. A lower court earlier stopped Sells' execution, ordering the Texas Department of Criminal Justice to reveal more information about the drug supplier, but its ruling was overturned on appeal. The convicted man's attorneys argued that they needed to know the name of the pharmacy supplying the pentobarbital in order to verify the drug's quality and protect him from unconstitutional pain and suffering. \\"Without transparency about lethal injections, particularly the source and purity of drugs to be used, it is impossible to ensure that executions are humane and constitutional,\\" lawyers Maurie Levin and Jonathan Ross said in a statement. But the Supreme Court agreed with Texas prison officials, who argued that information about the drug supplier must be kept secret to protect the pharmacy from threats of violence. The justices did not elaborate on the reasoning behind their ruling, which was issued about an hour before Sells' execution. Last month a pharmacy in the state of Oklahoma said that it would not supply pentobarbital to neighbouring Missouri for use in an execution. Sells was convicted of murder in 2000 for stabbing Kaylene Harris, 13, to death and slashing her 10-year-old friend, Krystal Surles, who survived and helped police find him. US media reports said Sells had confessed to as many as 70 killings across the US. He declined to give a statement prior to his execution. Sells was pronounced dead 13 minutes after being given the pentobarbital. His execution was the fifth lethal injection this year in Texas, the busiest state in the US for enforcing the death penalty. Nearly 1,400 men have been put to death since the US Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.","output":"US inmate executed in Texas amid debate over drug source, as states face a shortage of execution drugs and drug makers increasingly refuse to sell their products for use in executions."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Despite the concerns of regional U.S. allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia, and also a significant number of legislators in the U.S. Congress, it is clear that the Obama administration is pushing strongly for deal as part of its wider Middle Eastern strategy. Indeed, Kerry has now spent more time negotiating with counterpart Iranian officials than any other U.S. high-level engagement for perhaps three decades.Obama administration seeking Iran deal as part of wider Mideast strategy, says Andrew HammonDeal would reportedly see Iran's nuclear capacity capped for six months, opened up to inspectionSince re-election, Obama has achieved little policy success amid political gridlock - HammondForeign policy allows Obama potential for long-term success, he adds   Question:And, this shift is only likely to be reinforced if, as anticipated, the _ economic recovery continues to build up steam in 2014.

Q: You are presented with the quiz \\"What gives rise to offspring?\\"   But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"reproduction is the process by which living things give rise to offspring\\" and \\"physiologically, sex is for the purpose of reproduction\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question?  a). sex b). spring c). bird d). DNA e). ova f). production g). factories h). ovum A:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"What gives rise to offspring?\\" is a). sex.  This is because, as your teacher mentioned, reproduction is the process by which living things give rise to offspring. Furthermore, they added that physiologically, sex is for the purpose of reproduction. Based on these hints, we can infer that sex is the process that leads to the creation of offspring. Let's briefly analyze the other options as well: b). Spring: Spring is a season and not related to the creation of offspring. c). Bird: While birds do reproduce and give rise to offspring, the question is asking for the process that leads to offspring, not a specific organism. d). DNA: DNA carries genetic information but is not the process responsible for giving rise to offspring. e). Ova: Ova (plural for ovum) are female reproductive cells (eggs) that play a crucial role in reproduction, but the question is referring to the process rather than a specific cell type. f). Production: Production is a broad term and can relate to manufacturing, agriculture, and more, but in this context, it does not specifically refer to the process that gives rise to offspring. g). Factories: Factories are industrial buildings where products are manufactured or assembled, not the process that gives rise to offspring. h). Ovum: An ovum, or egg cell, is a female reproductive cell. While it is involved in the process of reproduction, it is not the best answer to the question, as we are looking for a process leading to the creation of offspring. In summary, based on the teacher's hints and the analysis of the given options, a). sex is the best answer to the question as it directly corresponds to the process of reproduction that gives rise to offspring in living beings."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer??","output":"To find the value of f in the equation 18 = -6*f - 12, follow these steps: Step 1: Add 12 to both sides of the equation. By doing this, you are trying to isolate the term with the variable f. Add 12 to both sides to determine the intermediate result: 18 + 12 = -6*f - 12 + 12 30 = -6*f Step 2: Solve for f by dividing both sides of the equation by -6. Now you only need to isolate f by dividing both sides of the equation by the constant that is multiplied with the variable (in this case, -6): 30 / -6 = (-6*f) / -6 So, we get: -5 = f Now, we have the value of f: f = -5 The solution to the equation 18 = -6*f - 12 for the variable f is -5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The winter wind hurried down Columbus Avenue and the hem of his coat flapped around his knees letting little pockets of cold waft up to invade the warmth his body had spent so much time preparing and storing around his torso. With a bitter squeeze of his hands, his knuckles now getting cold, Morzeny bowed his square shoulders to the wind and continued walking. At sixty-seven years old the New York winters bothered Morzeny more than he cared to admit. And, although no doctor would admit it to him, he was positive that the first faint hints of arthritis tweaking through his hands were made worse by the cold. At every cross street the setting sun flashed through to the avenue in shades of crisp pink and red. Morzeny didn't want to be working right now. But these outings were the price he paid for having a hybrid job, owning buildings and brokering as many of his own leases as possible. When he had first come to the city he had been told that he needed a job, not for income, his providers took care of that, but for his own sanity. Something to keep him going. He had asked for something in real estate and had never bothered to wonder what other paths he might have taken. He had always been able to focus to the point of blindness. It helped him in every aspect of his work. He arrived at the brownstone building housing the apartment he was to show tonight. His building was tucked into a short row of buildings that squatted over the street, their steps reaching towards the curb like stunted growths.

Question 1: Why is it that people call it DP in FB and WhatsApp instead of profile picture? Where did come from? Question 2: Can I use prime minister picture as my WhatsApp profile picture? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"To answer these questions, I will break down each question into smaller parts, find the required information, and ensure the answer is relevant and well-founded. Question 1: Why is it that people call it DP in FB and WhatsApp instead of profile picture? Where did it come from? Step 1: Understand the meaning of the abbreviation DP. DP stands for Display Picture, which is another term for a profile picture. Step 2: Research the origin and usage of DP. The term DP (Display Picture) became more popular in countries like India and Pakistan during the early days of social media platforms and instant messaging apps. It was commonly used on platforms like Orkut, Yahoo Messenger, BBM, etc. Step 3: Compare the usage of \\"DP\\" and \\"profile picture.\\" While \\"profile picture\\" is the more common term used by platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp, earlier platforms used the term \\"Display Picture\\" or simply \\"DP.\\" The term continues to be used by social media users in some regions as colloquial language. Answer to Question 1: People call it DP (Display Picture) in FB (Facebook) and WhatsApp because the term became popular in the early days of social media platforms and instant messaging apps, particularly in countries like India and Pakistan. The legacy of the term has since been carried forward to more current platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp in those regions. Question 2: Can I use the prime minister's picture as my WhatsApp profile picture? Step 1: Analyze the legality of using the prime minister's picture. There aren't any specific laws against using a prime minister's picture as a profile picture. However, depending on your country, laws around the depiction of public figures and the manner in which their images are used can vary. Step 2: Assess the platform's terms and conditions for profile pictures. WhatsApp's terms of service don't explicitly prohibit using a politician's image as a profile picture. But as a user, you should ensure that the image is not offensive or violating any copyright laws. Step 3: Evaluate potential consequences. Using the prime minister's picture as a profile picture, depending on the context, can lead to misunderstandings and confusion amongst your contacts. Consider the aim of such usage before uploading the image. Answer to Question 2: You can use the prime minister's picture as your WhatsApp profile picture as long as it doesn't violate any laws or platform regulations, such as being offensive or violating copyright laws. Be mindful of the potential implications and consequences, including misunderstandings and confusion. Would the answer to these two questions be the same? No, the answers to these two questions are not the same. While the first question deals with the origin of the term \\"DP\\" and its usage on social media platforms, the second question concerns the legality and implications of using a prime minister's picture as a profile picture on WhatsApp."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He cryptically promises his father he will \\"bring him home.\\" Rama joins a heavily armed 20-man elite police squad, including Officers Bowo and Dagu, Sergeant Jaka, and Lieutenant Wahyu, for a raid on a high-rise apartment block in Jakarta's slums. The team intends to capture crime lord Tama Riyadi, who, along with his two lieutenants Andi and Mad Dog, owns the block and lets criminals around the city rent rooms under his protection. Arriving undetected, the team sweeps the first floors and subdues various criminal tenants; they also temporarily detain an innocent, law-abiding tenant delivering medicine to his sick wife in apartment #726. Continuing undetected to the sixth floor, the team is spotted by a young lookout, who passes on the message to another adolescent lookout just before he is shot dead by Wahyu; but the latter youth raises the alarm. Tama calls down reinforcements and the SWAT team are brutally attacked. Thugs snipe two officers guarding the perimeter, eliminate two more in the SWAT van, and ambush several officers patrolling the first five floors. Cutting the lights, Tama announces over the PA system that the police are trapped on the sixth-floor stairwell, and he will grant free permanent residence to those who kill the intruders. In the darkness, the remaining team members are ambushed by shooters from above and behind, and the team is almost completely wiped out. Prior to the gunfight, Wahyu confesses to Jaka he has staged the mission so he can eliminate Tama, who is in league with many corrupt police officers, including himself. The mission is not officially sanctioned by the police command; nobody at HQ knows their location and thus there is no hope for reinforcements.

In his early years, his family moved to Sydenham, in the south-east of London, England. As an adult, Shackleton lived in various locations throughout his life, mainly in England and during his several Antarctic expeditions. After joining the merchant navy, Shackleton lived at sea for some time, traveling to various locations.

A one-year-old baby died in Upstate New York on Tuesday after it ingested liquid nicotine, the chemical used in the popular e-cigarettes. The baby died at its home in Fort Plains on Tuesday and when it was found unresponsive it was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead. ABC reports that police say the death was a 'tragic accident' and that no foul play was involved. Dangerous: Liquid nicotine that could have been  for an e-cigarette killed a one-year-old in Upstate New York who ingested the dangerous chemical. It's unclear as to whether or not the liquid was for an e-cigarette but officials expressed their concern about similar accidents happening to children of e-cigarette smokers in the future. 'One teaspoon of liquid nicotine could be lethal to a child, and smaller amounts can cause severe illness, often requiring trips to the emergency department,' the American Association of Poison Control centers in a statement yesterday. They also states that even though liquid nicotine is dangerous for children there are currently no child-proof packaging standards set in place. The American Association of Poison Control Centers made an announcement in November that the number of exposures to liquid nicotine is on the rise. By November 30 there had been 3,638 exposures to the dangerous chemical. That's more than double the 1,543 exposures reported in 2013. In 2011 just 271 exposures were counted. The child's death on Tuesday marks the first death related to the substance since 2012 when a man injected himself with the chemical. Dr.Donna Seger, director of the poison control center at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said that even the smallest amount of nicotine can be dangerous for children. 'They’re not that difficult to get into,' Seger said of the vials that contain the nicotine. 'The issue is once the exposure occurs, it could be bad.' ABC spoke with Phil Daman, president of the Smoke-Free Alternatives Trade Association who questioned whether or not the nicotine the child found was in fact the standard liquid used for e-cigarettes. Growing popularity: As the popularity of e-cigarettes increases so does the number of dangerous exposures to -liquid nicotine used in the cigarette. The liquids range in strength from low to high and the one consumed by the child could have been a higher dosage than normal. Daman also said he was, 'saddened to hear the terrible news.' '[We] want to always be mindful to put safe products on the market,' said Daman. He said companies should do their best to 'err on the side of caution.' Symptoms of nicotine exposure are vomiting, nausea, and eye irritation. Children may be more likely to consume the nicotine liquids that are flavored and made to look like candy. 'E-cigarette liquids as currently sold are a threat to small children because they are not required to be childproof, and they come in candy and fruit flavors that are appealing to children,' said U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Tom Frieden in April. As more and more children become exposed, legislators and companies are taking steps to ensure safety. The e-cigarette Vapor World, changed their packaging to make bottles child resistant. Governor Andrew Cuomo of is set to sign a bill in coming weeks that will require child-resistant caps on liquid nicotine bottles.","output":"A one-year-old baby in New York sadly passed away after accidentally swallowing liquid nicotine, which is a chemical used in e-cigarettes. The baby was found unresponsive and was taken to the hospital but couldn't be saved. This has raised concerns about the safety of using e-cigarettes around young children and the need for child-proof packaging. Liquid nicotine is very dangerous for children, even in small amounts. The baby's death has reminded people to be extra careful when using e-cigarettes and to keep the liquid nicotine safely away from children."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Michael \\"Mick\\" McGeough (pronounced \\"mik-GOOH\\"; born June 20, 1957) is a retired National Hockey League referee, who wore uniform number 19 (now worn by Gord Dwyer) from the 199495 NHL season until his retirement. His NHL career began in 1987. McGeough was one of the last NHL officials to officiate NHL games without wearing a helmet when he was on the ice. In the 200607 NHL season, McGeough was forced by the NHL to wear a helmet on ice, as it was the first season that dictated that all on-ice officials had to do so. He now is helping the NHL bring up new recruits from the AHL. Entering the 200708 NHL season, McGeough had officiated 1,023 regular season and 63 post season games.  - James McGeough ( born April 13 , 1963 in Regina , Saskatchewan ) is a retired Canadian ice hockey player . He is the brother of former NHL referee Mick McGeough . Drafted in 1981 by the Washington Capitals , McGeough also played for the Pittsburgh Penguins .  - The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional ice hockey league currently composed of 31 member clubs. Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season.  - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team.  - Regina (is the capital city of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The city is the second-largest in the province, after Saskatoon, and a cultural and commercial centre for southern Saskatchewan. It is governed by Regina City Council. The city is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Sherwood No. 159.  - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Lowest brightness with increased exposure Please fix the punctuation.","output":"When attempting to capture an image or a video with the optimal quality, it is crucial to understand the dynamics of visibility and exposure. This can be achieved by using the lowest brightness setting while increasing the exposure. To begin with, the brightness setting on your device affects the visibility of the captured image or video. A lower brightness will yield a darker image, whereas a higher brightness results in more vivid colors and more light. However, higher brightness can also lead to washed-out colors and loss of detail due to overexposure. On the other hand, exposure is the duration of time the camera's sensor is exposed to light, as well as the amount of light gathered in that time period. Increasing the exposure will allow more light to reach the sensor, which can be beneficial when capturing images in dimly lit environments or situations where the subject is poorly lit. Proper exposure is crucial for obtaining an image with well-balanced colors and good contrast between the light and dark areas of the scene. In some situations, it might be advantageous to lower the brightness and increase the exposure to obtain the best results. For example, when capturing a scene with high contrast, such as a sunset or a brightly lit stage on a dark night, using a combination of low brightness and increased exposure will allow you to achieve a balance between the brightest and darkest areas of the scene. This results in a more detailed and visually pleasing image, as the shadows and highlights retain their respective details, and the colors appear more true-to-life—neither too dark nor blown out. To achieve the perfect balance of brightness and exposure, you can follow these steps: 1. Access the camera settings on your device. Most smartphones and cameras have manual controls that allow you to tweak various settings, including brightness and exposure. 2. Lower the brightness setting on your device. This will help to prevent overexposed or washed-out images due to excessive lighting. 3. Increase the exposure time. Find the optimal exposure setting that will allow you to capture the scene with the right balance of light and shadows. Keep in mind that increasing the exposure time might result in motion blur if your subject is moving or if the camera is not steady. Using a tripod or a stable surface is recommended in such cases. 4. Adjust the ISO sensitivity if needed. Along with brightness and exposure settings, you may also need to experiment with the ISO sensitivity of your device to adjust the decision-making process of your device's sensor while taking in more or less light. 5. Take a test shot and assess the results. You may need to make a series of minor adjustments until you achieve your desired image quality. Be patient and experiment with different settings to see which combination works best for the particular scene you are capturing. In conclusion, the combination of the lowest brightness setting along with increased exposure can help you capture images and videos with a more balanced and detailed appearance. Carefully adjusting these settings will enable you to take advantage of all the nuances in the scene and produce an image that reflects the desired level of detail, contrast, and vibrancy."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Given the following context:  The seabed contains enormous reserves of minerals which can be exploited by dredging. This has advantages over land-based mining in that equipment can be built at specialised shipyards and infrastructure costs are lower. Disadvantages include problems caused by waves and tides, the tendency for excavations to silt up and the washing away of spoil heaps. There is a risk of coastal erosion and environmental damage. Seafloor massive sulphide deposits are potential sources of silver, gold, copper, lead and zinc and trace metals since their discovery in the 1960s. They form when geothermally heated water is emitted from deep sea hydrothermal vents known as \\"black smokers\\". The ores are of high quality but prohibitively costly to extract. Small scale mining of the deep sea floor is being developed off the coast of Papua New Guinea using robotic techniques, but the obstacles are formidable.There are large deposits of petroleum, as oil and natural gas, in rocks beneath the seabed. Offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. Offshore oil and gas production can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits, probably causing the beaching of whales. Toxic substances such as mercury, lead and arsenic may be released. The infrastructure may cause damage, and oil may be spilt.Large quantities of methane clathrate exist on the seabed and in ocean sediment at a temperature of around 2 °C (36 °F) and these are of interest as a potential energy source.

Write an article based on this summary: – After years of intrigue, researchers are celebrating \\"a major step forward\\" for the male birth control pill. A month-long clinical trial shows a once-daily male pill is safe and effective at suppressing the hormones needed for sperm production, and has no negative effect on sex drive, according to researchers who presented their findings Sunday at the Endocrine Society's annual conference in Chicago, per the Telegraph. The hormone pill, dimethandrolone undecanoate (DMAU), overcomes issues that plagued earlier versions of the male contraceptive. In addition to concerns about how low testosterone would affect sex drive, researchers feared the pill would need to be taken twice daily, given the speed that hormones clear the male body, reports the Guardian. DMAU, however, contains fatty acid undecanoate which is believed to slow the clearance. Some 100 men aged 18 to 50 received a placebo or varying doses (100mg, 200mg, or 400mg) of the pill, which contains an androgen and a progestin and must be taken with food. After 28 days, all pill-popping patients saw low testosterone levels, while patients given the 400mg dose saw a \\"marked suppression\\" in testosterone and two other hormones needed for sperm production, reports the Telegraph. Patients also saw mild weight gain and a slight drop in HDL or \\"good cholesterol\\" levels, per NBC News. But \\"very few subjects reported symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency or excess,\\" and liver and kidney function remained healthy, senior researcher Stephanie Page says in a release. \\"These promising results are unprecedented in the development of a prototype male pill.\\" Research will now focus on effects over longer periods. (Another male pill might leave hormones alone.)","output":"Once upon a time, in a science lab far away, some smart researchers wanted to help men share the responsibility of having babies. They thought, \\"Why should women be the only ones to take a pill?\\" So they worked very hard and discovered a new kind of pill that men can take to help them control when they want to have a baby. This magic pill is called DMAU. It's a really special pill because it doesn't have some of the problems that made the other pills not work well. The researchers wanted to make sure DMAU wouldn't make men feel less like themselves or have to take it many times a day, so they figured out how to make it last longer and not change their feelings. They shared their exciting discoveries in a big city called Chicago, where lots of other smart people were learning new things too. They told everyone how they had a group of 100 men try the pill and how it made their special baby-making hormones go on a little vacation. Some of the men gained a little bit of weight and had a tiny change in their blood that helps their hearts, but overall they felt just fine. The researchers even noticed that their bodies still worked well inside. Now, the scientists want to keep learning about this magic pill and how it can be a big helper for men and women who want to decide when to have a baby. They will keep testing the pill to make sure it works and is safe in the long run.

Their manager prostitutes the beautiful Gong-gil to rich customers, and Jang-saeng sickens of this practice. After Gonggil kills the manager in defense of Jang-saeng, the pair flees to Seoul, where they form a new group with three other street performers.Together the group comes up with a skit mocking some members of the Royal Court, including the king and his new concubine Jang Noksu. After they are arrested for treason, Jang-saeng makes a deal with Choseon, who turns out to be one of the King's servants, to either make the king laugh at their skit or to be executed. They perform their skit for the king, but the three minor performers are too terrified to perform well. Gong-gil and Jang-saeng barely save themselves with one last joke at the king, who laughs and then makes them part of his Court. The King falls for the effeminate Gong-gil, whom he calls to his private chambers often to perform finger puppet shows. Jang-saeng becomes jealous of this relationship. Meanwhile, the King becomes more and more unstable. He makes the clowns perform a skit depicting how his mother, the favorite concubine of the former king, was forced to take poison after being betrayed by other jealous concubines. The King then slaughters these concubines at the end of the play. Jangs-aeng asks Gong-gil to leave with him and the gang at once before the King kills them too during one of his homicidal fits.

Welcome to CNN Reset, a new feature revisiting news that's been unforgettable. Here's the latest on video and online. Oklahoma twister. Science calls it an EF5. The people of Moore, Oklahoma, know it as the most powerful category of tornadoes. The twister's destruction was merciless: it struck the Plaza Towers Elementary School, killing seven children there. In all, 24 people perished, including 10 children. The human response to the catastrophe has been powerful too. Locals call it the \\"Oklahoma standard\\" -- \\"persistence and a great positive attitude by the people to never give in,\\" as University of Oklahoma football coach Bob Stoops puts it. Cleveland captivity. It was a horror worthy of Stephen King's imagination: three young women allegedly held captive in a house for roughly 10 years beginning at ages 21, 16 and 14. They were allegedly abducted off the street in a Cleveland neighborhood by the homeowner, Ariel Castro, 52, who's now facing four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape. Alleged violence and threats made the captive women afraid to seek an escape. But one of the women -- the one who bore a child by Castro -- finally shouted for help after Castro left the house and forgot to lock a big inside door. Neighbors responded. The women and a 6-year-old girl were freed. Now tourists visit the neighborhood. And as the city seeks donations to support the women, it struggles with a dark legacy. Texas explosion. The explosion of a fertilizer plant shook the Earth like an earthquake. In fact, the blast in West, Texas, registered a 2.1 on the Richter scale, and people felt it 50 miles away. The first responders experienced a scene for which no training could ever prepare them: a mushroom-cloud fireball lay waste to 37 blocks, including a nursing home, the local high and middle school, and many houses. Fifteen people -- including 12 first responders -- were killed. Volunteer firefighter Robert Payne was blown out of his boots and knocked senseless. He woke up in intensive care wondering what happened. Now recovering from several injuries, he's thankful he's alive. As the town of 2,800 rebuilds, will it want the fertilizer plant back? The mayor doubts it. Boston Marathon bombings. Among those injured in the Boston Marathon bombings were two brothers. Paul and JP Norden have shared much in life. Now they are together in recovery: Each brother lost a right leg in the attack. As hard as the limb loss was for the brothers, equally difficult was not seeing other each for weeks as they underwent 12 surgeries in all. The siblings finally saw each other about two weeks ago for the first time since the marathon. They want the public to know their uncommon brotherhood is lifting them through an arduous recuperation. London slaying. The British soldier was well-liked by many. He was even a military recruiter and played the drum outside the Royal Palaces on behalf of his regiment, the Fusiliers. But the life of Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, came to a grisly end on a London street at the hands of a man with a meat cleaver and knife. What has shocked the world is how the alleged attacker -- Michael Adebolajo, 28, a British national of Nigerian descent -- made a video of the gory scene and spoke to the camera about the killing, saying it was \\"an eye for an eye\\" and \\"because Muslims are dying daily.\\" A total of five men have been arrested in the slaying. Now far-right activists are calling upon Muslims to leave the country. Capital calamities.

However, it's important to consider that if the steam production exceeds the turbine's capacity, it could cause potential damage or reduced efficiency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: This article: Up to c. 1210, continental Arthurian romance was expressed primarily through poetry; after this date the tales began to be told in prose. The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century. These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail, the Estoire de Merlin, the Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot, which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu, which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister Morgause and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chrétien's Lancelot, as Arthur's primary court. This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c. 1230–40), of which the Suite du Merlin is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu. During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon's Voeux du Paon in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art. contains an answer for the question: What are the two names for the Middle French prose work that made up half of the entire Lancelot-Grail Cycle?, what is it ? Answer:","output":"The two names for the Middle French prose work that made up half of the entire Lancelot-Grail Cycle are the Lancelot propre and the Prose Lancelot."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Answer choices: - motion  - clouds  - cold  - climate  - temperature  - orbit  - gravity  - wind Answer:","output":"A planet's seasons are primarily caused by two major factors, which are its orbit and axial tilt. To understand this more deeply, let's analyze the different answer choices and narrow down the options: 1. Motion: While a planet's motion plays a role in the development and the transition of its seasons, it is not the primary cause. Motion refers to the way a planet moves through space, but it's actually the orbit and axial tilt that create the variations in solar insolation, causing the formation of seasons. 2. Clouds: Clouds are an atmospheric component that helps regulate a planet's temperature. Although they can influence weather patterns and contribute to regional climates, they do not create seasons on a planetary scale. 3. Cold: Cold is a characteristic feature of certain seasons, typically winter, but it is not the cause of seasons. Cold temperatures are a result of the season itself, rather than the cause. 4. Climate: Climate pertains to long-term average weather conditions in a region. While regional climates are determined by several factors, including latitude, altitude, and proximity to large bodies of water, the seasonal cycle of the entire planet is not primarily driven by climate. 5. Temperature: Temperature is another factor that can characterize different seasons, but it is not the main cause of seasons. Instead, temperature changes are a result of the Earth's orbit and axial tilt. 6. Orbit: The orbit of a planet plays a critical role in the formation of seasons. As the planet orbits around its star, the distance between the planet and the star varies, resulting in varying levels of solar insolation. This variation, combined with the axial tilt of the planet, creates seasons. 7. Gravity: Gravity, while responsible for maintaining a planet's orbit and the tides, does not directly cause the formation of seasons. Its role is limited to keeping the planet on its orbital path. 8. Wind: Although wind can have a noteworthy impact on local and regional weather patterns, it does not cause the seasons on a planetary scale. In conclusion, the primary cause of a planet's seasons is a combination of its orbit and axial tilt. These two factors together determine the variations in solar insolation received at different parts of the planet over the course of its orbit, thus creating the seasons. While other options like motion, clouds, cold, climate, temperature, gravity, and wind can affect climate and weather patterns, they do not primarily cause the formation of a planet's seasons."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Lending activities can be performed either directly or indirectly through capital markets. Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are highly regulated in most countries. Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion of their current liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords.  - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.  - The peso (meaning \\"weight\\" in Spanish, or more loosely \\"pound\\") was a coin that originated in Spain and became of immense importance internationally. \\"Peso\\" is now the name of the monetary unit of several former Spanish colonies.  - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency.  - Mestizo (Peninsular Spanish: , Latin American Spanish, Philippine Spanish: ) is a term traditionally used in Spain and Spanish America to mean a person of combined European and Amerindian descent, or someone who would have been deemed a Castizo (one European parent and one Mestizo parent) regardless if the person was born in Latin America or elsewhere. The term was used as an ethnic/racial category in the casta system that was in use during the Spanish Empire's control of their New World colonies. Mestizos are usually considered to be mixed Spaniards by the crown of Spain.  - Money is any item or verifiable record that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts in a particular country or socio-economic context, or is easily converted to such a form. The main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value; and, sometimes, a standard of deferred payment. Any item or verifiable record that fulfills these functions can be considered as money.  - A medium of exchange is an intermediary used in trade to avoid the inconveniences of a pure barter system.  - A coin is a small, flat, round piece of metal or plastic used primarily as a medium of exchange or legal tender. They are standardized in weight, and produced in large quantities at a mint in order to facilitate trade.

Generally, one dollar is divided into one hundred cents.  - The foreign exchange market (forex, FX, or currency market) is a global decentralized market for the trading of currencies. This includes all aspects of buying, selling and exchanging currencies at current or determined prices. In terms of volume of trading, it is by far the largest market in the world, followed by the Credit market. The main participants in this market are the larger international banks. Financial centres around the world function as anchors of trading between a wide range of multiple types of buyers and sellers around the clock, with the exception of weekends. The foreign exchange market does not determine the relative values of different currencies, but sets the current market price of the value of one currency as demanded against another.  - A banknote (often known as a bill, paper money, or simply a note) is a type of negotiable instrument known as a promissory note, made by a bank, payable to the bearer on demand. Banknotes were originally issued by commercial banks, who were legally required to redeem the notes for legal tender (usually gold or silver coin) when presented to the chief cashier of the originating bank. These commercial banknotes only traded at face value in the market served by the issuing bank. Commercial banknotes have primarily been replaced by national banknotes issued by central banks.  - A currency (from , \\"in circulation\\", from ) in the most specific use of the word refers to money in any form when in actual use or circulation as a medium of exchange, especially circulating banknotes and coins. A more general definition is that a currency is a \\"system of money\\" (monetary units) in common use, especially in a nation. Under this definition, US dollars, British pounds, Australian dollars, and European euros are examples of currency. These various currencies are recognized stores of value and are traded between nations in foreign exchange markets, which determine the relative values of the different currencies. Currencies in this sense are defined by governments, and each type has limited boundaries of acceptance.  - Central America is the southernmost, isthmian portion of the North American continent, which connects with South America on the southeast.

Information:  - Pop rock is rock music with a lighter, smoother approach that is more reminiscent of commercial pop music. Originating in the 1950s as an alternative to rock and roll, early pop rock was influenced by the beat, arrangements, and style of rock and roll (and sometimes doo wop), but placed a greater emphasis on professional songwriting and recording craft. The detractors of pop rock often deride it as a slick, commercial product, less authentic than rock music.  - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan.  - \\"These Eyes\\" is a song by the Canadian rock band The Guess Who. The song was co-written by the group's lead guitarist Randy Bachman and lead singer Burton Cummings and originally included on the band's 1969 album \\"Wheatfield Soul\\". It was first released as a single (backed by \\"Lightfoot\\"), in their native Canada, where its chart success (#7), along with the influence of CKLW-AM Windsor's radio station music director Rosalie Trombley, helped land them a U.S. distribution deal with RCA Records. It was then released in the U.S. In March 1969, and became a breakthrough success for the group, as it would be their first single to reach the top ten on the \\"Billboard\\" Pop Singles chart, peaking at number six, and would eventually be certified gold by the RIAA for sales of over one million copies. While it was actually the 18th single released by the band, it was the first from the quartet of Cummings, Bachman, Jim Kale, and Garry Peterson as produced by Jack Richardson.  - BachmanTurner Overdrive is a Canadian rock group from Winnipeg, Manitoba, that had a series of hit albums and singles in the 1970s, selling over 7 million albums in that decade alone. Their 1970s catalogue included five Top 40 albums and six US Top 40 singles (ten in Canada). The band has sold nearly 30 million albums worldwide, and has fans affectionately known as \\"gearheads\\" (derived from the band's gear-shaped logo). Many of their songs, including \\"Let It Ride\\", \\"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\\", \\"Takin' Care of Business\\", \\"Hey You\\" and \\"Roll On Down the Highway\\", still receive play on classic-rock stations.  - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book.   - The Guess Who is a Canadian rock band, formed in Winnipeg in 1965. Initially gaining recognition in Canada, the group found international success from the late 1960s through the mid-1970s with many hit singles, including \\"No Time\\", \\"American Woman\\", \\"Laughing\\", \\"These Eyes\\", \\"Undun\\" and \\"Share the Land\\". The band has continued to perform and record to the present day; and at various times has included many well-known musicians, including Burton Cummings and Randy Bachman (of BachmanTurner Overdrive). Formed as a garage rock band, their musical style encompassed the pop rock and psychedelic rock genres.  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - Share the Land is the eighth studio album by Canadian rock band The Guess Who. After the departure of Randy Bachman, the band brought in two guitarists, Kurt Winter and Greg Leskiw.   - Power in the Music is the fourteenth and final studio album by the Canadian rock band The Guess Who to feature Burton Cummings on lead vocals and band leader . The album was released in remastered form by the Iconoclassic label including two bonus tracks . The track \`\` Rosanne '' ( # 55 in Canada ) was apparently written about the one time girlfriend of Burton 's very good friend Gary \`\` Big Daddy '' MacLean .  - Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. It may use novelty recording techniques, electronic instruments or effects, and sometimes draws on sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music.  - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices.  - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry.

The voices of Tunis and Tahrir Square, the uprising in Benghazi, the street protests in Yemen and Bahrain promised a popular awakening in countries where politics had been confined to an elite. The Western democracies -- if a little hesitantly -- took the side of the demonstrators. But with the exception of Libya, their contribution to the Arab world's new beginning comprised moral support and the promise of financial help once new governments were formed. The U.S. used some of its substantial political clout in the region to ease Hosni Mubarak and Zine El Abedine Ben Ali out of power in Egypt and Tunisia respectively. \\"Soft power\\" -- advice, mediation, persuasion and some aid -- was leveraged to influence events; the use of \\"hard power\\" as in Iraq was not even contemplated. In Egypt, the generals' long relationship with their OPTIONS: - Arab counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Arab Spring counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Bahrain counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Ben Ali counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Benghazi counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - CNN counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Egypt counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Hosni Mubarak counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Iraq counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Libya counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Obama counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Tahrir Square counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Tunis counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Tunisia counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - U.S. counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - West counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Western counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Yemen counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - Zine El Abedine counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past. - post-Gadhafi counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past.","output":"- U.S. counterparts (and their desire to keep the military aid pipeline flowing) will allow for renewed dialogue and influence once the immediate crisis is past.

We want to make sure the dough doesn't grow too much outside of the flowerpot. Solution 1 suggests we put a heavy object on top of the dough. While it might stop the dough from growing out of the pot, it could also squish the dough down and not let it grow nicely and fluffy inside the pot. Solution 2 recommends using a lid with holes. This allows the dough to breathe and grow nicely inside the flowerpot. If it tries to grow out of the pot, the lid will help keep it in place, but still let air in through the holes.

What kind of thing would answer this question?","output":"A soccer goalie is permitted to handle the ball within a specific area known as the penalty area or the 18-yard box. To answer this question in detail, we will first describe the dimensions and markings of the penalty area and then discuss the restrictions imposed on goalkeepers regarding handling the ball. The penalty area is a rectangular zone that extends 18 yards (16.5 meters) from each goalpost along the goal line and stretches 18 yards into the field, perpendicularly from the goal line. This creates a box that is 44 yards (40.3 meters) wide and 18 yards deep. At the corners of the penalty area, arcs with a radius of 1 yard (0.9 meters) are drawn to create the penalty arc. Also, inside the penalty area, 12 yards (11 meters) from the center of the goal line and parallel to it, there is a penalty spot where penalty kicks are taken. A soccer goalie can handle the ball within the penalty area using any part of their hands or arms. Handling the ball outside of this area can result in a direct free kick or even a disciplinary action, such as a yellow or red card, depending on the circumstances. The handling restrictions apply not only in live play but also during dead-ball situations, such as goal kicks, corner kicks, and free kicks. However, there are a few more rules and restrictions concerning the handling of the ball by goalkeepers: 1. Once the goalkeeper has released the ball from their hands, they cannot handle it again until it has been touched by another player, either a teammate or an opponent. 2. When receiving a deliberate pass-back from a teammate using their feet, the goalkeeper is not permitted to handle the ball. This would result in an indirect free kick for the opposing team from the spot where the goalkeeper touched the ball. 3. The goalkeeper must release the ball within six seconds of gaining control. Holding the ball for a longer period can result in an indirect free kick for the opposing team. 4. If a goalkeeper handles the ball after making contact with it through a throw-in directly from their teammate, it results in an indirect free kick for the opposing team. So, to sum up, a soccer goalie must stand within the penalty area to be permitted to handle the ball, following the additional rules and restrictions stated above. Knowledge of these rules and the dimensions of the penalty area can be crucial for goalkeepers to perform effectively and avoid conceding unnecessary fouls or disciplinary actions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Mark David Chapman (born May 10, 1955) is an American murderer who shot and killed John Lennon at the entrance to the Dakota apartment building in New York City on December 8, 1980. Chapman fired five times at Lennon, hitting him four times in the back, and read The Catcher in the Rye until he was arrested by police. He has repeatedly said that the novel was his statement. Chapman's legal team intended to mount an insanity defense that would be based on expert testimony that he was in a delusional psychotic state at the time of the killing. Context: Chapman's first court-appointed lawyer, Herbert Adlerberg, withdrew from the case amid threats of lynching. Police feared that Lennon fans might storm the hospital, so they transferred Chapman to Rikers Island for his personal safety.  At the initial hearing in January 1981, Chapman's new lawyer, Jonathan Marks, instructed him to enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity. In February, Chapman sent a handwritten statement to The New York Times urging everyone to read The Catcher in the Rye, calling it an \\"extraordinary book that holds many answers.\\" The defense team sought to establish witnesses as to Chapman's mental state at the time of the killing. It was reported they were confident he would be found not guilty by reason of insanity, in which case he would have been committed to a state mental hospital and received treatment.  However, in June, Chapman told Marks that he wanted to drop the insanity defense and plead guilty. Marks objected with \\"serious questions\\" over Chapman's sanity, and legally challenged his competence to make this decision. In the pursuant hearing on June 22, Chapman said that God had told him to plead guilty and that he would not change his plea or ever appeal, regardless of his sentence. Marks told the court that he opposed Chapman's change of plea but that Chapman would not listen to him. Judge Dennis Edwards refused a further assessment, saying that Chapman had made the decision of his own free will, and declared him competent to plead guilty. Question: Why did he want to change to a guilty plea?. Whats the answer?","output":"Mark David Chapman wanted to change his plea to guilty because he claimed that God told him to do so. He believed that by pleading guilty, he was following what God wanted for him. It's important to remember that at the time, there were concerns about his mental state, and his decision to change the plea was likely influenced by his mental condition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The body contains marks of many needle insertions and burns from sulfuric acid, which appear to have been inflicted while the child was still alive. Five years later, Claudia is still unable to get over the death of her child and she is addicted to tranquiliizers. Inexplicably, the presumed dead daughter Angela calls her mother, saying that she is still alive and needs her help.

She also gives him a boot she found on the site, believing it to have been left for her to find. Massera's research appears to corroborate the hypothesis that Angela is alive, revealing that a girl with similar characteristics disappeared around the same time and could have been used to fake Angela's death. He teams up with tabloid journalist Quiroga (Tristan Ulloa), a reporter for a magazine of parapsychology, after Quiroga receives in the mail a disturbing videotape which has Claudia's phone number written on the label. The tape shows what appears to be the murder or torture of a naked woman, and also footage of Claudia when she visited the derelict clinic. Visiting a theological expert at the university, the two begin to uncover a bizarre cult called The Nameless that is said to sacrifice children.

What is the answer for the question: What are the names of the two people who formed the supergroup? from the following article ?  During Tool's post-Ænima hiatus to deal with their legal issues, Keenan began working with Billy Howerdel, Tool's guitar tech through the Ænima tour, on a different project. The supergroup they formed, A Perfect Circle, began performing in 1999 and released its first album Mer de Noms in 2000. They released a successful follow-up in 2003 titled Thirteenth Step, a reference to twelve-step programs (many of the songs were written from the perspective of recovery). Both albums were eventually certified platinum. Their subsequent 2004 album, eMOTIVe, was primarily composed of covers, except for the singles \\"Counting Bodies Like Sheep to the Rhythm of the War Drums\\"—a song inspired by \\"Pet\\" that was originally released on Thirteenth Step—and \\"Passive\\". Keenan later characterized the record as a political album with which he \\"tested the waters\\" and was subsequently \\"crucified\\" for it because of the content. It was certified gold the month after its release. That same year they released the DVD and CD set entitled aMOTION, which was certified platinum within a month of its release. Howerdel reported in a May 2006 interview with MTV that the supergroup's work was concluded for the time being. After more than two years since the band's last release, Keenan was asked about the status of A Perfect Circle during an interview with Revolver. He stated: The real problem with running Tool and A Perfect Circle at the same time was they both operate the same way. They're both live touring bands with a label, still working under the old contract mentality. So I thought it was time to let A Perfect Circle go for now and let Billy explore himself. It's tough for a guy who went from being a guitar tech [for Tool] to being in a band with a pretentious, famous singer and having to live in that shadow. It was important for Billy to go and do his own thing and really explore his own sound and let people hear what he has to say and how he would do it on his own, and then we'll get back and do some A Perfect Circle stuff.

Answer choices: - photosynthesis  - kinetic energy  - genetic diversity  - activation energy  - stamina  - bloom time  - nutrients  - gene flow Answer:","output":"Answer: photosynthesis Step 1: Understand the question The question states that when a plant grows, photosynthesis may increase. It then asks what else may increase when a plant grows, providing a list of options. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant options - Kinetic energy: This is energy of motion and is not directly related to plant growth. - Genetic diversity: This refers to the variety of genes within a population, not an individual plant growth process. - Activation energy: This is the energy required for a chemical reaction to occur, not specifically related to plant growth. - Stamina: This term is related to the endurance of animals, not plants. - Bloom time: While this may be affected by plant growth, the question specifically linked photosynthesis to growth, making it a stronger answer. - Nutrients: Although important for plant growth, the question specifically links photosynthesis to growth. - Gene flow: This is the transfer of genetic information from one population to another, not specifically related to an individual plant's growth. Step 3: Justify the chosen answer Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into sugars, which provide energy for growth. As a plant grows, the surface area of its leaves may increase, allowing it to capture more sunlight and carry out more photosynthesis. Therefore, the most relevant answer is photosynthesis, as it is directly stated to increase when a plant grows."},{"instruction":"Given the below context:  Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904.

Summarize this article: (CNN) A feud with the first lady's office cost a senior national security adviser her job in the White House after she sparred with East Wing staff and other key members of the Trump administration.      The dispute spilled into public view in extraordinary fashion on Tuesday when the first lady's office released a statement calling for deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel's ouster as reports surfaced that President Donald Trump would fire the official.      \\"It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that (Ricardel) no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,\\" the first lady's communications director Stephanie Grisham said in a statement on Tuesday.      The White House announced Wednesday that Ricardel would be leaving her role as deputy national security adviser and would take a different role in the administration.      The statement Tuesday from Melania Trump's office amounted to a stunning public rebuke by a first lady of a senior official serving in her husband's administration. It came after reports surfaced earlier Tuesday indicating Ricardel would be pushed out of her post after less than seven months on the job.      Neither Ricardel nor spokespeople for the National Security Council responded to CNN requests for comment.      Reflecting the fast-moving nature of the events, soon after a Wall Street Journal report surfaced Tuesday afternoon alleging Ricardel was fired and escorted off the White House grounds, a senior White House official denied the story to reporters.      The official said Ricardel was still in her office Tuesday afternoon.      Her departure leaves national security adviser John Bolton without one of his key allies in the White House, a deputy who has also shared his penchant for bureaucratic infighting.      It was those sharp elbows that sources said led to the first lady's stinging statement, with Ricardel most recently feuding with members of the first lady's staff over her trip to Africa. One person familiar with the matter said Ricardel quarreled with the first lady's staff over seating on the plane and use of National Security Council resources.      A White House official accused Ricardel of being dishonest about the feud and subsequently leaking stories to try to cover her behavior.      And before her spat with the East Wing, Ricardel butted heads repeatedly with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a rivalry that was well-known within the Trump administration. Her disputes with Mattis preceded her time as deputy national security adviser, going back to the presidential transition when Ricardel sought to block Mattis from hiring certain people who had been critical of Trump or were viewed as insufficiently loyal to Trump.      Tensions had also been rising between Ricardel and chief of staff John Kelly and his deputy Zach Fuentes in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. Kelly and Fuentes believe Ricardel was leaking negative stories about them to the press, the people said.      The dispute made it difficult for Ricardel to land in a top post in the Trump administration, though she was ultimately tapped for the position of undersecretary of commerce for export administration. Ricardel then joined the National Security Council as Bolton's deputy in April after he was named national security adviser.      Ricardel has been key to Bolton's efforts to restructure the National Security Council and to help Bolton secure his place as an influential adviser to the President on all foreign policy matters.      The drama surrounding Ricardel's ouster surfaced while Bolton was half a world away in Singapore, where he is attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit.      West Wing caught off guard      West Wing officials were caught off guard on Tuesday by the statement from the first lady's spokeswoman targeting Ricardel, two sources familiar with the matter said.      White House officials were generally aware of the tensions between Ricardel and the first lady's office stemming from the Africa trip, but were stunned to see the first lady take such a public stance against a senior staffer through her spokeswoman. Sources said officials in the White House press shop were particularly annoyed that they didn't get a heads-up from the East Wing.      West Wing and NSC officials are more upset at the way the East Wing handled the matter than the substance of the effort to push Ricardel out.      One person said neither Trump, Kelly nor press secretary Sarah Sanders knew the statement was coming.      Ricardel made few friends since she came on board in April, clashing with officials across the administration. Two administration sources said she was generally not well liked, though others pushed back, saying she was a respected member of the team and one of the highest ranking women in the West Wing.      Even one NSC official who said they liked Ricardel said she \\"liked to pick fights with a lot of different folks\\" and suspected her latest feud with the first lady's office was \\"the last straw.\\"      Another official was more forgiving: \\"She'd run through a brick wall for you but her personality isn't for everyone.\\"      This story has been updated. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      / Updated By Carol E. Lee, Kristen Welker, Hallie Jackson and Courtney Kube      ­ WASHINGTON — John Kelly, mired in conflicts with a widening array of officials from the National Security Council to the office of the first lady, may soon depart the Trump administration, according to seven people familiar with the discussions.      Nick Ayers, Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, is among those being considered for the job, three of the people said, though President Donald Trump has mused about other possible candidates.      Melania Trump has ensured the departure of one White House official, deputy national security adviser Mira Ricardel, after she had a series of run-ins with the first lady’s office.      Stephanie Grisham, the first lady’s communications director, issued a pointed statement on Tuesday saying as much. “It is the position of the Office of the First Lady that she no longer deserves the honor of serving in this White House,” Grisham said.      It’s an extraordinary, if not unprecedented, move for the first lady’s office to publicly call for the firing of a NSC official. Ricardel was seen at an official White House event with the president as Grisham's statement was was issued.      Kelly’s time as chief of staff for most of the past year has been clouded by controversy and disagreements with Trump and various West Wing staff. But questions about his future in the White House recently became more serious after his repeated clashes with national security adviser John Bolton and his deputy, Ricardel.      Kelly has also gotten on the wrong side of Melania Trump over staffing issues and travel requests. Some of the disputes with the East Wing have escalated to the president, the seven people familiar with the clashes said.      SIGN UP FOR NBC BREAKING NEWS EMAILS      \\"There have been instances where the East Wing staff were not treated as equals to the male-dominated decision makers in Chief Kelly’s office,\\" one White House official said. \\"Promotions were denied then finally granted after months of requests,\\" the official said.      Melania Trump raised concerns with her husband earlier this year, amid the height of the controversy over his alleged affair with porn actress Stormy Daniels, that Kelly had repeatedly denied her requests to promote some of her aides, two White House officials told NBC News.      The requests languished for months as Kelly insisted there weren’t enough available positions for the first lady’s aides to have senior titles, these people said. During this same period however, West Wing officials working for Kelly received promotions, the White House officials said.      Having learned of the dispute, the president was furious and told Kelly to give the first lady, who has a smaller East Wing staff than her recent predecessors, what she wanted, these people said. \\"I don't need this shit,\\" Trump told Kelly, according to one person familiar with the conversation.      Kelly wouldn’t be the first chief-of-staff to upset a first lady but history has shown that such disputes are tough to overcome.      Nancy Reagan was at odds with President Ronald Reagan’s chief of staff, Donald Regan, which ultimately helped orchestrate his departure. And Hillary Clinton was at odds with President Bill Clinton’s chief of staff over her large role in policy decisions.      Trump was especially annoyed, according to people familiar with his thinking, that he had to get involved in disputes involving his wife. His message to Kelly, according to one of them, repeatedly has been: \\"Deal with it.\\"      The promotions of the first lady’s communications director, Grisham, and White House social secretary, Rickie Niceta, from special assistants to the president to deputy assistants to the president were ultimately cleared and announced in June.      Kelly has also sparred with the East Wing over travel arrangements for the first lady’s staff, people familiar with the issue said. He often wouldn’t reserve space for Melania Trump’s two aides on Air Force One or on helicopters. They would find themselves without hotel rooms and not listed for motorcade movements. The omissions have caused last-minute logistical issues that the first lady viewed as a slight, these people said.      The White House declined to comment for this story.      \\"The East Wing is very focused on the First Lady’s initiatives and works independently,\\" Grisham said in a statement to NBC news. \\"However, we do collaborate on a variety of projects and work alongside many departments within the west wing. We have a very positive working relationship,\\" she said.      The first lady also took issue with Kelly over the ousting in March of her director of operations, Justin Caporale, and of John McEntee, the president’s personal aide who had become close with the Trump family since working for him during the 2016 campaign, people familiar with the matter said.      The first lady liked and trusted both of them, according to current and former White House officials, and viewed forcing them out \\"as personal affronts.\\"      Some people close to the president believe Kelly’s handling of the East Wing at times is a significant threat to him maintaining his job.      \\"There’s one problem John Kelly has that’ll do him in, and that’s the first lady,\\" one of them said.      A White House official said the first lady has not pushed for his departure, noting that she likes Kelly personally and gets along with him. But tensions with her office, on top of his intensifying power struggle with Bolton, have reignited speculation that Trump will replace him before the end of the year.      Last month, Kelly got into a heated argument with Bolton on immigration, ultimately storming out of the White House on Oct. 18, NBC News reported last month after learning that Bolton had criticized Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen as doing a terrible job on border security,­ an issue of top concern to the president.      Nielsen is a close Kelly confidante, and Kelly viewed Bolton’s move as the latest example of the national security adviser circumventing his authority as chief of staff. Trump has been unhappy with Nielsen for months and she has not denied reports that the president has yelled at her in private settings. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that she may also be asked to depart the administration soon.      Kelly and Bolton also have clashed over Ricardel, the deputy national security adviser, four people familiar with the issue said. Bolton recently learned that Kelly has quietly mounted an effort to oust Ricardel, these people said, and was furious.      Ricardel was among Bolton’s first hires when he became national security adviser in March. She previously worked for him during the administration of former president George W. Bush.      But at the NSC, Ricardel has gotten into several disputes with the East Wing, also over the First Lady’s trip to Africa in October. One White House official said that in that instance, Kelly intervened on behalf of the East Wing to smooth over the issues.      Some current and former White House officials and other people close to the president said it’s the accumulation of incidents in recent months, on top of Kelly’s tensions with first daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner, that has led to a desire by the president to seek out a new chief of staff.      Kelly is Trump’s second chief of staff, having replaced Reince Priebus just seven months into the presidency. Kelly left his position as Secretary for Homeland Security in August, 2017 and joined the White House to bring structure to a freewheeling West Wing. He curtailed access to the president and he cut back on the number of staff allowed in meetings. The efforts quickly won him enemies among the president’s confidants.      John Kelly speaks to President Donald Trump as he departs the Oval Office on July 18, 2018. Tasos Katopodis / AFP - Getty Images      A retired Marine general, Kelly maintained his job despite a steady flow of reports that he’s lost the confidence of much of the White House staff and has disparaged the president behind his back, NBC has reported.      As conflicts have arisen, Trump has for months mused on and off about possible replacements for Kelly and vented his frustrations with his handling of the job. The president also arranged for some of his new hires this past spring, including Bolton, to report directly to him rather than his chief of staff.      The White House has tried to quell speculation about Kelly’s exit, even issuing a statement in July that he would remain in the job through 2020. But few expressed confidence that would be the case.      Ayers, who has worked to develop a relationship with Trump as the vice president’s chief of staff, is not the only candidate under consideration in what the three people familiar with the outreach describe as active discussions in the White House about replacing Kelly, possibly by the end of the year. The vice president’s office had no comment on the possibility of the appointment. One White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity said \\"personnel decisions don’t mean anything until formally announced by the,\\" president. \\"Regardless, Nick and those close to him have never lobbied for this.\\"      Melania Trump has kept a low profile as first lady and has surrounded herself with a smaller group of aides compared to her predecessors. In a rare, wide-ranging interview with ABC News during her Africa trip, she signaled, however, that she doesn’t hold back in private about her views on her husband’s aides.      There currently are members of her husband’s staff she does not trust, she said, which makes it \\"harder to govern.\\"      \\"You always need to watch your back,\\" she said. ||||| WASHINGTON—President Trump is considering new high-level staff changes in his administration—including discussing a potential successor for White House Chief of Staff John Kelly—as the West Wing makes preparations for the start of the final two years of Mr. Trump’s current term.

Now, let me tell you about how to get ready for your period: 1. Be aware: Since your period can start anytime between ages 8 to 16, it's good to be prepared. It usually starts when you're around 12, but everybody is different. 2. A period is a sign of puberty: Puberty is when your body starts to change from a child's body to an adult's body. Having a period is one of those changes for girls. It shows you're growing up! 3. Know the signs: Before your period starts, you might feel different. You could feel a little achy in your lower belly, your back might hurt, or you might be more tired than usual. These signs can tell you that your period might be coming soon. It's also possible that you don't feel any signs at all, and that's okay too! To prepare for your period, keep these things in mind: 1. Learn about it: Talk to your mom, older sisters, or friends about their experiences so you know what to expect. 2. Have supplies ready: Make sure you have pads or tampons at home or carry a few in your bag, just in case your period starts when you're not expecting it. 3. Track your period: When your period does start, keep track of the date and how long it lasts. This can help you figure out when your next period might come so you can be prepared. 4. Be prepared for changes: Your period might be different each month, and that's normal! It can be heavier or lighter, and sometimes it might even skip a month. Don't worry, your body is just figuring things out. Remember, having a period is a natural and healthy part of growing up for girls. It might feel strange at first, but it's important to talk about it with someone you trust and learn as much as you can. That way, you'll always be prepared and know what to expect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

En route to California to prospect for gold, ex-sheriff Hooker, professional gambler Fiske, and bounty hunter Luke Daly are forced to stop over in a tiny Mexican village by engine trouble on the ship they are taking. A desperate Leah Fuller hires the three men and local Vicente Madariaga, to rescue her husband, John, who is pinned under debris from a gold mine cave-in in hostile Apache territory. During the harrowing journey, Luke tries to force himself on Leah late one night, forcing Hooker to intervene. Leah tells Hooker that where her husband is trapped, once was a boom town, but a volcano eruption wiped it out, leaving only a church steeple and the mine uncovered by lava. The resident priest called it the \\"garden of evil\\". The Indians now consider the volcano sacred. The group then arrives at the mine. They find John unconscious, and they free him. Before John wakes up, Hooker sets the man's broken leg.  When John regains consciousness, he accuses Leah of using him to get gold.

(CNN) One of the US Navy's newest littoral combat ships can't catch a break.      In its latest mishap, the USS Montgomery, an Independence-class LCS that's been in service less than two months, sustained an 18-inch-long crack to its hull while passing through the Panama Canal en route to its homeport in San Diego.      The Montgomery (LCS-8) was traveling from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean through the canal's series of \\"locks\\" when it hit a cement structure known as the \\"center lock wall\\" while under the control of a local Panama Canal pilot, according to a statement to CNN from the Navy.      \\"The crack is located 8-10 feet above the waterline and poses no water intrusion or stability risk,\\" the Navy said, adding that the ship has since exited the Panama Canal to continue its trip to San Diego as scheduled.

MUST WATCH U.S. Navy tests littoral combat ship 01:23      The incident is the latest in a run of bad luck for the 360 million state-of-the-art warship since it was commissioned in September.      In fact, the Montgomery experienced a separate mishap just weeks ago that also resulted in a crack to its hull. It sprang a leak after it was hit by a tug boat pulling it out of the path of Hurricane Matthew.      An investigation into possible causes of that October 4 incident is under way, according to a statement that was made to CNN last month by Lt. Cmdr. Rebecca Haggard, a spokeswoman for the Naval Surface Forces Pacific.      Earlier, just days after its commissioning, the Montgomery also experienced a seawater leak into the vessel's hydraulic cooling system, and then lost one of its gas turbine engines later that day.      The Montgomery's Panama mishap is just the latest in a string of incidents that have dogged the LCS program.      In September, the service announced a major overhaul of the LCS program that will include designating the first four of the ships as testing vessels and limiting their overseas deployments to emergencies.

It is designed to defeat asymmetric “anti-access” threats such as mines, quiet diesel submarines and fast surface craft.      The LCS class consists of two variants, the Freedom variant and the Independence variant - designed and built by two industry teams. The Freedom variant team is led by Lockheed Martin (for the odd-numbered hulls, e.g. LCS 1). The Independence variant team is being led by General Dynamics, Bath Iron Works (LCS 2 and LCS 4) and Austal USA (for the subsequent even-numbered hulls).      The LCS seaframes will be outfitted with reconfigurable payloads, called mission modules (made up of mission systems and support equipment), which can be changed out quickly. These modules combine with crew detachments and aviation assets to become complete mission packages, which will deploy manned and unmanned vehicles and sensors in support of mine countermeasures, anti-submarine warfare, or surface warfare missions.      Initiated in February 2002, the LCS program represents a significant reduction in time to acquire, design and build ships in comparison to any previous ship class. Constructed by Lockheed Martin in the Marinette Marine Corporation's shipyard in Marinette, Wis., USS Freedom (LCS 1) was delivered to the Navy on Sept. 18, 2008. USS Independence (LCS 2) was constructed by General Dynamics, Bath Iron Works in the Austal USA shipyard in Mobile, Ala. and delivered to the Navy on Dec. 18, 2009. Lockheed Martin was also responsible for the construction and delivery of LCS 3 (USS Fort Worth, which was commissioned in September 2012) and General Dynamics for construction and delivery of LCS 4 (the future USS Coronado, which delivered Sept. 27, 2013).      The Navy's LCS acquisition strategy to down select to a single design in 2010 resulted in a highly effective competition and an industry response that produced significant savings in the LCS program. These competitive bids, coupled with the Navy's desire to increase ship procurement rates to support operational requirements, created an opportunity to award both bidders a fixed-price, ten-ship block buy for a total of 20 ships from fiscal years 2010 to 2015.      Contracts were awarded to Lockheed Martin and Austal USA on Dec. 29, 2010, for the construction of up to ten ships each (FY 2010 - FY 2015), beginning with LCS 5 and LCS 6.      In order to bring operational issues to the forefront, collect data in real-world operational scenarios, and inform the larger LCS fleet integration strategy, the Navy decided to deploy USS Freedom (LCS 1) nearly two years early. On Feb. 16, 2010, the ship deployed to the Fourth Fleet in the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility. During this deployment, Freedom successfully conducted four drug seizures, netting more than five tons of cocaine, detained nine suspected drug smugglers, and disabled two 'go-fast' drug vessels. USS Freedom also participated in the Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise during this early deployment.      On March 1, 2013, USS Freedom departed on the first LCS overseas deployment, crossing the Pacific to operate in Southeast Asia out of Singapore for eight months. Marking the first of many planned rotational deployments to the Western Pacific for the LCS platform, Freedom is conducting maritime security operations with regional partners and allies. This deployment will allow the Navy to demonstrate Freedom’s operational capabilities as well as evaluate crew rotation and maintenance plans for the entire LCS class.      Following her commissioning in Mobile, Ala. on Jan. 10, 2010, USS Independence continued on to her homeport in San Diego. The Navy commissioned LCS 3 on Sept. 22, 2012 in Galveston, Texas, after which she joined sister ships USS Freedom and USS Independence in homeport San Diego. Both LCS 2 and LCS 3 are conducting Post Delivery Test and Trials, which are scheduled to conclude in 2014. LCS 4 (the future USS Coronado) delivered to the Navy on Sept. 27, 2013 and is planned to commission in San Diego in April, 2014.      Milwaukee (LCS 5), Detroit (LCS 7), Little Rock (LCS 9) and Sioux City (LCS 11) are under contract to Lockheed Martin and are in construction at the Marinette Marine Corp. shipyard, and Jackson (LCS 6), Montgomery (LCS 8), Gabrielle Giffords (LCS 10) and Omaha (LCS 12), are under contract to Austal USA and are in construction at the Austal USA shipyard.      Wichita (LCS 13) and Billings (LCS 15) are under contract with Lockheed Martin and in the pre-production phase at Marinette Marine Corp, while Manchester (LCS 14) and Tulsa (LCS 16) are under contract with Austal USA and in the pre-production phase.

Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS). Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and application-specific naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the Internet, a server computer hosting a web site, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via the Internet. In 2015, 294 million domain names had been registered.  - The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is a department of ICANN, a nonprofit private American corporation that oversees global IP address allocation, autonomous system number allocation, root zone management in the Domain Name System (DNS), media types, and other Internet Protocol-related symbols and Internet numbers.  - The DNS root zone is the top-level DNS zone in the hierarchical namespace of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the Internet.  - The European Commission (EC) is an institution of the European Union, responsible for proposing legislation, implementing decisions, upholding the EU treaties and managing the day-to-day business of the EU. Commissioners swear an oath at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, pledging to respect the treaties and to be completely independent in carrying out their duties during their mandate.  - Cybersquatting (also known as domain squatting), according to the United States federal law known as the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, is registering, trafficking in, or using an Internet domain name with bad faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. The cybersquatter then offers to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark contained within the name at an inflated price.  - The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for the purpose of locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality of the Internet, and has been in use since the 1980s.  - EURid vzw / asbl ( European Registry for Internet Domains ) is a non-profit organisation appointed by the European Commission on 8 April 2003 as the domain name registry to operate the new . eu top - level domain .

Summarize this article: President Obama, clearly angry, let loose on House Republicans in what was, for him, an extraordinary fit of pique Friday night after talks with Speaker John Boehner broke down.      President Obama at the White House press room Friday afternoon. \\"One of the questions that the Republican Party's going to have to ask itself is, can they say 'yes' to anything?” Obama said.      It was President Obama’s Howard Beale moment: He was mad as hell, and not going to take it anymore.      The president had just been informed late Friday afternoon that Republican House Speaker John Boehner was breaking off talks over a deal to enact major deficit reduction and raise the federal debt ceiling. And there is only a week and a half to go until Aug. 2, at which points the US risks a potentially catastrophic default without new borrowing authority. The White House hastily called reporters to the briefing room, and Mr. Obama let 'er rip.      “I've been left at the altar now a couple of times,” the steely-eyed president said. “And I think that, you know, one of the questions that the Republican Party's going to have to ask itself is, can they say 'yes' to anything?”      “Can they say yes to anything?” he repeated. “I mean, keep in mind it's the Republican Party that has said that the single most important thing facing our country is deficits and debts.”      Obama said that he had put forward a package that would significantly cut deficits and debt in a way that does not raise individual tax rates. It is compatible, an exasperated Obama said, with the no-tax pledge that “a whole bunch of these folks signed on to, because we were mindful that they had boxed themselves in.”      The challenge, he said, “has to do with the seeming inability, particularly in the House of Representatives, to arrive at any kind of position that compromises any of their ideological preferences – none.”      The Democrats had done their part and agreed to compromises that were difficult to swallow, he said. Now it’s the Republicans’ turn.      “If you want to be a leader, then you got to lead,” he concluded, then turned and walked briskly from the room.      Those are mere highlights from a 30-minute primal scream, the likes of which Washington has not seen from a president known for his near-preternatural calm, both as a candidate and since assuming office. Obama was clearly fed up. And his emotion was authentic.      Obama seemed to be demanding the respect due a president of the United States. The Boehner walkout – not his first since debt negotiations began – in fact will be short-lived. Obama called on both parties’ congressional leaders to meet with him at the White House at 11 a.m. Saturday. Mr. Boehner said he would attend.      Obama also faces pressure from his own political base, which has expressed frustration that he seems to be doing all the compromising – see cuts to entitlement programs – while the Republicans insist on sticking to their “no new taxes” mantra.      A CNN/ORC International Poll released Friday showed Obama’s job approval rating down to 45 percent, in part a result of a decline in liberal support. The president’s approval rating among liberals dropped to 71 percent, a low for his presidency, the poll found. Another data point: 1 in 4 Americans who disapprove of his job performance say he has not been liberal enough.      So the president’s show of pique may have been as much aimed at Democrats as at congressional Republicans, whom he needs to believe that he means business. Obama also needs to win back independent voters if he is to win reelection next year. Polls show that independents strongly favor compromise in the debt and deficit talks. ||||| After rarely courting over the previous two years, the pair had an intense summer bromance they’ll never forget: a big outing, frequent dates (albeit with an occasional third wheel), shared secrets, big dreams, their friends cheering them on.

But it was promises, promises – all the time promises.      Then President Barack Obama began to complain that Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) never wants to talk about problems – he just leaves. Boehner stewed that Obama doesn’t know what he really wants, and keeps changing his mind. There were breakups and reconciliations.

With the August 2nd deadline approaching, and the risk of a catastrophic default without new borrowing authority, President Obama questioned whether the Republican Party can agree to anything. The president had put forward a package that would significantly cut deficits and debt without raising individual tax rates. Despite compromises from the Democrats, President Obama expressed frustration at the inability of the House of Representatives to compromise on their ideological preferences."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"The names for the nation of Greece and the Greek people differ from the names used in other languages, locations and cultures.

In China, I had English classes five times a week since fifth grade. However, I didn't know how different textbook English could be from everyday English until I came to Hotchkiss School, Connecticut. When I first studied English, I was told to say,\\"I am fine\\" when people say \\"How are you?\\" But in the US, I found that people say, \\"I am good\\" or \\"I'm tired\\". One day, someone greeted me with \\"What's up?\\" It made me  _ . I thought for a moment and then smiled because I didn't know what to say. Since then, I have discovered more and more differences between Chinese and US cultures. To my surprise, US girls spend a lot of time in the burning sun to get a tan . However, in China, girls try every possible way to get their skin paler, or \\"whiter\\". I was also surprised by how hardworking US students are . In China, schoolwork is almost everything, so we study hard and that's it. But here, a \\"good\\" student gets good grades, does a lot of work for the public and plays sports or music. The kids here are so talented, I am starting to be sorry that I gave up playing the piano at an early age and that I have never thought about sports.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Process:  - A conducting metal, like copper, is wrapped around a piece of metal - An electrical source, like a battery, produces an electrical current - The electrical current flows through the wire - The electrical current creates a magnetic field around the wire, magnetizing the metal - The magnetic field can be turned on and off by starting or stopping the electricity source -   suppose needing smaller electromagnet happens, how will it affect weaker magnetic field.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation caused by needing a smaller electromagnet with a weaker magnetic field can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. Let me explain this in more detail. Electromagnetism relies on the principle that an electrical current flowing through a conducting metal, like copper, creates a magnetic field around the wire. The strength of this magnetic field is directly proportional to the amount of current flowing through the wire and the number of turns or loops in the coil. In simpler terms, more current and more loops result in a stronger magnetic field, while less current and fewer loops result in a weaker magnetic field. In the given process, when you need a smaller electromagnet, you may have to reduce the size of the coil or decrease the amount of current supplied by the electrical source (like a battery). In both cases, the impact on the magnetic field is indirect, as it affects the parameters that determine the field's strength. Reducing the size of the coil will lead to fewer turns in the wire, which can lead to a weaker magnetic field. The electrical current will still flow through the wire and create a magnetic field, but the strength of the field will be altered due to the change in the coil's size. Decreasing the amount of current supplied by the electrical source will also lead to a weaker magnetic field as a direct consequence of the lesser current flowing through the wire. However, the actual process of generating an electrical current and creating a magnetic field is not directly impacted - it still occurs, just with different input parameters. Thus, the supposed perturbation of needing a smaller electromagnet with a weaker magnetic field is indirectly impacting a step of the process – as it primarily affects the parameters that influence the magnetic field's strength, and not the fundamental mechanisms through which the electromagnet operates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Village of the Damned Movie plot: The quiet coastal town of Midwich, California is invaded by an unseen force which leaves ten women mysteriously pregnant. Nine months later, the babies are born simultaneously on one night, except for one which is stillborn. At first, they all appear to be normal, but it does not take the parents long to realize that their children are anything but normal. As they grow older, the children are shown to have pale skin, platinum-white hair, fierce intellect and steely, cobalt eyes. The emotionless children display eerie psychic abilities and remarkable powers, which they use with deadly consequences, unleashing a reign of terror. When they actively use their mind-controlled powers, their irises or their entire eyes glow in different colours, mostly reddish-orange, but also green, yellow, violet, blue or pure white.There are some story differences from the earlier adaptation. In this version, the children \\"paired off\\", but one of the children, David (Thomas Dekker), loses his partner after she dies at birth. As a result, he shows human compassion while still resembling the other children and retaining some degree of psychic powers. This leads to him not fitting in well with the children. Their ruthless leader, Mara (Lindsey Haun) (\\"daughter\\" of a local doctor, Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve); her mother, Barbara (Karen Kahn), commits suicide by walking off an ocean cliff), considers him less important due to his expression of emotions. Because of his childhood loss, he understands what the other children do not: pain. He and his mother (Linda Kozlowski) (the local school principal) share a brief conversation about the meaning of the word \\"empathy\\", with David beginning to understand that if he feels pain, he can understand others' pain as well.

News article: SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Tesla Motors shares shot nearly 41% higher Tuesday in their first day of trade, an enthusiastic reception for the Silicon Valley electric car marker in sharp contrast to steep declines elsewhere in the equities market.      The stock opened at 19 a share, 12% above the 17 offer price. After briefly pulling back to 17.54, it staged a full-blown rally that carried it briefly to 25 a share.      Tesla /quotes/comstock/15*!tsla/quotes/nls/tsla (TSLA 21.96, -1.87, -7.85%) shares closed at 23.89, an advance of 6.89, or 40.5%, in a session that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average /quotes/comstock/10w!i:dji/delayed (DJIA 9,733, -41.49, -0.42%) fall more than 268 points to 9,870.      Tesla IPO prices above estimates Shares of Tesla Motors open higher after the initial public offering priced above expectations. With a relatively small dealer network and a high price point for its electric cars, should investors be concerned about the company's business model? VentureWire's Scott Austin joins Simon Constable and Lauren Goode on the Digits show to discuss.      Tesla, the first American car maker to go public in half a century, priced the deal one dollar above the initial offer price of 14 to 16 a share.      The maker of the Roadster sports car raised 202 million from the sale of 11.88 million shares. Insiders, including 38-year-old Chief Executive Elon Musk, collectively sold an additional 1.4 million shares in the deal.      Musk reaped an IPO payday of 15.3 million based on the 900,212 shares he sold, according to a regulatory filing.      Tesla on Monday boosted the share offering by 20% to 13.3 million shares due to strong demand. The company's selling shareholders granted the deal underwriters a 30-day option to buy an additional 1.995 million common shares to cover any overallotments. In all, the IPO could be worth 260 million.      For some, Tesla's IPO harkens back to Silicon Valley's Internet bubble in the late 1990s, when retail investors snapped up shares in brand-new tech companies with no track record of making any money.      Scott Sweet, senior managing partner of IPO Boutique, which profited Tuesday from flipping Tesla shares in opening trades, believes the stock faces an uphill battle.      He pointed to last September's IPO of A123 Systems Inc., a maker of lithium-ion batteries for hybrid vehicles. A123 /quotes/comstock/15*!aone/quotes/nls/aone (AONE 9.12, -0.31, -3.29%) shares spiked on their first day of trading, but the stock has now fallen 27% from its 13.50 offer price.      \\"There are enough problems with the financials,\\" Sweet said of Tesla. \\"The euphoria will likely fade soon given the cost of this vehicle in the recessionary environment. There is a very limited market for Tesla's cars.\\"      NAIAS                  Tesla has yet to earn a dime since it was founded by Musk and Chief Technical Officer J.B. Straubel in 2003. The company has lost almost 300 million since inception, and does not expect to make a quarterly profit until at least 2012.      \\"The investment is a risk for investors, but some risks pay off,\\" said Edmunds.com Chief Executive Jeremy Anwyl. \\"Even if this doesn't turn out well for investors, it's good for the country that Tesla has gotten so much attention for its innovative efforts.\\"      Tesla is hoping to tap growing interest from consumers and governments for hybrid and electric vehicles in an era of high oil prices and concerns about the impact of gas-fueled cars on the environment. The U.S. government wants to put 1 million electric cars on the road by 2015 and offers consumer tax credits of up to 7,500 per alternative-fuel vehicle. Read MarketWatch First Take on Tesla's believers.      Tesla's top-end Roadster, which sells for more than 100,000, has attracted attention from Hollywood's \\"A-list\\" stars, among other movers and shakers, and the U.S. Energy Department has backed it with a 465 million loan. But the company is pinning hopes of future profits on sales of a mass-market Model S sedan.      The Model S carries a price tag of 50,000, after a federal tax credit. So far, 2,200 would-be buyers have plunked down a 5,000 refundable deposit for the five-passenger car.      Volume production of the Model S is slated to begin in 2012 at a recently shuttered Northern California auto plant it bought from Toyota Motor Corp. /quotes/comstock/13*!tm/quotes/nls/tm (TM 68.70, +0.13, +0.19%) for 42 million.      Tesla is selling 50 million in shares to Toyota immediately after the IPO as part of a broader partnership with the Japanese auto maker.      Based in Palo Alto, Calif., Tesla has 646 employees. It plans to expand its network of 12 retail showrooms in the United States and Europe to 50 worldwide to accommodate its rollout of the Model S. On Thursday, Tesla will open a showroom in Copenhagen.      Tesla's Musk has had success in the past with startups.

Matt Andrejczak is a reporter for MarketWatch in San Francisco. ||||| Since its founding in 2003, luxury automaker Tesla Motors has never turned a profit. Its charismatic founder recently ran out of cash. It has sold fewer than 1,500 vehicles.      Yet in a burst of enthusiasm for electric cars, investors are saluting the company's prospects, raising more than 200 million at its initial public offering Monday and, on its first day of trading Tuesday, sending share prices up again from 17 to 23.89.      Co-founder and chief executive Elon Musk said the enthusiasts were making a smart bet.      \\"We had an incredibly positive outcome from the smartest investors in the world,\\" he told CNBC on Tuesday. \\"When people look at the list of the investors . . . they will be amazed at the quality and strength of the investor group in Tesla.\\"      The outcome, indirectly, amounts to a small measure of private-sector validation for Congress and the Obama administration, which has invested billions of government dollars in electric-car technology, including a 465 million loan commitment to Tesla.      But as lawmakers weigh bills that would bolster the electric-car industry with 10 billion more in consumer incentives and other support, industry observers remain divided over whether the technology will be commercially viable soon, and whether this is the right time for the government to get involved. Chevrolet and Nissan are expected to roll out electric cars for sale this year.      The Tesla stock offering \\"is a good sign that people believe electric vehicles have potential,\\" said Robbie Diamond, president of the Electrification Coalition.      The group is lobbying for more than 100 billion in long-term government support that would give consumers thousands of dollars in incentives to purchase an electric vehicle. Without subsidies, electric cars are unlikely to attract many buyers because they are more expensive than their conventional counterparts. The coalition's plan also calls for the government to subsidize the development of charging stations, where travelers would plug in.      \\"The government really does have to be involved,\\" Diamond said. \\"The government needs to get serious about working in this industry or electric cars will be relegated to a niche market and not solve our oil dependence problem.\\"      He notes that despite some government support, hybrid vehicles make up only about 1.6 million of the roughly 250 millions cars on the nation's roads.      Others said past government efforts to subsidize alternative energies have yielded little.      \\"The attempt to subsidize our way out of this problem has a 35-year track record of failure,\\" said John DeCicco, senior lecturer at the University of Michigan and a former senior fellow for automotive strategies at the Environmental Defense Fund.      He said that synthetic fuels were hyped during the Carter administration, that the Clinton administration pushed the \\"Supercar,\\" which was supposed to triple mileage, and that the Bush administration promoted a hydrogen-fueled vehicle dubbed the \\"Freedom Car.\\"      DeCicco backs government subsidies for research and development in alternative fuels, but he said subsidizing production and sales of vehicles is a \\"dubious proposition.\\"      Bills with bipartisan support now in Congress would, among other things, offer incentives of as much as 10,000 to consumers who buy electric cars, as well as provide support for building charging stations and other infrastructure. Existing law gives consumers a 7,500 tax credit for their purchase.      Such credits would only make a small dent in the price of Tesla's Roadster, which sells for more than 100,000 and has attracted buyers such as George Clooney and Brad Pitt. The Chevrolet Volt and the Nissan Leaf are expected to be far less expensive -- the Leaf price tag is 32,780. Tesla's next car is supposed to be less costly, projected to run about 50,000.      Regardless, the boost from investors led Musk on Tuesday to take a jab at skeptics of the company into which he has poured millions of dollars made from his previous company, PayPal.      \\"People at this point ought to be a little bit more optimistic about the future of Tesla because we've confounded the critics at every turn,\\" Musk said. \\"At a certain point, people have to get tired of being wrong.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Tesla Motors, a company that makes electric cars, had a very good first day of selling their shares to the public. Even though the company has not made a profit yet and has only sold a small number of cars, people are excited about electric cars and their potential for the future.

Write a title for this article: The Leadership Insider network is an online community where the most thoughtful and influential people in business contribute answers to timely questions about careers and leadership. Today’s answer to the question: How do you keep your team motivated? is written by ‎Daniel Saks, co-CEO and co-founder of AppDirect. Whether you feel the pull toward the Dark Side or the Light—or don’t really get the fuss about the Force to begin with—it’s hard to ignore the Star Wars mania that has swept the globe. Count me as one of those millions of happy movie-goers. But, I didn’t like The Force Awakens just because it has all of the lightsaber battles and star fighter action that any die-hard fan could ask for. As a startup co-founder and co-CEO, I also think the movie offers important lessons for anyone looking to build a strong workplace culture. No really. Hear me out. You can stretch and make all kinds of cute comparisons between Star Wars and the business world. Your competitor is the evil First Order (or Empire, if you’re keeping things old school), controlled by ruthless villains who will stop at nothing to crush you. Your company is the Resistance, who, with a well-aimed product, er, blast from an X-wing fighter can destroy your competitor’s Starkiller Base (or Death Star). Okay, eye-rolling aside, maybe this is true, but I’m more interested in the human side of the saga. Star Wars has always been about people facing huge challenges and not being entirely sure how to overcome them. The adventure is figuring it out along the way, and The Force Awakens shows just how powerful having a solid set of core values to guide you can be. See also: 6 Things That Will Make You Work Harder It’s an idea that leapt out at me when I saw the movie (and not because I was at a 3D showing). When we started AppDirect, we founded the company on a set of values that guide everything we do. They’re uncannily similar to what you see in The Force Awakens, which doesn’t surprise me. Our values have allowed AppDirect to build a strong workplace culture that has helped us do some awesome things, and they help the movies’ heroes achieve some pretty amazing things, too. With that in mind, here are four of the biggest team-building lessons from Star Wars. Stay humble After teaming up to ditch some TIE fighters in an early chase scene, Rey and Finn (played by Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, respectively) burst with compliments for each other. Their humility is a refreshing departure from the typical action hero—or coworker—who steps in, tries to fix things, and never gives credit to anyone. These compliments seal their friendship, and they can go a long way toward building rapport at work. Take ownership When BB-8 rolls up to Rey’s makeshift home, no one tells her she has to help the droid complete its mission. But, she takes ownership and does anyway (with incredible results). Sometimes work projects don’t have a clear owner either; if you step up and take responsibility for a project—or, like Rey, ensure that it gets handed off to the right person—you’ll not only earn the respect of your team, but also drive results for your company. Have a positive attitude Finn is accused of running away from problems, but he’s actually always trying to solve them. He may not know exactly how to rescue Rey from the Starkiller Base, but he keeps on talking, trying to get to something that will work. When you run into obstacles at work, a steady stream of ideas and new approaches are the only way to overcome them. In the end, you may not use any of your ideas—in one of the movie’s best moments, Finn turns around to see that Rey has already figured out her own rescue—but the key is to keep trying. Be intense Okay, so you can roll your eyes a little at this one (blame the screenwriters, not me!), but it is true that it takes a lot of intensity to make a hyperspace jump to a planet-sized weapon, dismantle its shields, and take out its thermal oscillator—all in about 15 minutes—but that’s just what the Resistance does. Back here on Earth, there are numerous distractions, big and small, that can get in the way at work. Making a conscious effort to move fast and stay focused will go a long way toward helping your team achieve its goals. Sure, the challenges of starting or growing a business may seem a little less… galactic in scale, but they can still feel monumental to the team that’s striving to build a successful company. Many businesses have values and mission statements, but the key is making sure your values surround you, flow through you, and bind your company together (hey, that sounds a lot like the Force). As you build a team that can take on any challenge, may these values—whatever you decide they should be—be with you.

They were both very surprised with they findings.  Which scientist read less about the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest?  Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. The answer is:","output":"Based on the information provided, we can deduce that the scientist who read less about the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest would be Jian. This is because Jian was focused on studying grassland soil, while Yun was studying forest soils. Given the hint, we know that tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in forest ecosystems, while grass root systems contribute significantly to organic matter in grassland soil. Moreover, different environmental factors like forest fires in grasslands and higher acidity in forests also impact the distribution of organic matter in these ecosystems. By analyzing the differences between the two types of soils, it becomes apparent why each scientist might have been surprised by their findings; they discovered variations in the characteristics of soil organic matter between forests and grasslands, which would not have been as evident if they had only studied one type of ecosystem. These findings would have highlighted the differences in soil formation, development, and processes dictated by the unique characteristics of each ecosystem and the relative importance of various sources of organic matter. In conclusion, Jian would be the scientist who read less about the principal source of soil organic matter in forests since he focused on grassland soil. On the other hand, Yun would have likely had a deeper understanding of forest soil organic matter inputs and distribution due to her focus on studying forest soils exclusively. Both scientists were able to contribute valuable insights into the relationship between soil and different ecosystems, demonstrating the importance of studying soil properties and processes in varied environments to broaden our understanding of soil as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Water gets into cracks in rocks - The water freezes into ice - The cracks expand - Over time the rocks split - The rocks are now in smaller pieces.  suppose more solid rock happens, how will it affect MORE or FASTER weathering occurring.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"In the described process of water freezing in the rock cracks, causing them to expand and eventually split, the presence of more solid rock could potentially affect the rate of weathering in different ways. Before I answer the question regarding the supposed perturbation, let's examine the possible ways more solid rock could influence this process: 1. More surface area for water to enter: If there is more solid rock, it means there are more cracks and surfaces for water to infiltrate. This could lead to more weathering occurring, as there are more potential sites for the freeze-thaw process.   2. Increased resistance to weathering: On the other hand, more solid rock can also mean that the rocks are denser or more resistant to weathering, which could slow down the rate at which the cracks expand and the rocks split. Now, let's consider which of the following perturbation types best fits the given scenario: - Directly impacting a step of the process: Since the presence of more solid rock can affect the availability of cracks and surfaces for water to enter and influence the rate of the freeze-thaw process, it can be considered as directly impacting a step of the process. Specifically, it might influence the first two steps: water getting into cracks in rocks and water freezing into ice. - Indirectly impacting a step of the process: While not directly a part of the process, the effect of more solid rock could also be considered as indirectly impacting weathering. If denser rock slows down the cracking process, it's an indirect factor shaping the rate at which weathering occurs. - Not impacting any step of the process: It's unlikely that more solid rock will not impact any step of the process at all, considering that density, resistance, and surface area of the rock play a role in weathering. Answer: Given the analysis above, the supposed perturbation on the process of weathering caused by an increase in solid rock would best be described as directly impacting a step of the process. However, in some cases, it might also indirectly impact weathering, depending on the resistance and composition of the rocks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The few remaining scientists work tirelessly to develop an antidote, but their efforts seem to be in vain. All hope seems lost until one day, two young scientists, Julia and Ryan, stumble upon the formula for a potential cure. Act 1: - The Black Spore has devastated countries and taken millions of lives. Governments have collapsed, and chaos reigns supreme. - The global scientific community is racing against time to find a cure. Two introverted and dedicated scientists, Julia and Ryan, are secretly researching the antidote in a hidden laboratory. - Julia and Ryan work together and start growing closer, as they share their grief and loss. They both lost their families to the pandemic and are hell-bent on finding the cure. - Amidst sleepless nights, old notes, and experimental algorithms, they discover a possible cure. Act 2: - Julia and Ryan, realizing they are not part of a government-sanctioned lab, decide to keep their discovery a secret and focus on creating the antidote. - They manage to develop only two vials of the antidote, as the essential ingredients are extremely rare and hard to acquire. - News of the antidote leaks out to a power-hungry warlord who wants to obtain it for himself to ensure his own survival and to control the remaining human population. - Julia and Ryan, who already tested the antidote on themselves and know its effectiveness, now face the challenge of protecting the antidote and finding a way to mass-produce it for the greater good. Act 3: - The warlord launches a full-scale attack on Julia and Ryan's hidden lab, intending to take the last two vials by force. - In the heat of the battle, Julia and Ryan manage to send a message to a secret network of resistance fighters who pledge to help them keep the antidote from falling into the wrong hands. - The climax of the story is a thrilling chase and showdown between the heroes and the warlord's forces, with Julia and Ryan doing everything they can to protect the last two vials. - Eventually, the warlord is defeated, and the evil plan is thwarted, but not without significant sacrifices from both Julia and Ryan. Conclusion: - With the defeat of the warlord, Julia and Ryan finally have the opportunity to work on mass-producing the antidote. - Thanks to their sacrifice and determination, the world starts to heal, and the remnants of humanity begin to rebuild their lives and the planet. - Julia and Ryan's love for each other grows stronger, and now their mission is to ensure the revival of human civilization. They vow to dedicate their lives to finding a way to create more of the antidote and give hope back to the world.

CB&L is for YOU!    My girlfriends and I were in dire need of some appetizers, and we happened to stumble past Caramel Bar & Lounge (and by stumble I don't mean in a drunken stupor, we weren't at that phase yet). So, we said hello to the host standing outside of the lounge as we read the appetizer list. Sounds good to us! So we walk in and get seated.  Nice place!  Total lounge feel, great ambiance.  That is, until our experience turned sour.  We asked for a couple items off their appetizer list and some water for two of us. We were then told that they aren't serving food as it was 9:17, just minutes after they stop cooking. Bummer.  How about removing the appetizer list placed outside that draws in the crowd?  So we disappointingly said water is fine, while we make our drink selection.    The waitress, who looked underaged and under-experienced, arrives back with two 11 oz bottles of Fiji water for each of us.  We then order our alcohol beverages - 2 vodka/redbulls and one jack/coke.  Check is given.... wait for it... waiiiiiit for it.... 71.00.  Whoa!  Really? We questioned it and assumed it had to be an error.  So the waitress checks on it and comes back to confirm it is in fact correct, that the waters were each 10 and the drinks averaged 18 a piece.   Wow. I might sound cheap, but 10 for a bottle that small should come with a happy ending of some sort.    I finished the water pretty quickly... in a gulp practically, since there wasn't much to begin with.  My girlfriend had hers down about 75%  while she sipped on her alcohol.  Suddenly one of the staff members picks it up from the table and threw her water bottle away, without asking if she was finished!!  He just threw away dollars that we had spent! We told him his error, he apologized and talked to his manager about getting a new one.  So 5 minutes later the waitress comes by with a BELLAGIO bottle of water that looked like it was meant for a 2 year old.  You know, what comes out of their faucets probably.  At this point we're thinking:  A) If Fiji isn't worth 10, neither is your faucet water B) If you had Bellagio water, why didn't you bring THAT the first time?!  Explaining that we weren't going to accept a substitute for water that they had thrown away at our expense,  she gets her manager who comes by, drops off a new bottle of Fiji water without saying a word and just leaves. No apology, nothing! How the HECK do you get in management being a complete d*** like that?! Please tell me, because if I treated my customers that way, I would have been fired yesterday!

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: More than half of all adult Americans say they don't want to get the H1N1 flu vaccine, according to a new national poll. The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Wednesday also indicates that the number of adults who have tried to get the vaccine but were turned away is higher than the number of adults who have gotten a swine flu shot. According to the poll, 55 percent of adults don't want to get the swine flu vaccine and don't plan to get a shot. Another one in five say they want to get inoculated but haven't taken any steps to do so; 14 percent want a shot and have tried to get it but have been unsuccessful. Just 7 percent have been inoculated for H1N1. Why are more than half of all Americans shunning the vaccine? \\"The perception that the vaccine has dangerous side effects is the top reason,\\" says CNN polling director Keating Holland. \\"Roughly half of those who don't want a swine flu shot say that the possibility of side effects is one reason why they don't plan to get the vaccine. That works out to 28 percent of the adult population who don't plan to get inoculated due to the risk of dangerous side effects.\\" So far officials of the National Institutes of Health say they've seen no serious side effects in clinical trials and that study subjects who have been immunized have generated a good response. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the vaccine for certain high-priority groups because they are more likely to have serious complications if they develop swine flu. These groups include: pregnant women; caregivers and household contacts of children younger than 6 months; everyone between the ages of 6 months and 24 years; and people ages 25 to 64 with existing health problems. Most frequently asked H1N1 questions. One in four American adults say they don't plan on getting a shot because they are not in a high-risk group, with 21 percent indicating they don't plan on getting vaccinated because they only go to a doctor when they are sick. Most of those respondents are men. What about the 14 percent who have unsuccessfully tried to get the vaccine? \\"Some say they don't know where to go. That works out to 4 percent of the total adult population who want to get inoculated but haven't been able to locate a medical facility that is giving swine flu shots,\\" Holland said. \\"A bigger group, 5 percent of the total population, say that they found a facility with the vaccine but were turned away because they were not in a high-risk group or for some other reason. And 3 percent of all adults say they found a facility that had the vaccine but it ran out before they got there.\\" Add together those last two groups, and the number of Americans who actively sought the vaccine but were turned away for some reason is 8 percent of the total adult population, roughly the same number as the 7 percent who have been inoculated so far. The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted November 13-15, with 1,014 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points. CNN deputy political director Paul Steinhauser and senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen contributed to this report. Highlights:","output":"1. A new national survey by CNN/Opinion Research Corporation shows that over half of the adult Americans (55%) do not wish to get the H1N1 flu vaccine.  2. The survey also found that a higher number of adults who attempted to get the vaccine were turned away than the number of adults who have received a swine flu shot. 3. Approximately 20% of adults want to get immunized but have not taken the necessary steps to do so, while 14% have tried but were unsuccessful in getting the shot.  4. The major reason behind the reluctance to get the vaccine is the fear of dangerous side effects, which accounted for roughly half of those who refuse to get the swine flu shot. This equates to about 28% of the adult population who are not preparing to get the vaccine due to the risk of side effects. 5. On the positive side, officials from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have reported no serious side effects from the vaccine in the clinical trials. 6. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the vaccine for high-risk groups, including pregnant women, caregivers and household contacts of children under six months of age, individuals aged between six months and 24 years, and those aged 25 to 64 with existing health problems. 7. One in four American adults say they don't intend on getting the vaccine as they don't belong to a high-risk group, with 21% opting out due to their practice of only visiting a doctor when ill, a sentiment mostly expressed by men. 8. Among the 14% who have tried to get a vaccine but were unsuccessful, 4% were unable to find a facility providing the swine flu shots while 3% unfortunately found a facility but the vaccine was exhausted before they got there. 9. Around 5% found a facility but were turned away for not being in a high-risk group or due to other reasons. Adding the last two groups makes it 8% of the total adult population who actively sought the vaccine but were turned away for some reason. 10.

The same is true if they have competitors you cannot easily understand. Any time that you're not able to decipher the purpose, mission or actions of a company (or those of its nearest competition), that should be a warning sign to you as an investor.  To think like Warren Buffet and make strategic investment decisions, it is vital to understand the importance of investing in fundamentally strong companies with transparent goals (Option IV). Companies that operate in industries with strong profit potential, possess a competitive edge, and exhibit clear and easily understandable business strategies are more likely to succeed in the long term, creating wealth for shareholders. On the other hand, it is crucial to avoid investments in industries with low profit margins, as these sectors may not provide sufficient returns to justify the risks associated with investing in them. Moreover, companies with opaque strategies and unclear goals may experience operational difficulties and financial instability, ultimately leading to poor investment performance. By avoiding such investments, investors can minimize potential losses and maximize returns on their portfolios. In order to adopt Warren Buffet's investment strategies, focus on the quality and business fundamentals of the companies you intend to invest in, rather than attempting to predict short-term market fluctuations. This long-term, value-oriented approach to investing has proven to be highly successful for Buffet, and it can serve as an excellent guide for individual investors seeking to emulate his success. In conclusion, to think like Warren Buffet, it is essential to invest in companies with transparent strategies and strong long-term prospects while avoiding those in low-profit industries or with unclear goals. This approach helps in making well-informed investment decisions that minimize risks and provide opportunities for significant returns over time."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Ethan saw the broccoli in the red_envelope, but he did not see Ella move it to the blue_treasure_chest. Ella knows Ethan's belief is outdated. So when asked where Ella thinks Ethan searches for the broccoli, I used scenario 3 and replied that Ella thinks Ethan searches in the red_envelope. 3. Grapes were in the blue_treasure_chest when Logan entered the sunroom. The question asked about the initial location of the grapes without considering any individual's beliefs. Therefore, I answered that the grapes were in the blue_treasure_chest at the beginning. 4. Ella exited the garage before the apple was moved from the blue_box to the green_drawer by Sophia. The question asks about the real location of the apple, disregarding beliefs. I used scenario 1 to reply that the apple is really in the green_drawer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What does Jesus mention in the New Testament?, using the article: Whales have also played a role in sacred texts such as the Bible. It mentions whales in Genesis 1:21, Job 7:12, and Ezekiel 32:2. The \\"leviathan\\" described at length in Job 41:1-34 is generally understood to refer to a whale. The \\"sea monsters\\" in Lamentations 4:3 have been taken by some to refer to marine mammals, in particular whales, although most modern versions use the word \\"jackals\\" instead. The story of Jonah being swallowed by a great fish is told both in the Qur'an and in the Bible. A medieval column capital sculpture depicting this was made in the 12th century in the abbey church in Mozac, France. The Old Testament contains the Book of Jonah and in the New Testament, Jesus mentions this story in Matthew 12:40.In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, 1585, and Francois, Duke of Anjou, 1582, were greeted on his ceremonial entry into the port city of Antwerp by floats including \\"Neptune and the Whale\\", indicating at least the city's dependence on the sea for its wealth.In 1896, an article in The Pall Mall Gazette popularised a practice of alternative medicine that probably began in the whaling town of Eden, Australia two or three years earlier. It was believed that climbing inside a whale carcass and remaining there for a few hours would relief symptoms of rheumatism.Whales continue to be prevalent in modern literature. For example, Herman Melville's Moby Dick features a \\"great white whale\\" as the main antagonist for Ahab, who eventually is killed by it. The whale is an albino sperm whale, considered by Melville to be the largest type of whale, and is partly based on the historically attested bull whale Mocha Dick. Rudyard Kipling's Just So Stories includes the story of \\"How the Whale got in his Throat\\". Niki Caro's film the Whale Rider has a Māori girl ride a whale in her journey to be a suitable heir to the chieftain-ship. Walt Disney's film Pinocchio features a giant whale named Monstro as the final antagonist.

This year his hometown suffered from snowstorms   for nearly a month. The heavy snow stopped cars and trains, broke the electricity   tower and turned tap water to ice. Every day Long Chuan had to walk several kilometers to carry drinking water. \\"I couldn't ride a bike and it took me 3 hours to walk to school. I can't remember how many times I slipped   on the hard ice, \\" said Long Chuan. Long is not alone. This year millions of people in central and southern China had a freezing winter without enough water and electricity. The biggest snowstorms in 50 years killed more than 100 people. They also cost the country 111.1 billion yuan. Experts   say a special type of climate condition  , La Nina, caused the storms. During a La Nina, the water in the Pacific Ocean   near the equator   becomes colder than usual. It changes the weather around the world.

Despite her anger at how his life has turned, by the middle of the picture, she really decides to accept this. She allows his friends to come in and suddenly it's all right to use the profanity as long as it's not in front of the children. This is a sad state of affairs regarding gangster rap. You knew where this film was heading. I literally laughed out loud when at the end, when Bassett is accompanying her son's body for burial, she states that while his life had been cut short at age 24, he had become a man. What man? He had been a convicted criminal, wrote the most atrocious rap music with constant vulgarity,and scorned society. That scene in the classroom where he tells a teacher that as a sanitation worker, he will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what goes on in our schools. The complete and utter lack of respect for the teacher. The east coast, west coast gang rap rivalry is never fully explained. All we see are guns blazing.

So, when you combine these two words, you get the Turkish translation of \\"His message was clear\\" as \\"Mesajı açıktı.\\" Turkish is an agglutinative language, which means that words are often formed by adding multiple affixes to a root word.

When he was gunning for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in Florida, the former speaker of the Florida House of Representatives aggressively courted the state's conservative Tea Party activists. That strategy worked. Rubio was suddenly a Tea Party favorite. His stunning rise in the polls forced Florida's more moderate governor, Charlie Crist, to bolt the GOP primary to run as an independent. But the race is now more complicated, with Rubio competing in a three-way battle royal against both Crist and the Democratic nominee, South Florida Rep. Kendrick Meek. \\"When you send a politician to OPTIONS: - CNN, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,\\" Wilkinson said. - Charlie Crist, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,\\" Wilkinson said. - Crist, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,\\" Wilkinson said. - Democratic, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,\\" Wilkinson said. - Florida, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,\\" Wilkinson said. - Florida House of Representatives, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,\\" Wilkinson said. - GOP, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,\\" Wilkinson said. - Kendrick Meek, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,\\" Wilkinson said. - Marco Rubio, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,\\" Wilkinson said. - Meek, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,\\" Wilkinson said. - Miami, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,\\" Wilkinson said. - Republican, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,\\" Wilkinson said. - Rubio, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,\\" Wilkinson said. - South Florida, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,\\" Wilkinson said. - Tea Party, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,\\" Wilkinson said. - Texas, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,\\" Wilkinson said. - U.S. Senate, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,\\" Wilkinson said. - Washington, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,\\" Wilkinson said.","output":"\\"When you send a politician to Washington, you're always worried whether you're going to get the same guy back,\\" Wilkinson said.

Despite his weakened technical mastery, his intellect and musical expression were still strong, and he continued to draw large audiences to his concerts. In Naples, Italy, in November 1956, just after the Soviets crushed the Hungarian uprising, as soon as he walked onto the stage the audience burst into wild applause and shouts of Viva l’Ungheria! (Italian for \\"Long live Hungary!\\"), delaying the concert for nearly fifteen minutes.In 1960 Szigeti officially retired from performing, and returned to Switzerland with his wife. There he devoted himself primarily to teaching, although he still traveled regularly to judge international violin competitions. Top-class students from all over Europe and the United States came to study under him. One of these students was Arnold Steinhardt, who spent the summer of 1962 with Szigeti. He came to the conclusion that \\"Joseph Szigeti was a template for the musician I would like to become: inquisitive, innovative, sensitive, feeling, informed\\".Toward the end of his life, Szigeti suffered from frail health. He was put on strict diets and had several stays in hospital, but his friends asserted that this did nothing to dampen his characteristic cheerfulness. He died in Lucerne, Switzerland on February 19, 1973, at the age of 80. The New York Times ran a front-page obituary that ended with this 1966 quote from violinist Yehudi Menuhin: We must be humbly grateful that the breed of cultured and chivalrous violin virtuosos, aristocrats as human beings and as musicians, has survived into our hostile age in the person of Joseph Szigeti. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who had weakened technical mastery?, what is it ?

Please answer the following question: Q: Some sea anemones establish what kind of relationship with hermit crabs by attaching to the crab’s shell?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  The mouth of a sea anemone is surrounded by tentacles that bear cnidocytes. The slit-like mouth opening and pharynx are lined by a groove called a siphonophore. The pharynx is the muscular part of the digestive system that serves to ingest as well as egest food, and may extend for up to two-thirds the length of the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity. This cavity is divided into several chambers by longitudinal septa called mesenteries. Each mesentery consists of one ectodermal and one endodermal cell layer with the mesoglea sandwiched in between. Mesenteries do not divide the gastrovascular cavity completely, and the smaller cavities coalesce at the pharyngeal opening. The adaptive benefit of the mesenteries appears to be an increase in surface area for absorption of nutrients and gas exchange. Sea anemones feed on small fish and shrimp, usually by immobilizing their prey using the cnidocytes. Some sea anemones establish a mutualistic relationship with hermit crabs by attaching to the crab’s shell. In this relationship, the anemone gets food particles from prey caught by the crab, and the crab is protected from the predators by the stinging cells of the anemone. Anemone fish, or clownfish, are able to live in the anemone since they are immune to the toxins contained within the nematocysts. Anthozoans remain polypoid throughout their lives and can reproduce asexually by budding or fragmentation, or sexually by producing gametes. Both gametes are produced by the polyp, which can fuse to give rise to a free-swimming planula larva. The larva settles on a suitable substratum and develops into a sessile polyp.

Screengrabs: Sky Sports The Decision Review System was again under the spotlight after the opening morning of the third Ashes Test at Emirates Old Trafford. Australia reached lunch at 92 for two but were left aggrieved after Usman Khawaja was given out by the third umpire, Kumar Dharmasena, caught behind off Graeme Swann. Khawaja almost immediately reviewed the decision by Tony Hill, the on-field umpire, to give him out and the Hot Spot technology appeared to back him up with no mark on the bat. Dharmasena saw differently though, upholding the on-field call after a lengthy delay, in a decision branded \\"shocking and ridiculous\\" by Shane Warne in the Sky commentary. \\"There was daylight between bat and ball, there was no Hot Spot and no noise,\\" the former Australia leg-spinner said. \\"The only noise was when the bat hit his pad. That's a shocker, that's an absolute shocking decision. You can see the bat hitting the pad, the ball goes past, no noise. There was clear evidence there as well. That is a ridiculous decision.\\" I've just sat down to watch the test. That was one of the worst cricket umpiring decisions I have ever seen. KRudd Kevin Rudd, the Australian prime minister, tweeted his reaction: \\"I've just sat down to watch the test. That was one of the worst cricket umpiring decisions I have ever seen.\\" The incident overshadowed Chris Rogers' progress to a career-best unbeaten 67, during which time the 35-year-old opener also passed 20,000 first-class runs. England were unable to make a breakthrough in the opening hour as Australia made chanceless progress to 47 without loss. After Michael Clarke elected to bat after winning the toss the England bowlers did find some early movement. Stuart Broad snaked the ball past Shane Watson's defences from consecutive deliveries while Rogers squirted a couple of boundaries away backward of point. Rogers was surprisingly the more fluid of the openers and produced the shot of the first hour when he pushed James Anderson through a vacant mid-off for four. England attempted to coerce an uncharacteristically circumspect Watson out of his shell with the opener loosely driving at a wide-ish Broad ball just short of point. As the opening stand passed 50 England skipper Alastair Cook swung Anderson around to the Statham End, but Rogers greeted the move with three fours from the over to reach his half-century from 49 balls. England got the breakthrough in the 17th over when Tim Bresnan found just enough seam movement to find Watson's edge as he pressed forward. Alastair Cook pouched the simple chance at first slip but the controversy of the morning soon followed. And people say you should Walk .... No chance when you get decisions like that.... #Ashes Khawaja played his part in his downfall, thrashing needlessly at a wide ball that turned further from Swann, but he appeared to have reason to feel aggrieved after the Hot Spot replay appeared to show he did not hit the ball. Dharmasena watched over the visual images more intently, however, before sending the batsmen on his way to prompt condemnation from not only Warne but also former England skipper Michael Vaughan, who tweeted: \\"And people say you should Walk … No chance when you get decisions like that … #Ashes\\".

Q:Information:  - The Demon Wars Saga is a series of seven novels written by R.A. Salvatore. The series is set in the world of Corona, principally in the kingdoms of Honce-the-Bear and Behren, and amongst the nomadic To-gai-ru. The Saga is separated into two trilogies bridged by a single book, \\"Mortalis\\". The saga has an accompanying roleplaying game, entitled \\"Demon Wars\\".  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - A fantasy world is a fictional universe created in fiction media, such as literature, film or games. Typical fantasy worlds involve magic or magical abilities, nonexistent technology and sometimes, either an historical or futuristic theme. Some worlds may be a parallel world tenuously connected to Earth via magical portals or items; a fictional Earth set in the remote past or future; or an entirely independent world set in another universe.  - A fictional universe is a self-consistent imaginary setting with events, and often other elements, that differ from the real world. It may also be called an imagined, constructed or fictional realm (or world). Fictional universes may appear in novels, comics, films, television shows, video games and other creative works.  - Corona is the name of the fantasy world in which R.A. Salvatore 's The DemonWars Saga and The Highwayman are set .    What is the relationship between 'corona ' and 'fictional universe'? A:","output":"The relationship between 'corona' and 'fictional universe' is that Corona is a specific example of a fictional universe. In this context, Corona is the imaginary world created by R.A.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem. Question: Why did the author say he wasn't a big fan of Vegas?

The island is well-known for its monastic history and religious significance dating back to the 6th century. Visitors to the island are often drawn by its natural beauty, idyllic sandy beaches, and the tranquility it offers, in addition to its religious sites. The religious community on Caldey Island was first established by Celtic monks in the 6th century. Owing to the Viking invasions, the monastery was abandoned for a short period in the late 10th century. With the Norman Conquest in the 11th century, the island’s monastery was reoccupied, and the foundation of an Augustinian priory was laid.  However, the best-known religious community on Caldey Island is the Cistercian Order, which arrived there in the early 20th century. The Cistercian monks constructed an impressive Italian-inspired monastery, known as the Caldey Abbey, in 1910. The present monastery on Caldey Island is home to a community of Silent Order Trappist monks with a vow of stability. They adhere to a life of monastic silence, work, and prayer. Apart from being a site of spiritual interest, Caldey Island is also renowned for its wildlife and natural beauty, making it a popular destination for tourists and day-trippers. Visitors to the island can appreciate its peaceful atmosphere, explore the monastery, visit the lighthouse, or simply take a relaxing stroll along the serene beaches. Additionally, Caldey Island is known for its unique flora and fauna, with the presence of rare species such as grey seals and seabirds. In summary, Caldey Island is a captivating destination lying off the coast of South Wales, opposite the beautiful town of Tenby.

Supply for the needs of the people leads to further pollution by industry. If the rapid increase of world population in countries continues at the present rate, there may be much greater harm to human beings. Some scientists speak of the increase in numbers of people as \\"population pollution.\\" About 2,000 years ago, the world population was probably about 250 million. It reached a billion in 1850. By 1930 the population was two billion. It is now three and a half billion. It is expected to double by the year 2,000. If the population continues to grow at the same rate, there will be 25 billion in the world a hundred years from now. Man has been using the earth's resources more and more rapidly over the past years. Some of them are almost used up.

Answer:","output":"Based on this single review stating that they can't login to their Yorku mail account, the recommendation would tend towards \\"Not at all\\" to \\"Maybe\\". Some reasons behind this decision include: 1. The reviewer appears to be having issues using the app, potentially due to an authentication issue. Their inability to access their YorkU mail account could reflect a problem with the app, and this holds true especially if the app is specifically designed for this purpose.  2. However, the review doesn't provide enough information to fully judge the app's overall functionality, reliability, or user-friendliness - we simply know one individual feature (log in to YorkU mail) isn't working as expected for this user.

It is a natural substance  produced by the human body, and it helps children's bones and muscles  to grow. Scientists are allowed to make the drug and it is also legal to take HGH in most countries. HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover  more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes. Scientists are developing a new test which will find the drug in the body for up to two weeks. But it isn't going to be easy. Everybody has different levels of natural HGH in their body. For this reason, scientists are warning athletes of the possible problems with the drug. Research shows that HGH increase the risk of cancer. But is this enough to stop athletes from taking it?

Court questions overturning of Marine conviction CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. – The military's highest court is questioning last year's ruling by an appeals court that threw out the murder conviction against a Camp Pendleton Marine in the killing of an unarmed Iraqi man. In a ruling late Tuesday, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces in Washington agreed there were errors at the trial of Sgt. Lawrence Hutchins III but they may not have been enough to overturn his conviction. Hutchins was released last June after the military appeals court ruled he had an unfair trial in 2007 because his lead defense attorney was let go three weeks before the start of his trial. Tuesday's ruling opens the possibility that his conviction could be reinstated. Hutchins spent four years in a military prison for the killing of a retired Iraqi policeman in 2006 in the village of Hamdania. Authorities say the 52-year-old man was dragged from his home and shot by Marines who then framed him as an insurgent. Six other Marines and a Navy corpsman were convicted or pleaded guilty in the killing. Hutchins' attorney, Capt. Babu Kaza, says the case against his client is without merit. He said he will file a motion asking the higher court to reconsider sending the case back to the lower court. If the conviction is reinstated, Kaza said they will appeal. Hutchins is currently stationed at Camp Pendleton, where he is not under any restrictions. After Tuesday's ruling, Hutchins sent an e-mail to his family telling them about the decision and telling them he was hopeful still that his conviction will not be reinstated. \\"I look at the last eight months as a blessing,\\" he said in the e-mail, made public by his defense attorney. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces is revisiting the case of Sgt.

Solve this problem.","output":"To solve the equation 116*c = 121*c + 41 - 16 for c, we will first simplify the equation and then isolate the variable c. Here's a step-by-step solution: Step 1: Simplify the equation. The given equation is: 116*c = 121*c + 41 - 16. We can simplify the right-hand side by subtracting 16 from 41: 116*c = 121*c + 25 Step 2: Move all the terms involving c to one side. Now, we will isolate c by moving all terms with c to one side of the equation. Let's subtract 116*c from both sides: 116*c - 116*c = 121*c - 116*c + 25 This simplifies to: 0 = 5*c + 25 Step 3: Isolate the variable c. Now, we want to isolate c. We will first get rid of the constant term '25' by subtracting 25 from both sides: 0 - 25 = 5*c + 25 - 25 -25 = 5*c Now, we'll divide both sides by 5 to completely isolate c: -25 / 5 = 5*c / 5 -5 = c The solution to the equation 116*c = 121*c + 41 - 16 is c = -5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - gliding  - hinge  - ball and socket  - pivot joint  A: Answer:","output":"The name of a joint in which one bone rotates in relation to another bone is the pivot joint. A pivot joint, also known as a rotary joint, permits rotation movements around a central axis. It is a type of synovial joint that allows for a wide range of motion while still providing stability and security to the skeletal structure. In a pivot joint, one bone has a cylindrical or circular region, called the pivot, that rotates within a ring-shaped structure formed by the other bone, along with a ligament or membrane. One of the most well-known examples of a pivot joint is the atlanto-axial joint, located between the atlas (C1) and axis (C2) vertebrae in the neck. This joint allows for the rotation of the head from side to side, as when gesturing \\"no\\" or shaking the head. Another example is the proximal radioulnar joint, which enables rotation of the radius around the ulna in the forearm, allowing the hand to be placed in positions such as pronation (palm down) and supination (palm up). In contrast, the other types of joints mentioned in the choices have different functions: 1) Gliding joints, also known as plane joints, allow bones to slide or glide past one another in various directions. This type of joint provides limited mobility and is found in areas such as the wrist, ankle, and certain joints of the spinal column (facet joints between vertebrae). 2) Hinge joints allow for movement in a single plane, similar to a door hinge. These joints consist of a convex surface of one bone fitting into the concave surface of another, permitting only flexion and extension. Examples of hinge joints include the elbow, knee, fingers, and toes. 3) Ball and socket joints possess the greatest range of motion and are characterized by a rounded, ball-like end of one bone fitting into the concave socket of another bone. These joints allow for movement in multiple planes, providing flexibility and stability, like the shoulder and hip joints. In conclusion, the pivot joint is the joint type in which one bone rotates in relation to another bone, allowing for rotation movements around a central axis. This joint type is essential for movements such as head rotation or hand positioning, and it distinguishes itself from gliding, hinge, and ball and socket joints by its unique structure and function."},{"instruction":"-  The virus finds an animal cell - The virus attaches to the cell's surface - The cell swallows the virus - The virus' RNA is released into the cell - The cell mistakenly reads the virus' RNA instead of its own - The cell creates new viruses - The animal cell releases the new viruses  What might be the last step of the process?

Write an article based on this summary: An Indian television journalist who reported on deadly floods while sitting on the shoulders of a survivor has been sacked, says the channel he worked for.","output":"Title: \\"Indian Television Journalist Sacked for Unprofessional Conduct Amidst Deadly Floods\\" A wave of controversy has crashed upon the world of Indian journalism, resulting in the dismissal of an erstwhile popular television reporter. This event followed a public outcry after the journalist reported on the devastating floods in the region while perched on the shoulders of a flood survivor. According to the news channel, this inappropriate conduct and lack of sensitivity led to his termination. To provide context, the incident came to light when the reporter's news segment covering the disastrous floods in the country aired. In the midst of the devastation, the reporter chose an unusual vantage point for his report, namely, the shoulders of a victim of the floods. This glaring unprofessionalism sparked widespread criticism from the public and media fraternity alike, leading to the necessary punitive action imposed by the channel. The decision to terminate the journalist was justified by the channel as a response to his insensitive and irresponsible actions, which showcased a stark absence of empathy towards the disaster victims. At a time when humanity grapples with nature's wrath, it is the duty of every reporter to cover the situation professionally and ethically. It is press ethics to ensure that the dignity and respect of disaster victims are held high, which the sacked reporter seemingly overlooked. In his defense, the journalist claimed to be providing viewers a clear picture of the deluge's severity. However, his argument was overshadowed due to his lack of professional conduct. It became a question not only of professional guidelines but also moral values. The journalist's modus operandi raised serious questions about his empathy towards the victims, teetering on the edge of objectifying the victim for the sake of news. This incident brings to light the need for ethical journalism. Reporters must endeavor to deliver accurate and vital information, without losing sight of their social responsibilities. The individuals who bear the brunt of unforeseen tragedies like floods require empathy and understanding, not to be used as mere columns for aiding news reports.  The channel's decision to sack the reporter signifies the gravity of professional and ethical violations. Ethics and professionalism must be the guiding principles of journalism and this incident serves as a stern reminder of it. This sacking emphasizes the industry's commitment to uphold these standards, as well as the penalties that ensue for those who cross these boundaries. In conclusion, the path of journalism is paved with responsibility and respect towards every individual's story. Reporters must remember to conduct their tasks without losing sight of their empathy for the subjects they deal with. The ethical lapse of the sacked journalist serves as a call to all journalists. It stands as a stark reminder of the importance of treating all individuals with respect and dignity, particularly in times of disaster when humanity should stand united. End Note: The unfortunate incident serves as a compelling lesson for all in the realm of journalism. Balance between the audacity of investigative journalism and sensitivity towards subjects, often victims, is quintessential. Journalism should always stand close to its moral compass, delivering the truth without compromising the dignity of its subjects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Analysis: Statement 1 is saying that fish, in general, hatch into a form that is different from their adult form. Statement 2, however, states that some species hatch already in their adult form, while others have tails when they hatch. It partially contradicts Statement 1 because it says that some species hatch already in their adult form.

I have a new situation: Stan moved from the US to Australia, and he still gets confused because of the seasons in the southern hemisphere and the fact that they use the same calendar as the rest of the world.  But I can use this background: During May, June, and July, the Northern Hemisphere is exposed to more direct sunlight because the hemisphere faces the Sun. The same is true of the Southern Hemisphere in November, December, and January. It is Earth's axial tilt that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months, which increases the solar flux. However, due to seasonal lag, June, July, and August are the warmest months in the Northern Hemisphere while December, January, and February are the warmest months in the Southern Hemisphere.  What is an answer for this question: Which month is colder in the northern hemisphere, July or January?

Options: a ) 60 km , b ) 87 km , c ) 33 km , d ) 67 km , e ) 20 km Student:","output":"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance between A and B (let's call it D). We know the rowing speed in still water, the time taken to row from A to B and back, and the speed of the stream. We can use this information to find the distance. First, let's find the effective rowing speed downstream (with the stream) and upstream (against the stream). Downstream speed = rowing speed + stream speed = 9 kmph + 1 kmph = 10 kmph Upstream speed = rowing speed - stream speed = 9 kmph - 1 kmph = 8 kmph Let t1 be the time taken to row downstream (from A to B) and t2 be the time taken to row upstream (from B to A). We know that: t1 + t2 = 7.5 hours We can express time as the ratio of distance to speed: t1 = D / 10 (downstream) t2 = D / 8 (upstream) Now let's plug these expressions into the equation above: D / 10 + D / 8 = 7.5 To solve for D, first combine the terms on the left side: (8D + 10D) / 80 = 7.5 Now solve for D: 18D / 80 = 7.5 18D = 7.5 * 80 18D = 600 D = 600 / 18 D = 33.3333 Since this is a multiple-choice question, we can see that the closest option to our answer is 33 km.

For instructions on disconnecting the battery, see How to Disconnect a Car Battery. Be careful to remove all screws before trying to pry off the trim or you may break it. For some cars, you may need to remove several pieces of plastic trim, usually working from the bottom up.  If you need to remove trim that includes any knobs or drawers, remove them before trying to pry off the trim. Use your hands or a pry tool to pry off each piece of trim. Pry tools are specifically for this purpose and will not damage the trim pieces. If you need to remove any components before being able to access the stereo, do so. Disconnect components that are wired to the car. Take a picture of how each is wired for later reference. Different cars may have varying elements securing the stereo in place.  If the stereo is held in place by screws or nuts, loosen them with the appropriate tool (screwdriver or nutdriver, respectively). If the stereo isn't held in place by screws or nuts, you'll need to use a radio-removal key. This tool is commonly necessary in Ford vehicles. Radio-removal keys (sometimes also referred to as radio-removal tools) will typically either be in an elongated horseshoe shape or will have a circular shape at one end and a notched shaft at the other. They’re available at most auto-parts stores. Insert the keys into the two small slots in the face of the stereo. You will release a mechanism holding the stereo in place. Slide the radio-removal keys into each slot again until you feel the stereo loosen from in its housing. You should then be able to pull out the stereo relatively easily. You may want to use needle-nose pliers to grip the edge of the stereo and help you pull it out. Pull it gently, and if the stereo doesn't come out easily, double check that you haven't missed any components that may be holding it in place. This is an important step because the photo will serve as a reference later when you’re wiring in the new stereo. You’ll see a series of wires connected to the back of the stereo, and you’ll need to disconnect each of them.  First unplug the antenna wire, which will typically be a thicker wire plugged in separately from the rest. Once it’s unplugged, you should be able to move the stereo around more freely. Next unplug the each of the wire harness connectors. There will typically be several of these and you can recognize them because a series of wires will feed into each one. The plastic piece into which the wires are fed should have either a tab or a button you can push, which will release the harness.

The Wildhearts next planned a double album, but East West vetoed this plan during the recording sessions. Instead the band released a collection of six of the more eclectic tracks on a fan club-only release entitled Fishing For Luckies in early 1995. This EP, which would be re-released in 1996 with more studio outtakes as Fishing for More Luckies, included the notable track \\"Geordie In Wonderland\\". Ginger offered this track to Kevin Keegan and Newcastle United F.C. as a potential team anthem, but was graciously turned down. The track was performed on Top of the Pops with Wolfsbane's Jeff Hateley, painted in Toon Army colours, on mandolin. Other noteworthy tracks included \\"If Life Is Like A Lovebank, I Want An Overdraft\\", also released as a single, and the 11:24 epic \\"Sky Babies.\\" Despite frequent fan requests, this track was rarely performed live, reputedly because of Danny McCormack's inability to remember his bass parts throughout the entire song. In 2003-2004 the band began to play \\"Sky Babies\\" at nearly every show with new bassist Jon Poole.  The second album proper was to be known as P.H.U.Q.. Midway through the recording sessions, Ginger (in a move he later claimed to regret) fired guitarist CJ, and some of the album's tracks were recorded without a second guitarist. P.H.U.Q. was released in May 1995 and reached #6 in the British charts, making it the band's most successful album. Shortly after the album's release, Mark Keds of Senseless Things was drafted as second guitarist, but lasted just one recording session, in which he appeared on the B-sides for the single \\"Just in Lust\\". Within a few weeks Keds was sacked after disappearing to Japan for a farewell tour with his old band. The Wildhearts were again down to a three-piece (Ginger, McCormack, and Battersby) for a few months, and performed a few gigs in this incarnation. The band resolved to return to a two-guitar formation, and after requesting demos and holding auditions, hired the previously unknown Jef Streatfield.  By late 1995 the band were finally fed up with their record label and set out to tour Japan and the UK, determined that they would split up unless East West would release them from their contract.

The movie supposedly caused quite a stir among the critics in Cannes, but for me the final scene was just a pathetic attempt for a newbie director to get himself noticed. Hardly a voice in the discussion on the issue of violence, drug abuse or juvenile delinquency (or any other issue, for that matter). The main character's metamorphosis from good, but troubled boy to the vicious rapist is virtually nonexistent, whereas the rape scene (being an over-dragged, exaggerated version of the rape scene from \\"A clockwork orange\\") is unbearable and I refuse to comment on its aesthetic values.

The reviewer is critical of the film, both in its portrayal of its main character and the disturbing content, like the graphically depicted rape scene. They accused the director of using shock tactics, rather than meaningful storytelling or character development, to attract critical attention and provoke reactions. Moreover, they also wanted to see more nuanced commentary on the topics of violence, drug abuse, and juvenile delinquency instead of such pointedly graphic depictions.

The original cost price of the car can be calculated by reversing the two percent changes. The friend sold the car for Rs. 54000, which represents a 20% gain. Therefore, 54000 represents 120% of the man's selling price. Divide 54000 by 1.2 to get the man's selling price, which is Rs. 45000. This represents 86% of the original cost price because the man made a 14% loss. Therefore, to find the original cost price, divide 45000 by 0.86 and the original cost price is Rs. 52325.58.

Article: Seven years of careful design and planning all came together on Monday, when James Cameron became the first human to make a solo trip to the deepest known point on earth - the Challenger Deep! More importantly though, he appeared safely seven hours later, completing with exciting-photos and videos from this dark mysterious world that has been visited by only two humans before! Seated inside a specially built 12-ton green submersible   called the Deep Sea Challenger,  the brilliant filmmaker caught every moment of his 2-hour-36-minute journey down to the bottom of the Mariana Trench on video -- given that it is 120 times larger than the Grand Canyon and a mile deeper than Mount Everest.        Absolutely nothing! There were no large alien creatures or mysterious footprints -- just a flat desolate   landscape, 50 times larger than the Grand Canyon.  Mr. Cameron describes it as \\"devoid   of sunlight, any heat, any warmth\\". The only things swimming around, were some tiny shrimp-like   creatures no bigger than an inch.      While the 57-year-old had expected to spend six hours at the bottom, he was forced to return in three hours, because the robotic arm that was supposed to help him collect samples went wrong and began leaking oil. He also lost some thrusters    and a whole starboard side,  causing the submersible to spin around in circles.                      However, these small setbacks did not make the whole trip any less exciting for Mr. Cameron. The director, who returned to the surface in a speedy seventy minutes, believes this is just one of many trips he and other adventurers will be taking. In fact, Sir Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin Group, is currently in the midst of planning a similar trip to the Puerto Rico Trench that lies five miles below the surface of the water.  Though Mr. Cameron's is promising to move his historic trip into an exciting 3-D National Geographic documentary, he is tight-lipped about how the experience will be used in his next movie!  We cannot wait to see! Question: On the bottom of Challenger Deep,   _  .

Context: Reaching high levels of professional and financial success at any cost has been the modern-day Mecca to multitudes of business men and women for several decades. Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.” Question: Why will stress be detrimental to a person?

Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Where does digestion begin and end?\\" is \\"Begins in esophagus and ends in small intestine\\"?","output":"No, the statement is incorrect according to the information provided in the paragraph. Digestion actually begins in the mouth, not the esophagus, where food is mechanically broken down into smaller pieces by chewing and chemically broken down by enzymes present in saliva. The mouth is the initial part of the digestive system where the process of digestion starts; therefore, we say digestion begins in the mouth. Digestion does not end in the small intestine either. While it's true that most of the chemical digestion and nearly all the absorption of nutrients occur in the small intestine, the process doesn't end there. The remaining undigested food material goes into the large intestine or colon. Here the main role is to absorb water from the remaining indigestible food matter, accept and store the remaining waste, and finally, excrete it through the rectum and anus, which is the end-point of the digestive system. So, the correct answer to the question \\"Where does digestion begin and end?\\" should be \\"Begins in the mouth and ends in the rectum/anus\\". The rectum and anus represent the final stages of digestion and elimination, thus marking the end of the digestive process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They stated that only about a third of black Harvard undergraduates were from families in which all four grandparents were born into the African American community. The majority of black students at Harvard were Caribbean and African immigrants or their children, with some others the mixed-race children of biracial couples.

At work, he has to endure torment from his boss Thomas Dunwitty, a tactless, boorish white man. Not only does Dunwitty use AAVE, and use the word \\"nigger\\" repeatedly in conversations, he also proudly proclaims that he is more black than Delacroix and that he can use nigger since he is married to a black woman and has two mixed-race children. Dunwitty frequently rejects Delacroix's scripts for television series that portray black people in positive, intelligent scenarios, dismissing them as \\"Cosby clones\\". In an effort to escape his contract through being fired, Delacroix develops a minstrel show with the help of his personal assistant Sloane Hopkins. Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show features black actors in blackface, extremely racist jokes and puns, and offensively stereotyped CGI-animated cartoons that caricature the leading stars of the new show. Delacroix and Hopkins recruit two impoverished street performers â Manray, named after American artist Man Ray, and Womack â to star in the show. While Womack is horrified when Delacroix tells him details about the show, Manray sees it as his big chance to become rich and famous for his tap-dancing skills. To Delacroix's horror, not only does Dunwitty enthusiastically endorse the show, it also becomes hugely successful. As soon as the show premieres, Manray and Womack become big stars, while Delacroix, contrary to his original stated intent, defends the show as being satirical. Delacroix quickly embraces the show, his newfound fame and awards while Hopkins becomes horrified at the racist nightmare she has helped to unleash.

Summarize the following: When water evaporates, it leaves the salt behind in your tank and it will increase your salinity. Use fresh distilled water that has been heated to the temperature of your aquarium to replace any lost water. Mark the tank at the top where the water level should be so you know how much water to add back in. Water needs to be changed and replaced every 2 weeks to remove filth and chemicals. Use a water siphon to remove 20% of the water from your tank and replace it with the same amount of heated saltwater. Alternatively, clean the tank weekly by removing 10% of the water once per week. When you’re mixing saltwater for a water change, make sure your solution has the same salinity as your tank. A stronger or weaker solution will raise or lower your tank’s salinity respectively. Mix and heat a saltwater solution 1 day before you perform a water change on your tank. Over time, salt deposits will form on the sides of your tank. The salt is removed from your water and will lower your salinity. Add a saltwater solution to your tank to raise the salinity back to the levels you need for your tank.","output":"Water evaporation in an aquarium results in increased salinity levels due to the salt being left behind. To maintain a healthy environment for the aquatic life, it's essential to regularly monitor and adjust the salinity as needed. One way to do this is by using heated, distilled water that matches your aquarium's temperature to replace the evaporated water. Marking the desired water level on your tank can help ensure that you accurately replenish the water. In addition to replacing the evaporated water, it's crucial to change and replace a portion of the water in your tank to eliminate accumulated filth and chemicals. This process should be carried out every two weeks by using a water siphon to remove about 20% of the water, then adding an equal amount of heated saltwater. Alternatively, you can choose to perform weekly water changes by removing 10% of the water each time. When preparing the saltwater solution, it's important to match the salinity of your tank, as solutions with higher or lower salinity will affect the overall salinity levels in the tank. Preparing the saltwater mixture a day in advance of the water change allows for adequate mixing and heating, ensuring a stable environment for your aquatic life. Over time, it's normal for salt deposits to form on the sides of the tank. These deposits are a result of the salt being removed from the water, which leads to decreased salinity levels. To counteract this effect, a saltwater solution should be added to the tank to balance the salinity back to ideal levels for the aquatic residents. In summary, maintaining proper salinity levels in an aquarium is crucial for the health and well-being of its inhabitants. This can be achieved by regularly monitoring and adjusting the water content through the use of distilled water, frequent water changes, and carefully prepared saltwater solutions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which group of larvae had fewer germline mutations?  The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't.  Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.","output":"Based on the provided paragraph and information, the group of larvae with fewer germline mutations would be Group D, as it did not display the various mutations that were found in Group L.

Pain can be physical or emotional, and humans typically seek comfort and well-being in order to maintain a balanced life. A detailed explanation of each option is provided below: A. Suffer Pain: As mentioned above, people try to avoid pain because it causes discomfort and distress, which is not desirable. Pain can act as an alert sign that something is wrong in our body, or it can result from external injuries and stressors. In any case, it is a natural human instinct to avoid pain. B. Talk to each other: While some people may be introverted or shy and avoid social interactions, talking to each other is an essential part of human socialization and communication. In general, people do not actively try to avoid talking to one another. However, it might be context-dependent, as some might avoid confrontation or emotionally charged conversations. C. Believe in God: Belief in God or a higher power varies from person to person, and it is often influenced by cultural, religious, and personal factors. Some people firmly believe in God, while others do not. It is not accurate to say that people, in general, try to avoid believing in God, as it is an individual preference based on faith and personal experiences. D. Bank Money: People do not typically try to avoid banking money. On the contrary, most individuals rely on banks and other financial institutions to save, invest, and manage their money. The trust in these institutions allows people to feel safe and secure with their finances. However, some people might avoid banks due to mistrust, skepticism, or a lack of access to banking services. E. Wait in Line: Waiting in line is a common inconvenience that people generally dislike but cannot always avoid. In many situations, waiting in line is necessary for a variety of services or activities. While people may prefer not to wait in line, doing so is often unavoidable in day-to-day life.

Article:North Ayrshire Council hopes the scheme will help youngsters who are entitled to free school meals during termtime. This is the first time a Scottish council has made a move of quite this nature and scale to help families on low incomes over the school holidays. Child poverty campaigners claim some parents struggle to feed their children properly when schools are shut. Across Scotland more than 250,000 children - including all children in P1-3 - are entitled to free school dinners. In many respects free meals are like a benefit to low income families - except they are not available for several weeks every year. North Ayrshire Council is opening 10 primary schools most days during the holidays for out of school activities. Children from 24 schools are eligible to attend. The scheme is open to all children - some parents may need childcare, other children may want to be with their friends and enjoy the holiday activities. But for parents of children entitled to free meals there is an important service - free meals in the holidays. Other children pay Â£2 for a meal. Council leader William Gibson hopes the scheme will be a real help to families on low incomes. It began two years ago but has been rolled out to primary schools across the area. About 1,200 meals are now being served every week to children - many of them for free. The council meets the cost itself. The vast bulk of Scottish councils have no similar schemes although East Renfrewshire has run \\"summer camps\\"  which include free meals for eligible children at two of its schools for several years. Renfrewshire Council also has schemes to help children who get free meals over the holidays. Anti poverty campaigners say there is a real problem with \\"holiday hunger\\". The group Children in Scotland claims food banks and community projects are reporting increases in families seeking food for their children in non-term time. Children in Scotland Chief Executive Jackie Brock said: \\"Scotland has gone a long way to address hunger for young children during term-time, but we now need to focus on how we can support families during holidays when pressures are most intense. \\"Poorer families will find feeding their children, and finding childcare and holiday activities, very difficult and stressful. We must do more to support them. \\"Scotland has policies in place on food and wellbeing, as well as Curriculum for Excellence, that make us well-placed to make a change. \\"Alongside a coordinated and strategic response to poverty and hunger, we need to look to sustainably funded projects at a local authority or community level that can offer meals out with term-time.\\" Children in Scotland is currently developing a Families, Food, Futures programme across three council areas. It will target schools to offer a free and nutritious meal as part of a wider range of activities for children and their families. The programme will be based in schools with high deprivation levels but provision will be available to all in the school. A summary of the above article is?","output":"North Ayrshire Council in Scotland has implemented a scheme to provide free meals to low-income families during school holidays.

AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.  - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments.  - Branimir ( Latin : Brannimero ) was a ruler of the Duchy of Croatia who reigned as duke ( knez ) from 879 to 892 . His country received papal recognition as a state from Pope John VIII on 7 June 879 . During his reign , Croatia retained its sovereignty from both Frankish and Byzantine rule and became de jure independent .  - In ecclesiastical heraldry, papal coats of arms (those of individual popes) and those of the Holy See and Vatican City State include an image of crossed keys to represent the metaphorical keys of the office of Saint Peter, the keys of heaven, or the keys of the kingdom of Heaven, that, according to Roman Catholic teaching, Jesus promised to Saint Peter, empowering him to take binding actions. In the Gospel of Matthew , Jesus says to Peter, \\"I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" The keys of heaven or keys of Saint Peter are seen as a symbol of papal authority: \\"Behold he [Peter] received the keys of the kingdom of heaven, the power of binding and loosing is committed to him, the care of the whole Church and its government is given to him [cura ei totius Ecclesiae et principatus committitur (Epist., lib. V, ep. xx, in P.L., LXXVII, 745)]\\".  - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.

Context: The painters of the early Renaissance used two traditional lake pigments, made from mixing dye with either chalk or alum, kermes lake, made from kermes insects, and madder lake, made from the rubia tinctorum plant. With the arrival of cochineal, they had a third, carmine, which made a very fine crimson, though it had a tendency to change color if not used carefully. It was used by almost all the great painters of the 15th and 16th centuries, including Rembrandt, Vermeer, Rubens, Anthony van Dyck, Diego Velázquez and Tintoretto.

For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor. He then called my OB and told him he thought I’d had a stroke. My OB immediately expressed his doubt but my husband was advised to call an ambulance to get me to the ER. I never really experienced pain from the stroke.

Summarize: The Conservative peer, now chairman of the In Campaign, said the UK was \\"stronger in Europe\\" and to leave the EU would be a \\"leap into the unknown\\". It comes after a group of Conservative, Labour and UKIP MPs launched a campaign to take the UK out of the EU on Friday. David Cameron has promised a referendum on the issue by the end of 2017. The prime minister held talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel at Chequers on Friday, in which he stressed he wanted to \\"secure reforms and then keep the United Kingdom in a reformed EU\\". A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Cameron had noted the talks were \\"progressing well\\" but there was still \\"much to be worked through in order to find a solution\\". Lord Rose's appointment comes as a review of the \\"costs and benefits\\" of the UK's membership of the EU, to be conducted by the Treasury Select Committee, was announced. Stuart Rose and M&S: A 'beautiful friendship' The In Campaign - which officially launches its bid on Monday - said Lord Rose would take up the position with immediate effect. Lord Rose said leaving the EU \\"risked\\" Britain's prosperity. \\"The choice in the coming referendum is between remaining stronger, safer and better off inside Europe, or taking a leap into the unknown, risking our prosperity, threatening our safety, and diminishing our influence in the world,\\" he said. BBC political correspondent Robin Brant said the language used by Lord Rose was reminiscent of the successful Better Together campaign during last year's referendum on Scottish independence. The campaign could play on \\"the fear factor\\" of the UK leaving the EU, said our correspondent, adding: \\"He [Lord Rose] talks about a 'hard-headed practical decision', the UK being 'safer and stronger'. \\"But also he talks about 'a leap into the unknown', and I think that is something that is similar to the message that came from the 'No' campaign.\\" A guide to the EU referendum In or out? The arguments for and against What do big businesses say on the issue? EU referendum: What will happen when? What Britain wants from Europe Will Straw, executive director of the In Campaign, said Lord Rose brought \\"unparalleled experience of business and enterprise\\". \\"He knows the value that Britain's membership of the EU brings to businesses right across the UK, and what would be at risk if we left,\\" he said. Vote Leave, made up of Conservative, Labour and UKIP MPs and donors, launched its campaign on Friday. Supporters of the campaign, which says it wants to negotiate a new deal based on free trade and friendly co-operation, include Labour's Kate Hoey and UKIP's Douglas Carswell. It is competing with a rival group - the UKIP-backed Leave.EU - to be the official campaign to leave the EU. The Electoral Commission has yet to designate the official campaigns on either side of the EU debate. The chosen groups will benefit from increased spending limits of Â£7m during the campaign period, campaign broadcasts, and a free mailout to households. They all get access to public meeting rooms and to the electoral register, and are entitled to public grants of up to Â£600,000. The Electoral Commission has recommended voters in the election are asked whether the UK should \\"remain in\\" or \\"leave\\" the EU, rather than being asked to answer a \\"yes or no\\" question. The government has tabled an amendment to the bill. Summary:","output":"A man named Lord Rose, who is the chairman of the In Campaign, said that the UK is stronger when it is a part of Europe and leaving would be a big, uncertain step. Some people from different groups of politicians want the UK to leave Europe.

Q:Process:  - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more magma to cool happens, how will it affect less pressure is created.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"To analyze the perturbation hypothesis, let's break down the steps of the volcanic process and evaluate the effect of the proposed change: 1. Gases cause pressure beneath the earth. 2. The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface. 3. The magma cools. 4. With enough time, the pressure builds up greatly. 5. The resulting volcano may explode. Perturbation hypothesis: Suppose more magma cools. How will this affect the system if less pressure is created? To evaluate this, let's consider the impact on each individual step. Step 1: Gases cause pressure beneath the earth. - The perturbation does not appear to have a direct effect on this step, as the hypothesis pertains to magma cooling and not the generation of gases that cause pressure. Step 2: The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface. - If more magma cools, it might indirectly affect this step by altering the amount of molten magma available to be pushed to the surface. However, the hypothesis states that less pressure is created, which could result in less magma being pushed to the surface. Step 3: The magma cools. - The perturbation has a direct effect on this step, as it hypothesizes an increase in the rate of magma cooling. Step 4: With enough time, the pressure builds up greatly. - The perturbation has a direct effect on this step, as it implies that less pressure will be created. If less pressure is created, it will take more time for the pressure to build up significantly. Step 5: The resulting volcano may explode. - The perturbation has an indirect effect on this step. With more magma cooling and less pressure being created, the likelihood of a volcanic explosion might be reduced, as explosions typically occur when pressure builds up to a critical point. However, the extent of this effect depends on other factors such as the rate of gas generation and the specific geological conditions present. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation involving more magma cooling and less pressure created does have direct and indirect effects on the volcanic process. It primarily affects the magma cooling rate and time for pressure to build up significantly, which can in turn influence the likelihood of a volcanic explosion. However, the extent of these impacts would depend on various geological factors and the overall rate of changes in pressure and magma cooling."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: During 1964, in the months following World War III, the conflict has devastated the Northern Hemisphere, polluting the atmosphere with nuclear fallout, killing all life there. Air currents are slowly carrying the fallout south; the only areas still habitable are in the far reaches of the Southern Hemisphere. From Australia, survivors detect an incomprehensible Morse code signal coming from the West Coast of the United States. The last American nuclear submarine, USS Sawfish, under Royal Australian Navy command, is ordered to sail north to the United States to attempt to make contact with the sender of the Morse signal. The submarine is commanded by Captain Dwight Towers (Gregory Peck), who must leave his new friend, the alcoholic Moira Davidson (Ava Gardner). The Australian government arranges for its citizens to receive suicide pills or prepared injections so they may end things quickly before there is prolonged suffering from radiation sickness. An Australian naval officer, Peter Holmes (Anthony Perkins) and his wife, Mary, who is in denial about the impending disaster, have a baby daughter. Assigned to travel with the American sub for several weeks, Peter tries to explain to Mary how to euthanize their baby and then kill herself in case he is not yet home when the end comes; Mary reacts very emotionally at the prospect of killing her daughter and herself. One scientist's theory is that the radiation level near the Arctic Ocean could be lower than that found at the mid-Northern Hemisphere, which might indicate the radiation could disperse before reaching the Southern Hemisphere. The theory is to be explored along with the submarine's main mission. After sailing to Point Barrow, Alaska, they determine that radiation levels are, on the contrary, intensifying. The next day, the Sawfish arrives in the San Francisco Bay Area, just off San Francisco. Through the periscope, Captain Towers sees that while the city has escaped nuclear annihilation due to anti-missile defenses during the war, there appears to be no...

Living Las Vegas: Sun Belt cities offer new take on race The Shops at Summerlin, left, under construction, and the Red Rock Casino, right, in Las Vegas, east of the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area.Ethan Miller/Getty Images LAS VEGAS â Andrew Spivakâs academic research comes to life every time he drives by the school bus stop on Sunset Road and Durango Drive near his new home on the cityâs west side. âI have never lived some place that was so diverse,â said Spivak, a sociology professor at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. âProbably half the kids are black or Hispanic. Thatâs nothing that Iâd experienced, especially when I lived in New England and Oklahoma.â People of different races and ethnicities are more likely to live side by side in the fastest-growing parts of the Sun Belt âÂ areas that are constantly sprouting housing developments on desert or farm land without the pre-civil-rights legacy of segregation still ingrained in many older cities in the Northeast and Midwest. These new subdivisions and master-planned communities âÂ all built after the Fair Housing Act of 1968 âÂ have no history of racial separation. They didnât start out as white or black because no one lived there before. As a result, they offer a clean slate of opportunity to anyone who can afford to live where they want to live and a glimmer of a postracial society. Research, including Spivakâs, shows that among the largest metropolitan areas, Las Vegas and other booming areas, such as Riverside, Calif., and Phoenix, have the lowest levels of black segregation from other groups. Nationwide, residential segregation has consistently declined since 1980, and the 10 least segregated metro areas all grew faster than the national average of 11 percent from 2000 to 2010, according to Kelvin Pollard, a demographer at the Population Reference Bureau. By contrast, some of the most segregated (Detroit, New Orleans and Milwaukee) lost population. âThe ghettos of the Northeast and Midwest are not being reconstituted in the fast-growing areas of the South and West,â said demographer John Iceland, head of the sociology department at Penn State. The most striking reason for the lower rate of segregation is that most of these newer places have few remnants of a pre-civil-rights society and fewer established racial enclaves. When a suburb or neighborhood gets a reputation for not being welcoming to blacks or other minorities, the perception can linger for decades, and it has in many older cities. But not so in much of the Sun Belt. The rapid growth brought on by a constant influx of newcomers from all parts of the U.S. and the world has shattered the vestiges of racial separation so deeply rooted elsewhere.Â Younger migrants are less likely to harbor discriminatory attitudes and are more likely to be in mixed-race relationships. The most striking reason for the lower rate of segregation is that most of these newer places have few remnants of a pre-civil-rights society and fewer established racial enclaves. Cassandra Smith, an African-American agent with Realty One Group, estimates half her clients are black. But black or white, most of the newcomers who are house hunting care about the same things: safety, schools and services.Â âMost of them are educated and working,â she said. And because housing is cheaper here, they can afford to buy in more upscale subdivisions. Everyone sets their sights on Summerlin, an affluent sprawling master-planned development west of the city where a brand-new, four-bedroom, two-bath home can be had for less than 350,000 and where schools are top-notch. Homes are about half the price of a three-bedroom, 50-year-old, ranch-style home in middle-class areas of Los Angelesâ San Fernando Valley. If Summerlin is too expensive, they may settle north or south or just east, an area often referred to locally as Not Quite Summerlin. Thatâs where Derek Duncan, 37, lives âÂ on a cul-de-sac that presents the ultimate in diversity, with homes for less than 200,000. Duncan, who works in sales for lighting supplier DecoLights, is black and Italian. His wife is white. His stepson is a quarter Puerto Rican, and his half-brother is black. The neighbors? Two families are Hispanic, one is white, one is mixed-race Hawaiian, and one is Filipino. Occupations? A musician, a casino worker, a tow truck company operator, a retiree.Â âMy neighborhood is a complete mixed bag,â Duncan said. His memories of living in Boston as a kid are very different.Â âMy family was from a black area of Dorchester, and everyone was â¦ black or Jamaican,â he said. âJust down the street, across two major streets, you had one neighborhood that was primarily Hispanic and then one that was primarily white. My dad lived in South Boston, where it was primarily Irish. The school I went to was primarily black.â But Duncan is well aware of Las Vegasâ history of segregation. His mother, Katherine Duncan, founded the Westsideâs Ward 5 Chamber of Commerce.Â In the time of segregation, blacks were pushed to the west side of what is now I-15, a line they crossed only to go to work as maids and servers in the glitzy hotels and casinos on the Strip. The area was dubbed the Black Strip and eventually, just Westside. âEven that community is far more diverse than it used to be,â Smith said, driving past the boarded-up apartments that housed hotel workers. On West Bonanza Road, she points to the dilapidated remains of the Moulin Rouge, billed as the first interracial casino resort when it opened in 1955. (Boxer Joe Louis was the only black owner.) The resort mysteriously shut down after a few months. The casino was gutted by a fire, and the hotel is just a shell, but it remains Las Vegasâ best-known black symbol. Smith is a Las Vegas native; her parents moved from the Deep South, as many blacks did over the decades, to work in the flourishing hotels and casinos. Her mother was a hotel maid, and her father helped set up trade shows. They settled in North Las Vegas, not in Westside, Vegasâ only historic black area, where black churches are still clustered. There were riots there in 1992, after four white police officers were found not guilty of beating black motorist Rodney King in Los Angeles. The violence sparked millions of dollars in local and federal investment and efforts to improve relations with police. âThat community is still very much still there but with a lot of Latino families,â Smith said. The Moulin Rouge, the first racially integrated casino in Las Vegas, in 1956.7927/Gamma/Getty Images But thatâs not where the thousands of African-Americans who joined the hundreds of thousands who migrated to the Sun Belt live now. Some are teachers, business professionals, and many are younger. âLas Vegas is one of the most diverse areas of any part of the country that Iâve been in,â said Gene Collins, director of the local chapter of the National Action Network, a civil rights organization. âSegregation is not an issue here. If you can afford to live someplace, you can move in. As soon as the Fair Housing Act passed, blacks could live wherever they could afford to live and chose to live.â African-Americans are in smaller numbers in these Sun Belt boomtowns, which contributes to increased diversity and less clustering.Â âWe do see this correlation between the size of the black population and segregation,â Iceland said. âAt the same time, some of the Sun Belt cities that have lower and declining black segregation have growing black populations.â Blacks made up 10.5 percent of the 2 million people living in Las Vegasâ Clark County, compared with 12.6 percent nationally, according to the 2010 Census. But the countyâs African-American population jumped more than 50 percent since 2000, compared with a 12 percent increase nationwide. Even among metro areas with the nationâs largest black populations, black segregation is lower. Houston ranks 21stÂ and Atlanta 24th, according to research by John Logan, a segregation expert at Brown University. âThere are two Americas,â he said, âthe America where segregation stays high â¦ then thereâs the part of the country where African-Americans have not been as segregated, are present in much smaller numbers and have incorporated into neighborhoods. These are areas where things are really changing.â Iva Harris, 71, a retired high school counselor and sometime actress, and her husband, Ermon Harris, 72, a military retiree, moved after 30 years in Stockton, Calif., to a guarded gated community on the southwest side of the city. They bought a home with a casita, or guesthouse, for 400,000. At the peak of the housing boom, it was worth 1.2 million, but it has since tumbled to about half a million. âWe didnât know an awful lot about Las Vegas,â said Iva Harris, who also runs a cosmetics company. âI didnât know the makeup, but I knew I was going to a somewhat affluent neighborhood. I knew I was going to be a minority.âÂ That was 11 years ago. Now, a third of the 18 homes on her street are occupied by African-Americans. Thatâs not to say that racism and discrimination have vanished, said Collins, a Louisiana native who has been in Vegas 56 years. âIâve been a part of the changes as they occurred,â he said. âI chose to live in West Las Vegas to make sure the community is safe â¦ Itâs really not black anymore.â He and other community leaders raise questions of equity in police treatment of blacks and say there continues to be a lack of investment in whatâs left of the cityâs historic black area.Â âWeâre very represented in most neighborhoods if you can afford them,â said Katherine Duncan. âItâs based more on income than skin color, but most of the disparity is in other parameters â¦ the workforce, and blacks overly represented in the prison population.â Even Harris sometimes wonders why there are so many black families on her block and whether some agents intentionally steered black buyers to that corner of the upscale community. The Ward 5 Chamber of Commerce is organizing a weeklong event this month to remind residents of the role the Emancipation Proclamation played in helping Nevada become a state 150 years ago.Â âWhen I arrived in Las Vegas, I thought it was the best place in the world for African-Americans,â said DerekÂ Duncan, whose family moved here more than three decades ago. âThere were black headliners [at the casinos]. I never experienced any segregation. There were no mosquitoes. The weather was beautiful. And there were African-American businesses that were thriving. But, he added, no one âÂ regardless of skin color âÂ is immune from economic downturns. âBut now all that is gone, and it seems like while the city has become more and more integrated, the black community has lost its economic base,â he said. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The text discusses how Sun Belt cities in the United States, such as Las Vegas, offer a new perspective on race and residential segregation. These newer cities and suburbs, which were developed after the Fair Housing Act of 1968, do not have a history of racial separation. As a result, people of different races and ethnicities are more likely to live side by side in these areas. Research has shown that Las Vegas and other fast-growing areas like Riverside, California, and Phoenix, Arizona, have the lowest levels of black segregation from other groups among the largest metropolitan areas. The lack of pre-civil-rights history and established racial enclaves in these newer cities is the main reason for the lower rate of segregation. Rapid growth brought on by newcomers from all parts of the U.S. and the world has helped break down racial barriers and create more diverse communities. Younger migrants are likely to have less discriminatory attitudes and be more open to mixed-race relationships. The movement of African-Americans to the Sun Belt and the growth of black populations in these cities have contributed to increased diversity and less racial clustering.

Last month he rode on a balloon with his friend Keith. First they were at the ground-level. They called it camp A. Then they rose to the height of three miles. They called it camp B. Eventually, they reached six miles above ground. They called it camp C.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Where the air would be denser, camp A or camp B?  Hint: As shown here, pressure decreases to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure when we get to an altitude of about six miles. Since this is a common cruising altitude for commercial airplanes, pressurized cabins are needed for the comfort and survival of the passengers. This is because the density of the air decreases along with the decreasing air pressure, so there is less oxygen in a breath of air. You've probably noticed this effect in high-mountain areas, as it often feels harder to breath. Answer:","output":"The air would be denser at camp A, which is at ground-level. This is because air pressure and density decrease as altitude increases. As mentioned in the hint, pressure decreases to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure at an altitude of about six miles. This significant decrease in pressure means that the air is less dense as you go higher. At camp A, the air is denser because it is at ground-level where the atmospheric pressure is higher. At camp B, the air is less dense because they rose to a height of three miles, which is higher than ground-level. The decrease in air pressure as they ascended resulted in a corresponding decrease in air density. Therefore, the denser air is found at camp A, when compared to camp B. This decrease in air density is also why passengers in commercial airplanes need pressurized cabins at high altitudes, as there is less oxygen available in each breath of air, making it harder to breathe and maintain comfort and survival."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Then I noticed one on the wall, one on the noticeboard, and then one on my classroom door. In fact, they were stuck to nearly every available surface along the corridor. And they all had the same statement:\\"All I'm asking for is a little respect seeing I pay you PS9,000 a year.\\" I still don't know what led to this flyer campaign -- it is said that it's linked to a group of students who were not given extra assignment grade for their examination -- but I could not help but become annoyed at the impolite language. I started to think about the ways that my students act and speak, and the way I acted and spoke during my time at university. I will admit that I didn't do all of the readings, and yes, I may have missed a couple of lectures throughout the year, but I completed all assignments and followed the guidelines presented to me, without expecting my lecturers to chase after me. I wish I could say the same for my students. As I walked through the car park with a colleague at the end of the day, we discussed the unrest that the posters had caused:\\"If you ask me,\\"he said,\\"all universities are going to need a customer services department before long.\\"And there it was, plain and simple, the issue that I hadn't been able to explain: these young people weren't behaving like university students, they were behaving like customers. I recalled the student who told me he was disappointed with his low grade because he had\\"paid so much money\\". My colleague topped it: when one of his students was asked to leave a seminar for not completing the reading, he responded:\\"I pay you to teach me what's in the article, not the other way around.\\" Last week I sent out the first round of grades for a module and had 12 emails of complaint within an hour.

Philadelphiaâs musical roots Union Transfer, a new, bi-level space, is fast becoming one of the hottest venues for live music on the US east coast. While jazz has early roots in New Orleans and Motown Records started in Detroit, Pennsylvaniaâs largest city â more famously known as the birthplace of American independence â is home to a surprisingly eclectic mix of pioneering musical artists and new sounds. Philly Soul songwriters Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, jazz great John Coltrane, rock and soul sensation Patti Labelle, hip-hop pioneers The Roots, punk rocker Joan Jett, rapper Schoolly D, neo soul artist Jill Scott and consummate entertainer Will Smith (once half of the unforgettable pop rap duo DJ Jazzy Jeff and The Fresh Prince) are just a few of the artists who put Philadelphia on America’s musical map. Today, the city’s music scene continues to reflect its rich musical heritage. Established artists still call Philly home, while new venues and emerging local talent make the city a great stop for any music lover. So, get on board the love train (or, Amtrak) for a peek into the freedom loving, musical soul of Philadelphia. Start at World Cafe Live (WCL), a three million dollar space with two stages and incredible acoustics that marries the size, sophistication and cleanliness of an upscale theatre with a friendly, down-to-earth vibe. Founder Hal Real licensed the World Cafe name from radio station XPN in 2004, but besides sharing the same building, passion and “philosophy about the power of music”, World Cafe Live (the venue) and World Cafe (the radio show, syndicated by NPR ) operate independently of one another. WCL embraces local artists, many of whom built their followings at the venue’s Philly Rising open mic nights or Monday Jazz Jams. Philly singer/songwriter Lizanne Knott, who performs often and runs the city’s outpost of the New York Songwriters’ Circle at WCL, called the atmosphere “respectful and like family”. With 550 ticketed and 200 free shows a year, WCL hosts live music in just about every genre, including jazz, rock, folk and rap (Philly native Queena Marie stopped by in early January 2012). The cafe is also where artists often gain popularity before becoming global superstars -- Adele played four times before she got her big break and Corinne Bailey Rae was a chart-topping UK artist first introducing herself to US audiences when she played WCL in 2006. Not far from WCL is The Blockley Pourhouse, a two-and-a-half-year-old nightclub in a space that was once a 19th-century insane asylum. More recently, The Blockley was the home of The Chestnut Club, a popular venue in the 1980s and 90s for iconic acts such as The Ramones, Violent Femmes, Iggy Pop, De La Soul, Nirvana and the Dave Matthews Band. With a small stage, wide dance floor and well-stocked bar, the Blockley’s young, party atmosphere is perfect for a mix of alt rock, hip hop, electronic and rap shows, where local artists and regional/national acts play the 700-person, (primarily) standing-room-only space. Dr. Fameus (from local electronic jam band Disco Biscuit) and Inspectah Deck of Wu-Tang Clan played recently, while nostalgia is kept alive with monthly performances by Splinter’s Sunlight, Philly’s most popular Grateful Dead tribute band. Two musts for indie rock are Kung Fu Necktie and veteran Johnny Brenda’s, both located in Philly’s Fishtown area and among the best spots in the country for indie music according to QD Tran, an editor at The Deli, a national indie music scene website. Kung Fu Necktie opened its doors in 2008 (two of its owners are from Lit Lounge on New York City’s Lower East Side) and the weathered dive bar atmosphere is accented with kitschy, vintage items that could be from your eccentric aunt’s private art collection (if your eccentric aunt plays pinball). You will find mostly local indie rock and local DJs, plus the occasional record launch party. At Johnny Brenda’s, founded in 1967 by pro boxer Johnny Brenda and under new ownership since 2003, more established national indie rock bands like Tokyo Police Club, Dr Dog, Nada Surf and Fleet Foxes join the line up of local, emerging indie talent. The bi-level venue, which has an elevated stage, wraparound balcony and capacity for 250 people, draws a decidedly hipster crowd. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1.

Write an article with the title: \\"'Mr. Robot' creator has a very 'Mr. Robot' response to Trump's presidency\\"","output":"Title: 'Mr. Robot' Creator Has a Very 'Mr. Robot' Response to Trump's Presidency Introduction: Sam Esmail, the brilliant mind behind the critically acclaimed television series, \\"Mr. Robot,\\" which aired from 2015-2019, has cultivated a reputation for offering incisive and powerful social commentary on today's digital age. Addressing issues such as wealth inequality, corporate greed, and technology's role in modern society, \\"Mr. Robot\\" has been a force to be reckoned with. As expected, with a creative mind like Esmail's, there was no way he would stay silent on the subject of Donald Trump's four-year term as President of the United States. So, what did Esmail think of the 45th president, and how could the themes present in \\"Mr. Robot\\" shed light on his feelings towards Trump's presidency? Let's explore. Setting the Stage: For those unfamiliar with \\"Mr. Robot,\\" the show centers around Elliot Alderson, a cybersecurity engineer and a vigilante hacker played by Emmy winner, Rami Malek. The show's protagonist, Elliot, suffers from social anxiety disorder and clinical depression. In the series, he ultimately starts a cyber-revolution to expose and take down the corrupt leaders of the Earth's most powerful conglomerate, E Corp. The series was known for its critique of corporate power, as well as for its daring exploration of mental health, political conspiracy, and technology's impact on society. The show's complex themes and compelling narrative were set against a backdrop of a United States grappling with inequality, politics, and the growing presence of technology. Sam Esmail's Take on Trump's Presidency: To understand how Sam Esmail's response to Trump's presidency is undeniably linked to the themes explored in \\"Mr. Robot,\\" we need to look at the link between dissatisfied citizens like the show's protagonist and the voting population that helped usher in Trump's era. Operating in a landscape where technology was often used as a means of control, surveillance, and manipulation, \\"Mr. Robot\\" highlights how easily power can be acquired and abused, concerns that echo many of the criticisms of the Trump administration. The election of Donald Trump can, in part, be attributed to a frustrated and disillusioned segment of the American population seeking change. This frustration, which can also be seen in the motivations of Elliot and his revolutionaries, highlights how the sentiment of resistance against the establishment is prevalent even outside the realm of fiction. Esmail's response to Trump's presidency can be summarized as a call to action, rather than a resignation into apathy and despair. \\"Mr. Robot\\" demonstrates the impact and societal value of individual action, even when pitched against a seemingly insurmountable force, and encourages viewers to question existing power structures and corruption. Esmail's response to Trump's administration reflects these values, urging people not to succumb to cynicism but instead to hold their leaders accountable. Addressing the Larger Picture: Esmail's response to Trump's presidency highlights the importance of viewing current events in a broader social and cultural context. Just as \\"Mr. Robot\\" tackled issues surrounding technology's effect on our everyday lives and the influence of powerful corporations, the political implications of the Trump administration reflected similar concerns. It is therefore pertinent for people to examine the role that technology played in Trump's election and influence - from the Cambridge Analytica scandal to the many controversies surrounding social media's effect on the 2016 election. It is also essential to remember that the core themes of \\"Mr. Robot\\" - questioning authority, examining corporate influence on politics, and understanding the role technology plays in our lives - are more relevant than ever before. Conclusion: As it turns out, Esmail's response to Trump's presidency is entirely in line with the values and themes that \\"Mr. Robot\\" explores. By incorporating these themes into a groundbreaking television show, Esmail has given audiences the tools to question the status quo and recognize the need for change. It is this ethos that also sets the stage for a thought-provoking and highly relevant response to the political and social upheavals of the past several years. In a world that has become increasingly digitalized and interconnected, the lessons we can learn from \\"Mr. Robot\\" are more relevant than ever."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The king of Wu was badly hurt and soon died. His son Fu Chai became the new king. Fu was very sad and angry and he decided to fight back for his father's death. He trained his army strictly until it was very strong. Three years later, he led his army against the State of Yue and caught its king Gou Jian, who was taken to the State of Wu. Gou Jian was put into a small black stone house which was full of terrible smell and was made to raise  horses. Gou worked hard and tried to keep himself quiet, but he never forgot his pain. Many years later, he was set free. Gou secretly trained his army after he went back to his own state. In order to make himself strong-minded he slept on firewood and ate a gall bladder before having dinner and going to bed every night. After a few years, his country became strong once more. Then Gou took hold of a golden chance to fight against Wu and won the war in the end. If one voluntarily  works very hard and voluntarily stands up to pains and difficulties in order to succeed, we might call him a\\"Gou Jian\\", and his story, a\\"Gou Jian's story\\".

This event is a significant part of the story of Gou Jian's resilience, determination, and eventual triumph over adversity. As the narrative describes, Gou Jian endured years of hardship before eventually returning to his own state and rebuilding it to be stronger, ultimately leading to his victory over the State of Wu. The term \\"Gou Jian\\" and \\"Gou Jian's story\\" have since become symbolic of an individual who willingly undergoes great challenges and difficulties in pursuit of success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information:  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - Arkansas is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Its name is of Siouan derivation from the language of the Osage denoting their related kin, the Quapaw Indians. The state's diverse geography ranges from the mountainous regions of the Ozark and the Ouachita Mountains, which make up the U.S. Interior Highlands, to the densely forested land in the south known as the Arkansas Timberlands, to the eastern lowlands along the Mississippi River and the Arkansas Delta.  - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics.  - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel.  - A radio station is a set of equipment necessary to carry on communication via radio waves. Generally, it is a receiver or transmitter, an antenna, and some smaller additional equipment necessary to operate them. Radio stations play a vital role in communication technology as they are heavily relied on to transfer data and information across the world.  - Kentucky, officially the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a state located in the east south-central region of the United States.

Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the MinneapolisSaint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \\"Twin Cities\\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the large majority of the European settlers emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany, and the state remains a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.  - Mississippi is a state in the southern region of the United States, with part of its southern border formed by the Gulf of Mexico. Its western border is formed by the Mississippi River.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - WPRE ( 980 AM ) is a radio station broadcasting a classic hits format to the Prairie du Chien , Wisconsin , USA area .

Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River.  - Oldies is a radio format that concentrates on rock and roll and pop music from the latter half of the 20th Century, specifically from around the mid 1950s to the 1970s or 1980s.  - Communication (from Latin \\"commnicre\\", meaning \\"to share\\") is the act of conveying intended meanings from one entity or group to another through the use of mutually understood signs and semiotic rules.  - Wisconsin is a U.S. state located in the north-central United States, in the Midwest and Great Lakes regions.

Wisconsin is the 23rd largest state by total area and the 20th most populous. The state capital is Madison, and its largest city is Milwaukee, which is located on the western shore of Lake Michigan. The state is divided into 72 counties.  - A meander, in general, is a bend in a sinuous watercourse or river. A meander forms when moving water in a stream erodes the outer banks and widens its valley, and the inner part of the river has less energy and deposits silt. A stream of any volume may assume a \\"meandering\\" course, alternately eroding sediments from the outside of a bend and depositing them on the inside. The result is a \\"snaking\\" pattern as the stream meanders back and forth across its down-valley axis. When a meander gets cut off from the main stream, an oxbow lake forms. Over time meanders migrate downstream, sometimes in such a short time as to create civil engineering problems for local municipalities attempting to maintain stable roads and bridges.  - Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects.   - The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \\"Third Coast\\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \\"south coast\\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \\"north coast.\\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin.  - Classic hits is a radio format which generally includes rock and pop music from 1964 to 1988 or 1989, with occasional songs as recent as the early 1990s or before 1995. The term is erroneously used as a synonym for the adult hits format (which uses a slightly newer music library stretching from the 1970s through the 1990s), but is more accurately characterized as a contemporary style of the oldies format, although most classic hits stations focus on pop hits from the late 1960s through the 1990s.  - Adult hits (sometimes also called variety hits) is a radio format that draws from a wide variety of different musical genres. Most adult hits stations play a mix of rock, pop, pop rock, soft rock, classic rock, adult contemporary, and new wave hits as well as select oldies hits, predominantly drawing on music from the late 1960s through the present day. Adult hits is akin to classic hits, although the classic hits format uses a slightly older and often narrower playlist (1960s to 1980s).  - Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States.

It is part of the Louisiana coastal plain, one of the largest areas of coastal wetlands in the United States. The Mississippi River Delta is the 7th largest river delta on Earth (USGS) and is an important coastal region for the United States, containing more than 2.7 million acres of coastal wetlands (and 37% of the estuarine marsh in the conterminous U.S. he coastal area is the nations largest drainage basin and drains about 41% of the contiguous United States into the Gulf of Mexico at an average rate of 470,000 cubic feet per second.  - The Appalachian Mountains, often called the Appalachians, are a system of mountains in eastern North America. The Appalachians first formed roughly 480 million years ago during the Ordovician Period.

It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge.

From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. Although local elections are nonpartisan, most of the city's elected officials are known to be Democrats. In 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a third-party socialist councillor, Kshama Sawant.

Choices:  - america - western hemisphere - northern hemisphere - occident - north america is the world’s third-largest continent – 24  The rationale to choose \\"northern hemisphere\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"North America experiences winter at the beginning of the year because it is located in the Northern Hemisphere. The Earth's axial tilt causes the different seasons as it orbits around the Sun. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Earth tilts away from the Sun during winter, resulting in less direct sunlight and lower temperatures. The winter season generally runs from late December to late March, although the specific timing and intensity of winter weather can vary depending on the region. To recap, the rationale for choosing \\"Northern Hemisphere\\" as the answer for why North America has winter at the start of the year is because it accurately describes the location of the continent and its position relative to Earth's axis and orbit. This positioning causes the cooler temperatures and seasonal conditions that we associate with winter."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question given this paragraph:   lava flows from a volcano and hardens into rock.

Please answer the following question: A Bite of China, made by CCTV's Documentary Channel, sparked discussion not only on Chinese food, but also on locally made documentary programs. When you think of documentaries, you may think of them as long, boring programs. But documentaries can be wonderful and bring stories from the real world into our homes. With fascinating footage and stories, documentaries encourage us to think about interesting issues we wouldn't necessarily know about. So, what makes a good documentary, and what should we pay attention to when we watch one? Here, we offer a few easy strategies to help you get the most out of watching documentaries. Pay attention to the themes While watching a documentary, keep your eyes and ears peeled for the themes people talk about and what ideas they focus on. Is it meant to be informative or raise a certain emotional response? Think critically Listen to what the people in the documentary are saying and ask yourself the following questions: If you were debating with someone or introducing a new concept, would you say the things the people in the documentary are saying? Do the arguments make sense? Check the sources If you're sitting at the computer and can't think of anything to do, why not look up the points the documentary made and see if they are accurate? You could even read more about what is presented in the documentary. Who are the creators? The creators or financial backers of a film will usually be involved with how the subject matter is presented. For instance, as the documentary 2016: Obama's America was directed in large part by a conservative writer, it's not surprising that it's critical of President Obama from the beginning. Why is 2016: Obama's America mentioned in the article? A) Because the author dislikes Obama. B) Because it is a persuasive example. C) Because it is quite popular in China. D) Because it is directed by a writer.[:Z. xx. k.Com] Answer:","output":"B) Because it is a persuasive example. This choice makes the most sense based upon the context provided. The article uses 2016: Obama's America as an example to illustrate the point that the creators or financial backers of a film can significantly influence its presentation. In this case, since the documentary was directed by a conservative writer, it's critical of President Obama from the outset. There is no information in the passage suggesting that the author dislikes Obama, the documentary is popular in China, or it is mentioned because it was directed by a writer. Therefore, it is a persuasive example in the context of the article, demonstrating the impact of the creators' or backers' biases on the documentary's narrative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I was once distinctly unsettled by a utility man who called to read the gas meter. We were living in an old house at the time and I was home alone with the youngest child (who was around six months old), balanced on my hip as I opened the door. The visitor looked genuine, dressed in the expected uniform. He was around 6.3 and probably not the most tidily presented utility man I'd met, but I believed him to be genuine and willingly invited him in out of the foul weather. It was pouring down outside, a freezing cold winter's day. As I closed the door I remembered that I should have asked to see his company I.D. , so as I opened the meter cupboard and switched on the light, I politely said, 'Oops, I should have asked to see your I.D. if you don't mind?. He stood there in front of the door and made no move to produce his card or do anything in fact. He just glared down at me in the most menacing way and said in a very sinister voice 'Isn't it a little bit late for that now? What are you going to do if I tell you I don't have it?'. There was an embarrassed silence. He continued to stare down at me without making a move for what seemed like minutes but was probably seconds. He didn't produce his I.D., instead he almost grudgingly read the meter as I looked on and then he swiftly left without saying goodbye. I closed the door and locked it, and then took a while to get my pulse rate back to normal and to realise I'd just learned a very big lesson.

As a professional dancer, Pasha Kovalev is used to pushing his body - and, apart from an occasional sniffle, it's served him well. 'I had a few colds, but nothing serious. I was always on the dancefloor, which kept me in good shape,' says the 33-year-old, who has appeared on Strictly Come Dancing since 2011, partnering celebrities such as singer Kimberley Walsh and, in the new series, Countdown's Rachel Riley. But it was this hard-working lifestyle, he believes, which led to a bout of illness so severe it could have cost him his life. In step: Strictly Come Dancing partners Rachel Riley and Pasha Kovalev. In 2006, Pasha was living in New York, where he came down with a sore throat - accompanied by fever, heavy limbs, trouble swallowing and extreme fatigue. 'I assumed it was just a common cold,' says Pasha, who is from Russia. But over the course of six days he became so ill his friend called an ambulance. After a battery of tests, he was diagnosed with Lemierre's syndrome. A complication of tonsillitis, it causes inflammation in the head or neck. The condition causes the bacteria infecting the throat to get into the jugular vein -– the main vein that runs through the neck and connects the head to the heart. This leads to the lining of the vessel becoming inflamed, disrupting the flow of blood and triggering the formation of a blood clot, which is infected with the bacteria. After a scan found Pasha had a blood clot, doctors told him there was a danger of it spreading into his brain, where it could result in a stroke. He was given antibiotics and blood-thinners to try to prevent it from getting bigger so his body could break it down. Another potential risk is of bacteria escaping into the bloodstream within broken pieces of clot or independently. This could lead to life-threatening blood poisoning, or septicaemia. Hooked up to drips and unable to eat solid food, Pasha lost 20lb in less than a fortnight and felt weak, but he stayed positive. 'I am quite chilled out and my attitude was: “If the blood clot moves, it moves, but for now I am still here.” ' Deceptive: Pasha thought he had a minor cold, but after a slew of tests he was diagnosed with Lemierre's syndrome, a complication of tonsillitis. Thankfully, Pasha's clot did dissolve and he was discharged from hospital within three weeks - but he was left with a weakened immune system for months. Though Lemierre's is rare, complications stemming from throat infections are not uncommon. 'Sore throats are more common than any other type of infection,' says Andrew McCombe, ear, nose and throat (ENT) consultant and spokesman for ENT UK. 'Though the majority will be nothing to worry about, if it gets nasty, bacteria can get into the bloodstream, make you very sick and interfere with the function of organs. In exceptional circumstances, they can cause septicaemia, which can lead to death.' The three main structures of the throat that can feel sore are the larynx (voice box), pharynx (the throat) and tonsils. Inflammation of these areas are known as laryngitis, pharyngitis and tonsillitis. The latter is the most common, with most children experiencing it at least once. Experts are warning that tonsillitis is on the rise, and this is causing an increase in a condition called quinsy. This is a complication of tonsillitis, and causes pus to develop between the tonsils and the back of the throat. 'Quinsy is common,' says Mr McCombe. 'We see two or three cases a week where I work, and there are 6,000 admissions for quinsy across the country every year. We're seeing more as we witness a reduction in the number of tonsillectomies.' As well as a painful abscess (up to the size of a walnut) and sore throat, patients with quinsy may have trouble swallowing, which can lead to drooling, bad breath and an earache. If the infection gets into the bloodstream, it could lead to rigors (shivering), though doctors are unsure why, says ENT surgeon George Murty, of University Hospitals Leicester. 'Cases have increased two to three times in the past few years compared to previously,' says Mr Murty. 'It's not just more common, it is also more severe. 'I see more complications, such as the pus spreading. If it gets to the spinal cord, it could potentially cause paralysis. 'In the past year I've seen three major complications of quinsy. When I started 25 years ago, you'd see it once every couple of years.' He puts the increase down to GPs prescribing fewer antibiotics for sore throats - due to concerns over antibiotic resistance - as well as fewer children having their tonsils removed. 'The Government is keen to reduce the costs of surgery. Previously, the decision on whether you'd benefit from a tonsillectomy was made by the GP,' says Mr Murty. 'Quinsy is common. We see two or three cases a week where I work, and there are 6,000. admissions for quinsy across the country every year. We're seeing more. as we witness a reduction in the number of tonsillectomies.' 'Now it's increasingly more difficult for GPs to refer patients for tonsillectomies. You need to have many more episodes of tonsillitis - usually seven a year - before you have the operation.' But quinsy isn't the only complication of a sore throat. A quarter of children with throat infections will have a middle ear infection, or glue ear, where the fluid between the inner ear and eardrum becomes infected by bacteria. 'The bacteria can spread up the eustacian tube, which connects the back of the throat to the ear,' says Mr Murty. 'It can also happen when the tonsils and andenoids - lumps of tissue above the tonsils - swell up, blocking off this tube and meaning you can't ventilate it properly. This can lead to hearing loss. Fortunately, it's reversible.' Another potentially serious, but thankfully rare, complication arising from a throat infection is scarlet fever - characterised by a distinctive pinkish rash - and rheumatic fever, which leads to joint pain and swelling, and inflammation of the heart. These conditions develop in response to so-called 'strep throat' - a throat infection caused by streptococcal bacteria. Throat infections can also result in glomerulonephritis - an inflammation of the kidneys that can ultimately lead to renal failure. It can be caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissue as a consequence of the infection. And research has even pointed to a link between throat infections caused by the streptococcal bacteria and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), characterised by anxious thoughts and repetitive behaviours such as handwashing. Pushy: Pasha, pictured with Kimberley Walsh, says 'Now if I push myself, I make sure I have time to recuperate' A 2009 study from Columbia University concluded some cases of OCD could be caused by the body's attempt to attack the bacteria. One theory is that antibodies made by the body to attack the bacteria react with parts of the brain. However, many experts are unconvinced of the link. Despite the potential complications of a sore throat, Mr McCombe stresses most are minor and unlikely to lead to a serious problem. 'If it's an isolated sore throat, I wouldn't be too stressed,' he says. 'But if you also have joint pain, which could indicate bacteria spreading into the bloodstream, muscle ache, a temperature, headache and you feel really rotten, give it up to 48 hours and do the sensible things, such as taking on fluids, painkillers and anti-inflammatories. 'But if you feel worse after 48 hours, consider seeing your GP.' After Pasha recovered from Lemierre's, he decided to stop putting himself through gruelling dance competitions and concentrate on performing in shows. This led him into the world of TV via the U.S. version of So You Think You Can Dance, where the Strictly producers spotted him. 'For most of us, if everything is going well, you take things for granted - and that includes your health,' says Pasha. 'Now if I push myself, I make sure I have time to recuperate. Strictly can be intense, so I go on holiday as soon as it's over.' Pasha: The Autobiography Of TV's Hottest Dance Star by Pasha Kovalev (John Blake, £14.99).

Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Pasha Kovalev, a professional dancer, was critically ill due to a complication of tonsillitis known as Lemierre's syndrome. He was living in New York in 2006 when he developed a sore throat, fever, and extreme fatigue. His diagnosis came after a friend called an ambulance as his health continued to decline. With Lemierre's syndrome, the bacteria from the throat spreads into the jugular vein, disrupting blood flow and leading to a blood clot. In Pasha's case, the blood clot had the potential to spread to his brain, causing a possible stroke. He was treated with antibiotics and blood thinners and took almost a month to recover, losing a notable amount of weight during the process. Inflammations in the throat can originate from the larynx, pharynx or tonsils, referred to as laryngitis, pharyngitis and tonsillitis respectively. Tonsillitis is said to be on the rise, leading to a condition called quinsy. Quinsy is a complication from tonsillitis that causes pus to develop between the tonsils and the back of the throat. One reason for the increased incidence of quinsy is a reduction in the number of tonsillectomies. Sore throats may also lead to other complications like middle ear infection or glue ear in children, scarlet fever, rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis, and possibly even obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) due to a link between streptococcal bacteria and OCD. After his recovery, Kovalev decided to focus on performing in shows instead of participating in grueling dance competitions.

Article: A device that stops drivers from falling asleep at the wheel is about to undergo testing at Department of Transport laboratories and could go on sale within 12 months. The system, called Driver Alert, aims to reduce deadly road accidents by 20% - 40% that are caused by tiredness. Airline pilots can also use it to reduce the 30% of all pilot-error accidents that are related to fatigue. Driver Alert is based on a computerized wristband. The device, worn by drivers or pilots, gives out a sound about every four minutes during a car journey. After each sound the driver must respond by squeezing the steering wheel. A sensor in the wristband detects this pressing action and measures the time between the sound the driver's response. Tiredness is directly related to a driver's response time. Usually, a watchful driver would take about 400 milliseconds to respond, but once that falls to more than 500 milliseconds, it suggests that the driver is getting sleepy. In such cases the device gives out more regular and louder sounds, showing that the driver should open a window or stop for a rest. If the driver's response continues to slow down, the sounds become more frequent until a nonstop alarm warns that the driver must stop as soon as possible. The device has been delivered to the department's laboratories for testing. If these tests, scheduled for six months' time, are successful, the makers will bring the product to market within about a year. Question: How should a driver respond to the sounds from Driver Alert?

Martin O'Neill's Republic of Ireland side, who like Northern Ireland qualified as one of four best third-placed teams, take on hosts France in Lyon on Sunday at 14:00 BST. Neither Northern Ireland nor Wales had ever qualified for the European Championship before this year's edition, the first to feature 24 teams, while it is the first time the Republic have made the knockout stages of a Euros. The last time the Republic of Ireland played France was in 2009, when Thierry Henry handled the ball in the build-up to the deciding goal in a World Cup qualification play-off. With a population of just 330,000, England's opponents Iceland are the smallest nation ever to qualify for the tournament.

Write a text based on \\"difrancesco quits nj governor race\\" Text:","output":"Title: Difrancesco Exits New Jersey Governor Race In a surprising turn of events, Difrancesco has officially announced his withdrawal from the New Jersey Governor race. The news has shaken the political landscape of the state and prompted speculations about the reasons behind his decision. Difrancesco, a prominent figure in New Jersey politics, initially entered the race with high hopes of securing the governorship. However, recent polls have shown a decline in his popularity among voters, leading to a dip in campaign morale. There are a few potential reasons behind Difrancesco's decision to withdraw from the race. Firstly, it is possible that the decrease in voter support led him to believe that his chances of winning were slim. As a result, rather than continue to invest time, money, and resources into a campaign that seemed increasingly unlikely to succeed, Difrancesco may have decided to take a step back. Secondly, there could be undisclosed personal reasons for his decision to quit. Running a political campaign is both time-consuming and demanding, with candidates required to juggle numerous commitments, priorities, and responsibilities. If Difrancesco found himself unable to effectively manage these challenges, his withdrawal from the race might have been the responsible choice. Lastly, it is possible that forthcoming political developments influenced his choice. Aligning oneself with particular policies, parties, or politicians can have a significant impact on a candidate's odds of success. If Difrancesco saw a more promising opportunity elsewhere, or if he found that his political beliefs no longer aligned with his path to the governorship, he may have opted to change course. Regardless of the reasons behind Difrancesco's withdrawal from the New Jersey Governor race, his decision marks a significant shift in the contest. It remains to be seen how this new development will reshape the electoral map and influence voters' choices. With Difrancesco out of the race, other candidates must now reevaluate their strategies and seize the opportunity to capture undecided voters. In conclusion, while the exact reasons behind Difrancesco's decision to quit remain uncertain, his departure undoubtedly has a substantial impact on the political landscape of New Jersey. As the race for governor continues, all eyes will be on the remaining candidates and how they adapt to this unexpected development."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The tweet starts with a strong positive sentiment, expressed by \\"i lovee\\" followed by mentions of two users, \\"@winlovelyy\\" and \\"@meganlovelyy\\". This indicates that the person tweeting admires or shares a close bond with these two users. The use of the word \\"lovee\\" with an extra 'e' may be to emphasize their affection towards the mentioned users. Following this, the tweet mentions \\"So im wide awakee\\", which may imply a neutral tone or perhaps a slightly positive sentiment since the person is open to engaging in conversation, as they are awake. The addition of extra 'e' in \\"awakee\\" can be attributed to the informal and casual nature of the tweet. Lastly, the tweet concludes with \\"TEXTME??\\" which suggests that the person is inviting their followers or the mentioned users to communicate with them via text messages. The use of double question marks can imply a sense of urgency or eagerness to receive text messages. It can be seen as a mildly positive sentiment, as the person is actively seeking interaction with others. Combining all the portions of the tweet, the overall sentiment can be interpreted as positive. The tweet showcases affection towards other users, an eagerness to communicate, and a casual, relaxed tone. While the middle of the tweet might be considered neutral, the positive sentiment in the expressions of affection and the invitation for interaction lead to an overall positive sentiment prediction for this tweet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Movie title: Scream 2 Movie plot: While attending a preview of the film Stab, a film within a film based on the Woodsboro murders depicted in the first film, two Ohio Windsor College seniors, Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens are murdered by Ghostface. Phil is stabbed through the ear in a bathroom stall while trying to eavesdrop on strange whimpering noises. The killer, wearing a Ghostface costume, then returns to the screening and sits beside Maureen before mortally stabbing her. At first the audience believes she is part of the raucous acting out by audience members until she falls dead in front of the cinema screen. The following day, the news media including local journalist Debbie Salt, descend on Windsor College where Sidney Prescott, a theatre major, now studies alongside her best friend Hallie and her new boyfriend Derek, fellow Woodsboro survivor Randy, and Derek's best friend Mickey. Sidney receives prank calls but is oblivious to the recent killings until someone instructs her to watch the news. Two other Woodsboro survivors arrive at the campus: officer Dewey Riley to help Sidney, and reporter Gale Weathers to cover the case. Gale tries to stage a confrontation between Sidney and Cotton Weary, who is attempting to gain fame from his exoneration for the murder of Sidney's mother. After Gale forcibly brings Sidney to Cotton, Sidney angrily hits Gale. Later that evening, Sidney goes to a party with Hallie. At a sorority house, Ghostface kills fellow student Cici. After all the partygoers leave, the killer then crashes the party and attempts to murder Sidney, though Derek intervenes. The killer injures Derek but Dewey and the police arrive, causing the killer to flee. The next morning, Gale discusses the case with the police. Upon realizing that Cici's real name is Casey, she concludes that the killer is a copycat who targets students who share the same names as the Woodsboro murder victims. That afternoon, while Gale is talking to Dewey and Randy on the campus lawn, she receives a call from Ghostface hinting that he is watching them....

Q:Process:  - Living organisms in the sea die - The matter forms on the sea floor - Layers of sediment form above the matter compressing it - After many years the matter is compressed and heated - The result is that crude oil forms.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more energy from breaking happens, how will it affect less layers of sediment form above the matter.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you've proposed involves a scenario where more energy from the breaking process potentially leads to fewer layers of sediment forming above the decomposing organic matter. To understand the effect of this perturbation on the process of crude oil formation, we need to examine the stages of this process in more detail and discuss how the breaking process is related to it. The crude oil formation process essentially occurs through the following stages: 1. Accumulation of organic matter: Dead plants and organisms decompose and settle at the bottom of the ocean, forming layers of organic materials that accumulate over time. 2. Sedimentation: These layers of organic materials are covered by sediments, such as fine particles of sand, silt, and clay, which gradually accumulate on the ocean floor. Continuous deposition of sediments causes an increase in pressure and temperature within the buried organic matter. 3. Diagenesis: Under increasing temperature and pressure, the organic matter undergoes diagenesis, where it converts into kerogen, a waxy, insoluble organic substance that serves as a precursor to crude oil and natural gas. 4. Catagenesis: As pressure and temperature continue to rise due to deeper burial, kerogen undergoes catagenesis, which is a thermal decomposition process. During this stage, kerogen converts into hydrocarbons, including crude oil and natural gas. 5. Migration and accumulation: The generated hydrocarbons migrate through porous rocks and accumulate in reservoir rocks, such as sandstone or limestone, where they are trapped beneath impermeable layers called cap rocks. Now, let's examine the perturbation hypothesis. You suggest that more energy from the breaking process might lead to fewer layers of sediment forming above the decomposing organic matter. The breaking process could involve physical forces that influence the transportation and deposition of sediments in the ocean, such as waves, currents, and tides. More energy from the breaking process could potentially cause: 1. Redistribution of sediment: More energy from the breaking process might lead to stronger water movements, which could disperse sediments more widely or redistribute them within the water column. This could potentially lead to thinner layers of sediment forming above the organic matter, reducing the overall pressure and temperature experienced by the organic material. 2. Erosion: The higher energy in the breaking process could also cause increased erosion of the seafloor, preventing the consistent deposition of sediment layers and potentially even removing sediment from existing layers. If either of these possibilities occurs, the direct effect on the crude oil formation process would be a reduction in the pressure and temperature experienced by the organic matter. This could result in slower transformations of organic matter into kerogen and hydrocarbons, as both diagenesis and catagenesis are dependent on temperature and pressure. Less pressure due to fewer sediment layers might also hinder the migration and accumulation of hydrocarbons into reservoir rocks, reducing the chances of forming significant oil deposits. In essence, the perturbation hypothesis you've posited could indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the process of crude oil formation. A higher amount of energy in the breaking process could lead to fewer layers of sediment forming above organic matter, thereby slowing down or even hindering the transformation of organic matter into kerogen and ultimately crude oil, and potentially impacting the migration and accumulation of hydrocarbons in reservoir rocks. While the precise effects of this perturbation would depend on various factors, including the scale of the energy increase and geological conditions in specific locations, it's clear that the proposed perturbation could significantly alter the process of crude oil formation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Look for the third diagonal column to the left of the right-hand edge, which should be pointing up and to the left and have 3 cubes. Fold the 3 cubes of that row 180° toward you underneath the puzzle so they are now parallel with and even to the row next to them. Take the 2-cube column next to the 2 parallel columns and rotate it back 90°. Then rotate the column on the end 90° upward so the 3 cubes are vertical. Keeping your hand on the last pieces you moved, rotate both columns inward toward you 90°. Then, push the 3-cube column down and away from you 90° so it is parallel with the floor. Find the bottom cube of the second 3-cube column from the left. Fold it in toward you 90°. Then, find the lowest cube on the column to the left of the column you just manipulated and rotate it 180° clockwise. Find the top cube in the 2-cube column you just rotated. Rotate it 90° to the right so the 3-column row is stacked on the row beneath it. The long piece on the right will look like stairs. Fold the last cube on the right-hand side in the 3-cube column you just rotated upwards 180° away from you so it lies flat on the row beneath it. Then, let go of the puzzle with your left hand, using your right hand to hold the pieces in the “stair” line that haven’t yet been folded. This will rotate the puzzle so the extra cubes are on top. Grasp the 2 columns of cubes that are sticking up in the line next to the partially completed cube and fold them down 90° toward you. Then rotate the column on the right side of the cube back away from you 180°. Flip the column to the right of the cube back toward you 180°. Then fold the column that is the second to the end on the right-hand side down 90°. To finish the puzzle, rotate the last remaining column 180°.

Article: A wounded person is walked in on a wheelbarrow as Las Vegas police respond during an active shooter situation on the Las Vegas Stirp in Las Vegas Sunday, Oct. 1, 2017. Multiple victims were being transported... (Associated Press)      LAS VEGAS (AP) — A gunman on the 32nd floor of a Las Vegas Strip casino opened fire on an outdoor music festival, killing at least 20 people — including two off-duty police officers — and wounding more than 100, officials said early Monday.      Country music star Jason Aldean was performing on stage when the shots began ringing out Sunday night at the Route 91 Harvest Festival.      Officers confronted the suspect on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino across the street from the concert and he was killed, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said. Authorities did not release the suspect's name but said he is a local resident.      Concert-goers reported hearing what they described as automatic gun fire during the shooting.      Lombardo said they believe this was a \\"lone wolf\\" attack but said they were looking for a roommate of the dead suspect as a person of interest.      The two slain off-duty officers were attending the concert, Lombardo said. Another off-duty officer was in critical condition and another was wounded, Lombardo said.      Several officers from California were attending the music festival. A Bakersfield Police officer was shot and taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries.      Hours after the shooting, Aldean posted on Instagram that he and his crew were safe and said the shooting was \\"beyond horrific.\\"      Kodiak Yazzie, 36, said he and his girlfriend were watching Aldean's performance when he heard what sounded like fireworks. The music stopped temporarily and started up again before another round of pops sent the performers ducking for cover and fleeing the stage.      Thousands fled as bursts of gunfire could be heard for more than five minutes, Yazzie said.      Jose Baggett, 31, a Las Vegas resident, said he and a friend were in the lobby of the Luxor hotel-casino — directly north of the festival — when people began running. He said people were crying and as he and his friend walked away, they encountered police checkpoints where officers were carrying shotguns and assault rifles.      \\"There were armored personnel vehicles, SWAT vehicles, ambulances, and at least a half-mile of police cars,\\" Baggett said.      Witnesses said they saw multiple victims and dozens of ambulances near the concert venue. Some attendees later huddled in the basement of the nearby Tropicana hotel-casino.      Officers carrying assault rifles ran into the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino.      Authorities shut down part of the Las Vegas Strip and Interstate 15. Flights were temporarily halted at McCarran International Airport because of the shooting, the airport said on its verified Twitter account.      ___      An earlier version of this report had an incorrect spelling for the name of witness Kodiak Yazzie. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| A lone gunman unleashed a rapid-fire barrage of bullets from the 32nd floor of a Las Vegas hotel late Sunday, killing at least 59 people and injuring more than 500 others attending a country music festival below, officials said.      It was the worst mass shooting in modern American history, and Stephen Craig Paddock was \\"solely responsible for this heinous act,\\" Assistant Clark County Sheriff Todd Fasulo told reporters Monday night.      Paddock, 64, of Mesquite, Nevada, fired shot after shot from his room at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino down on the crowd of about 22,000, sending terrified concertgoers running for their lives.      \\"We heard what sounded like firecrackers going off.

Authorities identified the gunman as Stephen Craig Paddock, 64, of Mesquite, Nevada. They said he acted alone.      Investigators found 23 firearms in Paddock's room at Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and 19 more at his home.      President Donald Trump, who will visit Las Vegas on Wednesday, called the shooting \\"an act of pure evil.\\"      Police responded to reports of the shooting just after 10 p.m. (1 a.m. ET). Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters Monday that authorities believe Paddock killed himself before police entered his room. Officials had said earlier that police fatally shot Paddock.      Authorities were digging into Paddock's history. Other than a citation he received several years ago that was \\"handled as a normal practice\\" by the courts, he had no criminal background, Lombardo said.      Paddock is believed to have checked into the hotel on Thursday, Lombardo said. Fasulo said that he had 23 firearms in his room and that investigators found 19 more at his home.

Hotel employees had been in his room before the shooting and didn't notice anything unusual, according to Lombardo.      Two broken windows could be seen from the 32nd floor of the hotel, curtains billowing out. Law enforcement officials said Paddock had connecting rooms or a suite and ran between the windows, firing out of both, either to get a different vantage point or to avoid return fire.      They believe he smashed the windows with a something like a hammer before he started firing.      The shooting started while performer Jason Aldean was onstage. Witnesses described a chaotic scene of back-to-back bullets raining down from above, lasting for up to 10 minutes.      Fellow performer Jake Owen said he was standing about 50 feet from Aldean when the shots started.      \\"It got faster and faster, almost like it was an automatic rifle,\\" Owen said. \\"At that point, everyone on stage started running everywhere.\\"      Owen dashed by victims covered in blood and eventually found shelter in his bus. The gunfire still hadn't stopped by the time he got there, he said.      \\"It wasn't something that was quick. It was chaos for a pure seven to 10 minutes,\\" he said.      A map shows the area of the shooting in Las Vegas. NBC News      Flags at the White House and the U.S. Capitol were lowered at half-staff on Monday. President Donald Trump, who said he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday, called the shooting \\"an act of pure evil.\\"      \\"Hundreds of our fellow citizens are now mourning the loss of a loved one,\\" Trump said at a news conference. \\"We cannot fathom their pain.

Several other off-duty police officers are believed to be among the dead and injured.      The massacre put the normally bustling Strip at a standstill. Flights in and out of the Las Vegas airport were temporarily halted.      Police found Paddock's roommate, Marilou Danley, 62, and don't think she was involved, Lombardo said, adding that the investigation is ongoing.      Police searched their home in Mesquite, about 80 miles from Las Vegas.

Senior law enforcement officials and a Las Vegas casino executive said Stephen Paddock had made several large gambling transactions in recent weeks, including some of more than 30,000 a day. It wasn't known whether they were losses or wins.      In 2012, Paddock sued the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas for a slip and fall. Martin Kravitz, the lead attorney for the hotel, described him Monday as \\"bizarre\\" and said \\"he dressed slovenly to the deposition.\\"      \\"His answers were vague, not very thoughtful,\\" Kravitz said. \\"He wasn't angry. ...

Our goal is to find the value of \\"a.\\" 1. We have an equation: 93 = -293*a + 587 + 385 2. First, let's add the numbers on the right side of the equation:    Right side = -293*a + 587 + 385    Right side = -293*a + 972 (since 587 + 385 = 972) 3. Now our equation looks like this: 93 = -293*a + 972 4. Next, we have to get \\"a\\" by itself. So, let's subtract 972 from both sides of the equation:    Left side - 972 = 93 - 972    -879 = -293*a (since 93 - 972 = -879) 5. Finally, we just need to divide both sides of the equation by -293 to find the value of \\"a\\":    -879 / -293 = -293*a / -293    3 = a (since -879 ÷ -293 = 3) So, the value of \\"a\\" is 3."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: \\"That's Glenn Miller,\\" my father said. \\"But it can't be.\\" He had the back of the hospital bed cranked upright, the lower lid of his left eye creeping up in a warning signal I'd learned to recognize as a child. My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier. The date was in India ink on a piece of surgical tape, stuck to the top of a spool of recording wire. The handwritten numerals had the hooks and day-first order of Europe: 18/12/44. I'd won it on eBay the week before as part of a lot that included a wire recorder and a stack of 78s by French pop stars like Charles Trenent and Edith Piaf.

He packed his belongings in a suitcase instead of a box because the  Available choices:  1). suitcase was flimsier.  2). box was flimsier.","output":"After considering the available choices, I will select the option that appears to be more logical and complements the story context. I choose story 2. Reasoning for choosing story 2: Option 1 mentions that the suitcase is flimsier, which would not be a reasonable choice to pack belongings, as it may result in damage or loss of items. In contrast, option 2 states that the box is flimsier, implying that the suitcase is more secure and sturdy. This option makes more sense as a practical choice to pack belongings. Continuing the story (Story 2): He packed his belongings in a suitcase instead of a box because the box was flimsier. The fragile items meant so much to him – photo frames, souvenirs he collected from his travels, and his grandmother's antique vase. He had heard one too many horror stories of valuable objects being ruined due to flimsy packaging during moves. This time, he wanted to make sure that everything would arrive at his new home safe and sound. The suitcase, once a reliable companion on countless trips, now served a new purpose. Its sturdy structure and secure clasps provided the perfect storage option for his precious belongings. He carefully wrapped each item in bubble wrap and soft cloth before arranging them snugly within the suitcase. The satisfaction he felt each time he heard the soft click of the suitcase shutting was proof that he had made the right decision. Finally, after hours of meticulous packing, he could rest easy, confident that his valued possessions would survive the journey ahead. As he looked around his nearly empty room, he allowed himself to feel the excitement of starting anew, relieved that the suitcase had given him some peace of mind during this transition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"National Lampoon's Vacation\\" had been shot today, he just couldn't have taken the time off work. That's according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which show that Americans are taking fewer, shorter vacations.      Workers pay a career penalty for vacation      Nine million Americans took a week off in July 1976, the peak month each year for summer travel. Yet in July 2014, just seven million did. Keeping in mind that 60 million more Americans have jobs today than in 1976, that adds up to a huge decline in the share of workers taking vacations.      Some rough calculations show, in fact, that about 80 percent of workers once took an annual weeklong vacation — and now, just 56 percent do.      It's not as if Americans are cutting back on an excessive vacation habit, either. The United States is the only developed economy that doesn't guarantee its workers a paid vacation. Most of its peer nations promise about 20 days off a year, according to a report by Rebecca Ray, Milla Sanes, and John Schmitt of the Center for Economic and Policy Research.      About a quarter of the American workforce doesn't get paid vacation, according to data they cite from the National Compensation Survey. The no-vacationers usually work part-time or for small employers in low-wage jobs.      The average American gets 14 days off from work, according to an annual survey by the travel company Expedia, but actually uses only 10 of those days each year. It's an open question why Americans don't use it all. They say their bosses are supportive and that scheduling got in the way. Others say they're are just stockpiling it for some future trip —but wouldn't someone, then, eventually take that trip?      One possibility is that vacation suffers from a \\"Prisoner's Dilemma.\\" It's dangerous to be \\"that guy\\" who uses all the time off they get when everyone else is on the job, so workers limit their vacations. On balance, The Wall Street Journal says, the evidence does support that theory. Workers pay a career penalty for vacation. If Americans could establish a pro-vacation norm, those pressures would lessen.      That seems to be happening in some workplaces, where bosses require workers to use their time off. That might be, for the most part, just a management fad. Yet it is surprisingly normal in one industry: finance. That's not out of kindness, however. Regulators have long recommended banks require vacations as a way of making it harder to conceal embezzlement.      It's not clear what's driving the trend towards fewer, shorter vacations. Tourism tends to be very cyclical, but the decline of the great American vacation seems to have been a gradual affair. There aren't any shortage of possible explanations: lessened job security, stagnant median incomes, rising part-time employment, and an increasing share of households with more than one member employed could all be parts of the story.      There's no obvious sign that any of this has hurt the travel industry, though. Hotel occupancy is back to pre-recession highs, and employment in the leisure and hospitality industry has been one of the bright spots of the recovery. It seems like they're carrying on, Griswolds or not.      * Here's how the math works.      The Current Population Survey surveys workers once a month about a specific \\"reference week.\\" If an employed person says they were absent that week — that is, they worked zero hours — and the reason why is \\"vacation,\\" they're counted here. There's no reason to think that workers are more likely to take off during the survey's reference week than any other, so we can divide the number of vacation absences by the number of workers, and raise that to the fourth power to get the percentage of workers who took a weeklong vacation in one month.      Now we multiply the percentage of Americans who didn't across the last twelve months, since vacation is (obviously) seasonal. That gives you the share who haven't taken a vacation in the last year. The calculations assume that nobody takes more than one weeklong vacation each year. ||||| My wife and I returned Friday from two weeks of vacation in China, hanging out with one of our sons (posted there with the Peace Corps) and his girlfriend. We were mostly unplugged, wandered miles every day, traipsed the Great Wall and watched pandas, among other exotic (to us) exploits. And that’s what vacations are for – time away from the desk to, as an old friend once described it, get a chance to rub our fur in a different direction for a while.      Who knew we were so rare?      The folks at Vox report, based on recent federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data, that fewer Americans are taking weeklong vacations than in previous decades, for a range of reasons including fear of career repercussions to jobs that don’t offer accrued vacation days. According to Vox:      “Nine million Americans took a week off in July 1976, the peak month each year for summer travel. Yet in July 2014, just seven million did. Keeping in mind that 60 million more Americans have jobs today than in 1976, that adds up to a huge decline in the share of workers taking vacations.      “Some rough calculations show, in fact, that about 80 percent of workers once took an annual weeklong vacation — and now, just 56 percent do.”      American workers receive an average of 14 vacation days a year, according to annual studies by Expedia. The average for the industrialized world is 20 days, led by generous time-off policies in many European countries. Yet Americans last year only used, on average, 10 of their 14 vacation. Many opted to leave the days in the bank, planning to use them later on, or hoping to cash them in at retirement.      That's what vacations are for - time away from the desk to, as an old friend once described it, get a chance to rub our fur in a different direction for a while.      But others cite difficulty in scheduling the time away (conflicts with fellow workers’ time off and synchronizing vacation time with working family members), lack of money to pay for trips, and job insecurity. When it comes time for layoffs, you don’t want to be the person deemed most expendable.      Glassdoor conducted its own survey and found some different results: It says Americans took only about half of their allotted vacation time, though the reasons were similar to Expedia’s findings. When we’re on vacation, most of us still stay connected to work through email or other methods (guilty of that myself). Glassdoor found that those who reported working while on vacation cited the sense that no one could do their work while they were away (33%) and fear of falling behind (28%), among other reasons – including fear of getting fired.      And that’s not healthy. When we work all the time and skip vacations, we often become burned out, resulting in reduced productivity and increased stress that can affect our physical health and personal relationships.      Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to go check the office vacation calendar for next year. It’s never too early to plan.

But Chinese people appear to be even less willing to take time off.      China — which is hosting the World Leisure Games in Qingdao this weekend — has a work culture even less vacation-friendly than the U.S. Over 72% of Chinese workers have not taken a paid vacation in the last three years, according to a report by Xinhua, the state news agency, cited by the New York Times. Less than 14% of Chinese workers took a paid vacation in the last three years. Workers in China who have been employed continuously for one year are entitled to paid annual leave, according to the China Law Blog.      The situation is better — if far from ideal — in the U.S. Employees only use 51% of their eligible paid vacation time and paid time off, according to another recent survey of 2,300 workers who receive paid vacation. The survey was carried out by research firm Harris Interactive for the careers website Glassdoor. What’s more, 61% of Americans work while they’re on vacation, despite complaints from family members; one-in-four report being contacted by a colleague about a work-related matter while taking time off, while one-in-five have been contacted by their boss.      Workers appear to be getting more skittish when it comes to asking for time off. And employers too are clamping down: Summer Fridays are dead in the water, according to a 2015 survey of 15,723 Americans surveyed by Google Consumer Surveys in May 2015 for vacation site Priceline.com.      Some 40% of Americans will leave vacation time on the table, a third study found, citing a post-recession “work martyr complex” among worker who feel tied to their desk. The study by GfK Public Affairs and Corporate Communications and the U.S. Travel Association — which obviously has a vested interest in workers using up all their paid vacation time — found that one-third of the 1,000-plus respondents say they cannot afford to take their time, 40% fear returning to a mountain of work and 35% believe no one else can do their work.      Also see: The Moneyologist: How many people should go on vacation together?      This complex is reinforced by company culture and lack of encouragement from management to take time off, the GfK survey found. Even though senior business leaders overwhelmingly recognize the importance of using time off, two-thirds of American employees said their company says nothing about the need to take vacation days or discourages using them. In fact, one-third of senior business leaders state they never or rarely talk with employees about the benefits of taking time off.      Most American workers receive around 10 paid work days a year and six federal holidays, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a nonprofit left-of-center think tank in Washington, D.C. So based on Bureau of Labor Statistics’ current average weekly earnings, they’re leaving more than 1,300 on the table by only taking half their paid time off. This amounts to more than 52 billion, according to economic researcher Oxford Economics, “All Work, No Pay: The Impact of Forfeited Time Off” — commissioned by the U.S. Travel Association and sponsored by American Express.      Workers in the European Union are legally guaranteed at least 20 paid vacation days a year — and 25 or even 30 days a year in some European countries. Chinese workers who have been employed between one and 10 years are entitled to five days, and entitled to two weeks between 10 and 20 years’ service, the China Law Blog notes.      People not used to taking time off may not understand that paid vacation is actually built into their compensation package. Under the The Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. is also one of the few developed countries that does not require employers to provide paid time off (see chart, below). Still, 91% of full-time U.S. workers receive paid vacation, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, but only 49% of low-wage workers — those in the bottom fourth of earners — get paid vacation.      Why don’t they take what’s due? “Fear,” says Scott Dobroski, career trends analyst at Glassdoor. “That’s the underscoring theme.” Some 28% of workers told Glassdoor they fear getting behind while they’re sitting on a beach, another 17% actually say they fear losing their job, 19% don’t take all of their days in the hopes that it will give them an edge for a promotion, while 13% are competitive and wanting to outperform colleagues. As workers shoulder a heavier workload post-recession, he says others are afraid of not meeting goals.      And that fear may not be misplaced, experts say. Citing cultural differences between Americans and Europeans is a “significant misreading” of the issue, says John Schmitt, senior economist at CEPR. “I don’t think that Americans love their families less than German or French workers who take all their vacation time,” he says. “Americans have less job security than European workers. That’s why they eat lunch at their desk and work late. And if you’re on vacation you are likely to miss important meetings.”      Most U.S. companies have an “employment-at-will” doctrine, meaning they can be fired for any reason or no reason at all, unless they have a written contract, they’re in a labor union that has other rules relating to conditions of employment or they’re fired because of some kind of discrimination. “We have almost no job security in the U.S., no legal requirement for severance pay and, with very few exceptions, can be laid off without notice,” Schmitt says. (Of course, most employees can also leave without notice, although two weeks’ notice is standard when resigning.)      “The inability to disconnect has led to a blurring of personal versus work life,” says Piera Palazzolo, senior vice president for marketing at Dale Carnegie Training. Since people take their work with them wherever they go, she says, they may simply decide to stay put. But what’s bad for the employee, she adds, is also bad for the employer. “Taking vacation is important for creativity and energy levels,” Palazzolo says. “They may be going through the motions at work, but not taking time off can lead to burnout.” In fact, more than half of American workers say just that — that they are burned out and overworked.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. As if there weren't enough of them in the world already, scientists have succeeded in cloning flies. The alike fruit flies are the first insects ever cloned, says the Canadian team that created them. The question everyone asks is why anyone would want to clone flies in the first place. She hopes that the insects , which are very easy to experiment with , will help to adjust the cloning process in other animals and even in humans, where the technique is being researched to aid production of therapeutic   stem cells. In cloning, the DNA-containing nucleus of an adult cell is injected into an egg whose own nucleus  has been removed. At the moment, the majority of cloned mice, sheep and other animals die before birth. It is thought this is because the adult DNA is not properly 'reprogrammed'. Using flies, researchers might discover genes that are important for this reprogramming, and that have matches in other animals. That is because it is relatively easy in flies to knock out the function of a single gene and then attempt cloning with these cells, which will test whether that gene is important. If such genes are confirmed, then in theory cloned mammalian embryos  might be grown in selected solutions that change the activity of those genes to improve the technique's success rate. Although some groups have attempted to clone insects before, Lloyd says this is the first time it has been successful. The team used a slight difference on the standard cloning process: they transferred nuclei taken from embryos rather than fully-grown adult cells. They sucked several nuclei (pl)out of developing fly embryos, and injected them into a fertilized  fly egg. From over 800 early attempts, they cloned five adult insects, the group reports in the journal Genetics. The scientists cloned flies because  _  .

While it may be played by children, it is not specific to India and does not share the cultural context of Aksharit.

Another option for buying ZBrush online would be through authorized online resellers of digital software such as Toolfarm (https://www.toolfarm.com/), Turbosquid (https://www.turbosquid.com/), or Novedge (https://www.novedge.com/). Like with physical stores, it is crucial to verify that the online reseller is authorized to sell ZBrush licenses to avoid any complications or counterfeit software. To answer your last question, whether these two questions are paraphrases of each other, my answer is *no*. The reason is that one question asks for the best place to buy ZBrush within the US, possibly considering both physical and online locations. In contrast, the second question specifically asks for the best place to buy ZBrush online.

Movie title: Moondru Mugam Movie plot: Arun (Rajinikanth), son of a rich businessman Ramanathan (Thengai Srinivasan), returns to India after 10 years in America, but as a saint. His shocked father enlists a charming press reporter, Rekha (Radhika Sarathkumar) to change him back to normal. She first sets up an interview, which he thwarts. Later, on the pretense of taking him to a temple, she plans another set up. On the way to the temple, she pretends that the car has broken down and he leaves to roam around a bit when sees a crying child and offers a chocolate. Suddenly he is swarmed by more children and other villagers who confront him of being a child-kidnapper. Using the event, Rekha cuts Arun's beard off, a symbol of piety. After a few more set up events, he renounces his sainthood. Later, Arun goes to work and is puzzled about why his father has been sending money to a lady named Sagaya Mary for over twenty years. The scene shifts to a parallel scenario, wherein a man informs Sagaya Mary (Kamala Kamesh) that someone has proposed to her nephew John (again Rajinikanth). When asked about John's parents, she opens up about her brother and John's father, Alex Pandian (also portrayed by Rajinikanth). A flashback ensues that explains Alex Pandian's story. Alex Pandian is a scrupulous police officer. He is ruthless on criminals and brings upon him the wrath of their mob boss, Egambaram (Senthamarai). After repeated confrontations, Egambaram kills him and as he exhales his last breadth, Alex Pandian vows that he will be born again to take revenge. When Alex Pandian dies so does his wife after giving birth to twins. Ramanathan's wife gives birth in the same hospital but the child dies, just like the other two times she had been pregnant. Sagaya Mary hands over one of Alex Pandian's twin children to them and he is christened Arun, while she raises the other child, John. On Arun's 25th birthday party he gets a divine epiphany that makes him realize he is the reincarnation of Alex Pandian. He is asked to meet a woman named Smitha at a hotel but it proves...

Which olympic cyclist was nicknamed The Flying Scotsman What is the answer?","output":"The Olympic cyclist nicknamed \\"The Flying Scotsman\\" is Graeme Obree. Born on September 11, 1965, in Nuneaton, England, he grew up in Scotland and became a prominent track cyclist representing the country. Graeme Obree's claim to fame was his unconventional approach to cycling, which helped him achieve great success in the early 1990s. He innovated several unique cycling positions, including the \\"tuck\\" and \\"superman\\" positions, which gained attention for their aerodynamic advantages and improved his speed on the track. During his career, Obree set multiple world records: 1. On July 17, 1993, he broke the world hour record by covering 51.596 kilometers (32.034 miles) in one hour. This achievement took place at the Vikingskipet velodrome in Hamar, Norway. 2. In April 1994, he broke the world 4,000-meter individual pursuit record with a time of 4:22.668. This accomplishment took place at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Sicily, Italy. Obree also won several prestigious titles: 1. He won two gold medals at the UCI Track Cycling World Championships, claiming the individual pursuit title in 1993 and 1995. 2. He was a British national track champion in the individual pursuit for three years (1993, 1994, and 1995). In addition to his cycling career, Obree was known for building his bikes from scratch and using unconventional materials. His most famous bike, \\"Old Faithful,\\" was made using parts from a washing machine and scrap metal, showcasing his ingenuity and unique approach to cycling.

The charge passing through the circuit always passes through an appliance (which acts as a resistor) or through another resistor, which limits the amount of current that can flow through a circuit. Appliances are designed to keep current at a relatively low level for safety purposes. The appropriate voltage and resistance in a circuit keeps the current in control and keeps the circuit safe. It is possible, however, for something to happen that causes the wire bringing the current in to come into contact with either the wire carrying the current out or the ground wire, thus causing what is called a short circuit .

Russian authorities said the hands were likely disposed of by a local forensics lab, bucking proper protocol.      According to the Siberian Times, the fisherman found the bag of hands on a small river island near the city of Khabarovsk, Russia, located in the country's far southeast about 18.6 miles (30 kilometers) from the Chinese border. The Amur River is a popular local fishing destination, the Times reported.      Initially, the fisherman saw only one hand sticking up out of the snow there, and discovered the full bag soon after. Photos taken at the scene and shared anonymously to Russian media reveal the discovery in brutal detail. In one image, the 54 hands lie in a haphazard pile in the snow like leathery catcher's mitts, seemingly upended from the bag; in another photo, the hands have been lined up in neat rows. [27 Oddest Medical Case Reports]      While many social media spectators (naturally) suspect foul play, officials from the Investigative Committee of The Russian Federation — a government agency responsible for criminal investigations — have said that the hands appear to have been improperly disposed of by a forensics lab in Khabarovsk.      \\"The biological objects (hands) found are not of a criminal origin,\\" the Investigative Committee wrote in a post (as translated) on the messaging app Telegram, \\"but were disposed of in a manner not provided for by law.\\"      Indeed, medical bandages and plastic hospital-style shoes were discovered near the hands. According to the Siberian Times, it's not unheard of for forensics labs in Russia to cut off the hands of unknown corpses in order to retain fingerprint information after the rest of the body has been discarded. Despite this possible explanation, investigators have been able to lift fingerprints from only one of the 27 pairs of hands. Little is known about the hands' previous owners.      \\"Based on the [investigation] results, a legal assessment will be made of the actions of officials of the forensic medical institution in the city of Khabarovsk responsible for the disposal of these biological objects,\\" the Investigative Committee wrote.

Question 2: When rh+ fetal blood mixes with rh- mother's blood, there is a problem. Why doesn't this occur if the fetal blood group is different from the mother's? Possible answers: (i). no. (ii). yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"No, the answers to the two questions are not the same as they address two different aspects of understanding and the consequences of blood types and Rh factors. Let's delve into this topic in detail: 1. Question 1: When and why did we evolve Rh negative blood? Rh negative blood type is a result of genetic variation and natural selection like most other human traits. The Rh stands for 'Rhesus', named after the Rhesus monkeys on which the initial tests were performed. The Rh factor is a protein that can be present on the surface of red blood cells. If your blood cells have this protein, you are Rh positive. If your blood cells don’t have it, you are Rh negative. The exact time of the 'evolution' of Rh negative blood is not known. However, the evolutionary mechanism of Rh negative blood has likely developed in geographically confined populations or could be linked to random mutation. In terms of why it evolved, like many genetic changes, it is believed to have possibly offered some sort of survival advantage to those with Rh negative blood in certain environments or situations. However, current understanding doesn't pin down a definitive evolutionary advantage of being Rh negative. It's important to acknowledge that the process of evolution involves a great deal of randomness and chance, and not all traits that evolve necessarily have a clear 'why' or purpose behind their evolution. 2. Question 2: When Rh+ fetal blood mixes with Rh- mother's blood, there is a problem. Why doesn't this occur if the fetal blood group is different from the mother's? This is due to the nature of the immune system response to Rh factors versus general blood types. In the case of a mother having Rh- blood and carrying an Rh+ baby, if fetal blood cells breach the placental barrier into the mother's circulation, her body might identify those Rh+ cells as foreign bodies. Her immune system might then produce antibodies against these cells, potentially leading to the removal and destruction of Rh+ red blood cells. This is a condition known as hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). It rarely occurs in first pregnancies but is more likely with subsequent pregnancies if the mother has been sensitized by the first pregnancy. On the contrary, ABO blood type differences between mother and child (e.g., a type A baby with a type O mother) could theoretically cause similar issues, but in practice, they usually don’t. This is because ABO antibodies (which people naturally produce against the A and/or B antigens if they don’t have them on their own cells) are of the IgM type, which don't cross the placenta. On the other hand, anti-Rh antibodies are IgG, which can cross the placenta and attack the fetal red cells.  Overall, both questions delve into fascinating and varied aspects of human biology and genetics, each with their distinct explanations and reasons. Thus, their answers cannot be the same."},{"instruction":"I know that the answer to the question \\"Of osage-orange and beech, which species has the same type of sapwood as black locust?\\" is in \\"The term heartwood derives solely from its position and not from any vital importance to the tree.

De Rust is also known for the meandering Meiringspoort pass . Meiringspoort is a gateway that connects the Klein Karoo ( little Karoo ) and the ( great ) Karoo through a gorge with a 25 km road crossing the same river 25 times in the span of the 25 km. This area is also well known for ostrich farming and most of the farmers in the area either farm exclusively with ostriches or as a sideline to their existing farming .  - A desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or \\"cold deserts\\". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.  - The Karoo (; from a Khoikhoi word, possibly \\"garo\\" \\"desert\\") is a semi-desert natural region of South Africa. There is no exact definition of what constitutes the Karoo, and therefore its extent is also not precisely defined. The Karoo is partly defined by its topography, geology, and climate  above all, its low rainfall, arid air, cloudless skies, and extremes of heat and cold. The Karoo also hosted a well-preserved ecosystem hundreds of million years ago which is now represented by many fossils.  - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern.

If you're trying to start a flirty conversation, try including a flirty comment to help get the ball rolling.  For instance, if you're going out with someone on the basketball team, you could write, \\"The gym sure heated up when you came on the court today!\\" Be genuine and specific. You don't have to stick to looks, but make it something specific. For instance, instead of saying, \\"You're cute,\\" you could say, \\"You have a beautiful smile.\\" Now, you probably don't want to start sending texts at 2 in the morning unless you know he's already up. Texting at night, though, can be more intimate and invite flirting.  Something about the nighttime will invite you both to let loose a little. Try waiting until gets dark before you send a text. You could write, \\"I'm all snuggled up in my bed. What are you doing?\\" In a text, you may be tempted to present yourself as sillier, poutier, or more sexualized than you are in person. You really don't need to do that, especially since, if that's all he knows about you, he's going to expect a different person if you do meet. For example, you don't need to use a million exclamation marks to show how excited you are if you really aren't that excitable in real life. While you don't want to make yourself out to be something you're not, it is okay to play up your fun side in texts. Texting lends itself to shorter, lighter conversations, so bringing that side out will make him want to get to know you more. For instance, say you're spending the night home in your pajamas. Instead of texting about that, tell him about the fun night you had out last night, such as \\"Went out and had fun with the girls last night, but I kept wishing you were there.\\" Teasing can help create intimacy, as long as the guy has a sense of humor. One thing you can tease him about is a mistake he let through on one of his texts, such as a goofy autocorrect. For instance, if he sends a text that says, \\"I think your nets are sexy\\" when he probably meant \\"eyes,\\" you can tease him about it. You could say, \\"Oh, so you think my nets are sexy huh? What part of body is my nets?\\" Giving him a nickname may seem silly, but it does let him know that you like him. You stick to something more manly or go over the top with something cutesy and silly. Either way, try dropping it in a text to help him know how you feel.  For instance, you could use \\"hunk\\" or \\"Thor\\" as more manly reference. For something more cutesy, you could use \\"sugar pie\\" or \\"babe.\\" Sending the same text every day at about the same time can get boring. Try breaking up your routine by sending texts at different times of day or by changing up the message so he'll stay interested.  For instance, a friendly, \\"Good morning, babe!\\" is a nice way to say hello in the morning, but you wouldn't want to send that text every morning. Change it up little with texts like, \\"Wake up, sunshine!\\" or \\"Can't wait to see you at school!\\" If you see something that reminds you of him, snap a picture. Send it his way with a side note, telling him that the pic made you think about him, which will make him smile.  Stick to pics of things he's interested in or inside jokes you have. Skip anything to serious, such as wedding rings or cakes. If you're texting back and forth, you need to hold up your end of the conversation. Just giving him one-word replies doesn't help out the conversation. Instead, contribute to what's being said, ask a question, or introduce a new topic if you have nothing to say.  For instance, if he says, \\"So, do you like movies?\\" don't just say, \\"yes.\\" Instead, give him room to keep going, by saying something like, \\"Yes, especially when I'm seeing them with cuties like you! When are we going?\\" Alternatively, ask him a question about himself, such as \\"So what's your favorite type of food?\\" You may be tempted to start out with sexualized texts, but it's a good idea to wait a little while. In fact, it's probably a good idea to be in a relationship before you start sending sexy texts.  Flirting is obviously fine, such as telling him you like his eyes. What you may want to avoid is overtly sexual texts where you start talking about genitalia and trying to engage him in sexual chat. Of course, how you text is up to you, but you may catch him off guard by sending these kinds of texts up front. Even when you're in a relationship, consider skipping the sexy pics. Once those pictures are out in the world, you can't take them back, and you have no guarantee that the other person won't release them. While sending flirtatious pictures is fine, such as blowing him a kiss, avoid anything that you wouldn't want your grandma to see if it got out on the internet--because it can get out and she could see it.","output":"This article suggests various ways to flirt with a guy through texts, such as giving compliments, texting at night, being genuine, teasing, giving nicknames, changing up the message, sending pictures, holding up your end of the conversation, and avoiding overtly sexual texts."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Cash is the money we use to buy things we need or want, like toys, yummy snacks, or going to fun places. Here's a plan to get some cash: 1. Do chores at home: You can help mommy and daddy with small tasks like cleaning up your toys, making your bed, or helping to set the dinner table. They might give you some cash called \\"allowance\\" to thank you for your help. 2. Save your birthday or holiday money: When you get money as a gift on your birthday or during the holidays, you can save it in a piggy bank or a special place. This way, you can add up the cash you get and use it later when you really want to buy something. 3. Sell old toys or clothes: You can ask your parents to help you sell your old toys or clothes that you don't use anymore. You can have a yard sale or sell them online, and you'll get cash from the people who buy them. 4. Create crafts or homemade treats: With the help of your parents, you can make crafts like colorful bracelets or yummy cookies. Then, you can sell them to your friends, family, or neighbors to earn some cash. 5. Start a lemonade stand: On a sunny day, you can make a lemonade stand in front of your house with the help of your parents. You can sell cups of lemonade to the people passing by, and they will give you cash if they buy a cup of your tasty drink.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: I first came across the concept of pay-what-you-can cafes last summer in Boone, N.C., where I ate at F.A.R.M (Feed All Regardless of Means) Cafe. You can volunteer to earn your meal, pay the suggested price(10) or less, or you can overpay--paying it forward for a future customer's meal. My only regret after eating there was not having a chance to give my time. So as soon as Healthy World Cafe opened in York in April, I signed up for a volunteer shift . F.A.R.M and healthy World are part of a growing trend of community cafes. In 2003, Denise Cerreta opened the first in Salt Lake City. Cerreta now runs the One World Everybody Eats Foundation, helping others copy her pay-what-you can model. \\"I think the community cafe is truly a hand up, not a handout,\\" Cerreta said. She acknowledged that soup kitchens  have a place in society, but people typically don't feel good about going there. \\"One of the values of the community cafe is that we have another approach,\\" she said. \\"Everyone eats here, no one needs to know whether you volunteered, overpaid or underpaid.\\" The successful cafes not only address hunger and food insecurity but also become necessary parts of their neighborhood -- whether it's a place to learn skills or hear live music. Some teach cooking to seniors; some offer free used books. Eating or working there is a reminder that we are all in this world together. My 10 am-1pm shift at World-Healthy-Cafe began with the cafe manager -- one of the two paid staff members. Our volunteer crew wasn't the most orderly, but we managed to prepare and serve meals with a lot of laughs in between. At the end of my shift, I ordered my earned meal at the counter, together with other volunteers. After lunch, I walked out the door, with a handful of new friends, music in my head and a satisfied belly and heart.

If \\"An elderly man swims with others.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A person swimming.\\"?","output":"Yes, it logically follows that \\"A person is swimming\\" based on the given statement, \\"An elderly man swims with others.\\" Here's an explanation of why this is true: First, let's break down the given statement: \\"An elderly man swims with others.\\" 1. An elderly man: This phrase implies that there is, indeed, a man who is considered elderly. This man is the primary subject of the statement. 2. Swims: This verb signifies that the action taking place is swimming. The elderly man is engaging in the activity of swimming. By definition, swimming is an action typically performed by a person who moves through water by moving their limbs. 3. With others: This phrase means that the elderly man is not swimming alone; he is accompanied by other individuals. The word \\"others\\" implies that there could be multiple people involved, but it doesn't specify the exact number or nature of these individuals (whether they are also elderly, young, male, female, etc.). Now, let's consider the statement that we want to check for logical validity: \\"A person is swimming.\\" In order to determine whether this statement logically follows from the given statement, we can ask ourselves the following question: Is it true that at least one person is swimming based on the information provided in the given statement? The answer is yes. Since the given statement mentions that an elderly man is swimming with others, we already have the presence of at least one person involved in the activity of swimming – the elderly man himself is considered a person. When the statement also mentions \\"with others,\\" we can infer that there are additional people involved in the swimming activity. However, even without considering the \\"others,\\" the presence of the elderly man is enough to conclude that a person is swimming. In summary, based on the given statement (\\"An elderly man swims with others.\\"), it logically follows that \\"A person is swimming.\\" The key to this conclusion is understanding that an elderly man is considered a person, and the action of swimming confirms that a person is engaging in the swimming activity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora? , can you please find it?   Lissitzky was born on November 23, 1890 in Pochinok, a small Jewish community 50 kilometres (31 mi) southeast of Smolensk, former Russian Empire. During his childhood, he lived and studied in the city of Vitebsk, now part of Belarus, and later spent 10 years in Smolensk living with his grandparents and attending the Smolensk Grammar School, spending summer vacations in Vitebsk. Always expressing an interest and talent in drawing, he started to receive instruction at 13 from Yehuda Pen, a local Jewish artist, and by the time he was 15 was teaching students himself. In 1909, he applied to an art academy in Saint Petersburg, but was rejected. While he passed the entrance exam and was qualified, the law under the Tsarist regime only allowed a limited number of Jewish students to attend Russian schools and universities. Like many other Jews then living in the Russian Empire, Lissitzky went to study in Germany. He left in 1909 to study architectural engineering at a Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt, Germany. During the summer of 1912, Lissitzky, in his own words, \\"wandered through Europe\\", spending time in Paris and covering 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) on foot in Italy, teaching himself about fine art and sketching architecture and landscapes that interested him. His interest in ancient Jewish culture had originated during the contacts with a Paris-based group of Russian Jews led by sculptor Ossip Zadkine, a lifetime friend of Lissitzky since early childhood, who exposed Lissitzky to conflicts between different groups within the diaspora. Also in 1912 some of his pieces were included for the first time in an exhibit by the St. Petersburg Artists Union; a notable first step. He remained in Germany until the outbreak of World War I, when he was forced to return home through Switzerland and the Balkans, along with many of his countrymen, including other expatriate artists born in the former Russian Empire, such as Wassily Kandinsky and Marc Chagall.Upon his return to Moscow, Lissitzky attended the Polytechnic...

Question: This article: Almost as soon as they returned home, the Beatles faced a fierce backlash from US religious and social conservatives (as well as the Ku Klux Klan) over a comment Lennon had made in a March interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave. \\"Christianity will go,\\" Lennon had said. \\"It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. ... Jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.\\" The comment went virtually unnoticed in England, but when US teenage fan magazine Datebook printed it five months later – on the eve of the group's August US tour – it sparked a controversy with Christians in the American \\"Bible Belt\\". The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service. Epstein accused Datebook of having taken Lennon's words out of context; at a press conference Lennon pointed out, \\"If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it.\\" Lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: \\"If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry.\\"As preparations were made for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard.

Select the topic that this about: Marsh  amp; McLennan Cos. #39; new boss Michael Cherkasky may be the prototype of the new CEO -- where the E stands for enforcement.","output":"Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc.'s new CEO Michael Cherkasky is an embodiment of the growing trend towards businesses adopting a regulatory and enforcement-driven approach in their management strategies. Cherkasky, given his background in compliance and enforcement, is an excellent example of the type of leader companies are seeking to navigate the complex and evolving regulatory landscape. Cherkasky's career and leadership style provide valuable insights into the increasing importance of regulatory compliance and corporate governance in today's business world. His background as a prosecutor, coupled with his time spent working in the private sector in risk management and consulting roles, lends him a unique perspective on the challenges posed by the intersection of corporate strategy and regulatory enforcement. As a former prosecutor and chief of the investigations division in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, Cherkasky had a strong record in the realm of law enforcement. During his tenure, he prosecuted white collar crimes and organized crime, developing a keen understanding of the methods used by criminals to exploit weaknesses in corporate governance and compliance programs. This experience has likely informed his approach to corporate leadership, placing a strong emphasis on the importance of robust compliance and ethical conduct. After leaving the public sector, Cherkasky joined Kroll Inc., a global risk consulting company, as the president and CEO. His leadership at Kroll further solidified his credentials in the corporate world, where he led the company to significant growth and eventual acquisition by Marsh & McLennan Companies in 2004. This merger brought Cherkasky to Marsh & McLennan, eventually leading him to his current role as the CEO. Given the various challenges related to corporate governance and compliance, companies are now seeking leaders who possess both the knowledge and experience to navigate these complex issues. Cherkasky's background and experiences make him the prototype for the next generation of CEOs, where the \\"E\\" stands for enforcement. The following factors have contributed to the rise of CEOs like Michael Cherkasky: 1. Increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement: Government bodies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Department of Justice, have ramped up enforcement actions on corporate compliance, emphasizing the importance of proactive and comprehensive risk management strategies. CEOs with enforcement experience are more likely to understand the importance of preempting potential risks and addressing them effectively. 2. Growing complexity of global operations: As businesses grow and operate in an increasingly connected global market, their exposure to varied regulatory environments increases. The need for a robust and sophisticated compliance infrastructure becomes paramount to mitigating risks and ensuring seamless operations. Leaders with experience in the realm of enforcement are better equipped to build and maintain such infrastructures. 3. Corporate scandals and greater demand for ethical leadership: High-profile corporate scandals have resulted in a loss of trust in business leaders. Stakeholders now demand greater transparency, accountability, and ethical conduct from corporations. CEOs with a strong background in enforcement and compliance are seen as more likely to prioritize ethical behavior and maintain a strong compliance culture within their organizations. In conclusion, the appointment of Michael Cherkasky as the CEO of Marsh & McLennan Companies marks a significant development in the business world, as it highlights the increasing demand for executives with a strong background in regulatory enforcement. Company leadership now requires a deep understanding of the complexities surrounding corporate governance and compliance, and Cherkasky's background and experience make him an excellent example of the next generation of CEOs. Such leaders are better equipped to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of regulatory enforcement and maintain a strong culture of ethical conduct within their organizations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sarcopenia is a natural physiological process that occurs as people age, and it can affect both their physical health and overall quality of life. The term sarcopenia is derived from the Greek words \\"sarx,\\" meaning flesh, and \\"penia,\\" meaning poverty or deficiency. This decline in muscle mass and strength typically begins around the age of 30 and progresses more rapidly after the age of 60. Sarcopenia can be attributed to several factors, including: 1. Hormonal changes: As people age, hormonal production declines, particularly the hormones testosterone and estrogen, which play a crucial role in maintaining muscle mass and strength. Additionally, the decrease in human growth hormone (HGH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) can lead to reduced muscle synthesis. 2. Neuromuscular changes: Aging is associated with a loss of motor neurons, which results in decreased neural stimulation of muscle fibers. This decline in neural input can contribute to muscle atrophy and reduced muscle strength. 3. Reduced physical activity: As people get older, their overall level of physical activity often decreases. This reduction in activity can lead to muscle disuse and, subsequently, further muscle loss. 4. Nutritional factors: Older adults may have reduced nutrient intake, especially protein, due to changes in appetite, taste perception, and digestion. Inadequate protein intake can hinder the body's ability to repair and build muscle tissues. 5. Chronic inflammation: Age-related inflammation can contribute to muscle breakdown and impair the body's ability to regenerate muscle tissues. The consequences of sarcopenia include: 1. Decreased functional capacity: With reduced muscle mass and strength, activities of daily living, such as climbing stairs, carrying groceries, and maintaining balance, can become increasingly difficult. 2. Increased risk of falls and injuries: Muscle weakness and poor balance are associated with a higher risk of falls, which can result in fractures and other injuries. 3. Loss of independence: As sarcopenia progresses, older adults may become more reliant on others for assistance with daily tasks, reducing their independence and overall quality of life. 4. Increased risk of chronic diseases: Sarcopenia is associated with an increased risk of developing chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and osteoporosis. To reduce the risk and progression of sarcopenia, it is essential to incorporate regular physical activity, particularly resistance training, into one's routine. Additionally, consuming adequate amounts of protein and maintaining a balanced diet can help support muscle health. Other strategies include managing chronic conditions to reduce inflammation and consulting healthcare providers regarding hormonal therapies or interventions if necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What was the original name of the structure that Titus inaugurated the completion of? from the following article ?  The inaugural games were held, on the orders of the Roman Emperor Titus, to celebrate the completion in AD 80 (81 according to some sources) of the Colosseum, then known as the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium). Vespasian began construction of the amphitheatre around AD 70 and it was completed by his son Titus who became emperor following Vespasian's death in AD 79. Titus' reign began with months of disasters – including the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a fire in Rome, and an outbreak of plague – he inaugurated the completion of the structure with lavish games that lasted for more than one hundred days, perhaps in an attempt to appease the Roman public and the gods. Little literary evidence survives of the activities of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians. Only three contemporary or near-contemporary accounts of the games survive. The works of Suetonius and Cassius Dio focus on major events, while Martial provides some fragments of information on individual entertainments and the only detailed record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena known to survive: the fight between Verus and Priscus.

The sentence fragment \\"from charismatic rising star Jake Gyllenhaal\\" seems to have a positive sentiment. Here's why: 1. The use of the term \\"charismatic\\". Charisma is universally viewed as an attractive trait, therefore the use of this term implies a positive sentiment. 2. \\"Rising star\\" is another term with positive connotations. It implies that Jake Gyllenhaal is gaining popularity and is well-regarded in his field. 3. The use of \\"Jake Gyllenhaal\\", in this context, is likely well-known or noteworthy, which again contributes to the positive sentiment. However, this is only a fragment of a sentence, and assessing the sentiment could be more accurate if we had the sentence in full.

I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying.

When one of the bottles begins to emit an eerie supernatural glow, Mears tells Petrie \\"They've found us again.\\" Knowing an evil presence is there, they decide to fight it. Two years earlier, in the small town of Salem's Lot (formally known as Jerusalem's Lot) in Maine in the United States, Ben Mears, an author, has returned to the town after a long absence to write a book about the Marsten House, an ominous old property on a hilltop which has a reputation for being haunted. Mears attempts to rent the house but finds that another new arrival in town, the mysterious Richard Straker (James Mason), has recently bought it. Straker also opens an antique shop with his oft-mentioned but always absent business partner, Kurt Barlow. Meanwhile, Mears moves into a boarding house in town run by Eva Miller (Marie Windsor), and develops a romantic relationship with a local woman, Susan Norton (Bonnie Bedelia). He befriends Susan's father, Dr. Bill Norton (Ed Flanders), and also renews his old friendship with his former school teacher, Jason Burke (Lew Ayres). Mears tells Burke that he feels the Marsten House is somehow inherently evil, and recalls how he was once traumatized inside the house when he was a child. After a large crate is delivered to the Marsten House one night, an increasing number of the townsfolk begin to disappear or die in strange circumstances. Both Mears and Straker are initially the main suspects as they are new in town, but it becomes clear that the crate contained Straker's mysterious business partner, Kurt Barlow (Reggie Nalder), an ancient master vampire who has come to the town after having sent Straker to make way for his arrival.

Possible A: to do somersaults, feel comfortable, you're cold, were cold, more comfortable  Why is \\"feel comfortable\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Feel comfortable\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly addresses the primary reason someone wants to get warm when they are cold. When our bodies are exposed to cold temperatures, various physiological responses occur, such as shivering or the constriction of blood vessels, in an attempt to maintain our core body temperature. These reactions can cause discomfort, making us feel uneasy, stiff, and generally uncomfortable. By getting warm, we can alleviate this discomfort and return our body to a more balanced state, which is commonly referred to as feeling comfortable. Humans naturally seek comfort, and maintaining an optimal body temperature falls within this pursuit. The other provided answers, such as \\"to do somersaults,\\" \\"you're cold,\\" \\"were cold,\\" and \\"more comfortable,\\" are either unrelated or partially related to the primary reason for seeking warmth.

Write an article that answers the following question: How did the revolutionaries think the battle would go?","output":"Title: The Revolutionaries' Vision: How They Forecasted the Battle's Outcome Introduction: The revolutionary period was marked by an ardent desire for freedom, justice, and equality. The revolutionaries were bold and idealistic, fighting against inequality and tyranny. As battles and uprisings unfolded, these impassioned individuals had their unique perspectives on how the conflicts might unfold. In this article, we explore the thoughts of revolutionaries on the anticipated course of the battle and the factors that influenced their perspective. 1. Revolutionaries' optimism and belief in their cause: Revolutionaries often displayed unwavering confidence in the righteousness of their cause. They firmly believed that their actions would lead to a victorious outcome. Their optimism stemmed from the conviction that the masses' collective power would be enough to overthrow corrupt governments and usher in new, just societies. The revolutionaries’ optimism fueled their dedication and resilience in battle, enabling them to persevere and overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. 2. The influence of revolutionary leaders: Charismatic leaders, such as George Washington in the American Revolution or Vladimir Lenin in the Russian Revolution, played a pivotal role in shaping the revolutionaries' mindset. These influential figures inspired their followers by presenting clear visions of future success and instilling a sense of purpose and unity. The revolutionaries trusted and admired their leaders, which bolstered their confidence in triumphing over their adversaries. 3. The impact of previous victories and setbacks: The outcomes of past battles often significantly influenced how the revolutionaries estimated the future course of the struggle. When revolutionary forces emerged victorious, such as the French Revolution’s storming of the Bastille, hope and determination surged among fighters and supporters. These moments of triumph reinforced the idea that their cause was destined to succeed. Conversely, when the tide turned against the revolutionaries, as it did during the American Revolution's initial stages where the Continental Army suffered significant losses, they were compelled to regroup, reevaluate their strategies, and bolster their resolve. Setbacks made the revolutionaries more pragmatic and forced them to adapt to new challenges. 4. The role of international alliances: The stance of foreign nations significantly influenced how revolutionaries perceived the battle's trajectory. For instance, the American revolutionaries recognized their dependence on assistance from France, which proved pivotal in securing their ultimate victory. Revolutionaries closely observed the international landscape, seeking alliances to bolster their chances for success. The promise of international support elevated their morale and enhanced their expectations for a favorable outcome. 5. Revolutionary propaganda: Revolutionaries were adept at using propaganda to garner support, rally the masses, and sustain morale. Dramatizations of revolutionary victories often emphasized the underdog's triumph over their oppressors and framed the struggle as a moral imperative. These narratives instilled a sense of inevitability in the revolution’s ultimate success, shaping the revolutionaries' thoughts about how the battle would progress. Conclusion: The revolutionaries in various historical uprisings held diverse perspectives on their battles' predicted outcomes. These viewpoints were shaped by the strength in their cause, leadership, past successes and failures, international alliances, and propaganda. Revolutionaries consistently displayed a determination to persist despite the odds, enabling them to emerge victorious in many instances. Their unwavering belief in the righteousness of their cause and the desire for a better future propelled them forward to forge new, more equitable societies."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Hard to Kill Context: In 1983, Mason Storm, a Los Angeles police detective, investigates a mob meeting that takes place by a pier. He records a shadowy figure who assures the mob they can rely on his political support. Storm is spotted, but escapes. Unaware that he is monitored by corrupt cops, Mason informs his partner and then his friend Lt. O'Malley that he has evidence of corruption. While he goes shopping, a store is robbed, and one of the robbers shoots the clerk. Mason stops them and goes home, intent on celebrating with his wife, Felicia. Mason hides the videotape in his house. When he goes upstairs, a hit squad composed of corrupt policemen, including Jack Axel and Max Quentero, break in and proceed to murder Mason's wife and shoot him. Mason's young son, Sonny, hides until the danger passes. The corrupt policemen frame Mason, making it look like a murder-suicide. At the same time, assassins kill Storm's partner. At the hospital, Mason is first pronounced dead, but is then discovered to be alive, although unconscious. To prevent the assassins from finishing the job, Lieutenant O'Malley tells the medics to keep Mason's status a secret. Seven years later, Mason wakes from his coma. Andy, one of his nurses, makes a phone call, which is intercepted by corrupt police officers. They send Axel to finish the job and kill the nurses to whom Mason might have talked. Mason realizes that he is still in danger, but his muscles have atrophied to where he can barely use his arms. He staggers to an elevator, and when Andy sees her colleagues killed, she helps Mason escape. Needing time to recuperate, Andy brings Mason to a friend's house, where Mason uses his knowledge of acupuncture, moxibustion and other meditation techniques to recover his strength. While training, Mason hears a commercial for Senator Vernon Trent and recognizes the voice from the pier.

By Chuck Todd, Mark Murray, Domenico Montanaro, and Brooke Brower Mandel Ngan / AFP - Getty Images President Barack Obama speaks following a meeting with NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen in the Oval Office of the White House on May 31, 2013 in Washington, DC. *** Scattershot: Beginning the sixth month of his second term in office, President Obama today hosts -- along with Vice President Biden -- a daylong White House conference on mental health. This comes after Friday’s event on student loans, last Tuesday’s trip to New Jersey to talk about rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy, and the even earlier national-security speech at the National Defense University. And these different events raise this question: What is the White House’s overall message? Because right now it’s all over the place. The above events are all worthy, don’t get us wrong. But they seem disconnected from whatever larger narrative the president offered up in January during his inaugural and State of the Union. Team Obama seems like it’s doing plenty of one-day events, but it’s lacking a larger, well, vision thing. To be sure, the IRS/Benghazi/leak controversies have put the White House on the defensive over the last three weeks. But what is the larger message? That the economy is improving and the budget deficit is getting smaller? (The president hasn’t really leaned into those arguments, almost as if fearing he does, something bad will happen in the economy.) That immigration reform is necessary? (The White House is letting Congress work its will on the legislation, staying quiet so Republicans can deal with their internal politics without interference on this issue.) That Republicans and Democrats need to come together on the budget? (When is the last time we’ve heard the president speak on that topic? *** Why not go bold? The White House tells us that June will be about student loans and immigration (through the Senate), plus foreign affairs (meeting with China’s president in California, heading to the G-8 summit in Northern Ireland, going to Africa later this month). But here’s a second question we have for the White House: As it finds itself playing defense on the IRS controversy, why isn’t it also playing offense -- to seem like is trying to fix dysfunctional Washington? Why nothing on civil-servant reform? Why nothing on tax reform? Why not go big and bold on something or multiple things? The White House seems to be acting as if it’s powerless to really change things in Washington, which is one way to act if you are in the seventh or eighth year of a presidency. Of course, the White House would dispute the idea it’s given up on going big. But as the summer kicks in, it will only put more pressure on the White House to get its mojo back in the fall. *** GOP’s message is all over the place, too: If the White House’s message has been all over the place the last few weeks, so has the Republican Party’s. On the Sunday shows yesterday, Republicans hit the Obama administration on the IRS and leak-investigation controversies, but there was barely a word about Benghazi -- which happened to be the subject that kicked off the trio of controversies. Regarding the IRS, Republicans are divided on their line of attack. Was the Obama White House responsible for the IRS targeting of conservative-sounding groups? Or was it asleep at the wheel? But it can’t be both of those things. And regarding the Justice Department’s seizure of reporters’ phone records to investigate national-security leaks, Republicans (and now even some Democrats) are calling for Attorney General Eric Holder to step down. Yet don’t forget that Republicans were the ones who complained about national-security leaks and demanded investigations into them. All of these various and sundry GOP complaints seem to validate the argument coming from many Democrats -- that Republicans are simply throwing whatever they can against the wall to see what sticks. And House Oversight and Government Reform Chair Darrell Issa (R-CA) calling White House Press Secretary Jay Carney a “paid liar” only furthers that impression. *** This is what you get during second terms: But given these scattershot messages, here’s an important reminder: This is normally what you get during second terms. Your authors have covered two previous second terms -- Clinton’s and Bush’s. Both presidents tried to push a big domestic priority (education/child care for Clinton, Social Security privatization for Bush), and both failed. During those second terms, the political opposition threw the kitchen sink at the White House (Lewinsky/impeachment for Clinton, Iraq/Katrina for Bush). And these former presidents found their second terms reduced to locking in their first-term accomplishments, building on their legacies, and getting their judicial nominations cleared through Congress. *** Unrest in Turkey: Here is the world’s biggest story today: “Anger and resentment boiled over onto the street over the past three days [in Istanbul, Turkey], as the police barraged demonstrators with tear gas and streams from water cannons — and as the protesters attacked bulldozers and construction trailers lined up next to the last park in the city’s center,” the New York Times says. “In full public view, a long struggle over urban spaces is erupting as a broader fight over Turkish identity, where difficult issues of religion, social class and politics intersect. And while most here acknowledge that every Turkish ruling class has sought to put its stamp on Istanbul, there is a growing sense that none has done so as insistently as the current government, led by [Prime Minister] Erdogan’s Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party, despite growing resistance.” *** Eric Holder on the hot seat, again: As we alluded to above, Attorney General Eric Holder is receiving political heat, which is nothing new. But this time, some of it is coming from Democrats. The Sunday Times: “Over the course of four and a half years, no other member of President Obama’s cabinet has been at the center of so many polarizing episodes or the target of so much criticism. While the White House publicly backed Mr. Holder as he tried to smooth over the latest uproar amid new speculation about his future, some in the West Wing privately tell associates they wish he would step down, viewing him as politically maladroit. But the latest attacks may stiffen the administration’s resistance in the near term to a change for fear of emboldening critics.” Holder’s tenure has always been divisive inside the West Wing and that fact is now breaking out into the open with more blind quotes about Holder circulating this week. At the end of the first term, Holder had told the White House he wanted to stay on for just one more year (or so), which the president agreed to even as some of his political aides hoped differently. Replacing an AG is never easy, and of all the cabinet agencies, Justice is the hardest to “force” someone out (just ask Bill Clinton who failed to push Janet Reno out for YEARS). *** IRS remains in the news: Meanwhile, the IRS’s troubles aren’t going away. “The Internal Revenue Service spent an estimated 49 million on at least 220 conferences for employees over a three-year span beginning in fiscal 2010, according to a forthcoming report that will prompt fresh scrutiny of the already embattled agency,” the Washington Post reported on Sunday. “The findings come as the Obama administration is overhauling the agency after officials said dozens of groups were inappropriately scrutinized as they sought tax-exempt status. The admission forced the resignation of the agency’s acting commissioner and has sparked criminal and congressional investigations.” More from the paper: “[A]cting IRS commissioner Daniel Werfel acknowledged the report in a statement late Friday, but he did not share any of the findings. He called the spending ‘an unfortunate vestige from a prior era’ and said the agency has significantly curtailed conference spending in recent years.” In addition, per NBC’s Kelly O’Donnell, Issa’s committee has released a partial transcript of interviews between GOP congressional investigators and Cincinnati IRS employers. According to the GOP-run committee, one Cincy employee pointed to Washington, DC as being responsible for the targeting effort. (But Washington doesn’t necessarily mean White House.) And at 3:00 pm ET, the House Appropriations Committee holds another hearing on the IRS. *** Immigration bill to reach Senate floor on June 10: On “Meet the Press” yesterday, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said none of the controversies is affecting the immigration debate. “Well, first we're going to put immigration on the floor starting on June 10. I predict it will pass the Senate by July 4. We're hoping to get 70 votes, up to 70 votes, which means a lot of Republicans. And we're willing to entertain amendments that don't damage the core principles of the bill, but improve the bill, just as we did in committee.” Schumer went on to say, “These so-called scandals have not diverted us one iota. You have, on the Gang of Eight, three of the people who have been most critical of the president on some of these other issues. But I think the eight of us realize how important this is, more important probably than any of these scandals, to the future of America, for job growth, for the middle class.” *** GOP report: Republicans have challenge winning over younger votes: Politico reports on a post-election study by the College Republican National Committee -- being released today -- which is “sharply critical of the GOP on several fronts [when it comes to wooing young voters]. The study slams some Republicans’ almost singular focus on downsizing Big Government and cutting taxes; candidates’ use of offensive, polarizing rhetoric; and the party’s belly-flop efforts at messaging and outreach, even as the report presents a way forward and, at times, strikes an optimistic tone.” *** Don’t miss this story: If you have time today, be sure to read this fascinating -- and long -- look by Buzzfeed at the conflict inside one of the Republican Party’s top consulting firms. *** The GOP’s built-in midterm advantage: Lastly, the Cook Political Report’s David Wasserman makes an important point about the upcoming 2014 midterms: The GOP is favored to make gains -- but it has little to do with the political environment or the so-called “six-year itch” that hits the party controlling the White House. Wasserman writes, “Midterm elections have always drawn older voters, and usually drawn white voters, to the polls in disproportionate numbers. Older voters are less transient, have grown deeper roots in their local communities, and pay much more attention to non-presidential elections than their younger counterparts. In the 1980s, that didn't hold partisan consequences. Today, that amounts to a built-in midterm turnout advantage for Republicans.” Click here to sign up for First Read emails.

President Obama's second term has seen a multitude of disconnected events, while the GOP has been divided on various issues. Both parties have also struggled with controversies, such as the IRS targeting scandal and leak-investigation. Amidst the scattershot messaging, significant global events continue to unfold, such as the unrest in Turkey, which has evolved into a broader fight on Turkish identity involving religion, social class, and politics.  While immigration bills are set to appear on the Senate floor, the GOP faces challenges in winning over younger voters, as revealed in a post-election study by the College Republican National Committee. The study highlights the party's difficulties with messaging and outreach, as well as the offensive language used by some Republicans. In the upcoming midterm elections, the GOP is favored to make gains, not due to the political environment or the six-year itch, but rather due to the built-in turnout advantage for Republicans, as midterm elections disproportionately draw older and white voters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence from a movie review: all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new  Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","output":"Based on the given sentence from the movie review, it is evident that the movie was seen negatively by the reviewer. Let us break down the sentence to determine the reasons for perceiving it negatively. 1. \\"All three descriptions suit Evelyn\\" - This statement implies that there are three qualities or characteristics that have been mentioned previously in the review, which are attributed to the movie. Although we don't have access to these descriptions, it is clear that these identified aspects are not positive since the following part of the sentence offers criticism. 2. \\"A besotted and obvious drama\\" - The term 'besotted' generally refers to being infatuated or obsessed with something, but in this context, it is likely meant to imply that the movie is overly sentimental, heavy-handed, or excessively focused on its dramatic elements, to the point where it becomes a drawback. The word 'obvious' further emphasizes that the movie is predictable and lacks subtlety in its storytelling, which are negative qualities in the eyes of the reviewer. 3. \\"That tells us nothing new\\" - This phrase clearly indicates that the movie fails to provide fresh or original content to the audience. The reviewer perceives the movie to be reiterating concepts, themes, or ideas that have been seen before, which adds to their negative view of the film. In summary, the reviewer sees the movie, Evelyn, in a negative light. This is mainly due to its overly-dramatic nature, predictability, and lack of originality. The critical tone of the statement in the review suggests that they did not enjoy the movie and would not recommend it to others."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here's a detailed breakdown and steps on how to make Red Eye gravy using choice (a): Ingredients: - 1/4 cup beef fat (ideally from cooking a steak or roast) - 1/4 cup brewed coffee (strong black coffee is recommended) - 2 tbsp. cornstarch - 1/4 cup cold water - Salt and pepper, to taste Instructions: 1. Prepare your ingredients: First, measure out your beef fat, brewed coffee, and cornstarch. Ensure you have 1/4 cup of beef fat collected from cooking steak or roast, and have a fresh, 1/4 cup of brewed coffee on hand. 2. Heat the beef fat: In a small saucepan or skillet, heat the beef fat on medium heat until it's melted and hot. 3. Add coffee: Carefully pour the brewed coffee into the hot beef fat. 4. Prepare cornstarch slurry: In a separate small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of cornstarch with 1/4 cup of cold water until fully dissolved. This mixture is called a \\"slurry\\" and will be used to thicken the Red Eye gravy. 5. Thicken the gravy: Slowly pour the cornstarch slurry into the saucepan while continuously stirring the beef fat and coffee mixture. Keep stirring to combine everything evenly. 6. Cook over medium heat: Continue to cook the gravy over medium heat, stirring frequently, for 3-5 minutes, or until it reaches the desired thickness. The gravy should thicken gradually as it simmers. 7. Season with salt and pepper: Once the gravy has reached your desired consistency, taste it, and season with salt and pepper to your preference. 8. Serve and enjoy: Remove the saucepan from the heat and pour your homemade Red Eye gravy over cooked steak, ham, biscuits, or any other dish you'd like to enhance with its rich flavor. Using a coffee filter, as suggested in choice (b), is not necessary and could create difficulties in combining and heating the ingredients properly. The filter could also hinder the absorption and mixing of flavors, resulting in an inconsistent gravy.

On a day it celebrated 50 years of giving free legal advice, Southern Arizona Legal Aid announced it has received two grants totaling more than 7 million. One of the grants includes the creation of a Web site with legal advice for the poor. A three-year grant worth 6.6 million and a separate technology grant were announced at a press conference and dinner held Thursday at Evo. A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse, 405 W. Congress St. Deconcini was one of the organization's early board members. Thursday's celebration was the first public even held at the courthouse. About 100 members of the legal community attended, including state Attorney General Janet Napolitano and Arizona Supreme Court Justice Thomas Zlaket. Both grants come from the Legal Services., a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1974 to offer poor people equal access to the justice system. It's funded through congressional appropriation. The 6.6 million grant will pay for staffing operations. The Web site, which will be created with a 50,000 grant, is intended to offer legal advice to poor people across Arizona, said Paul Julian, chief executive officer of Southern Arizona Legal Aid. He said he wants every poor person in Arizona to have legal help. \\"This is another step in trying to realize that. We feel like we do a pretty good job of helping people who find us,\\" Julian said. Julian said that though most people do not own computers, they can still access them at libraries, schools, and courthouses. He said the Web site will help bridge the \\"digital divide\\" that keeps the poor from using the Internet as a resource. Southern Arizona Legal Aid was founded in 1951 as the Legal Aid Society of the Pima County Bar Association. It offered free legal advice on civil matters including disputes in small claims court, divorce proceedings and obtaining Social Security benefits. Charles Ares, a member of the board of directors in the 1950s, said the office was kind of a charity operation.

The boat is disabled but manages to free itself and return to Pearl Harbor. Tissue from a huge sea creature is discovered jammed in the submarine's dive planes. A man-and-woman team of marine biologists, Lesley Joyce (Faith Domergue) and John Carter (Donald Curtis), is called in; they identify the tissue as being a small part of a gigantic octopus. The military authorities scoff, but are finally persuaded after receiving reports of missing swimmers and ships at sea being pulled under by a large animal. Both scientists conclude the sea beast is from the Mindanao Deep, having been forced from its natural habitat by hydrogen bomb testing in the area, which has made the giant creature radioactive, driving off its natural food supply.[3] The scientists suggest the disappearances of a Japanese fishing fleet and a Siberian seal boat may be the work of the foraging sea beast. Both Pete and the Navy representatives express doubt and demand further proof. Later, as Pete assists John and Lesley, a report comes in of an attack on a French shipping boat; several men escaped in a raft. The French survivors are questioned by psychiatrists, and when the first sailor's description of a creature with giant tentacles is met with skepticism, the other sailors refuse to testify.

The cytoskeleton, a network of various protein filaments and tubules, plays a crucial role in cell shape, organization, and movement.  Motor proteins interact with the cytoskeleton to drive cell motility. These proteins use ATP to perform mechanical work, such as moving along the cytoskeleton's structure or causing its components to slide against each other. There are various types of motor proteins like myosin, kinesin and dynein, and they interact with different parts of the cytoskeleton. For example, myosin interacts with actin filaments, whereas kinesin and dynein move along microtubules. These proteins move along the cytoskeleton toward the positive or negative end, thereby creating generating force and movement. This interaction between motor proteins and the cytoskeleton is essential for cell movement, hence the correct answer to your question is 'interaction'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - John Henry Bonham (31 May 1948  25 September 1980) was an English drummer, musician and songwriter, best known as the drummer of Led Zeppelin. Bonham was esteemed for his speed, power, fast bass-drumming, distinctive sound, and \\"feel\\" for the groove. He is considered by some publications to be one of the greatest drummers in rock.  - The gittern was a relatively small gut strung round-backed instrument that first appears in literature and pictorial representation during the 13th century in Western Europe (Iberian Peninsula, Italy, France, England). It is usually depicted played with a quill plectrum, as we can see clearly beginning in manuscript illuminations from the thirteenth century.  It was also called the guitarra in Spain, guiterne or guiterre in France, the chitarra in Italy and quintern in Germany. A popular instrument with court musicians, minstrels, and amateurs, the gittern is considered ancestral to the modern guitar; possibly other instruments like the mandore and gallichon.  - In Through the Out Door is the eighth studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin, and their final album of entirely new material. It was recorded over a three-week period in November and December 1978 at ABBA's Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, and released by Swan Song Records on 15 August 1979. \\"In Through the Out Door\\" was the band's eighth and final studio release to reach the top of the charts in America, and was the last released by the band before the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980.  - ABBA (stylised ) are a Swedish pop group formed in Stockholm in 1972 by Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. They became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of popular music, topping the charts worldwide from 1974 to 1982. ABBA won the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 at The Dome in Brighton, UK, giving Sweden its first triumph in the contest, and are the most successful group to ever take part in the competition.  - Swan Song Records was a record label launched by the English rock band Led Zeppelin on 10 May 1974. It was overseen by Led Zeppelin's manager Peter Grant and was a vehicle for the band to promote its own products as well as sign artists who found it difficult to win contracts with other major labels. The decision to launch the label came after Led Zeppelin's five-year contract with Atlantic Records expired at the end of 1973, although Atlantic ultimately distributed the label's product.  - Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. The band's heavy, guitar-driven sound, rooted in blues and psychedelia on their early albums, has earned them recognition as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, though their unique style drew from a wide variety of influences, including folk music.  - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.  - British English is the English language as spoken and written in the United Kingdom or, more broadly, throughout the British Isles. Slight regional variations exist in formal, written English in the United Kingdom. For example, the adjective \\"wee\\" is almost exclusively used in parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and occasionally Yorkshire, whereas \\"little\\" is predominant elsewhere. Nevertheless, there is a meaningful degree of uniformity in \\"written\\" English within the United Kingdom, and this could be described by the term \\"British English\\". The forms of \\"spoken\\" English, however, vary considerably more than in most other areas of the world where English is spoken, so a uniform concept of British English is more difficult to apply to the spoken language. According to Tom McArthur in the \\"Oxford Guide to World English\\", British English shares \\"all the ambiguities and tensions in the word \\"British\\" and as a result can be used and interpreted in two ways, more broadly or more narrowly, within a range of blurring and ambiguity.\\"  - \`\` Carouselambra '' is the fifth track on Led Zeppelin 's 1979 album In Through the Out Door . The name Carouselambra is a reference to the first section of the song sounding similar to carousel music . It is the second - longest song the band recorded in the studio ( after \`\` In My Time of Dying '' ) , clocking in at more than 10 minutes in length .

The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music.  - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history.

Die prekären Kulturproduzenten sind häufig in verschiedenen kreativen Bereichen tätig, wie zum Beispiel in den Bereichen Kunst, Musik, Film, Theater, Literatur oder Design. Sie arbeiten oft unter ungewissen Bedingungen, mit befristeten Verträgen, ohne feste Anstellung, und sind möglicherweise von Projekt zu Projekt oder von Förderung zu Förderung abhängig.

Options are: --send a letter to the police station; --file a police report.;","output":"Option two, which is to file a police report, makes the most sense to accomplish the said task of reporting something being stolen to the police. Here's why: Reporting something stolen involves providing key information that is likely time-sensitive and could vary depending on the specific items stolen and the circumstances surrounding the theft. Depending on the jurisdiction, there may be different methods for reporting a stolen item, but they generally involve the following steps: 1. Determine Your Loss: First, you should ascertain what's been stolen. Look for other missing items, calculate their worth, and gather as much information as possible like serial numbers, brands, and any unique features they may have. 2. Contact the Police: Next, you should contact the local police department. You could call them or go there in person. Some jurisdictions even permit online filing of police reports for certain kinds of crimes. 3. Provide Detailed Information: You will need to provide a detailed account of the incident. This should include where and when it happened, descriptions of the stolen items, and any other details that could help identify the thief or recover the stolen goods. 4. Submit the Report: Once you've provided all the necessary information, you'll submit your report. It'll then be reviewed by officers who will decide the best course of action. Typically, a case number will be given to you after submission. 5. Follow-up: Keep in touch with the police department and provide any additional information or materials they may request. This could include pictures of the stolen items, for example. Sending a letter is another way you could potentially notify the police of the theft, but this is not the best method. First, it may take several days for the letter to reach its recipient. Even once it arrives, there may be additional delay before it's read and acted upon. In contrast, filing a police report, whether in person, over the phone, or online, allows for immediate notification and action. Moreover, the letter won't give the police a chance to ask you questions and obtain further details during the conversation. It might also lack crucial information, leading to ineffective investigation. If you're reporting a theft in progress or just occurred, speed is crucial, and a letter doesn't offer this. Lastly, the formality of a police report ensures your complaint is recorded properly in the system and tracked. A letter doesn't have the same degree of formality and criticality in terms of legal proceedings. Overall, reporting a stolen item involves much more than simply notifying the police. It requires an exchange of pertinent information that may play a crucial role in recovering the stolen property or prosecuting the perpetrator, and that's why filing a report is more beneficial and efficient than sending a letter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But in a recent league table, a European country, Finland, was top of the class. South Korea was still in second place, though. Britain was at number 6. In Korea the school day is long--typically 7 or 8 hours, followed by hours of private tutoring in the evenings. _ leaves Korean students so tired, they sometimes fall asleep in class next day. Worries about the effects of late night cramming  led the government to force cramming schools to close by 10 p.m. Finnish children spend the least time in class in the developed world, often finishing just after lunch, with about one hour of homework a day. Private tuition is uncommon. The British and American school day is quite long in comparison, around 6 hours, and secondary school pupils do 2 or 3 hours of selfstudy a night. The Korean education system, like many in Asia, is intensely competitive, with students even competing to get into the best cramming schools, to help them get ahead. Finnish education is far less cutthroat. Classes are all mixed ability, and there are no league tables. British schools again occupy the middle ground, with quite high levels of competition for places at university, and schools and universities battling to come top of league tables for everything from exam results to student satisfaction. Korea and Finland both do well, yet their education systems are so different. However, there are some similarities between Korea and Finland.

During this time, Dubuffet developed many other interests, including music, poetry, and the study of ancient and modern languages. Dubuffet also traveled to Italy and Brazil, and upon returning to Le Havre in 1925, he married for the first time and went on to start a small wine business in Paris. He took up painting again in 1934 when he made a large series of portraits in which he emphasized the vogues in art history.

The term 'circus' also describes the performance which has followed various formats through its 250-year modern history. Philip Astley is credited with being the 'father' of the modern circus when he opened the first circus in 1768 in England. Early circuses were almost exclusively demonstrations of equestrian skills with a few other types of acts to link the horsemanship performances. Performances developed significantly through the next fifty years, with large scale theatrical battle reenactments becoming a significant feature. The 'traditional' format, whereby a ringmaster introduces a varied selection of acts that mostly perform choreographed acts to traditional music, developed in the latter part of 19th century and continued almost universally to be the main style of circus up until the 1970s.  - Joseph Fernand Henri Léger (February 4, 1881  August 17, 1955) was a French painter, sculptor, and filmmaker. In his early works he created a personal form of cubism which he gradually modified into a more figurative, populist style. His boldly simplified treatment of modern subject matter has caused him to be regarded as a forerunner of pop art.  - Abstract expressionism is a postWorld War II art movement in American painting, developed in New York in the 1940s. It was the first specifically American movement to achieve international influence and put New York City at the center of the western art world, a role formerly filled by Paris. Although the term \\"abstract expressionism\\" was first applied to American art in 1946 by the art critic Robert Coates, it had been first used in Germany in 1919 in the magazine \\"Der Sturm\\", regarding German Expressionism. In the United States, Alfred Barr was the first to use this term in 1929 in relation to works by Wassily Kandinsky.

Victims: Tiffany York, 17, and her boyfriend Michael Roark, 19, were shot dead by three soldiers who wanted to protect their anti-government militia and their plans to assassinate the president. The case took a stunning turn at an. earlier hearing Monday when prosecutors told a Superior Court judge the. accused soldiers belonged to an anti-government militia operating within. the U.S. military that had stockpiled at least 87,000 worth of guns. and bomb components. They. said the group had a range of plans - from bombing a park fountain in. nearby Savannah to poisoning apple crops in the state of Washington -. and its ultimate goal was to overthrow the U.S. government and. assassinate the president. President Barack Obama was not mentioned by name as their target. Atlantic. Judicial Circuit District Attorney Tom Durden cites domestic terrorism. as an aggravating factor that warrants the death penalty. But. all charges against the soldiers relate directly to the killings. No. charges have been filed in state or federal court accusing the three. suspects of terrorist plots or acts. Fight: Brett Roark, the father of Michael Roark, is escorted out by courtroom security during the hearing. Heartbreak: Brett Roark is escorted out by courtroom security during the hearing of a defendant. 'Sometimes some of these things don't. fit neatly into our state laws,' Durden said after court when asked. about the absence of terrorism-related charges. \\"We're going forward. with what we feel comfortable with.\\" Because. they now face capital charges, all three soldiers will need to have new. attorneys appointed with death penalty experience. They won't be. arraigned or asked to enter pleas until that happens. 'At. this point, there has been no evidence presented to prove anything,' said Keith Higgins, an attorney who represented Aguigui in court. Thursday. 'The fact that certain statements are being made does not. necessarily mean these allegations are true.' Salmon's. wife, Heather Salmon, has also been charged with murder and other. counts. She did not appear in court Thursday and Durden said he will not. seek the death penalty for her. Target: The ruckus took place as Sgt. Anthony Peden appeared at Long County Superior Court. Accused: Isaac Aguigui has also been accused of murder to cover up plans to bring down the government. In court: Christopher Salmon walks into court. The District Attorney said he will seek the death penalty for all three. Authorities. took extra precautions Thursday as the accused soldiers, in shackles. and jailhouse jumpsuits, were brought before the judge for a preliminary. hearing. The defendants were brought to the courthouse one-at-a-time, with their hearings scheduled an hour apart. Deputies armed with assault rifles walked in front of and behind them. Relatives of both victims have been seething since Monday's hearing after a fourth soldier who says he witnessed both slayings testified about them in detail before pleading guilty to reduced charges. Pfc. Michael Burnett told the judge Roark, whom prosecutors say was helping the militia buy guns, had just left the Army and was considered 'a loose end' by Aguigui, the militia's leader. Burnett said Roark and his girlfriend were led to the woods. Peden shot York before she could get out of her car, Burnett testified, then paused to check her pulse and shot her again. Struggle: Wesley Thomas comforts his wife Brenda Thomas during the hearing of Pvt. Isaac Aguigui. Roark was forced to kneel on the ground before Salmon shot him twice in the head, Burnett said. The Army brought its own murder charges in the case in March, but dropped them earlier this month. Civilian federal prosecutors won't say if they're building a case. Durden, the state prosecutor, says he doesn't know how many other members belonged to the militia, which prosecutors say was called F.E.A.R. - Forever Enduring Always Ready. Army authorities have indicated they don't believe the suspects were part of a large group. 'We have one investigation that encompasses all the allegations made against these suspects,' said Chris Gray, spokesman for the Army's Criminal Investigations Command. 'We're not aware of any other subjects beyond this.' What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1. Three active-duty soldiers, Private Isaac Aguigui, Private Christopher Salmon, and Sergeant Anthony Peden, are accused of shooting dead Tiffany York, 17, and her boyfriend Michael Roark, 19, in December 2011. They were stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia, and are now facing the death penalty. 2. The soldiers allegedly belonged to an anti-government militia group operating within the U.S. military, which had stockpiled at least 87,000 worth of guns and bomb components and reportedly had plans to overthrow the U.S. government and assassinate the president. 3. Wesley Thomas, the stepfather of Tiffany York, rushed at one of the suspects, Sergeant Anthony Peden, during the court hearing, screaming \\"You killed my kid!\\" before being tackled by officers. 4. The victims were shot in the head in the woods of rural Long County near Fort Stewart in southeast Georgia. Their bodies were discovered by fishermen the following day. 5. So far, charges against the soldiers relate directly to the killings, and no charges have been filed in state or federal court accusing them of terrorist plots or acts. 6. Salmon's wife, Heather Salmon, has also been charged with murder and other counts, but the District Attorney will not seek the death penalty for her. 7. The Army initially brought murder charges against the three soldiers but dropped them earlier this month. The state prosecutor, Atlantic Judicial Circuit District Attorney Tom Durden, remains uncertain about the number of members in the militia, called F.E.A.R. (Forever Enduring Always Ready), and whether there are more suspects involved."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question: how rare are cardiac issues with amitriptyline Suggestion: It is also known to reduce aggression and violent behavior.","output":"False The suggested answer does not address the question about the rarity of cardiac issues associated with amitriptyline. Instead, it discusses the drug's effect on aggression and violent behavior. To provide a more appropriate answer to the question, one should talk about the potential side effects of amitriptyline on the cardiovascular system. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is used to treat various mental/mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. Although it is generally considered safe when taken under a doctor's supervision, it can sometimes cause cardiac issues, particularly in individuals who have pre-existing heart conditions or risk factors. Some potential cardiac side effects of amitriptyline include irregular heartbeat, a change in heart rhythm (prolonged QT interval), or increased blood pressure. These side effects are relatively rare and are usually dose-dependent, meaning that they may be more likely to occur at higher doses of the drug. Doctors generally monitor patients taking amitriptyline to ensure that they are on the appropriate dosage and to detect any potential cardiac issues early on. In summary, the suggested answer does not properly address the question about cardiac issues associated with amitriptyline; therefore, the correct answer is \\"False\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

[II] Adam is arty..","output":"Derrick is arty. Being arty, Derrick displayed an innate inclination towards music and arts. This predisposition of his was a significant contributing factor in him finding the glockenspiel easy to pick up. A creative personality goes hand in hand with a distinct ability to grasp the rhythm and melody involved in musical instruments. An artsy individual like Derrick views the world through a lens of creativity, finding complexity unscrambled and patterns visible where others don't. His arty side gave him the ability to understand and appreciate the beauty of music intrinsically and naturally. As soon as Derrick laid his hands on the glockenspiel, he was instinctively drawn to the unique timbre and pitch that the instrument produces. Inspiring a mélange of creativity and curiosity within him, it opened a new door to artistic expression. He found the melody and rhythm resonating within the very core of his being, connecting deeply with his creative spirit. Each note on the glockenspiel was like an artist's palette for him - a means to create unique, creative blends of music.  This ability to perceive, interpret, and bring to life the complex patterns and sounds of the glockenspiel is tied strongly to Derrick's arty nature. His love for art encompasses not just visual expression, but aural as well. This allowed him to intuitively understand the technical aspects of the instrument and use them to create emotionally resonant music. His instincts guided his fingers over the keys, telling him where to strike to create the desired note. He was able to grasp the technicalities, such as the importance of mallet selection and striking technique, quite effortlessly. The understanding of tempo, rhythm, and the ability to pour emotion into music, is often an instinctive trait found in those of artistic nature. Derrick's creative instincts guided him to materialize the music in his mind through the keys of the glockenspiel. Moreover, possessing an arty temperament made Derrick open-minded and receptive to exploring new sounds, emotions, and expressions through his music. He displayed a certain kind of flexibility and adaptability in the way he played the instrument. Now, when we look at Adam, he too, is arty but in a different way. However, this trait didn't help him much in learning to play the glockenspiel. There could be many reasons for this. Perhaps Adam's creative forte lies in a different domain of arts or his artistic ability may be of a different kind. Not all art forms are the same, and artistic skills don't necessarily translate across different mediums or instruments. Therefore, while Derrick, with his innate musical instincts and creative disposition, effortlessly learned the glockenspiel, Adam, on the other hand, despite being arty, didn't find it as accessible or instinctive. These cases serve to highlight the diverse range of skills and talents even within those who are artistically inclined."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I could memorize fingerprints. The nearby agencies, including local offices of federal agencies that had their own labs, came to me for help. One day in a trial a new-hatched defence attorney tried to make me seem neglectful because I hadn't sent the prints from the crime scene to the FBI for verification. The FBI will not look at prints that have already been identified locally. I tried to get that across to him. Finally I said, “Sir, you don't understand. I don't ask the FBI for help. The FBI asks me for help.” The courtroom went dead silent. The lawyer choked a bit and looked frantically at the judge, who knew me quite well. The judge slowly nodded. The lawyer choked a few more times, said, “No further questions,” and returned to his seat. I was the only person in the five-state area in which the silver burglar was hitting who got him on fingerprint evidence. He never left fingerprint evidence . . . except when he did. Every other police agency quit looking, because his MO was unmistakable. We didn't. A detective got prints from a bamboo tree he had used to climb in a window, and I got several prints from items he had handled inside the house. After the trial he was being led back to the jail and I was walking down the hall. He stopped and said, “I want to talk to that lady.” The bailiff told him he couldn't talk to the witness, but I said I wanted to hear what he had to say.

Grown-ups made special rules called \\"children's rights\\" to help make sure children like you are taken care of and protected. One very important rule is that all children should be protected from any kind of harm or violence. To show that this rule is important, we have some big organizations like the United Nations (UN) that work with different countries to make sure children are safe. They created a special paper called the \\"Convention on the Rights of the Child\\". This paper has a list of many important rules, and one of them says that children should be protected from all kinds of violence.

If children feel scared or hurt, it can make it really hard for them to be healthy, happy, and learn new things.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Presley's only child, Lisa Marie, was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career. Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, and none higher than number 28. His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, would rank at number 82 on the Billboard chart. Parker had already shifted his plans to television, where Presley had not appeared since the Sinatra Timex show in 1960. He maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to both finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, simply called Elvis, aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience—Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer Steve Binder had worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned. The show, NBC's highest rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience. Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked, \\"There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made Jim Morrison green with envy.\\" Dave Marsh calls the performance one of \\"emotional grandeur and historical resonance\\".By January 1969, the single \\"If I Can Dream\\", written for the special, reached number 12.

James Thomas Fallon was born in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York on September 19, 1974, the son of Gloria (nee Feeley) and James W. Fallon. He is of German, Irish, and Norwegian descent. His paternal grandmother, Luise Schalla, was a German immigrant from Osterholz-Scharmbeck, while one of his maternal great-grandfathers, Hans Hovelsen, was a Norwegian immigrant from Fredrikstad. Another set of great-great-grandparents were Thomas Fallon, an Irishman from County Galway, and Louisa Stickever, the daughter of an Irishman born in France and his Irish wife. Fallon married film producer Nancy Juvonen, co-owner of production company Flower Films, on December 22, 2007. After meeting on the set of Fever Pitch, the two began dating in May 2007. Fallon proposed in August 2007 with a Neil Lane-designed engagement ring, at sunset on the dock of Juvonen's family home in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire. They were married four months later. They have two daughters. They have a female English cream Golden Retriever named Gary Frick that has appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.  On June 26, 2015, Fallon suffered a ring avulsion, an injury he suffered by tripping over a rug in his home and catching his wedding ring on a counter top which nearly tore off his finger. He was taken to the emergency room and then sent to a surgeon who performed microsurgery on his finger. Fallon spent 10 days in the ICU before going home. He discussed this on the July 13 episode of the Tonight Show and thanked the doctors and nurses who helped him.

It was closed after the Tibetans captured it in 678, but in 699, during Empress Wu's period, the Silk Road reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi originally installed in 640, once again connecting China directly to the West for land-based trade. The Tang captured the vital route through the Gilgit Valley from Tibet in 722, lost it to the Tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the Goguryeo-Korean General Gao Xianzhi. When the An Lushan Rebellion ended in 763, the Tang Empire had once again lost control over its western lands, as the Tibetan Empire largely cut off China's direct access to the Silk Road. An internal rebellion in 848 ousted the Tibetan rulers, and Tang China regained its northwestern prefectures from Tibet in 851. These lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the Tang dynasty desperately needed.Despite the many expatriate European travelers coming into China to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks and missionaries, recorded the strict border laws that the Chinese enforced. As the monk Xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many Chinese government checkpoints along the Silk Road that examined travel permits into the Tang Empire. Furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as Xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions. The Silk Road also affected Tang dynasty art. Horses became a significant symbol of prosperity and power as well as an instrument of military and diplomatic policy. Horses were also revered as a relative of the dragon.  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person that recorded travelers being assaulted by bandits on the road that reopened when the Tang reconquered the Four Garrisons of Anxi?

His parents are dead and he lives with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). He has a crush on his next door neighbor, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), who is also one of the few classmates who is nice to him. Her boyfriend, Flash (Joe Manganiello) and his buddies pick on him. Peter's only friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco), who, though rich and good-looking, is similarly an outcast. Harry, however, is somewhat jealous of the affection his father, Norman (Willem Dafoe) shows Peter. Norman, the head of weapons contractor Oscorp, appreciates Peter's scientific aptitude and can barely conceal his desire that Peter was his own son.Peter's science class takes a field trip to a genetics laboratory at Columbia University. The lab works on spiders and has even managed to create new species of spiders through genetic manipulation and combination. While Peter is taking photographs of Mary Jane for the school newspaper, one of these new spiders lands on his hand and bites him. Peter comes home feeling ill and immediately goes to bed. At the genetic level, the venom injected by the spider bite begins to work strange magic on Peter. Meanwhile, General Slocum (Stanley Anderson) visits Oscorp to see the results of their new super soldier formula. When one of Norman's top scientists, Dr. Stromm (Ron Perkins) warns him the formula is unstable, General Slocum threatens to pull all of the military's funding from Oscorp. Later that night, Norman exposes himself to the formula. He gains superhuman strength and agility but is driven insane. He kills Stromm and steals two other Oscorp inventions, an exoskeleton and jet glider.Peter wakes up the next morning feeling better than ever.

This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\".

Does all of the music bring happiness to you? Do you know some music is noise? What is noise? Noise is a loud or unwanted sound. It is also called noise pollution. Where is noise from? Noise can be caused by many kinds of machines, such as motorcycles, planes, farm tractors and TVs. And, to some people, rock bands are also noise. What happens to people who live near noisy machines or use them over a period of time? Doctors find that noise pollution can influence both our health and behavior. It can cause high stress levels, hearing loss, sleep problems, and other harmful effects. Scientists use a unit  of measure  called a decibel to measure the loudness of a sound. The sound of a quiet room, for example, measures 35 decibels. Talk measures between 40 to 65 decibels. Sounds from traffic and from some rock bands can measure over 120 decibels. Noise at this high level causes the greatest hearing loss. How do we reduce noise damage? Turn down your music player or wear ear muffs  when you are working in a noisy environment. Ear muffs for human can protect against noise pollution. Question: According to the passage, noise is .

Emily and Rachel may have different perspectives when it comes to dressing up for parties, but their choices represent their unique tastes and personalities. Emily is of the view that parties are special occasions that warrant dressing up in elegant and eye-catching outfits. She thrives on the excitement of selecting the perfect ensemble, from the perfect dress to wonderfully matching accessories. This is not only a form of self-expression for Emily but also a way to boost her confidence and make a lasting impression on others. For her, fashion is an art form, and she truly enjoys being creative and experimenting with various looks, patterns, and styles. On the other hand, Rachel embraces an entirely different approach to dressing up for parties. For her, comfort is the ultimate priority when it comes to selecting clothes and accessories. She loves to wear attire that is casual and allows her to move, dance, or simply chill effortlessly throughout the party. Rachel cherishes these gatherings as opportunities to let loose and enjoy the company of her friends and family, and she feels that wearing comfortable clothes helps her focus on the experience rather than constantly worrying about her appearance. In fact, Rachel has a penchant for picking clothes that are not only comfortable but also stylish in their own right. She believes in simplicity and minimalism, opting for chic but effortless outfits that reflect her laid-back and modest personality. Both Emily and Rachel differ significantly when it comes to their fashion choices for parties. While Emily enthusiastically indulges in the latest fashion trends, exploring various colors, fabrics, and textures, Rachel opts for a more understated approach. She chooses neutral and earth-toned palettes, focusing on simplicity and wearability rather than ostentatious display. In a way, Emily's dressing style can be seen as a form of socializing, as her outfits often spark conversations and compliment from other party guests. She genuinely enjoys discussing fashion and sharing style tips, and her dressing choices open up opportunities for connection and camaraderie. Conversely, Rachel sees parties as a time to let her hair down and catch up with friends, without the added pressure of dressing up and adhering to specific party attire norms. Her comfortable outfits radiate a sense of ease that ultimately translates into her attitudes towards partying and mingling with others, as well. Despite their contrasting outlooks on dressing up for parties, both Emily and Rachel are confident in their clothing choices and respect each other's preferences. They understand that the way they dress is a reflection of their personalities and lifestyles, and it is essential for each of them to be true to themselves. Just like Emily and Rachel, it is important for everyone to recognize that different people have different tastes when it comes to fashion. What truly matters is finding the style that makes you feel content, confident, and, most importantly, comfortable in your own skin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer a question about the following article about Empiricism: Most of Hume's followers have disagreed with his conclusion that belief in an external world is rationally unjustifiable, contending that Hume's own principles implicitly contained the rational justification for such a belief, that is, beyond being content to let the issue rest on human instinct, custom and habit. According to an extreme empiricist theory known as phenomenalism, anticipated by the arguments of both Hume and George Berkeley, a physical object is a kind of construction out of our experiences. Phenomenalism is the view that physical objects, properties, events (whatever is physical) are reducible to mental objects, properties, events. Ultimately, only mental objects, properties, events, exist — hence the closely related term subjective idealism. By the phenomenalistic line of thinking, to have a visual experience of a real physical thing is to have an experience of a certain kind of group of experiences. This type of set of experiences possesses a constancy and coherence that is lacking in the set of experiences of which hallucinations, for example, are a part. As John Stuart Mill put it in the mid-19th century, matter is the \\"permanent possibility of sensation\\". Mill's empiricism went a significant step beyond Hume in still another respect: in maintaining that induction is necessary for all meaningful knowledge including mathematics. As summarized by D.W. Hamlin: What is subjective idealism closely related to?","output":"Subjective idealism is closely related to phenomenalism. Both of them believe that only mental objects, properties, and events exist. Phenomenalism says that physical things, like objects and events, can be reduced to mental experiences. So, both ideas tell us that our world is made up of our thoughts and feelings, rather than just physical objects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Process: - Get an ice cube tray - Fill the tray with cool water - Place the tray in the freezer - Leave the tray in the freezer for a few hours - Take they tray out of the freezer - Pop the ice cubes out of tray.  Question: suppose a person needs ice for a barbecue happens, how will it affect Less trays are filled.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: Less If a person needs ice for a barbecue, the amount of ice produced will directly depend on the number of ice trays filled with water and subsequently frozen. If fewer trays are filled with water, there will be a smaller quantity of ice cubes produced. In this situation, the outcome results in less ice rather than more or no effect. To better understand this, let's break down the process and examine the consequences of filling fewer trays. 1. Get an ice cube tray - This step establishes the need for an ice cube tray and suggests that the more trays used, the more ice that can be produced. 2. Fill the tray with cool water - Depending on the number of trays being filled, the amount of cool water used will vary. More trays filled translates to a greater quantity of cool water used in the process. 3. Place the tray in the freezer - In this step, the trays filled with water are placed in the freezer to solidify into ice cubes. Space availability in the freezer will usually dictate the maximum number of trays that can be placed there simultaneously. 4. Leave the tray in the freezer for a few hours - The trays need to be left undisturbed while the water freezes into ice cubes. This can take a few hours, depending on the tray's material, the freezer temperature, and water temperature. Fewer trays filled with water would mean that the freezer works on a smaller volume of water. This, in turn, could potentially lead to the ice freezing slightly faster; however, this is not a significant factor in the overall ice production quantity. 5. Take the tray out of the freezer - This step involves removing the frozen trays from the freezer. If fewer trays were filled initially, then fewer trays can be taken out, resulting in a lesser quantity of ice. 6. Pop the ice cubes out of the tray - Finally, the ice cubes are removed from the trays and made available for use. The overall quantity of ice produced for the barbecue will be less if fewer trays were filled with water beforehand.  In conclusion, the answer is B: less. Filling fewer trays will result in producing less ice for a given event, such as a barbecue. If an individual needs more ice for such an occasion, it is essential to consider filling more trays or planning ahead to use additional means to produce the desired quantity of ice."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a sentence in the Bulgarian language and corresponding English translation of this sentence.

During the campaign in Egypt, Napoleon showed much tolerance towards religion for a revolutionary general, holding discussions with Muslim scholars and ordering religious celebrations, but General Dupuy, who accompanied Napoleon, revealed, shortly after Pope Pius VI's death, the political reasons for such behaviour: \\"We are fooling Egyptians with our pretended interest for their religion; neither Bonaparte nor we believe in this religion more than we did in Pius the Defunct's one\\".[note 8] In his memoirs, Bonaparte's secretary Bourienne wrote about Napoleon's religious interests in the same vein.

Simplify the equation: Firstly, let's move all variables (l) to one side of the equation, in this case, to the right side. Doing so will involve adding 35*l to both sides of the equation. -35*l + 35*l = -36*l + 35*l On the left side, -35*l and 35*l will cancel each other out, leaving 0: 0 = -36*l + 35*l 3. Combine the terms with the variable (l): -36*l and 35*l share the same variable \\"l\\", so we can combine them: 0 = (-36 + 35)*l This simplifies to: 0 = -1*l 4. Solve for \\"l\\": Now we have a simple equation to solve for the variable \\"l\\". To find \\"l\\", we need to isolate it. Since the coefficient of \\"l\\" is -1, we simply divide both sides of the equation by -1 to solve for \\"l\\". 0 / -1 = (-1*l) / -1 Dividing by -1 results in: 0 = 1*l This can also be expressed simply as: 0 = l So, the solution to the given equation -35*l = -36*l is l=0.

Article: How can you help kids cope with  stress? Proper rest and good nutrition can improve coping skills, so can good parenting. Make time for your kids each day. Whether they need to talk with you or just be in the same room with you, make yourself available. Even as kids get older, quality time is important. It's really hard for some people to come home after a tiring day of work, get down on the floor, and play with their kids or just talk to them about their day -- especially if they've had a stressful day themselves. But expressing interest in your kids shows that they' re important to you. Help your child deal with stress by talking about what may be causing it. Together, you can come up with a few solutions.  For example, he should cut back on after-school activities, spending more time talking with his parents or teachers, developing an exercise plan or keeping a journal. You can also help by predicting potentially stressful situations and preparing kids for them. For example, let a child know ahead of time, but not too far ahead of time, that a doctor's appointment is coming up and talk about what will happen there. Keep in mind, though, that younger kids probably won't need too much advance preparation. Too much information can cause more stress. Remember that some level of stress is normal, Let kids know that it's OK to feel angry, scared, lonely, or anxious and that other people share those feelings, too. When kids can't or won't discuss these problems, try talking about your own concerns. This shows that you're willing to handle tough topics and are available to talk with when they're ready. If a child shows symptoms that concern you and is unwilling to talk, consult a counselor  or other mental health experts. Most parents have the skills to cope with their children's stress. The time to seek professional attention is when any change in behavior continues to exist, when stress is causing serious anxiety, or when the behavior is causing significant problems in functioning at school or at home.

Background: Sevendust is an American alternative metal band from Atlanta, Georgia, formed in 1994 by bassist Vince Hornsby, drummer Morgan Rose and guitarist John Connolly. After their first demo, lead vocalist Lajon Witherspoon and guitarist Clint Lowery joined the group. Following a few name changes, the members settled on the name Sevendust and released their self-titled debut album on April 15, 1997. They have attained success with three consecutive RIAA gold certified albums, a Grammy nomination, and have sold millions of albums worldwide. Context: On August 24, 1999, they released their second album, Home. The album peaked at 19 on the Billboard 200 and featured Skin from Skunk Anansie and Chino Moreno from Deftones as guest vocalists. The two singles from the album, \\"Denial\\" and \\"Waffle\\", gave the band moderate chart success, and the latter of which was played on the Late Night with Conan O'Brien show. They appeared in Woodstock 1999 and have toured with many bands such as Korn, Staind, Nonpoint, Reveille, Godsmack, Mudvayne, Mushroomhead, Powerman 5000, Creed, Kid Rock, Machine Head, Limp Bizkit, Disturbed, and Metallica. In 1999, they gained European exposure by opening for Skunk Anansie at various shows in Germany. Skin from Skunk Anansie provided guest vocals on the track Licking Cream off Home. They also opened with Kid Rock and Ted Nugent for Metallica on New Year's Eve in 1999 at the Pontiac Silverdome near Detroit, Michigan. They also joined Slipknot, Coal Chamber and other bands on the Tattoo the Earth Tour in June 2000. Also in 2000, the song \\"Fall\\" was recorded by producer Sylvia Massy in 1998 at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. \\"Fall\\" appears on the soundtrack to the film Scream 3.  In November 2001, the band released their third album, Animosity. This album went gold and gained the band commercial success thanks to the success of singles \\"Praise\\" and \\"Angel's Son\\", which peaked at 15 and 11, respectively, on the Mainstream Rock Tracks. In 2002 they covered the theme song of Chris Jericho for WWF Forceable Entry. The song was never used as an official entry theme for him though. \\"Angel's Son\\" was a tribute to Lynn Strait, the lead singer of the band Snot, whom the members of Sevendust were friends with. Strait had died in a car accident in 1998. In addition to being included on Animosity, the song was included on the compilation album Strait Up. The band made an appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman playing an acoustic version of \\"Angel's Son\\" featuring Paul Shaffer on keyboards.  In the same year Sevendust was seen in the Chris Rock movie Down to Earth as a partial clip of \\"Waffle\\" is played.  Another friend of the band, Dave Williams, the lead singer of Drowning Pool, died in 2002. Tragedy would strike again when Lajon Witherspoon's younger brother was shot and killed later that year. Due to his death, Sevendust went on hiatus in 2002. Question: Did they tour?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Sevendust toured extensively during their career. They performed in Woodstock 1999 and toured with bands like Korn, Staind, Nonpoint, Reveille, Godsmack, Mudvayne, Mushroomhead, Powerman 5000, Creed, Kid Rock, Machine Head, Limp Bizkit, Disturbed, and Metallica.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.\\"? Answer:","output":"Question: In the context of the passage, what was the significance of the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case for state prisoners under sentence of death, and how has the subsequent decision in Baze v. Rees impacted the opportunities for relief through Section 1983? Answer: The 2006 Hill v. McDonough case was significant for state prisoners under sentence of death because it opened up an alternative legal avenue for them to challenge their method of execution. Prior to this case, the Supreme Court had held that habeas corpus was the only legal mechanism available for state prisoners to contest their death sentences. However, in Hill v. McDonough, the Court approved the use of Section 1983 to challenge a state's method of execution on the grounds of cruel and unusual punishment as a violation of the Eighth Amendment. This decision was based on the rationale that a prisoner raising such a challenge is not directly attacking their judgment of death, but rather the means by which that judgment will be carried out. As a result, the Supreme Court held that prisoners could use Section 1983 instead of habeas corpus to bring such lawsuits. However, the passage also notes that since the Hill v. McDonough case, there have been limitations on the practical application of Section 1983 for challenging methods of execution. Lower federal courts have frequently refused to hear suits on the grounds that prisoners brought their claims too late and only for purposes of delay. Furthermore, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, which upheld a lethal injection method used by several states, has significantly narrowed the opportunities for relief through Section 1983. In summary, while the Hill v. McDonough case initially provided state prisoners with an alternative means of challenging their execution method under Section 1983, the subsequent ruling in Baze v. Rees and the reluctance of lower federal courts to entertain such suits have considerably limited the potential for relief through this legal avenue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: Dick was enraged to see how contentedly the men bore the irksome confinement, the meager food, and harsh peremptoriness of the beardless boys set over them as guards.  Most of the prisoners passed the time in cards, playing for buttons, trinkets, or what not that formed their scanty possessions.  Dick learned that all the commissioned officers of the company with Wesley Boone had been wounded or killed in the charge near the stone bridge.  Wesley had been with the prisoners at first.  He had been struck on the head, and was in a raging fever when his father and sister came to the prison to take him away.  No one could tell where he was now, but Dick knew that he must be in the city, since there were no exchanges, the Confederates allowing no one to leave the lines except women with the dead, or those who came from the North on special permits.  Then he visited the provost headquarters, and was shown the complete list of names recorded in the books there; but Barney's was not among them.

Answer the following question: Q: What is the number placed in front of a chemical symbol or formula that shows how many atoms or molecules of the substance are involved in the reaction?   A: Answer:","output":"A: The number placed in front of a chemical symbol or formula that shows how many atoms or molecules of the substance are involved in the reaction is called a coefficient.  In a balanced chemical equation, coefficients are used to ensure that the principle of mass conservation is satisfied, which states that the total mass of substances entering a chemical reaction (reactants) must equal the total mass of substances formed through the reaction (products). This principle is based on the conservation of matter, which suggests that matter can neither be created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction. The use of coefficients helps illustrate the stoichiometry of a chemical reaction, which is the quantitative relationship between reactants and products in a balanced equation. By showing the ratio of molecules involved in a reaction, coefficients enable chemists to determine the amounts of substances required for the reaction to occur, as well as the amounts produced as a result. Consider the following example of a balanced chemical equation representing the combustion of methane: CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O In this equation, we can observe the following coefficients: 1. A \\"1\\" is placed in front of \\"CH₄\\" (methane). The \\"1\\" is generally not written in the equation, but it is implied. This means that there is 1 molecule of methane reacting. 2. A \\"2\\" is placed in front of \\"O₂\\" (oxygen), indicating that 2 molecules of oxygen are reacting. 3. A \\"1\\" is implied in front of \\"CO₂\\" (carbon dioxide), meaning that the reaction produces 1 molecule of carbon dioxide. 4. A \\"2\\" is placed in front of \\"H₂O\\" (water), indicating that 2 molecules of water are produced by the reaction. This balanced equation helps us understand that one molecule of methane reacts with two molecules of oxygen to produce one molecule of carbon dioxide and two molecules of water. Moreover, it allows chemists to calculate mass conversions, predict the amount of products formed in the reaction, and optimize the conditions for carrying out various chemical processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth, and ozone is represented chemically as O3. Given these facts, the depletion of what results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth among the following options: - O3  - O2  - oil  - pan  - h2o  - CO2  - DNA  - DDT Answer:","output":"The depletion of O3, or ozone, results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. Ozone is a molecule consisting of three oxygen atoms, represented by the chemical formula O3. This gas is mainly found in the Earth's stratosphere a few miles above the Earth's surface and is crucial for life, as it serves as a protective shield by absorbing and filtering harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. UV radiation can have adverse effects on the environment and living organisms, including humans. Prolonged exposure to increased levels of UV radiation can lead to skin cancer, cataracts, and immune system suppression in humans. Higher levels of UV radiation can also negatively impact agricultural crops, marine ecosystems, and terrestrial habitats. Ozone depletion is primarily caused by human-produced chemicals, such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons, which were once widely used in refrigeration, air conditioning, foam insulation, and firefighting. When these chemicals make their way up into the stratosphere and break down, they release chlorine and bromine atoms, which initiate chemical reactions destroying ozone molecules. This process is accelerated in the cold conditions of the polar regions, leading to the formation of the \\"ozone hole.\\" None of the other options, Oil, O2 (oxygen), Pan, H2O (water), CO2 (carbon dioxide), DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), directly deplete the ozone layer or cause higher levels of UV radiation to reach the Earth. Some of these, like CO2, are related to other environmental issues such as climate change and the greenhouse effect, while others, like DDT, do not contribute to ozone depletion or UV radiation in the same manner. In summary, the depletion of O3 (ozone) is the primary culprit behind higher levels of ultraviolet radiation reaching Earth, among the options provided. Addressing the release of ozone-depleting substances and implementing international agreements, such as the Montreal Protocol, are essential to safeguarding the ozone layer and mitigating the harmful effects of excessive UV radiation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the context: What will happen to Others?   a). excited about the kill.  b). be proud.  c). help him with the kill. Answer:","output":"In the given context where Austin killed another deer while out hunting with the others, various emotions and reactions can be anticipated from the Others. Here's a detailed breakdown of the potential outcomes: a). Excited about the kill: It is quite likely that the Others would feel excitement upon witnessing the successful hunt since it would indicate a productive outcome from the hunting expedition. This excitement may arise from several factors, such as the thrill of the chase, the satisfaction of hunting prowess, or the simple knowledge that the group now has a valuable source of meat to sustain them. b). Be proud: Pride is another potential emotion that the Others may experience upon seeing Austin's successful kill. This pride could stem from the fact that one of their group members has demonstrated skill and expertise in bringing down a deer, which displays a valuable contribution to their collective well-being. Furthermore, the pride could extend to their association with Austin, as they may view themselves as part of a competent and capable hunting party. c). Help him with the kill: After the initial emotions of excitement and pride have subsided, it is expected that the Others would offer their assistance to Austin in dealing with the aftermath of the kill. This could involve several tasks, such as: 1. Field dressing: The Others could help Austin in removing the internal organs of the deer, which is an important step in preserving the meat and ensuring it remains safe for consumption. 2. Transporting the carcass: The group might collectively carry the deer back to their camp or dwelling, where they can process it further and distribute the meat among themselves. 3. Skinning and butchering: Once the deer has been transported to a suitable location, the Others can assist Austin in skinning the animal, separating the meat from the bones, and portioning it out for storage or cooking. 4. Sharing the spoils: As part of a hunting group, the Others would likely participate in the consumption and enjoyment of the deer meat together. This shared experience can reinforce bonds within the group, as well as offering a sense of communal reward for their collective efforts. In conclusion, given the context that Austin killed another deer while out hunting with the Others, it is expected that the group would feel a mixture of excitement and pride, and would subsequently assist Austin in handling and processing the kill. Moreover, this shared experience would likely contribute to a greater sense of unity and camaraderie within the group."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.
