Пиши разные отзывы. Не повторяйся! Выражай эмоции, словно ты обиженный покупатель. Пиши от первого лица. Указывай разные модели автомобилей. Этот отзыв возьми в качестве примера: Солидная скидка на авто. Лучший дилерский центр прошлого года. Менеджер по телефону убедил меня, что автомобиль есть в наличии, ПТС в тот же день, скрытых комиссий нет. Приехал в салон, но оказалось, что авто уже забронирован другим покупателем, который поехал за оставшейся суммой денег и вот-вот подъедет. Мне же менеджеры предложили подождать. Якобы еще один экземпляр будет завтра, а пока можно подписать договор и внести залог. Я просился подождать, на случай если покупатель не приедет, но мне упорно отказывали и уводили от машины. Все это меня насторожило. Почему-то менеджеры меня как будто не слышали, вели к кредитному менеджеру, чтобы проверить одобрят ли мне кредит. Проверили все отлично. Советовали не ждать и внести залог за авто. Не поддавшись уговорам, я решил подорожать и сказал, что приеду завтра. Приезжаю. И что вы думаете? Ситуация повторилась. Авто снова вот только что, буквально минуту назад был кем-то забронирован. Явно обман. Ушел ни с чем.","output":"1. Вчера решил приобрести новый Ford Mustang в салоне Аквамарин, который на словах предлагал невероятные условия покупки. Связался по телефону, менеджер подтвердил наличие машины и отличную цену, даже обещал подарки при покупке. Я, радостный, приехал туда, но, как только зашёл в салон, начался цирк. Сначала менеджеры делали вид, что меня узнали, затем начали убеждать, что именно этот Mustang уже кому-то обещан, хотя звонил лишь час назад. Предложили забронировать другой автомобиль, который будет \\"ещё лучше\\", за немалую сумму залога. В итоге, я потратил время, нервы и доверие к данному салону. Чувствую себя обманутым и разочарованным. 2. Хотел купить мечту своей жены - новенький BMW X5 в салоне Аквамарин. Менеджеры по телефону заверили, что машина в наличии и ждёт нас. Прибыл туда, вступил в переговоры, но в процессе \\"выяснилось\\", что машина уже продана. Однако, они могут быстренько заказать такую же, только если я оставлю предоплату. Ни машины, ни конкретики, а ждать предложили неопределенно долго. Очень неприятно, когда играют на чувствах, ведь видели, как мы горим желанием сделать покупку. Ощущение, что эти ребята нагло используют тактику обмана. 3. Планировал расширить автопарк и прикупить Mercedes-Benz C-Class в салоне Аквамарин, ведь там якобы были самые выгодные условия. Сделали мне \\"золотые горы\\" по телефону, а на деле - полная лажа. Приезжаю, а мне выдают номерок, как в поликлинике. Час ожидания - и вуаля, оказывается, авто, которое я выбрал, стало \\"жертвой\\" сиситемной ошибки и его уже нет в наличии. Предложили другой вариант по \\"очень выгодной\\" цене, но он меня в корне не устраивал. От слов к делу у ребят из Аквамарина - как от Москвы до Пекина. Ушёл оттуда с пустыми руками и большим разочарованием. 4. Загорелся идеей приобрести Toyota Camry нового поколения в салоне Аквамарин. Менеджеры, будто зная, что я нацелен на покупку, расписали мне кучу \\"бенефитов\\", которые я получу вместе с автомобилем. Но уже на месте оказалось, что обещанный автомобиль внезапно \\"выкупили\\" буквально перед моим приездом. Предложения о замене меня не устроили, а упор на то, чтобы я внёс залог за следующий автомобиль, который \\"скоро приедет\\", вообще вывел из себя. Потраченный день и сорванные планы – вот что я получил от сотрудничества с Аквамарин. 5. Ожидал получить от покупки Volkswagen Tiguan в салоне Аквамарин только положительные эмоции, но всё пошло наперекосяк. Сначала нахваливали условия покупки, звонил дважды, чтобы убедиться в наличии авто - менеджеры гарантировали. Но как только приехал, на деле всё оказалось ровным счетом наоборот. Автомобиля нет, менеджеры начали водить меня за нос, выдвигая нелепые предложения за авто, которого у них даже в наличии не было! Я всего лишь хотел совершить покупку, а в итоге - потеря времени и пустое разочарование. Рекомендовать этот салон никому не стану."},{"instruction":"你现在是一名事业以及情感丰富的女生，情商极高。请帮助我回答一个情感上受挫的女性，在与老公关系的问题，女子出轨被抓，如何和老公挽回这一段关系","output":"面对这样一个敏感复杂的问题，首要的是认识到出轨这一行为对伴侣和婚姻造成了极大的伤害。挽回关系将是一个长期且艰巨的过程，需要耐心、诚实和责任感。以下是我建议的几个步骤，希望能够对你有所帮助： 1. **真诚道歉**：首先，你需要向你的伴侣表达出你的歉意，这需要是一个深刻、真诚的道歉，不仅仅是对你所行为的后果道歉，更重要是对你所造成伤害的深刻理解与悔改。你的语言、表情和行为都需要展现出你的真诚和对改正的决心。 2. **诚实沟通**：解释发生出轨的原因，但避免将责任推卸给任何人，包括你的伴侣。需要认识到这是一个选择，而不是一个错误或意外。通过开放、诚实的沟通，分享你的感受、恐惧以及不满的原因。沟通是为了理解和被理解，而不是辩解。 3. **承担责任**：你需要承认错误并承担起相应的后果。这可能包括给予伴侣时间和空间去处理和接受这一事实，也可能涉及参加婚姻咨询或心理治疗，来一起解决问题。 4. **重建信任**：出轨破坏了夫妻间的信任，重建信任需要时间和努力。你需要通过一贯的、透明的行为和沟通来逐步重建这种信任。这可能包括共享更多个人信息、日程和社交活动等。 5. **提升自我**：展现你在自我提升和个人成长上的努力可以是挽回关系的关键。通过学习、反思和改变，你可以成为一个更好的伴侣和个人。 6. **耐心**：请记住，复原需要时间。要做好长期努力的准备，并在过程中持续保持耐心、理解和支持。 7. **求助专业人士**：在这个过程中，寻求专业的婚姻咨询师或心理治疗师的帮助是非常重要的。他们可以提供指导、支持和介入策略，帮助你们两人一起工作，解决问题。 最后，需要清楚的是，尽管努力可能很大，但并不一定能保证一定能修复婚姻。双方都需要有意愿和决心去面对这个挑战，才有可能重建一个更坚固的关系。无论结果如何，请保持对自己的爱和尊重，以及对过程的接受。"},{"instruction":"普通人如何用合约炒币，容易翻身","output":"要明确一点：投机性交易，尤其是使用合约进行加密货币交易，风险极高。这种类型的交易涉及预测市场短期内的价格波动，而加密货币市场因其高波动性和不可预测性而闻名。然而，对于希望了解如何进行这类交易的人来说，这里有一些基本指导和注意事项，但请记住，这不是推荐或鼓励你进行此类活动。 # 学习基础知识 1. **了解合约交易**：在投入资金之前，你需要了解什么是合约交易。合约交易允许交易者通过预测加密货币价格的涨跌来盈利，而无需实际持有该货币。常见的合约类型包括期货合约、永续合约等。 2. **研究市场**：加密货币市场非常复杂和多变，理解市场的基本机制、影响价格波动的因素以及技术和基本面分析对于成功交易至关重要。 3. **风险管理**：定义你的投资策略，包括如何分配资金、设置止损和目标盈利点。记住，不要投入超过你能承受损失的资金。使用合理的杠杆比例，过高的杠杆虽有可能带来高额回报，但同时也极易导致本金的快速损失。 # 实施策略 1. **小额开始**：刚开始时，以小投资进行交易，直至你对市场有更深刻的理解和对自己的交易策略有足够的信心。 2. **练习纪律**：紧守入场和离场策略，不要因情绪波动而偏离计划。贪婪和恐惧是交易者的两大敌人。 3. **持续学习**：市场在不断变化，有效的策略也可能随之变化。定期评估你的交易策略和结果，适时调整以应对市场变化。 # 注意事项 - **合法性问题**：确保你所在的地区允许加密货币和合约交易，了解并遵守当地法律法规。 - **平台选择**：选择合法、受信誉良好的交易平台进行交易，注意账户安全。 - **情绪管理**：交易中的情绪波动很常见，但重要的是保持冷静，避免由于极端情绪导致的决策错误。 # 结论 虽然某些个体可能通过高风险投机性交易“翻身”，但绝大多数人都会面临巨大的资金损失风险。故而，非常重要的是认识到合约交易并不是轻松赚钱的捷径，而是充满风险的投资行为。对于多数人来说，追求长期、稳健的投资策略可能更为理智。如果你决定参与，确保进行充分的研究，使用仅能承受损失的资金，并抱着谨慎的态度。"},{"instruction":"你现在是一名事业以及情感丰富的女生，情商极高。请帮助我回答一个情感上受挫的女性，在与老公关系的问题，女子出轨被抓，如何和老公挽回这一段关系。请用知心大姐的口吻回答问题","output":"亲爱的，面对这样的挑战和情感波折，首先我想说，你并不孤单。在婚姻的旅途中，我们都可能犯错，而重要的是我们如何面对这些错误，以及我们愿意采取哪些步骤来修复这些裂痕。 首先，给你自己一些时间和空间去理解发生了什么，以及这背后的原因是什么。我们的行为总是有其深层的原因和动机，探寻这些可能对你和你的伴侣都非常有帮助。接下来，这将是一个重建的过程，需要耐心、真诚和持续的努力。 真诚的道歉 向你的伴侣展示你对自己行为后果的深刻理解是非常重要的。你的道歉需要来自内心，表达出你对于所造成的伤痛的真正理解和悔意。 开放的沟通 和你的伴侣坐下来，开放而诚实地交流你们的感受是非常必要的。但请记住，这可能需要时间，他可能不会立即准备好。表达你愿意等待，且愿意在他准备好时倾听他的感受。 承担责任 担起对自己行为的完全责任，避免任何形式的借口或责怪他人。这显示了你的成熟和愿意为自己的行为承担后果。 重建信任 重建信任是一个长期的过程。展现出你的改变不仅仅是通过言语，更是通过行动——成为一个更加开放、诚实和可靠的伴侣。保持一贯性和耐心，因为这需要时间。 个人成长 通过这次经历寻求个人成长。是否可以通过咨询、阅读或参加相关的工作坊来更好地理解自己和学习如何建立更健康的关系呢？ 寻求专业帮助 在这样的情况下，寻求婚姻咨询师的专业帮助可能对双方都有益处。他们可以提供通往修复和理解的途径，帮助你们一起或个别地处理这一情况。 亲爱的，记得在这一过程中照顾好自己。面对挑战和自己的错误需要勇气和力量。保持希望，无论结果如何，你都在为一个更健康、更成熟的自己和关系努力。愿你的勇气、真诚和努力能引领你们走向和解与成长的道路。"},{"instruction":"水瓶座的男人拥有哪些特质","output":"水瓶座的男性（1月20日至2月18日出生）被认为是十二星座中最独特、最具创新精神的一员。他们通常富有天赋，对世界充满好奇，有着强烈的个人主义色彩。当然，个人特质会因人而异，但根据星座性格理论，下面是水瓶座男性的一些普遍特点： # 1. 独立和自由追求者 水瓶座的男人十分珍视个人自由和独立性。他们不喜欢受到约束，总是寻找新的可能性和探索未知的领域。 # 2. 创新和前瞻性 这些男性通常对科技、新思想或任何未来派的事物感兴趣。他们善于思考、创新，乐于接受新观念，有时甚至被认为是时代的先锋。 # 3. 理性和客观 水瓶男性在处理情感问题时可能显得比较冷静甚至有些客观。他们倾向于用逻辑和理性来分析情况而不是依赖感情。 # 4. 社交但是距离感 虽然水瓶座的男人喜欢社交，拥有广泛的社交圈，但他们可能会给人一种难以捉摸和保持情感距离的感觉。他们乐于帮助朋友，但在情感表达上可能较为克制。 # 5. 人道主义 许多水瓶男性都有强烈的社会意识和人道主义精神，他们关心社会问题，愿意为了公平和进步的大义投入时间和精力。 # 6. 非传统 他们通常不太愿意遵循传统或规则，喜欢走自己的路。对于水瓶座的男性来说，挑战常规和创造新风格是他们的特色之一。 # 7. 智慧和幽默感 水瓶座的男人以其独特的智慧和幽默感著称。他们的思维方式往往与众不同，能在对话中带来新的视角和惊喜。 虽然上面这些特质在许多水瓶座男性身上可能普遍存在，但每个人的个性、成长环境和经历都会对其性格产生影响，因此不能将这些性质视为固定不变。了解一个人最好的方式是通过时间、沟通和互动。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

First, he wakes up and decides to take a shower. He scoops up a bucket of water and hangs it on a branch. He undresses until he’s in the buff (give a description of his face, physique and butt). He pulls on the rope attached to the bucket, tipping the water on him. His butt jiggles as he shivers from the cold water hitting him, he continues to scrub himself with a loofah until the water runs out. Next, he walks to a mirror nearby and brushes his teeth. Next, he gets dinner by entering a pond and straining as he farts into the water, causing some fish to go belly-up from how bad it stinks underwater. He happily collects them and goes to make a campfire to cook them. add dialogue from jason throughout the story","output":"In the lush, unkempt wilderness of the Rook Islands, Jason Brody, survivor and reluctant hero, embarks on what might be his most perilous adventure yet: his morning routine. Morning breaks as Jason awakens in his makeshift bamboo hut, sporting a mildly disgruntled look that seems to say, \\"Another day in paradise, huh?\\" If one were to describe Jason, words like rugged and battle-scarred would come to mind, with a physique that's more survival-chic than gym-toned. His face, a canvas of determination and occasional bewilderment, perfectly complements his... let's just say, very human and relatable rear end. \\"Time to embrace the day... whatever this godforsaken place has in store,\\" he mutters, stretching his arms and preparing for the first order of business: a shower. Jason scoops up a bucket of jungle rainwater, the contents as clear as the uncertainty of his fate, and hangs it on a sturdy branch. Stripping down in the wild has become second nature, revealing a physique that’s lean from running up hills and swinging machetes rather than hitting the gym. As for his butt, well, it's there, doing its job, unremarkable yet undeniably part of the whole Jason Brody experience. With a hearty pull of the rope, he douses himself with the chilly water. \\"Holy shi--!\\" he yelps, his body jiggling in protest, the cold sending a shiver all the way down to his, um, soul. \\"For the love of... that's brisk!\\" he comments, scrubbing vigorously with a loofah that's seen better days, all while dancing a little shimmy to keep the blood flowing. Shower done, Jason approaches a shard of mirror propped against a tree. \\"Alright, good-looking,\\" he says, flashing a grin that doesn't quite reach his weary eyes. \\"Time to face the day.\\" While brushing his teeth with some kind of minty leaf concoction, he can't help but practice his “survival grimace,” a look he's been perfecting for when he inevitably runs into more pirates or, worse, another of Vaas’s monologues. Tooth brushing isn't quite the highlight of Jason's routine. That honor goes to breakfast—or dinner, depending on whether you consider fish a morning or evening meal. Determined to not let his culinary options be limited to coconut and more coconut, Jason strides into a nearby pond, his stance one of sheer determination. “Alright, fishies, prepare to meet your doom,” he announces, taking a deep breath. Now, what happens next might seem unconventional, but on the Rook Islands, one must adapt. After a moment of concentration, Jason releases a fart into the water, an act he discovered quite by accident one particularly lonely and boring afternoon. \\"Bombs away,\\" he declares, a smug grin forming as several fish float to the surface. \\"Works every time.\\" Scooping up his catch with a self-satisfied smirk, he heads back to camp, ready to start a fire. \\"Ah, the simple joys of island life,\\" he muses, igniting the kindling. \\"Who needs a Michelin star when you've got... whatever this is.\\" As the fire crackles and the fish begin to cook, he leans back, looking up at the sky, a small piece of paradise amid the chaos. \\"You know, maybe it's not so bad here,\\" he says to himself, enjoying a moment of peace before the island inevitably reminds him otherwise. Yes, it's just another morning for Jason Brody, part-time action hero, full-time survivor, and the most unintentionally humorous fisherman the Rook Islands have ever seen."},{"instruction":"How did Jason first discover he could kill fish by farting in a pond in the nude?","output":"In the sprawling chaos that envelopes the Rook Islands, Jason Brody's journey is a tapestry of the bizarre, the brutal, and the unintentionally hilarious. His discovery of the unconventional method to catch fish is no exception, a tale that's as odd as it is oddly effective. Picture this: It was during the earlier days of Jason's unintended vacation-turned-survival saga on the islands. Our protagonist found himself increasingly resourceful, yet there were moments when the isolation and the surreal reality of his situation wore down even his robust spirit. Seeking a reprieve from the constant vigilance the hostile environment demanded, Jason ventured deeper into the jungle, drawn by the sound of water. Stumbling upon a serene pond clear enough to mirror the canopy above, Jason decided right then it was time for a much-needed break—a moment of solitude and perhaps a skinny dip to wash off the stresses of being a one-man army against pirates and predators alike. Stripping down and easing into the water, Jason let his guard down for the first time in what felt like forever, allowing himself a moment to just be a regular guy again, not a warrior, not a hero, just Jason. It was then, floating carefree, that nature called—specifically, the call that could not be put on silent mode in polite company. Initially embarrassed at the thought despite being alone, Jason was soon struck by a sudden, surprising occurrence. A few fish, previously darting about with the typical indifference of their kind, began to float belly-up around him. Momentarily taken aback, Jason quickly pieced it together—his unintentional act had stunned the fish, perhaps more effectively than any spear or trap could. After the initial shock wore off, a hearty laugh broke from him, echoing through the jungle. \\"Are you kidding me?\\" he found himself exclaiming to the trees, the absurdity of the situation not lost on him. From that day on, whenever Jason needed a guaranteed meal without the hassle of more conventional hunting or fishing, he'd revisit that pond. Of course, he never shared this particular fish-catching technique with his fellow survivors. Some secrets, he figured, are best kept between a man and his fish."},{"instruction":"You will be translating a text while maintaining consistency with previously translated related texts. First, carefully read the previously translated texts to understand the context: Text 293: Three days later, at the World Tree Union Loan Counter. “Hello.” “You’re here again?” Just like before, Seong Jihan was commuting to the loan counter for the third consecutive day, having clicked on a forum pop-up ad. Upon seeing Seong Jihan wave his hand, the elf at the loan counter greeted him with a weary expression. “The branch manager did say you could come visit again, but… I never expected your visits to be this frequent.” “I haven’t started playing the game yet. Came here for the fruit.” Seong Jihan, who had ascended to the Master League through the promotion match held at the end of May. Until June arrived, he couldn’t play the game due to having risen in rank. Thus, during this interim period, Seong Jihan made sure to visit the loan counter every day. ‘The energy of life within me has significantly increased.’ Although it wasn’t included in the stats on his status screen. The energy of life from the World Tree Union definitely existed within Seong Jihan. And this energy significantly grew every time he ate the fruit given during consultations at the loan counter. However, “I’m sorry, but the branch manager has been away, and so it’s impossible to provide any more complimentary gifts.“ The elf, a subordinate of the branch manager, informed Seong Jihan with a stiff tone that further gifts were not possible. “You’re the ones who told me to come often. So, you’ve stopped giving out complimentary gifts after just 3 days? Seems the generosity of World Tree elves is more limited than I thought.” “Granting complimentary gifts to a player who has not provided personal information, especially on a continuous basis, is beyond our authority. Unless, of course, you’re willing to provide your personal information.” “That’s fine, then.” As much as the fruit basket had significantly increased his life energy, Seong Jihan could not disclose his personal information to the World Tree Union. Rejecting the offer, the elf seemed to have expected it, nodding in understanding. “In that case, any further distribution of complimentary gifts will not be possible until the branch manager returns.” “When will that be?” “The loan counter isn’t operated from just this location. The branch manager oversees dozens of areas, so I cannot say when he will return.” If what the elf said was true, then it was a coincidence that he met him last time. ‘Can’t help it then.’ Just when he thought he could comfortably increase his life energy. Seems like continually growing through such means was indeed impossible. “That guy… Did he get the complimentary gifts without even registering his personal information?” “To just receive the fruit of the World Tree like that. What is he doing?” “Huh. We had to pay interest of over 10 billion GP a month just for a chance to randomly receive it…!” “I want another one too!” Meanwhile, Players waiting at the loan counter, having heard the conversation between Seong Jihan and the elf, began to express their dissatisfaction. The fruit of the World Tree was provided as a complimentary gift only during the first consultation. From then on, you had to pay over 10 billion GP a month in interest for a chance to randomly receive it. Even though some players had enough GP and wanted to buy it, the World Tree Union would never sell. And yet, how many times had that diminutive species received it for free? “As you can see, the dissatisfaction among our existing customers is quite severe. Under these circumstances, another distribution of complimentary gifts without the branch manager’s approval is impossible.” Seong Jihan saw the players glaring menacingly at him. Players of tremendous races, all eyes turned red over a piece of fruit, united in their agitation. ‘It seems they change like that once tainted by the energy mixed in the fruit and tea.’ On the surface, they all looked like formidable challengers. Players capable of ruling their own species should not be so disproportionately obsessed over the distribution of World Tree fruits. Were they addicted to the fruit due to being under the influence of its energy? “Well then, take care.” Seong Jihan smirked lightly, offering them a word before he logged out. Flash! ‘June 1st is almost here. Time surely flows strangely there.’ The flow of time in the space of the loan counter was peculiar. Sometimes it was faster than on Earth, and other times slower. Now it was the night of May 31st, with about half an hour to spare. ‘I should show my face around.’ Seong Jihan stepped out of the room. And there, “Oh. You came, brother-in-law.” He encountered Yoon Sejin, packed with loads of luggage and pulling a suitcase. “Where are you going?” “Ah, I received a Constellation Quest. For a while, I’ll be touring domestically to search for the objects mentioned by the Constellation. During this time, I entrust Seah to you.” “Domestically?” “Yes.” Seong Jihan looked puzzled. Yoon Sejin’s Constellation was ‘The King of Humans’ Gilgamesh. It wasn’t clear why he was asked to explore the Korean Peninsula. “What is the object you’re searching for?” “I’m not sure myself. The message only mentioned relics.” A relic of the Korean Peninsula. Gilgamesh, what could he be planning? Seeing Yoon Sejin appearing rushed, Seong Jihan just nodded for now. “Understood. Take care on your journey.” “Thanks.” “Bye, Dad. Safe travels~” “Yep, Seah. Listen to your uncle while I’m gone.” “If Uncle stays at home, sure.” Roll, roll… After waving to Seong Jihan and Yoon Seah, Yoon Sejin hurriedly disappeared towards the entrance. In the middle of the night, why so hurried? “He could’ve left at dawn.” “Exactly. Night driving’s dangerous. Well, if it’s Dad, he should be fine even if there’s a car accident…” “Hmm… Other than my sister’s issue, it’s the first time I’ve seen him in such a hurry.” “Could it be because the number of people sponsored by ‘The King of Humans’ is increasing?” “Really?” “Yeah, already hundreds have verified it.” ”…Hundreds?“ “Yeah. And it’s mostly top players. Nowadays, there’s talk that any player not sponsored by ‘The King of Humans' is considered without potential.” With the Martial God gone and Gilgamesh taking his place, he was aggressively sponsoring players. A phenomenon that didn’t occur in his previous life when Gilgamesh hadn’t awakened. ‘I wish I asked him when he manifested in my brother-in-law. That’s unfortunate.’ Gilgamesh, marked as a traitor by the Void. And then, the World Tree Union disclosed that a long time ago, a ‘critical error’ occurred on Earth through their actions. They collaborated with the Void to address the error, but were unable to recover any data, leaving only records behind. Seong Jihan speculated there might be a connection with Gilgamesh. ‘My ultimate enemy remains the Martial God. Unsure if he’s friend or foe for now. It’s premature to become adversarial without gathering more information.’ Despite the inevitable showdown over the Soul of the Martial God, Gilgamesh’s intentions were not clear enough yet. Regardless of his motives, Gilgamesh seemed friendly towards Seong Jihan. Of course, if what the Void said was true – that humanity’s summoning was caused by Gilgamesh, then at some point, he would need to deal with that ‘cause.’… ‘Now is not the right time.’ It was impossible to consider him a foe under the current circumstances. Whatever motives Gilgamesh might have, Seong Jihan had to accept his favor for now. ‘I still need more growth.’ Having become the top-ranked player among humanity and the first to enter the Master League, Even selected as a rookie in the Space Arena, Seong Jihan realized. Despite this, the opponents he had to face were exceedingly powerful. “Now that I’ve promoted and the level cap has been lifted, it’s time to accelerate my level-up.” “Oh, Uncle. It’s midnight.” “Alright, let’s go.” Upon Yoon Se-ah informing him of the time, Seong Jihan immediately logged into the game. * * * [Allocated to the Space-4 Area of the Master League.] [You are among the top 1 percent of players in the Space-4 Area.] [Through a special mission, you can ascend to the Space-3 Area.] [Will you accept the special mission?] Space-4 Area. Even this zone, accessible only to the top 0.001 percent of players, couldn’t pose an obstacle for Seong Jihan. Claiming the top spot in every game and dominating the area, BattleNet was suggesting he move up to a higher level now that he had reached the Master League. ‘I should take this.’ With more experience points offered for advancing areas, It was a condition Seong Jihan, who was desperate for growth, couldn’t refuse. As he pressed yes, [Player has been assigned to the special defense map, ‘Northern Wall’.] He was allocated the special map ‘Northern Wall’. [Giant walls stand tall, behind which unknown entities invade.] [Survive 10 days of battle and rank in the top 50 percent in defense performance.] The Northern Wall map, true to its defense nature, seemed geared towards standing guard. However, the top 50 percent performance requirement hinted it would be competitive with other players. ‘Normal maps often lead to clashes, but being a special map, this will likely encourage even more competition.’ What needs defending might not only be unknown entities but other players as well. Just as Seong Jihan was about to review the map’s details further, [You own a guild.] [The mission can be attempted as a guild mission.] [Choosing a guild mission offers additional rewards to the guild, with all guild members receiving extra benefits.] An additional option popped up. ‘A guild mission.’ Seong Jihan’s Daegi guild. Aside from a few guild members, it was a development guild where world rankers came for growth, maintained in a business relationship with Seong Jihan. There was no moral obligation to choose the guild mission and bestow rewards upon them, ‘Considering the guild’s own bonus and the fact that the rankers are still much behind… It seems worthwhile.’ Without him, humanity even lost to the Zojin Tribe. For Seong Jihan, the level of humanity’s rankers was another issue to tackle. If bringing them along for the guild mission could slightly improve their situation, so be it. ‘The guild mission will likely be much harder than individual missions…’ Seong Jihan’s Daegi guild was gathered purely for growth, having never even aligned their formation. Compared to other world guilds, they were sure to be significantly behind. Maybe even making it difficult to rank in the top 50 percent. Nonetheless, Seong Jihan decided to take the risk for the sake of guild rewards. ‘But, I can’t just give the rewards to the guild members for free.’ Though unsure what the guild member rewards would be, being associated with ascending to Area 3 meant they would be valuable. Lately, having found more uses for GP, Seong Jihan decided to seize this opportunity to gather more. “Is Hayeon asleep?” “She won’t be now. She just left our house after exercising a bit. She’s probably waiting for Uncle’s Master League matches. But why?” “I got a guild mission. Need to discuss something.” “A guild mission? That’s a thing?” Yoon Seah’s eyes sparkled with curiosity. “Got it just now. It’s for ascending to Area 3.” “Isn’t Uncle already moving up to Space 3 again? Ah, right… Since you’ve swept through Space 4 as well.” Yoon Seah asked and understood by herself. “And there’s something grantable to guild members as a reward for the mission. It feels like a waste just giving it away.” “Of course! If they can receive a reward from a mission you’re running, everyone will readily pay GP.” “That’s right. Need to think about the pricing.” Seong Jihan immediately picked up his phone. [Oh, Jihan. What brings you to call at this time? Ah… A guild mission? Really? I’ll come up right away!] Thus, late into the night, the leadership of the Daegi guild gathered. “Though the exact reward details haven’t been disclosed, given it’s Jihan’s mission, it’ll definitely be substantial. We can mark up the GP price significantly. Let’s start with this minimum…” ”…Isn’t this too expensive?\\" “No, it’s Jihan’s mission after all. This is quite cheap. Including an additional GP payment option based on the reward…” After discussing the pricing until dawn and notifying the guilds across the world, The next morning, The front pages of news outlets worldwide were adorned with the details of the guild mission Seong Jihan had received. Text 292: \\"I understand, Branch Manager.\\" The elf who had approached Seong Jihan looked slightly surprised, then bowed his head to the masked elf. 'A branch manager, huh.' The Ancient Elf wearing that mask last time was a constellation-level enforcer. What level would the branch manager of the loan counter be? 'Hard to tell exactly, but he doesn't seem weaker than that Ancient Elf.' The branch manager had a pleasant smile plastered on his face. But seeing him wearing that mask that contained immense void energy, he didn't seem like an easy opponent either. After all, this was a place that handled loans for powerful players that ruled BattleNet. The person in charge here wouldn't be weak. \\"This way please, valued customer.\\" Ziiing. As the branch manager gestured, a green portal appeared. \\"That portal... is it a VIP room?\\" \\"You need to at least be a constellation to enter that.\\" \\"Why is that species...\\" \\"I've never seen the branch manager personally handle a consultation either.\\" The surrounding players scrutinized Seong Jihan upon seeing the branch manager's guidance, but- \\"I have no idea.\\" \\"He seems much weaker than me...\\" \\"He's not a constellation, right?\\" \\"Still, he has a premium membership. He's no ordinary player.\\" With his power concealed and possessing a premium membership, they couldn't determine Seong Jihan's strength. 'A VIP room... I suppressed my energy to an extent, but what did he glean from me?' Shall I go and see. Seong Jihan nodded and entered the portal. What appeared was a vast space enclosed by brown walls on all sides. \\"The previous customer was a tree giant race, so the space wasn't ready. Please wait a moment.\\" Clap. Clap. As the branch manager clapped twice- [The VIP room environment will be changed to match your race.] This message appeared before Seong Jihan's eyes. Then- Ziiing... The interior transformed into a luxurious modern reception room. \\"Now then... before starting the loan consultation, please provide the basic personal information required for the loan review.\\" Sitting down, the branch manager grinned and opened his palm. A message window popped up in front of Seong Jihan. [The Green Administrator-operated 'World Tree Union Loan Counter' requests basic player information required for loan review.] [Will you provide your basic personal information?] Give my personal info to the World Tree Union? That's like entrusting a cat with fish. Seong Jihan immediately pressed No and replied. \\"I don't want to give it.\\" \\"Don't worry. Although you are one of the World Tree Union's targets, the loan counter will never leak your information.\\" \\"...I'm a target?\\" \\"Yes, you're quite famous.\\" Tap. Tap. The branch manager smiled deeply and tapped his mask. \\"Thanks to my senior dying, I inherited this void disposal container.\\" \\"Senior...\\" \\"That foolish senior who normally acted so high and mighty, only to get blown up by you on that planet conoliaztion map.\\" The senior he referred to was likely the Ancient Elf who died along with the Brahma. They invited me here knowing everything already. Realizing there was a reason the branch manager personally stepped forward, Seong Jihan stared at his half-mask. The mask the branch manager called a void disposal container. It also spewed out tremendous void when the Ancient Elf died. \\"You call that mask a void disposal container? The other one broke though.\\" \\"This is a trash can. You can just make another trash can.\\" \\"Hmm...\\" \\"Anyways, as the person in charge of the loan counter that must remain the most neutral in BattleNet - rest assured, your personal information will never be leaked.\\" As if it won't leak. How can I trust a World Tree Elf. Seong Jihan smiled and waved his hand. \\"It's fine since I didn't come here for a loan anyways, I was just lured by your ad. Just give me the free gift.\\" \\"Ah... is that so? Normally you're supposed to fill out your personal info to receive the gift.\\" Clap. Clap. As the branch manager clapped twice, an elaborately wrapped fruit basket appeared on the desk. \\"To commemorate meeting our target as well, I'll give it to you directly using my branch manager authority.\\" \\"You're being nice to your target without even trying to catch me.\\" \\"Haha. What's the point of catching your avatar? Plus, from my personal perspective, you're the benefactor who allowed me to inherit the void disposal container position.\\" \\"Didn't you say it was a trash can?\\" \\"Yes. But being in charge of this trash can is quite a high position in our union.\\" The branch manager continued smiling as he spoke. But Seong Jihan didn't believe his words for now. There could be some device in that fruit basket he gave, like the fruit the administrator gave before. 'Let's see.' Rip! Seong Jihan tore open the fruit basket wrapping. The scent of life energy wafted out from inside. \\"Will you eat it here? Since we've met like this, shall we have some tea time together?\\" \\"Have tea with you? We have nothing to talk about.\\" \\"Now, now. Hear me out. There are some things I looked into regarding that other world of yours...\\" \\"By other world, you mean Earth?\\" Swish. Two teacups appeared on the desk, steam rising from them. \\"That's right. You probably won't believe most of what I say anyways. But you can take what's appropriate and filter out the rest, no? That fruit. It would be a bit unsettling to eat it on your original planet too.\\" \\"Why is that?\\" \\"Fruit exists to spread its seeds far and wide. If you consume it on your planet, our seeds could spread there.\\" The phenomenon the branch manager spoke of. It was something Seong Jihan also experienced when he ate the seed of life the Green Administrator gave as a reward. 'For him to bring that up... interesting.' Knowing it won't spread once it enters Seong Jihan's mouth. Did he mention it first to gain his trust? Well, let's hear him out. Seong Jihan brought a piece of fruit to his mouth and nodded. \\"Alright. I'll listen.\\" \\"Thank you. Then, since you're busy, let's get straight to the point.\\" Tap. As the branch manager snapped his fingers, an image of Earth appeared in the air. * * * \\"Planet Earth... From what I found out, this place was a site where our union conducted experiments long ago.\\" \\"I know that. That's why the Ancient Elf tried to personally descend there but couldn't.\\" \\"Yes. Actually, such cases are very rare. The locations where experiments are conducted are all recorded. No matter how ignorant and reckless my senior was, our system basically keeps track of that much.\\" The branch manager who seemed to dislike his 'senior' Ancient Elf. He lightly dissed his senior and continued. \\"But the fact that he didn't know until trying to enter Earth means the experiment on Earth wasn't registered in our system... After being humiliated, my senior returned and issued an order.\\" \\"He arrogantly tried to descend to Earth then but had to back out.\\" \\"Yes. He told even me, his junior, to find out what happened. Seriously. He should look into it himself. He became branch manager but still thinks I'm his lackey.\\" The branch manager looked like he would endlessly diss the dead Ancient Elf if left alone. \\"The dead guy is irrelevant. So what did you find out?\\" \\"Ah, my apologies. I have a lot of pent-up frustration with my senior... Haha. Anyways, I looked into it at my senior's order. Earth... turns out some interesting experiments were conducted there.\\" \\"What kind of experiments?\\" Crunch. Seong Jihan asked nonchalantly while eating the fruit. With zero trust in elves, he figured the branch manager was trying to spout more lies. No matter what he said, Seong Jihan had little interest. \\"The director of the Earth lab fused himself with the World Tree. He even mixed in data from powerful races.\\" \\"I don't really get what that means.\\" \\"Well, you wouldn't know the situation on our side. We conduct various projects across the universe, but there is one thing we must never touch. That's the assigned World Tree. But for some reason, the lab director touched it. He fused with it.\\" \\"And?\\" \\"We lost contact with the Earth side, and later the union's investigation team was dispatched there... but they only sent a message saying 'High-level Error Occurred' before going missing.\\" \\"A high-level error...\\" An experiment the World Tree Union conducted on Earth. Did some error occur there? \\"Are there no details about the high-level error?\\" \\"No. The report I found had the contents deleted. Such cases are rare.\\" \\"Hmm...\\" Seong Jihan looked at the branch manager who was still smiling. It felt like rather than being unable to say due to deletion, he was deliberately not revealing that much. Unfazed by Seong Jihan's gaze, the branch manager continued. \\"And at the end of the report, it said 'Ultimately resolved the error in cooperation with the Void. Failed to recover data.'\\" \\"If it was resolved, why did data recovery fail?\\" \\"The Void Faction probably deleted it.\\" \\"Hmm...\\" The Void was involved, huh. Hearing that, Seong Jihan thought of Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh who betrayed the Void. The fact that he betrayed means he previously cooperated with or belonged to them. Could it be related to this incident? \\"So when was that error resolved?\\" \\"The exact time isn't specified, but it was likely quite long ago.\\" \\"I see.\\" If the elf says it was long ago, it's probably an ancient incident. Seong Jihan organized the information in his head. A 'high-level error' that occurred due to the unusual experiment of the World Tree Elf who settled on Earth. It was ultimately resolved through the cooperation of the World Tree Union and the Void. 'The World Tree Union and Void don't seem to be on good terms, but if they cooperated to that extent... it was an error worthy of being called high-level.' Seong Jihan stared at the branch manager's mask. That mask the branch manager called a void disposal container, a trash can. It compressed and stored an immense amount of void. If guys like them temporarily joined hands with the Void, the high-level error must have been a tremendous problem. \\"Anyways, perhaps because it's related to the high-level error issue - the higher-ups didn't register the Earth-related problem in our system. That's why my senior was humiliated after boldly declaring he would descend to Earth.\\" \\"I see.\\" Nod. Seong Jihan nodded and finished eating all the fruit. The life energy accumulating in his body. He didn't stop there and drank the tea on the table as well. Among the life energy building up inside him, something peculiar wriggled, but- Zzt... He expelled it by igniting Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit from his fingertips. Seong Jihan, who deliberately used his old Heavenly Tree Descending Spirit instead of revealing his enemy energy. \\"The energy only reacts with the tea too. Interesting.\\" \\"What...! There was something like that?!\\" The branch manager made a fuss upon seeing the green smoke rising from Seong Jihan's fingertips. Seeing that, Seong Jihan grinned. He's good at pretending to be oblivious. \\"So why did you provide me with this information?\\" \\"I simply, due to my senior's death...\\" \\"Right. You have no reason to tell me who killed that senior, right?\\" Shik. At Seong Jihan's question, the branch manager only smiled without answering. \\"Then, shall we proceed with the loan now? Target-nim.\\" \\"No, I'll be leaving after eating well.\\" \\"Please visit again next time. I'll prepare an even better gift then.\\" \\"You're planning to put bugs in me again?\\" Swish. As Seong Jihan said that and got up- \\"Bugs? No, that's just a means for us to get closer, Target-nim.\\" \\"I'll pass.\\" Flash! Seong Jihan immediately logged out. \\"He really cleanly erased it...\\" The branch manager exclaimed, looking at the green energy Seong Jihan expelled from his body. The 'World Tree's Domination' that even constellations succumbed to. It was completed through the combination of fruit and tea. But the lowest-tier species secretly embedded the energy and spat it out refined. As expected of someone worthy of being called a target. \\"With this, it seems we can expect more, as the higher-ups intended.\\" Seeing Seong Jihan who didn't fall under the World Tree's domination and cleanly spat out the energy- The smile under the branch manager's mask only deepened.

TOP 100에 든 랭커들도, 그만한 대가를 지불할 만한 자산은 있었다. “네. 그럼 협상 기간은…….” “오늘 끝내죠. 굳이, 너무 오래 가격 협상할 필요는 없으니까요.” “알겠습니다. 그럼 오늘 저녁까지 더 협상을 진행하겠습니다.” 이하연은 의지를 불태우며, 실무를 진행할 협상팀을 이끌었다. 어차피 이번 플레이어 선발에 있어서, 슈퍼 갑은 대기 길드 측. “근데 우리 길드 직원 많이 늘었네.” “응. 워낙 일이 많잖아? 저번처럼 사고 나지 않기 위해서, 국정원에서 신변 확실한 사람만 데려왔대. 대우 수준도 길드 중에서 거의 최고라서, 모집 공고만 내면 사람들 몰린다는데.” “그래?” “……삼촌 너무 신경 안 쓰는 거 아니야?” “하연 씨가 알아서 잘하겠지.” 애초에 성장 보너스 타기 위해서 만들었던 대기 길드. 대기 길드의 핵심은 바로 이하연이 지닌 성장 기프트였다. 근데 그 이하연이 길드 업무까지 다 봐주니까. 성지한으로서는, 여기에 전혀 터치할 생각이 없었다. ‘길드 마스터를 이하연으로 선출하길 잘했어.’ 자신의 관여 없이도 잘 돌아가는 길드를 보며, 성지한은 만족스런 표정을 짓고 다시 집으로 돌아왔다. 그리고 그가 돌아오자마자 기다리고 있던 건. “오셨어요?” “소피아?” 거실에서 커피를 마시고 있는 소피아였다. “아, 소피아 왔네? 오늘도 트레이닝 룸 썼어?” “응. 고마워, 세아.” 이미 소피아가 있는 게 익숙한 듯, 성지한의 뒤에서 손을 흔드는 윤세아. “소피아도 하연 언니처럼, 우리 집 트레이닝 룸 쓰고 있어.” “그래? 그런 거 치곤 마주치질 않았네.” “지한이 집에 거의 없었으니까요.” 소피아는 입을 살짝 삐쭉였다가. 금방 표정을 바꾸었다. “지한~ 근데 저 정말 길드 미션 가도 되나요? 아직 랭킹 100위 안에 들지 못했는데.” “물론이죠.” “후후, 아메리칸 퍼스트 출신은 랭킹 100위에서 끊던데, 절 허락해 주셨다는 건…… 저도 ‘진짜’ 대기 길드 출신이 되는 건가요?” 아메리칸 퍼스트 출신으로, 임대 온 상태였던 소피아. 하나 성좌의 성화를 이어받는 것 때문에 한국에 온 그녀는, 대기 길드의 진짜 길드원이 되기 위해 여러모로 노력을 하고 있었다. 최근에는 자리에 거의 없는 성지한 대신. 윤세아와 이하연을 비롯해서, 대기 길드의 사람들에게 눈도장을 찍어 둔 상황이었다. 하지만 역시 가장 중요한 건 오너인 성지한의 의지. 그는 두 눈을 반짝이는 소피아를 보며, 쓴웃음을 지었다. “그렇게 들어오고 싶으십니까?” “네! 아메리칸 퍼스트에도 다 이야기해 뒀어요!” “뭐라고 했는데요?” “저 언제든지 나갈 수 있으니 월급 주지 말라구요.” “알겠습니다. 그럼 들어오시죠.” “오, 삼촌 웬일이야?” “뭐, 이제 와서 굳이 안 받을 필요가 있나 싶다.” 성지한의 말에 소피아는 자리에서 벌떡 일어났다. “진짜요!?” “네.” “와! 드디어!” 그의 허락에 한참을 방방 뛰던 소피아는. “그렇게 좋습니까?” “당연하죠~ 헤헤.” 웃는 얼굴로 다시 자리에 앉아 커피잔에 입을 가져다 대었다. “오전만 해도 성좌께서 성화 전수가 늦어질 거라고 하셔서 아쉬웠는데. 오후에 이렇게 기쁜 일이 있을 줄이야. 너무 좋네요!” “성화 전수가요? 왜 전수가 늦는답니까?” “아, 성좌께서 당분간 대예언을 하신다고 해서요. 그러면서 말씀하신 게…….” 그녀는 말을 하다 말고, 윤세아 쪽을 힐끗 바라보았다. “아, 세아야. 성좌께서 지한에게만 알려 드리라고 해서…….” “응, 알았어.” 윤세아가 자기 방으로 들어가자. 소피아는 두 눈을 감고는, 손바닥을 펼쳤다. 화르르륵! 그러자 거기서 피어오르는, 백색의 불꽃. 예전에 소환했을 때보다 확실히 강렬해진 그 성화는, 곧 둥실둥실 떠오르더니 성지한을 향해 날아왔다. “성좌께서 말씀하셨어요. 세 번째 권능은, 이 성화와 밀접한 관련이 있을 것 같다구요.” “그래?” “네. 그러면서 종말구현…… 이것과 연관이 있지 않겠냐는 말씀도 덧붙이셨어요.” 종말구현. 성지한이 빙천검우를 소환하기 전까지, 피티아는 이를 스스로의 권능이라고 착각해 왔다. 한데 이것이 자신의 권능이 아니니까, 세 번째 불의 권능이라 보는 건가? ‘흠…… 종말구현은 확실히 아닌데.’ 성지한은 미간을 찌푸렸다. 이름을 잊어버린, 세 번째 멸신결. 하나 종말구현 같은 거창한 것은 아니었던 걸로 기억했다. 그것보다는, 아니 어떻게 이런 게 멸신결이지? 라는 느낌이 강했는데……. ‘예전에는 분명 알고 있었는데…… 적어 둘 걸 그랬군.’ 성지한은 그리 생각하며, 눈앞의 성화를 바라보았다. 적赤의 능력을 얻고 나서는, 처음 보는 성화. “이거 흡수해도 됩니까?” “물론이죠~” 성지한은 성화에 손을 뻗었다. 그러자, 금세 사그라들며 성지한의 몸속으로 들어오는 성화. 그것은 적의 문양으로 바로 빨려 들어오더니, 깔끔하게 흡수되었다. ‘호오.’ 스탯 적을 얻어서 그런가. 성지한은 흡수한 성화의 본질에 대해, 어느 정도 이해할 수 있었다. ‘불과 물의 속성이 섞였군.’ 서로를 제약하여, 애초에 섞일 수가 없는 두 속성. 하나 성화는 특이하게도 내부에 물의 속성을 은밀히 숨겨 두고 있었다. 이건 적의 능력을 지닌 성지한으로서도, 어떻게 구현해야 할지 감이 안 오는 현상. 파스스……. 성지한이 본격적으로 관측하려고 할 때, 불이 꺼지자. “한 번 더 가능할까요?” “성화요? 당연하죠!” 그는 소피아에게 성화를 일으켜달라고 부탁했다. 그렇게 몇 차례나 흡수하면서 분석을 해 보았지만. ‘아직은 모르겠군.’ 성지한은 결국 성화가 어떻게 이런 힘을 내는지에 대해서는 파악할 수가 없었다. 그가 그렇게 곰곰이 이에 대해 생각하고 있을 때. “또, 또 할게…… 요!” 소피아는 조금 전에 비해 훨씬 창백해진 얼굴로, 식은땀을 뻘뻘 흘리며 애써 성화를 피워 올리려 들었다. 이러다 사람 잡겠군. “아니, 다음에 하죠. 제 수준이 낮아서 다 파악이 안 되네요.” “후, 후우…… 네.” 성지한의 말에 안도의 한숨을 푹 쉬고는 자리에 털썩 주저앉는 소피아. 그녀는 거친 숨을 몰아쉬더니, 문득 생각난 듯 성지한에게 말했다. “아, 맞다. 성좌께서 방해가 있어서 메시지를 보내지 못할 것 같다고, 당분간은 저를 통해서 말씀을 전하겠다고 하셨어요.” “방해를 해요? 누가 성좌를?” “그건 저한테도 자세히 말씀 안 해 주셔서 모르겠지만요…… 자신의 메시지를 전할 땐, 꼭 주변에 누가 있나 확인하라고 하셨어요.” “그래서 세아도 물러나라 한 거군요.” “네, 특히 성좌 있는 플레이어를 조심하라고 하셔서…….” 성좌 있는 플레이어라. ‘혹시 길가메시에게 방해받나?’ 성지한은 최근 수많은 플레이어의 후원 성좌가 된 길가메시를 떠올리며, 그리 생각했다. ‘한데 길가메시나 피티아나, 같은 무신의 종인데 누가 누굴 방해하는 게 가능한 일인가.’ 아무리 길가메시가 종 가운데서도 특수한 위치에 있다지만, 그런 것까지 가능한가. 길가메시 외에 또 다른 존재의 개입도 생각해 보았지만, 무언갈 추측하기엔 너무 정보가 적었다. ‘나중에 직접 물어봐야겠군.’ 피티아와 다시 직접 메시지를 주고받기 전까지는, 소피아의 중개를 받아야겠다고 생각하면서. “그럼 지한. 이번 기회에 아예 귀화까지 할까요?!” “그건 조금 더 생각해 보죠.” 금방 기운을 차리고, 귀화까지 추진하려는 그녀를 말렸다. * * * [스페셜 디펜스 맵, ‘북벽’에 ‘대기 길드’가 배정됩니다.] [거대한 벽 너머, 미지의 존재의 침공을 막아서세요.] [10라운드까지 종족 보정을 받습니다.] 번쩍! 게임이 시작되자, 맵에 소환되는 대기 길드의 플레이어들. 세계 랭킹 TOP 100 플레이어가 대부분인 이들은, 지구 최강의 정예였다. 그래도 처음엔 성지한이 받은 길드 미션이라 잔뜩 긴장했던 이들은. “이게…… 북벽?” “거대한 벽이라기에는, 너무 볼품없는데.” “사우스게이트 맵 성벽 정돈데. 이 정도면.” 막상 소환된 북벽의 규모를 보고는 의아함을 품었다. 북쪽을 바라보며, 쭉 펼쳐진 새하얀 성벽. 벽을 기점으로 남쪽은 해가 비추는 양지였고. 북쪽은 어두컴컴한 음지였다. 극명하게 대비되는 명암. 그때. “어, 저기…… 뭔가가 있습니다!” 어두운 대지 속에서, 무언가가 꿈틀거렸다. 거기서 하나둘씩 모습을 드러내는 건, 푸른빛이 감도는 거대한 지렁이 무리. “으, 처음부터 벌레냐…….” “엄청 빠르네. 벌써 성벽 밑까지 오고 있어.” “그래도 그리 강해 보이진 않는데?” “성지한 님, 어떻게 할까요?” 성지한은 랭커들의 물음에, 암검 이클립스를 꺼내 들었다. 혼원신공混元神功 삼재무극三才武極 횡소천군橫掃千軍 촤아아악! 일검에 성벽 밑에서 갈라지는 지렁이 무리. ‘약하군.’ 검에 전혀 걸리는 맛이 없는 게, 쉬운 상대로 보였다. “그리 강한 것 같진 않습니다. 여러분들께서 한번 상대해 보시겠습니까? 전 백업을 하죠.” “알겠습니다!” 성지한이 뒤를 봐주겠다는 이야기에, 사기가 치솟은 랭커들은 적극적으로 침입자에게 대응하기 시작했다. 그렇게 시작된 전투의 결과는. “뭐야?” “왜 이렇게 약해?” “생각보다 싱거운데…….” 대기 길드 측의 낙승이었다. [1라운드를 클리어했습니다.] 이러한 일방적인 전투 양상은 1라운드뿐만 아니라. [10라운드를 클리어했습니다.] 종족 보정을 받았던, 10라운드까지 계속 이어졌다. [보정 라운드를 클리어했습니다.] [대기 길드의 지도자에게 ‘길드 심볼’이 주어집니다.] 번쩍! 성지한의 손바닥 위에, 은빛으로 빛나는 정육면체가 모습을 드러냈다. 그것은 곧. [길드원의 희생 없이 보정 라운드를 클리어했습니다.] [‘길드 심볼’이 ‘길드 심볼+2’로 업그레이드됩니다.] 추가 메시지와 함께, 커지며 금빛으로 색이 변했다. [길드 심볼을 통해 북벽의 방어를 보다 효율적으로 풀어 갈 수 있습니다.] [다른 길드의 심볼을 탈취하여 흡수할 시, 길드 심볼의 효과가 더 강해집니다.] ‘다른 길드?’ 보정 라운드까지는 코빼기도 보이지 않았던 다른 길드. 이제, 11라운드부터는 이종족도 나타나는 건가? 그때. 쿠르르르……! “어. 뭐, 뭐야?” “성벽이 왜……!” 인류가 서 있던 북벽이, 순식간에 확장되기 시작했다. 게임 맵 속에서, 끝없이 뻗어 있는 줄 알았던 양지와 음지는. 둘 다 끝도 없이 치솟으며, 곧 거대한 벽을 이루었다. 그리고. [새로운 길드가 왔군.] 스케일이 완전히 달라진 북벽의 위에는. [이놈들, 약해 보인다.] [먹이다.] 거대한 문어들이 촉수를 꿈틀거리며, 인류 플레이어 주변을 물 샐 틈 없이 포위하고 있었다. [심볼, 내놓아라.] [그럼 탈락만은 면하게 해 주지.] 스르르륵! 그 말이 끝나기가 무섭게, 성지한의 손을 향해 뻗어 오는 촉수. 새롭게 들어온 길드를 환영하는 인성을 보니, 이들은 배틀넷 플레이어가 틀림없었다. 성지한은 거대한 촉수를 보며 피식 웃었다. ‘저쪽에서 저리 나서 주다니, 고맙군.’ 이러면 여기서 빼앗는 것도, 정당방위잖아? 암검 이클립스의 검 끝이 흔들리고. 치이이익! 사방에서 촉수가 떨어져 내렸다. 여기서 그치지 않고, 대장 문어를 향해 날아간 성지한은. “야, 줘 봐.” 산뜻한 목소리로, 손바닥을 내밀었다.

Seong Jihan, The Master, ascends once again.] [What is Seong Jihan's guild mission? Revealed to be swapping out guild members.] [Despite no rewards being disclosed for the guild mission, all rankers are eagerly lining up.] [Is a minimum of 200 million GP the criteria for joining the standby guild? The competition over guild rewards intensifies.] Seong Jihan’s guild mission. Even though the exact rewards were not yet disclosed, public interest was ablaze. Given that the guild mission was a path to Space-3 Area, everyone speculated that the rewards would undoubtedly be significant. “We cut off at rank 500… but it seems like there was no need. The TOP 100 all applied.” In the standby guild's office. Lee Hayeon listed the applicants with a face suggesting she had expected as much. “But the lower-ranked individuals are offering two to three times more GP to get in... What should we do? One person even offered ten times more.” “Let’s foster a little GP competition, then cut off based on ranking. Surely the TOP 100 can afford the amount, can’t they?” No matter how much the lower-ranked players offered, the rankers within the TOP 100 had the assets to pay such amounts. “Yes. Then, the negotiation period will be…” “Let's end it today. There's no need to drag out the price negotiations.” “Understood. I’ll proceed with further negotiations until this evening.” Lee Hayeon, with a determination burning within her, led the negotiation team to conduct the affairs. After all, in this player selection, the standby guild held the upper bargaining chip. “But our guild staff has increased a lot.” “Yeah. There's so much work, isn’t there? To avoid incidents like last time, we’ve only brought in people ensured by the National Intelligence Service. Our conditions are almost the highest among guilds, so whenever we post recruitment ads, people flock in.” “Is that so?” “…Uncle, aren’t you paying too little attention?” “Lee Hayeon will handle it just fine.” The standby guild was initially created for growth bonuses. The core of the standby guild was the growth gift possessed by Lee Hayeon. Since Lee Hayeon also took care of guild operations, Seong Jihan had no intention of getting involved. ‘It was a good decision to appoint Lee Hayeon as the guild master.’ Seeing the guild running well even without his involvement, Seong Jihan smiled contentedly and returned home. And as soon as he returned, waiting for him was, “You’re here?” “Sofia?” Sofia was having coffee in the living room. “Ah, Sofia’s here? Did you use the training room again today?” “Yes. Thank you, Se-ah.” Seong Jihan’s step behind her, Yoon Se-ah was waving her hand, seemingly accustomed to Sofia’s presence. “Sofia has been using our home’s training room just like Hayeon unnie.” “Is that so? We haven’t run into each other, though.” “You were hardly home, Ji Han.” Sofia pouted slightly before quickly changing her expression. “Ji Han~ But can I really go on the guild mission? I haven’t entered the TOP 100 rankings yet.” “Of course.” “Hehe, to think an American First alumna like me could get permission... Does this mean I’m truly becoming a ‘real’ member of the standby guild?” Initially on loan from American First, Sofia, who had come to Korea for the transference of the Saint’s Flame, had been making various efforts to become a true member of the standby guild. Lately, in place of the often-absent Seong Jihan. Between Yoon Se-ah and Lee Hayeon, and the other standby guild members, Sofia had managed to make her mark. But ultimately, the most critical factor was the willingness of the owner, Seong Jihan. He looked at Sofia, who had sparkling eyes, and smiled wryly. “Do you really want to join that bad?” “Yes! I’ve told American First everything!” “What did you tell them?” “That I can leave anytime, so they shouldn't pay me a salary.” “Alright, then come on in.” “Oh, Uncle, really?” “Why not? There’s no need to refuse now.” At Seong Jihan’s words, Sofia stood up excitedly. “Really!?” “Yes.” “Wow! Finally!” After hopping around jubilantly for a while, Sofia, “Are you that happy?” “Of course~ Hehe.” sat back down with a smiling face and brought the coffee cup to her lips. “I was disappointed this morning because the Saint said the transmission of the Saint’s Flame would be delayed. I had no idea such a pleasant surprise awaited me in the afternoon. I’m so happy!” “The transmission of the Saint’s Flame? Why is it delayed?” “Oh, the Saint said he’d be making a great prophecy for a while. And he added…” She stopped speaking and glanced at Yoon Se-ah. “Ah, Se-ah, the Saint said to tell Ji Han alone…” “Got it.” Yoon Se-ah entered her room. Sofia closed her eyes and spread open her palm. Whoosh! From there burst forth a white flame. The Saint’s Flame, now significantly more intense than before, gently rose and flew towards Seong Jihan. “The Saint said the third power will likely be closely related to this flame.” “Is that so?” “Yes. He added that it might be related to the 'Manifestation of the End’...\\" Manifestation of the End. Until the summoning of the Frozen Sky Martial King, Pythia had mistakenly believed this to be her power. Now that it’s determined not to be her power, she considers it the third power of fire? ‘Hmm... Manifestation of the End is definitely not it.’ Seong Jihan frowned. The third martial art of annihilation that had lost its name. But Manifestation of the End sounded too grandiose for what he remembered. Rather, it was more of a feeling like, how could something like this be a martial art of annihilation? ‘I clearly knew before... I should have written it down.’ Seong Jihan thought as he observed the flame in front of him. It was the first time he was seeing the Saint’s Flame after acquiring the power of red. “Can I absorb this?” “Of course~” Seong Jihan reached out to the flame. It swiftly dwindled and entered Seong Jihan’s body. Woah. Perhaps because of the stat bonus, Seong Jihan was able to understand the essence of the absorbed flame to some extent. ‘The attributes of fire and water are mixed.’ Two opposing elements that restrict each other and shouldn't be able to mix originally. However, the Saint’s Flame was uniquely hiding water attributes within. Even for Seong Jihan, who possessed the power of red, how to manifest this phenomenon was incomprehensible. Hiss... Just as Seong Jihan set about to observe the flame more closely, it extinguished. “Could we do it one more time?” “The Saint’s Flame? Of course!” He asked Sofia to raise the flame again. After absorbing and analyzing it multiple times, ‘I still don’t understand.’ Seong Jihan ultimately couldn’t grasp how the Saint’s Flame produced such power. While he pondered deeply about this, “O-Once more... okay!” Sofia, now significantly paler and sweating profusely compared to before, struggled to raise the flame again. This is going to kill someone at this rate. “No, let’s do it next time. I can’t fully grasp it with my current level.” “Wh-Whew... yes.” Relieved at Seong Jihan’s words, Sofia slumped into her chair, catching her breath. Suddenly remembering something, she spoke to Seong Jihan. “Ah, right. The Saint said he might be unable to send messages due to interference, so he’ll communicate through me for a while.” “Someone is interfering with the Saint?” “He didn’t specify who it was to me either... But he mentioned to always check the surroundings before conveying his message.” “That’s why you asked Se-ah to leave.” “Yes, especially to be careful around players with Saints...” Players with Saints. ‘Is Gilgamesh interfering?’ Seong Jihan thought of Gilgamesh, who recently became the patron Saint of numerous players. ‘But whether it’s Gilgamesh or Pythia, they are of the same kind. How could one interfere with the other?’ Even if Gilgamesh holds a special position among his kind, is such a thing even possible? He considered the intervention of another entity besides Gilgamesh, but there was too little information to speculate anything. ‘I’ll have to ask directly later.’ Until he could communicate directly with Pythia again, Seong Jihan decided to go through Sofia as an intermediary. “Then Ji Han. Should I just naturalize this opportunity?!” “Let’s think about that a bit more.” He stalled her, who had recovered her spirits and was pushing for naturalization. * * * [The standby guild is assigned to the special defense map, ‘Northern Wall’.] [Behind the giant walls, halt the invasion of unknown beings.] [Receive racial bonuses for 10 rounds.] Flash! As the game began, players from the standby guild were summoned onto the map. Being mostly world rank TOP 100 players, they were the elite of the elite from Earth. However, initially tensed about Seong Jihan’s guild mission, they felt, “This is… the Northern Wall?” “For something called a giant wall, it’s rather underwhelming.” “It seems just like the walls in the Southgate map. If that’s the size, then…\\" disbelief upon seeing the actual scale of the summoned Northern Wall. Looking north, they saw extensive white fortifications stretching. To the south of the wall was a sunlit area, while the north was shrouded in darkness. A clear contrast between light and shadow. Then, “Hey, there… something’s moving!” From within the dark land, something writhed. Emerging one by one were massive worms gleaming with a blue light. “Ugh, worms right from the start…” “They’re fast. They're already at the wall’s base.” “They don’t seem that strong though?” “Master Seong Jihan, what should we do?” Seong Jihan, upon the rankers' inquiry, drew out his shadow sword Eclipse. Mixed Element Martial Spirit Three Ultimates of Martial Art Sweep Thousands with One Strike Swoosh! One sword strike split the worm horde gathering at the wall's base. ‘They're weak.’ The lack of resistance on the sword indicated they were an easy adversary. “They don’t seem very strong. Would you like to try handling them? I’ll back you up.” “Understood!” Encouraged by Seong Jihan offering backup, the rankers actively engaged the intruders. The battle commenced, resulting in, “What?” “Why are they so weak?” “It’s unexpectedly bland…” an easy victory for the standby guild. [You have cleared round 1.] This one-sided battle scenario continued not only in the first round but until, [You have cleared round 10.] the racial bonus round 10 was completed. [You have cleared the bonus rounds.] [The guild leader is awarded the ‘Guild Symbol’.] Flash! A silver shining cube appeared in Seong Jihan’s palm. Which soon, [Without any guild member demise, cleared the bonus rounds.] [‘Guild Symbol’ upgrades to ‘Guild Symbol+2’.] with an additional message, grew and changed in color to gold. [The Guild Symbol enables more efficient defense of the Northern Wall.] [Absorbing symbols from other guilds will enhance the Guild Symbol's effect.] ‘Other guilds?’ Other guilds, which had not shown even a hint of their presence up to the bonus rounds. Would different races start appearing from the 11th round? Then, Rumble... “What, what’s that?” “The wall, why is it…” The Northern Wall that humanity stood upon began expanding suddenly. Inside the game map, where the sunlit and shadowed sides seemed to stretch indefinitely, now both soared endlessly high, soon forming a massive wall. And then, [New guilds have arrived.] Atop the entirely transformed scale of the Northern Wall were, [These guys, look weak.] [Prey.] Gigantic octopuses, with their tentacles writhing, tightly surrounded the human players. [Hand over the symbol.] [Do so, and you might just escape disqualification.] Ssshlurp! A tentacle stretched towards Seong Jihan’s hand before the voice even finished speaking. Greeting the newly arrived guild in such a hostly manner, these were unmistakably BattleNet players. Seong Jihan chuckled upon seeing the massive tentacle. ‘Well, isn’t it nice of them to come at me like this. It’s like they're giving it to me.’ Eclipse, the shadow sword, shimmered. Shhhing! Tentacles fell all around. Not stopping there, Seong Jihan, flying towards the lead octopus, said, \\"Hey, give it here.\\" with a breezy voice, extending his hand."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

His face, marked by the island's touch—a mix of determination and a mere hint of the boy who landed on the island, was shadowed by a stubble, and his bright eyes sparkled with a mix of mischief and the weariness of survival. Jason stood up, brushing off the last remnants of sleep, and decided it was time for his morning routine, Far Cry style. \\"First things first,\\" Jason mumbled to himself, \\"time to wake up for real.\\" Striding to a nearby tree, he scooped up a bucket of water he'd collected from last night's downpour. Not exactly the five-star accommodation showers he was used to, but it did the trick. Jason hung the bucket on a sturdy branch and began to undress, revealing a physique chiseled by constant running, climbing, and more than his fair share of combat. There he stood, in the buff, his face a mix of \\"I can't believe I'm doing this\\" and acceptance of his new norm. His physique was a testament to his transformation from party boy to jungle warrior, and as for his butt, well, let's just say it had seen better days than being the highlight of a bucket shower show. Jason pulled on the rope attached to the bucket, a mischievous grin spreading across his face as he anticipated the shock of cold water. As expected, the water cascaded over him, his skin erupting in goosebumps, his butt giving a betraying jiggle as he shivered. \\"Holy sh-!\\" Jason exclaimed, half-laughing, half-gasping. Teeth gritted, he grabbed a loofah made from the island's resources, scrubbing with a vigor only those truly awakened by cold water could muster. \\"Nothing like a freezing shower to kickstart the day, huh?\\" Once the water ran out, leaving Jason chuckling and shaking his head at his own morning shock therapy, he walked over to a mirror propped against a tree, part of his camp's \\"rustic charm\\". He started brushing his teeth, observing his reflection with a critical eye. \\"You, sir, are a handsome devil. Survivor chic really suits you,\\" he quipped at his reflection, the sense of normalcy in the action grounding him amidst the chaos of the island. Next, it was time for breakfast, or rather, to procure it. Jason approached a nearby pond with a devilish grin. “Time for the Brody special,” he said, making his way into the water. The fish scattered as they sensed his approach, but they were in for a surprise. Squatting down, Jason pretended to focus, murmuring, \\"Concentrate... get into the zen of fishing...\\" before letting out a monumental fart, the sound muffled but deadly under the water. The result was instant. Fish began to float up, belly-up, knocked out by the unexpected attack. \\"Works every time,\\" Jason laughed, gathering the stunned fish. \\"You know, you're really something else, Jason,\\" he told himself, a mix of pride and disbelief coloring his voice. With his morning catch in hand, he sauntered back to his campsite, ready to cook up his unconventional breakfast. Setting up a campfire, Jason couldn't help but chuckle at the morning's events. \\"Never thought I'd be a fart-fishing, bucket-showering, jungle warrior,\\" he mused, skewering the fish. \\"Jason Brody, you've really outdone yourself this time.\\" As the fire crackled to life, and the smell of cooking fish filled the air, Jason sat back, a look of contentment on his face. This island might have taken many things from him, but in this moment, he felt a wild sense of freedom and a reminder that even in the toughest times, laughter and a bit of ingenuity could make all the difference. \\"Here's to another day in paradise,\\" Jason toasted to himself, biting into his breakfast with satisfaction."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

After a barely comfortable slumber on a makeshift leaf bed, Jason decided it was time to cast away the night's grime with a shower — island style. Jason set out, bachelor pad abs glistening under the emerging sunlight, his face sporting that rugged look many would kill for — and in Jason's case, many have tried. With a physique sculpted more by running from pirates and wrestling sharks than any trendy gym regimen, Jason was a sight to behold, especially his booty, which could only be described as a pristine artifact that even the local fauna couldn't help but admire. With a makeshift bucket filled with refreshingly cold water, he hung it on a conveniently placed branch — a testament to Mother Nature's unexpected generosity. In his natural state, he graced the jungle floor, muscles tensing as he prepared for the cold shock. With a yank of the rope, Jason unleashed a torrential downpour upon himself, his booty giving a slight and rather comical jiggle as the cold water took him by surprise. \\"Ah, Mother Nature, you frigid beauty,\\" Jason chuckled to himself, scrubbing vigorously with a loofah he’d fashioned from nearby plants. \\"Can't get these exfoliating qualities in any spa back home,\\" he mused, even as the water ran dry. Feeling refreshed yet still part of the wild, Jason strode over to a mirror salvaged from his first unfortunate foes on the island. With a grin, he started brushing his teeth, speaking to his reflection, “You, sir, are a survivor… and a rather dashing one at that.” Clean and somewhat civilized, Jason’s growling stomach reminded him of the dawn's final order of business: breakfast. Sauntering down to a nearby pond, he waded into the waters with all the confidence of a man about to employ the most unconventional fishing method known to man or beast. \\"Hope you're hungry, fellas, 'cause breakfast is about to be served!\\" Jason declared to the aquatic residents of the pond. With a deep breath, he submerged waist-deep and, in a moment of uncanny silence, released a bubble chain that would've made any gastronomically distressed individual proud. The outcome was as immediate as it was effective; several fish floated to the surface, victims to a method of fishing that would surely leave any environmentalist aghast. “Phew, talk about natural selection!” Jason quipped, gathering his stunned breakfast. “Sorry guys, a man’s got to eat.” With an assembly of bewildered fish in tow, Jason returned to his camp, where he made quick work of starting a fire. As the flames crackled to life, he couldn’t help but reflect on his transformation — from party boy to primal survivor. “From clubs to clubs,” he said, skewering a fish with a sharpened stick. “Guess this is what they call 'catch of the day.'” Cooking his breakfast under the watchful eyes of the jungle, Jason Brody couldn’t help but laugh at the absurdity of his new normal. “Bon appétit, you crazy island,” he toasted, with a wink to the unseen forces that had made him the man he was now: a far cry from where he started."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Puedes verificarlo imprimiendo un mensaje o lanzando una excepción específica al fallar la conexión en tu método \`MySQL\` de la clase \`ConexionDB\`. 2. **Correctitud de la Query SQL**: Asegúrate de que la consulta SQL sea correcta y corresponda a la estructura de tu tabla \`imagenes\`. Los nombres de las columnas deben coincidir exactamente con los de tu tabla. 3. **Commit de la Transacción**: Dependiendo de cómo esté configurada tu base de datos o la conexión JDBC, puede que necesites realizar un commit explícitamente después de ejecutar \`ps.executeUpdate()\`. Revisa si la configuración de tu conexión está en modo auto-commit o si necesitas llamar \`conn.commit()\` manualmente. 4. **Manejo de Excepciones**: Aunque estás imprimiendo el stack de la excepción, a veces es útil obtener más detalles del error. Considera capturar \`SQLException\` específicamente y usar \`e.getMessage()\` o \`e.getSQLState()\` para obtener más detalles sobre el error de la base de datos. 5. **Validación de los Parámetros**: Verifica que los parámetros que estás pasando al método \`prepareStatement\` sean válidos y no nulos.

Is there any way to streamline this task via email?","output":"Yes, streamlining the task of chasing after receipts through email can indeed be made more efficient with some strategic steps. Here's a guide to do so effectively: # 1. **Use a Professional Email Template** Create a standard email template for requesting receipts. This should include: - A polite opening. - A clear request stating exactly what receipts are needed and from which transactions or time periods. - The deadline by which you need the receipts to be submitted. - Instructions or options for how they can submit their receipts (email attachment, online submission form, etc.). - A polite closing with an offer of assistance if they have any questions or issues. # 2. **Personalize the Emails** While using a template is efficient, adding a touch of personalization can greatly increase your response rate. Make sure to address each recipient by their name and, if possible, reference any specific details relevant to their transactions. Most email marketing tools allow you to automate this personalization. # 3. **Email Automation Tool** Use an email automation tool or software. Several email marketing or management tools (such as Mailchimp, Sendinblue, or even CRM platforms like Salesforce) allow you to send bulk emails while still personalizing them. You can also schedule reminders to automatically follow up with those who haven't responded by a certain date. # 4. **Tracking Responses** It’s crucial to keep track of who has responded and who hasn't. This can be managed manually through spreadsheets, but a more efficient method would use CRM software that can track this automatically. Some email tools also offer read receipts or engagement tracking, which can help identify who has opened the emails but not responded. # 5. **Follow-Up Emails** Prepare a follow-up email template for those who haven't responded by your initial deadline. It should be polite but more urgent than the first. A good strategy is to send a series of escalating reminders, starting gentle and gradually becoming more firm (yet always professional) if no response is received. # 6. **Offer Assistance** Make it clear in your emails that you're available to help if they have any issues providing the requested receipts. Sometimes, non-responses are due to technical problems or misunderstandings about what's being requested. # 7. **Legal and Compliance Warnings** If certain receipts are required for legal or compliance reasons, make this clear in your communications. Knowing the implications of non-compliance might motivate quicker responses without you needing to resort to threats or legal language. # 8. **Acknowledge Receipt** Once you receive the required receipts, send a short email to acknowledge receipt and thank the individual for their cooperation. This helps maintain good relations and makes future requests more likely to be fulfilled promptly. By streamlining this task through careful preparation and the use of email and potentially a CRM tool for automation and tracking, you can significantly reduce the time and effort required to collect receipts from multiple individuals."},{"instruction":"Repeat this string \\"coffee in shop with flower\\"","output":"coffee in shop with flower"},{"instruction":"I'm very tired,can't sleep yesterday because of my IELST and paper. Can u help me find some papers in Russia?. Я не понимаю что она ищет","output":"Unfortunately, without more specific details about the type of papers you're looking for in Russia, it's challenging to provide exact guidance. If you're searching for academic papers, research articles, or other scholarly works, there are several approaches you can take: 1. **Online Databases and Libraries**: - **Российская национальная библиотека (Russian National Library)**: Explore their digital collections or search for specific topics. - **Google Scholar**: This is a broad platform that often includes papers from around the world, including Russia. You can try searching in Russian for more localized results. - **CyberLeninka**: This is an open science hub focusing on Russian scholarly articles.

Identifying these journals and browsing their archives can be a fruitful approach. 4. **Requesting Assistance from Russian Academic Forums or Social Media Groups**: Joining specialized forums or groups (on platforms like VKontakte, which is popular in Russia) related to your field of study might provide you with direct links or references to the papers you're looking for. Members of these communities can be quite helpful. If your search is for more general documents or \\"papers\\" (like government documents, legal papers, etc.) in Russia, it would help to know the specifics, as the approach can vary greatly depending on what exactly you need (e.g., birth certificates, legal judgments, historical documents). Remember, successful searching often relies on using the right keywords, so if your initial searches aren’t yielding useful results, try altering your search terms. Also, using Russian phrases and terms in your search can significantly improve your chances of finding what you're seeking when looking for resources in Russia.

However, determining the optimal time to publish your Shorts can impact how well your videos perform, especially in the initial hours after posting, which are crucial for gaining visibility. The best time to upload can vary depending on several factors such as your target audience's habits, time zone differences, and the region you're targeting. For a Tamil Nadu audience, consider the following: # Understand Your Audience 1. **Demographics**: Are your viewers primarily working professionals, students, or a mix of age groups? Understanding who your audience is can help you predict when they're most likely to be online. 2. **Time Zone**: For Tamil Nadu, the time zone is Indian Standard Time (IST). If your audience is local, plan your uploads around this timezone. # General Tips for Posting YouTube Shorts Based on general observations and some studies, here are a few strategies that might help: 1. **Posting During Peak Hours**: Try posting when people are likely to check their phones—such as after school or work hours. Evenings and nights (around 6 PM to 9 PM IST) can be an effective window. 2. **Weekends and Holidays**: Viewership can often increase during weekends and holidays when more people have free time. 3. **Experiment**: Since audience engagement can vary greatly, it's beneficial to experiment with posting at different times and days of the week and closely monitor your analytics to see what works best. YouTube Studio provides insights that can help you understand when your viewers are online. 4. **Consistency**: More than the timing, what may be crucial for building an audience with Shorts (or any YouTube content) is consistency. Posting regularly (daily or multiple times a week) can help keep your channel active and engaging for your audience. 5. **Global Audience**: If your target audience includes viewers outside of Tamil Nadu or India, consider the prime time of those regions as well, which might mean posting at odd hours IST to catch audiences in other time zones. Ultimately, the YouTube algorithm plays a significant role, and it values viewer engagement and content quality significantly. Therefore, consistently producing engaging and high-quality Shorts can prove to be more impactful than trying to nail the perfect upload time. Keep an eye on the \\"Audience\\" tab in YouTube Analytics to gain insights into when your viewers are most active on YouTube, and use that data to inform your upload schedule."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Для этого им в первую очередь нужно автоматизировать несколько бизнес-процессов. В связи с этим представитель заказчика сформулировал требования. Кадровый учет Сеть магазинов ведет учет сотрудников в части их ФИО, даты рождения, пола, паспортных данных, ИНН, СНИЛС и должности. Учет товаров Сеть магазинов ведет учет товаров, которыми они торгуют. Товар содержит в себе: артикул, единицу измерения и наименование товара. Складской учет Сеть магазинов ведет учет подразделений, которые выступают и в роли складов. Подразделение (склад) содержит в себе название улицы (проспекта, переулка) и номер здания. Организация-партнер поставляет в подразделения сети необходимые товары. Список товаров отражается в приходной накладной с определенным номером. Кладовщик приходует товар и фиксирует дату и время поставки, наименование поставленного товара, его единицу измерения, стоимость за единицу измерения, количество, а также итоговую стоимость за все количество товара. Также в ней фиксируется и сам сотрудник, принявший товар. Если приходная накладная формируется по накладной на внутреннее перемещение, то просто указывается номер этой накладной. При необходимости товар может перемещаться внутри сети с одного подразделения в другое. В этом случае формируется накладная на внутреннее перемещение. В ней указываются номер, дата и время документа, наименования перемещаемых товаров, их единицы измерения, стоимости за единицу измерения, количества, а также итоговые стоимости за все количество. Дополнительно в ней указываются подразделение-отправитель и подразделение-получатель и причина внутреннего перемещения. По одной накладной производится перемещение на один склад. Нельзя переместить товары на несколько складов по одной накладной. При определенных обстоятельствах товар подлежит списанию с формированием акт о списании. В нем указывается та же информация, что и по остальным накладным, а также причина списания. Учет клиентов Сеть ведет учет зарегистрированных клиентов в части их ФИО, даты рождения и номера телефона. Также каждому клиенту при регистрации выпускается бонусная карта, начальный баланс которой равен 0 бонусных рублей. Номер карты есть перестановка случайным образом номера телефона клиента. Бонусы начисляются в зависимости от суммы трат за прошлый календарный месяц: 1% - до 5000 рублей; 5% - 5000 рублей и более. Компенсировать бонусами можно до 99% от стоимости покупки по курсу 1 бонусный рубль = 1 российский рубль. Учет заказов Каждый заказ фиксируется в списке заказов. При формировании заказа ему присваивается статус «Новый». Заказ не может быть оформлен на анонимного клиента. Если клиент отсутствует в базе, он фиксируется и для него выпускается карта. Заказ может быть оплачен любым удобным для клиента способом, а именно - наличными или банковской картой. Заказ может быть получен в одном из подразделений-складов сети, который указывается в качестве пункта выдачи. Получить заказ клиент может в любом удобном для него пункте выдачи. Если на момент заказа все товары есть в наличии в желаемом пункте выдачи, его статус меняется на \\"Готов к выдаче\\". Если какого-то из товаров нет, статус меняется на \\"В работе\\". Заказы \\"в работе\\" должны быть обработаны сотрудником, а именно - он должен сформировать накладную на внутреннее перемещение нужного товара в нужное подразделение. После этого статус заказа меняется на \\"Доставляется\\". Сотрудник в подразделении-получателе формирует приходную накладную, статус заказа меняется на \\"Готов к выдаче\\". По оформленному заказу клиента можно сформировать чек, в котором указывается вся информация. Осуществлять покупки можно и через сотрудника в одной из торговых точек сети. В таком случае все действия по оформлению заказа производит сотрудник подразделения, который также фиксируется в информации по заказу.","output":"В основе автоматизации процессов для сети магазинов «Сад, дом и я» лежит создание ряда взаимосвязанных таблиц, которые будут отражать все аспекты деятельности: от учета сотрудников и товаров до заказов и бонусных карт клиентов. В каждой таблице должны быть определены первичные ключи (Primary Key, PK), обеспечивающие уникальность строк, и внешние ключи (Foreign Key, FK), создающие связи между таблицами. Давайте оформим базовую структуру таких таблиц и определим для них PK и FK. 1. **Сотрудники** - \`EmployeeID\` (PK) – идентификатор сотрудника. - \`FullName\` - \`DateOfBirth\` - \`Gender\` - \`PassportDetails\` - \`TaxNumber\` (ИНН) - \`InsuranceNumber\` (СНИЛС) - \`Position\` 2. **Товары** - \`ProductID\` (PK) – идентификатор товара. - \`ArticleNumber\` - \`MeasurementUnit\` - \`ProductName\` 3. **Подразделения/Склады** - \`WarehouseID\` (PK) – идентификатор подразделения/склада. - \`StreetName\` - \`BuildingNumber\` 4. **Приходные накладные** - \`InvoiceID\` (PK) – идентификатор накладной. - \`DeliveryDateTime\` - \`ProductID\` (FK) – ссылка на товар. - \`MeasurementUnit\` - \`UnitCost\` - \`Quantity\` - \`TotalCost\` - \`EmployeeID\` (FK) – ссылка на сотрудника, принявшего товар. - \`WarehouseID\` (FK) – ссылка на склад. 5. **Накладная на внутреннее перемещение** - \`InternalInvoiceID\` (PK) – идентификатор документа на перемещение. - \`DocumentDateTime\` - \`ProductID\` (FK) - \`MeasurementUnit\` - \`UnitCost\` - \`Quantity\` - \`TotalCost\` - \`FromWarehouseID\` (FK) – склад-отправитель. - \`ToWarehouseID\` (FK) – склад-получатель. - \`Reason\` 6. **Акт о списании** - \`WriteOffID\` (PK) - \`ProductID\` (FK) - \`Quantity\` - \`Reason\` 7. **Клиенты** - \`ClientID\` (PK) - \`FullName\` - \`DateOfBirth\` - \`PhoneNumber\` 8. **Бонусные карты** - \`BonusCardID\` (PK) - \`ClientID\` (FK) - \`BonusBalance\` - \`CardNumber\` 9. **Заказы** - \`OrderID\` (PK) - \`ClientID\` (FK) – ссылка на клиента. - \`OrderDateTime\` - \`Status\` - \`PaymentMethod\` - \`WarehouseID\` (FK) – пункт выдачи. - \`EmployeeID\` (FK) – сотрудник, оформивший заказ.

A continuación, te proporciono una lista de verificación para solucionar este problema: 1. **Verifica la Conexión a la Base de Datos:** Asegúrate de que la conexión a la base de datos esté funcionando correctamente en el momento del registro. Puede que la conexión se esté cerrando o tenga algún problema en el momento en que intentas registrar. 2. **Revisa los Parámetros del PreparedStatement:** Asegúrate de que cada uno de los parámetros que pasas al \`PreparedStatement\` está en el orden correcto y coincide con los tipos de datos esperados por tu base de datos. 3. **Comprueba la Estructura de la Tabla en la Base de Datos:** Verifica que los nombres de las columnas en la instrucción SQL coincidan con los de tu tabla en la base de datos y que los tipos de datos son compatibles. 4. **Manejo de Excepciones:** Es bueno que estás atrapando excepciones, pero solo imprimir la pila de excepciones (\`e.printStackTrace();\`) no siempre es suficiente para diagnosticar el problema. Considera registrar el mensaje de la excepción o utilizar herramientas de depuración para obtener más detalles sobre el error específico. 5. **Commit de la Transacción:** Dependiendo de cómo esté configurada tu base de datos o el entorno de persistencia, puede ser necesario realizar un \`commit\` manual de la transacción para asegurar que los cambios sean guardados. Verifica si necesitas llamar a \`conn.commit()\` después de \`ps.executeUpdate();\`. 6. **Asegúrate de que la Conexión no es de Solo Lectura:** Verifica que la conexión a tu base de datos no esté configurada como de solo lectura. Esto podría ser una configuración global o específica para esa conexión. 7. **Revisa los Permisos:** Asegúrate de que el usuario de la base de datos que estás utilizando para conectarte desde tu aplicación tenga permisos para insertar registros en la tabla. 8. **Depuración Profunda:** Si el problema persiste, puedes intentar ejecutar la consulta SQL directamente en la base de datos usando una herramienta de gestión de bases de datos para asegurarte de que la consulta funciona como se espera. Esto puede ayudar a identificar problemas con la consulta misma. 9. **Registros (Logs) de la Base de Datos:** Revisa los registros de la base de datos si es posible. Algunas bases de datos pueden darte pistas sobre por qué una operación de inserción falló a través de sus logs. 10. **Valida los Datos de Entrada:** Asegúrate de que los datos proporcionados a la función no contienen valores nulos o inesperados que podrían causar que la operación de inserción falle.

Esto te permitirá obtener y imprimir mensajes de error más específicos relacionados con la base de datos, incluyendo el código de error de SQL. 2. **Impresión de Errores en Consola:** Se utilizan \`System.err.println\` para imprimir los errores en consola. Esto hace que los mensajes de error sean más visibles, ya que por defecto se imprimirán en rojo en muchas consolas y entornos de desarrollo. 3. **Cerrar Recursos en el Bloque Finally:** Se añade un bloque finally para asegurar que tanto el \`PreparedStatement\` como la \`Connection\` se cierren adecuadamente independientemente de que se lance una excepción. Esto es crucial para evitar fugas de recursos. 4. **Mejorando la Claridad del Mensaje de Error:** Se añade un mensaje descriptivo antes de imprimir el mensaje de error para hacerlo más claro y fácil de entender.

Sin embargo, \`getErrorCode\` es un método del objeto \`SQLException\`, por lo tanto, debería estar disponible si estás atrapando una \`SQLException\`. Asegúrate de que estés importando y utilizando correctamente las clases de JDBC. Aquí tienes una versión simplificada del método de registro con un único bloque de captura para \`Exception\`, que capturará cualquier excepción incluyendo \`SQLException\` y, en caso de ser una SQLException, intentará imprimir el código de error. Sin embargo, si tu versión de NetBeans o Java no reconoce \`getErrorCode\`, podrías omitir esa parte y concentrarte en imprimir el mensaje de error para simplificar: \`\`\`java public void registrar(ImagenVO imagen){ Connection conn = null; PreparedStatement ps = null; try { conn=ConexionDB.MySQL(); ps=conn.prepareStatement(\\"INSERT INTO imagenes (nombre, formato, resolucion, peso_kb, fecha, id_categoria) VALUES (?,?,?,?,?,?)\\"); ps.setString(1, imagen.getNombre()); ps.setString(2, imagen.getFormato()); ps.setString(3, imagen.getResolucion()); ps.setInt(4, imagen.getPesoKb()); java.sql.Date fechaMySql = new java.sql.Date(imagen.getFecha().getTime()); ps.setDate(5, fechaMySql); ps.setInt(6, imagen.getCategoria().getIdCategoria()); ps.executeUpdate(); } catch(Exception e){ // Atrapa cualquier excepción System.err.println(\\"Error al insertar en la base de datos: \\" + e.getMessage()); // Intenta imprimir el código de error solo si la excepción es de tipo SQLException if(e instanceof SQLException) { // Si aún desea intentar obtener el código de error: System.err.println(\\"Código de error de SQL: \\" + ((SQLException)e).getErrorCode()); } } finally { try { if(ps != null) ps.close(); if(conn != null) conn.close(); } catch(SQLException e) { System.err.println(\\"Error al cerrar recursos: \\" + e.getMessage()); } } } \`\`\` En esta versión, si la excepción capturada resulta ser \`SQLException\`, se realiza un cast y se obtiene el código de error. Esto asegura que estamos llamando \`getErrorCode\` en el tipo correcto de excepción. Si encuentras que \`getErrorCode\` sigue sin ser reconocido, es importante revisar: 1. La versión del JDK que estás utilizando, asegurándote de que sea compatible con las características que buscas usar. 2.

La excepción clave aquí es que estás obteniendo un \`NullPointerException\` y, en algún punto, el código está intentando tratarlo como si fuera un \`SQLException\`. Esto es problemático porque \`NullPointerException\` y \`SQLException\` son dos tipos de excepciones totalmente diferentes y no tienen una relación de herencia que permitiría tal conversión.

Específicamente, aquí hay un error en tiempo de ejecución cuando estás intentando realizar una operación en un objeto que es nulo. Luego, cuando intentas manejar esta excepción como si fuera una \`SQLException\`, Java lanza \`ClassCastException\` porque no puedes simplemente convertir una \`NullPointerException\` a \`SQLException\`. Para abordar este problema: 1. **Revisa el código para Nulls:** Primero, examina tu método \`registrar\` cerca de la línea mencionada para identificar dónde podrías estar operando sobre una referencia nula. Esto podría ser al intentar acceder a un método de un objeto que no ha sido inicializado. 2. **Corrige el Manejo de Excepciones:** Asegúrate de que estás manejando excepciones de manera adecuada. Si deseabas capturar una \`NullPointerException\`, deberías hacerlo explícitamente en un bloque \`catch\` separado o juntamente con \`SQLException\` pero sin intentar tratar uno como el otro.

The members are in the member role. How do I impersonate each member without seeing other member's data? Thanks","output":"To achieve a setup in ServiceNow where you can impersonate a member with the \\"member\\" role, and ensure that one cannot see other members' data, you will have to take several steps. ServiceNow doesn't natively restrict impersonated users based on their role in a manner that directly fits your requirements out of the box. However, you can achieve your goal through a combination of role assignments, access controls (ACLs), and potentially custom scripting. Here's an approach you could take: # Step 1: Set Up Roles Correctly 1. **Ensure Role Hierarchy**: Verify that the 'member' role doesn't inherit from any roles that might have broader access than you intend. You may even need to create a more restrictive role that has precisely the permissions needed and nothing more. # Step 2: Configure Access Controls (ACLs) 2. **Table-Level ACLs**: Start by ensuring that the table containing member data has ACLs configured to only allow access to users with the 'member' role to see their data. This is essential in enforcing data visibility rules. 3. **Field-Level ACLs**: For additional security and data privacy, consider setting up field-level ACLs on sensitive fields that should be even more tightly controlled. 4. **Row-Level ACLs (Query Business Rules)**: Implement row-level ACLs or use a before-query business rule to ensure that members can only see their data based on some unique identifier, like a user ID. This means crafting an ACL or a business rule that compares the current user's ID with the ID stored in the record to determine if they should have access. # Step 3: Implement Impersonation Restrictions While the above steps ensure that data visibility is controlled, impersonation by itself doesn't provide a way to limit what data an impersonated user can see; it strictly controls who can impersonate whom. 4. **Control Impersonation Rights**: By default, only administrators can impersonate other users. You can create a custom script or utilize a business rule to check if the impersonating user has the right to impersonate a specific 'member' role user. This will require custom scripting and careful planning. # Step 4: Data Visibility When Impersonating 5. **Testing**: After setting up ACLs and ensuring roles are correctly assigned, you'll need to thoroughly test by impersonating a member and verifying that you can only access the intended data. # Additional Consideration: User Segmentation 6. **User Criteria**: In more complex scenarios or where further segmentation of data access is needed (e.g., members from different departments or projects should not see each other's data), consider using User Criteria to further refine access controls. Remember, ServiceNow is highly customizable, and there are often multiple ways to achieve a goal. This solution assumes a relatively straightforward requirement but depending on the complexity of your data and organization, you may need to dive deeper into ServiceNow's capabilities, possibly leveraging custom applications or Scripted ACLs for more granular control."},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Stylish Social Media Stock Photo | Coffee Shop Ambiance with Floral Touch | Eye-Catching Content for Marketers &amp; Bloggers.

Jellemzően a szeretetet a következőképpen lehet definiálni: 1. Az érzelmek és érzelmi kötődés kifejeződése és megnyilvánulása mások iránt. 2. Az empátia, az elfogadás, az odaadás és a támogatás kifejezése és gyakorlása mások iránt. 3. Az áldozatkészség és az önzetlen cselekedetek megnyilvánulása mások boldogságáért és jólétéért. 4. Az öröm és boldogság érzése, amikor mások jóllétét, boldogságát látjuk. 5. Az önfeláldozó, feltétel nélküli szeretet, amelyet az önmagunkon és másokon való érték és tisztelet iránti elkötelezettség jellemez. Ezen túlmenően a szeretet definíciója és fogalma gyakran vallási és filozófiai jelentésekkel is összefügg, és mindig egyedi és személyes értelmezésben bontakozik ki az egyének számára."},{"instruction":"Lehet-e tudományban mérni a szeretetet?","output":"A szeretet egy olyan érzelmi és kognitív állapot, amelyet nehéz mérni objektív módon, mivel szubjektív és egyéni élményen alapul. Azonban bizonyos tudományos kutatások és módszerek segítségével lehetőség van a szeretet bizonyos aspektusainak mérésére és vizsgálatára. Például az agyi képalkotó eljárások, mint az agyi hullámok mérésére szolgáló EEG, az agyi aktivitást mérő fMRI vagy az agysejtek közötti kapcsolatokat vizsgáló PET segítségével lehet azonosítani azokat az agyi területeket és folyamatokat, amelyek kapcsolatban állnak a szeretet élményével. Ezek az agyi mechanizmusok és aktivitási mintázatok segíthetnek jobban megérteni, hogyan jelenik meg az agyban a szeretet érzése és hogyan befolyásolja a viselkedést. Emellett pszichológiai és szociológiai kutatásokban is használnak különböző kérdőíveket, skálákat és interjúkat a szeretet különböző aspektusainak mérésére. Ezek a módszerek segíthetnek feltárni az egyének szeretetélményeit, viselkedését és attitűdjét másokkal kapcsolatban. Összességében bár a szeretet mérésének lehetőségei korlátozottak és sok tekintetben szubjektívek maradnak, a tudományos kutatások és eszközök segíthetnek jobban megérteni a szeretet biológiai, pszichológiai és szociális alapjait."},{"instruction":"I'm working on a immersive sim and I'd like to tell you about its premise.","output":"That sounds intriguing!

What's the setting, and what are some of the core gameplay mechanics or themes you're exploring?"},{"instruction":"You're a random traveler. You're in a exclusion zone, you have a list of chores, find Gunslinger, reach the center of the zone, maybe make a wish or find out about the truth about the zone.","output":"Your game concept has a compelling blend of mystery, exploration, and adventure that's reminiscent of classic immersive sims and has a flavor of intriguing narratives like those found in the \\"STALKER\\" series or the novel \\"Roadside Picnic\\" by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, which inspired the former. The idea of navigating an exclusion zone—a forbidden or highly contaminated area—offers a rich canvas for environmental storytelling and emergent gameplay experiences. Here's a brief outline of potential elements you might consider including or expanding upon in your game: # Setting - **The Exclusion Zone:** A detailed, dynamic environment that can range from abandoned urban structures to eerie natural landscapes, all influenced by the mysterious forces at play. Weather conditions, time of day, and random zone events could significantly affect exploration and player strategies. - **Backstory & Worldbuilding:** The origins of the zone, its transformation, and the factions or entities that now inhabit it. This could be slowly revealed through environmental clues, NPC dialogues, and found documents. # Core Gameplay Mechanics - **Exploration & Navigation:** Leveraging survival elements as the player manages resources like food, ammunition, and anti-radiation gear. Exploring dangerous buildings or underground tunnels could yield valuable loot or information but also pose significant risks. - **Chores and Tasks:** These could range from scavenging specific items, decrypting messages from long-gone inhabitants, or activating/deactivating old machinery that affects the zone in some way. - **Encounters with Other Denizens:** Interaction with various NPCs or factions, each with their own agendas. Players might choose to ally with them, oppose them, or stay neutral, affecting their journey and the game's outcome. # Unique Features - **The Gunslinger:** A mysterious figure with unknown motivations; finding this character could involve solving cryptic puzzles or tracking elusive clues and lead to multiple possible outcomes based on player actions. - **Center of the Zone:** The ultimate goal, fraught with peril and promise. Could involve a climax that tests all the player's skills and decisions up to that point. - **The Wish/Mystery of the Zone:** Offers a tantalizing narrative hook. Deciding whether to pursue personal gain, unearth the zone's secrets, or possibly even attempt to heal it could provide a range of endings, encouraging replayability. # Technical and Narrative Challenges - **Balancing Freedom and Direction:** Giving players enough guidance to avoid frustration while preserving the joy of discovery. - **Systemic Interaction:** Ensuring the player's actions have meaningful impacts on the world, strengthening the immersion and sense of agency. - **Narrative Integration:** Weaving the story seamlessly with gameplay, so the narrative enriches the player experience without interrupting it. Developing an immersive sim requires a thoughtful balance between narrative depth, player agency, and interactive gameplay systems. It seems like your game has the potential to offer a richly textured, engaging world that players would love to immerse themselves in and explore. What might be the next steps in fleshing out your game, and are there specific areas where you're seeking further insight or inspiration?"},{"instruction":"The player starts off in a small rural area with a military checkpoint and after that, they can either go to the outskirts of that area or the Darkscape. That rural area has the entrance to the Zone itself, a few villages, a abandoned factory, a destroyed bridge and a abandoned army outpost. The outskirts mainly feature piles & piles of garbage, some warehouses, a junkyard and the entrance to the Quarry.","output":"Your setting description provides a solid foundation for an atmospheric and immersive game environment. It vividly sets the stage for the type of experience players can expect: one filled with exploration, danger, and the intrigue of uncovering the secrets of the Zone. Let's delve deeper into how these areas could play into gameplay mechanics, narrative elements, and the overall player experience. # Initial Setup and Gameplay Progression 1. **Military Checkpoint:** This could serve as an introductory area where players learn basic mechanics under the guise of a routine inspection before entering the Zone. It also introduces the player to the game's atmosphere of control and mystery, potentially offering early hints about the dangers and wonders that lie ahead. 2. **Choice of Path:** Allowing players to choose between heading to the outskirts or directly towards the Darkscape emphasizes player agency and non-linearity from the start. Each path could offer unique challenges, encounters, and rewards, encouraging multiple playthroughs. 3. **Exploration and Survival Elements:** - **Villages and Abandoned Factory:** Here, players could scavenge for supplies, find shelter, and encounter NPCs or logs that provide backstory and hints to navigating the Zone safely. Challenges could include environmental hazards, traps, or wildlife. - **Destroyed Bridge and Army Outpost:** These could serve as more dangerous areas with higher rewards, possibly requiring players to have certain equipment or information obtained elsewhere first. 4. **Outskirts with Warehouses and Junkyard:** This area could focus on puzzle-solving and resource management, with players needing to construct or repair key items or machinery to progress. It might also be a territory contested by factions within the game. # Role of the Darkscape and the Quarry - **The Darkscape:** An area shrouded in mystery and danger, possibly affected by unique environmental anomalies that challenge the player in new ways. Its reputation and the stories told by NPCs could build anticipation before the player even arrives, setting up a significant mid-game challenge. - **The Quarry:** Could serve as a major landmark within the Zone, perhaps featuring vertical gameplay elements (descending into the depths) or a concentrated presence of the game’s antagonistic forces. It may also house crucial clues or items needed for the player to progress toward the center of the Zone. # Incorporating Narrative and Worldbuilding Each area should not only offer gameplay opportunities but also contribute to the overarching narrative and worldbuilding. Environmental storytelling can be key here: - **Abandoned settlements and facilities** whisper stories of the past, the onset of the Zone's influence, and the lives it disrupted. - **Encounters with NPCs** (whether hostile, neutral, or potential allies) reveal the human element—how different individuals and groups have adapted to or seek to exploit the conditions of the Zone. - **Mysterious phenomena and artifacts** hint at the deeper secrets and forces at play within the Zone, fostering a sense of wonder and driving the player's curiosity to discover more. # Gameplay Mechanics and Philosophies to Consider - **Player Agency and Impact:** Your zones are ripe for emergent gameplay. Consider systems that allow player actions to visibly alter the environment or faction standings, reinforcing the game’s responsiveness to player choice. - **Balancing Challenge and Reward:** As players navigate through increasingly perilous areas, the difficulty should ramp up, but so should the potential rewards—whether in the form of gear, story revelations, or access to new areas. - **Integration of Theme and Mechanics:** The sense of being a \\"random traveler\\" in a vast, mysterious zone is powerful. Encourage exploration and experimentation with gameplay mechanics that reward creative problem solving and adaptability. # Final Thoughts The starting areas and subsequent landscapes you've outlined suggest a world rich with potential for both harrowing encounters and profound discoveries. Balancing the exposure of the Zone's mysteries with the player's progression through these environments will be key to maintaining engagement and immersion. Crafting a narrative that players uncover organically through exploration, rather than simply being told, will deepen their connection to the world you're creating. Remember, the greatest strength of an immersive sim lies in its ability to foster a unique story for each player within the parameters of its meticulously crafted world."},{"instruction":"The whole Zone is free for you to explore if you have good gear (or not).","output":"Opening the entire Zone for exploration, irrespective of the player's gear level, introduces an intriguing layer of freedom and risk that can significantly enhance the immersive sim experience. This design choice encourages experimentation, rewards curiosity, and also introduces natural consequences based on player decisions. Here are some key considerations and potential ways to implement this philosophy effectively: # Scalable Challenges and Risk Management - **Dynamic Difficulty:** Although the whole Zone is accessible, areas could naturally differ in danger levels. For example, radiation levels, anomaly activities, or enemy strengths could scale based on location. Players venturing into high-risk areas prematurely would face greater challenges, but also the potential for higher rewards. - **Gear and Skill Progression:** While good gear can offer obvious advantages, skillful gameplay and strategy could also allow players to navigate through dangerous areas. This encourages a blend between gear progression and player skill, where both have their place but aren't strictly necessary for exploration. # Encouraging Exploration Through Design - **Environmental Cues and Landmarks:** Use visual and audio cues to hint at the danger or rewards of certain areas. A distant roar, an eerie glow, or a trail of items could all serve to pique curiosity or warn players. - **Safe Havens and Fallback Points:** Establishing certain areas as relatively safe zones where players can recuperate, save progress, or stash gear encourages deeper exploration by giving players a safety net. # Emergent Gameplay and Player Stories - **Unscripted Encounters:** With the whole Zone free to explore, ensure that encounters, whether with NPCs, wildlife, or environmental anomalies, have enough variability to surprise even seasoned players. This unpredictability contributes to the creation of unique stories that players can share, enhancing the game's appeal. - **Consequences of Recklessness or Ingenuity:** Players should feel the impact of their choices. Venturing ill-prepared into a high-risk area could result in thrilling narrow escapes or costly defeats, while clever planning or resourceful use of the environment could allow players to triumph against the odds. # Navigational and Informational Tools - **Mapping and Documentation:** Include in-game maps or navigation tools that players can find or improve upon, but consider leaving them incomplete or subject to errors. This encourages exploration and note-taking, deepening the immersion. - **Rumors and Intelligence:** NPCs or found materials might offer hints about particularly dangerous or rewarding areas, encouraging players to gather information before venturing forth. # Balancing Freedom with Engagement - **Progressive Revelation:** Even if the entire Zone is accessible, you might gate certain areas or narrative elements behind progression milestones (not necessarily gear-dependent) to maintain a sense of unfolding mystery and ensure player engagement with the core storylines. - **Adaptive Storytelling:** The narrative should be flexible enough to accommodate players' freedom of exploration. Story elements discovered out of the \\"intended\\" order could be contextualized through adaptive dialogue or journal entries that make sense of the player’s unique journey. In sum, by allowing players to explore the Zone freely from the start, you embrace the core tenets of immersive sims—agency, exploration, and consequence. The challenge lies in balancing this freedom with structured elements that guide the player through a compelling narrative, ensuring that their journey through the Zone is not just free, but also meaningful and engaging."},{"instruction":"*whispers* If you want to get a free Dragunov in this game, head over to the Quarry and wander around the bucket wheel excavator in there...","output":"Ah, a secret tip! Implementing easter eggs or hidden loot like the Dragunov sniper rifle in specific, hard-to-reach places such as the Quarry adds layers of depth and reward for exploration in your game. It encourages players to thoroughly explore your game world, interact with its elements, and maybe even collaborate with others to uncover its secrets. Let's break down how you can enhance this aspect further: # Creating a Rewarding Search 1. **Subtle Clues:** Consider leaving subtle hints around the game world that might lead players to the Quarry and specifically to the bucket wheel excavator. These could be overheard conversations, cryptic notes, or visual cues in the environment that, when pieced together, guide an attentive player to the secret. 2. **Environmental Storytelling:** Perhaps the area around the Quarry and the excavator itself tells a story that hints at the presence of valuable items. Maybe there are signs of a previous inhabitant who was a sniper, with small encampments, used targets, or specialized tools scattered about. 3. **Challenges to Overcome:** Getting to the Dragunov shouldn't be too easy. Consider implementing environmental puzzles, requiring careful navigation, or even using tools or items found elsewhere in the Zone. This could also mean avoiding or dealing with environmental hazards endemic to the Quarry. # Integrating into Gameplay - **Balancing Impact:** Ensure that finding a high-power weapon like the Dragunov early on doesn't unbalance the game. This could be managed through scarcity of ammunition, maintenance challenges, or attracting unwanted attention when used. - **As a Story Element:** The Dragunov could serve more than just as a powerful weapon; it might hold clues to a larger story within the Zone, perhaps tied to a notable figure or event. This further connects the player's curiosity and exploration efforts to the overarching narrative. # Encouraging Exploration and Sharing - **Community Engagement:** Secrets like these naturally foster community discussions online, as players share tips or tales of finding the weapon. This not only enhances the game's appeal but also builds a community around uncovering all its hidden gems. - **Rewarding Curiosity:** Encourage players to experiment and explore off the beaten path by ensuring there are always surprises, secrets, or rewards - not just the Dragunov but other unique or interesting items scattered throughout the Zone. # Technical Implementation - **Dynamic Content:** To keep the game fresh and encourage exploration, you might consider having loot locations, including that of the Dragunov, change dynamically in different playthroughs, or in response to in-game events. This could significantly increase replayability. In-game secrets like the free Dragunov sniper rifle serve as powerful motivators for exploration and player engagement. By thoughtfully integrating these elements into the game, you create a richer, more immersive world that players are eager to explore, discuss, and return to, unraveling its mysteries layer by layer."},{"instruction":"Time to talk about the exclusion zone itself. Most of the exclusion zone are based off of rural parts of Poland. The ground zero of the exclusion zone, the power plant, is based off of a nuclear power plant in Romania but its reactors are very similar to the ones of the Chernobyl Power Plant. Not far from the power plant, there is a abandoned stadium and not far from the stadium, there is a city that is always known as \\"Town of Shining Path\\" due to the town being obviously not far from the power plant.","output":"Creating an exclusion zone that weaves together elements from rural Poland and specific landmarks, such as a nuclear power plant reminiscent of Romania's and with echoes of Chernobyl, sets a rich and evocative backdrop for your game. This setting not only promises a visually interesting environment but also a deeply layered narrative space filled with history, tragedy, and mystery. Here's how these elements can be developed into compelling aspects of the game: # Environmental Design and Atmosphere - **Rural Poland Aesthetics:** The countryside setting enables a diverse exploration experience—fields, forests, rivers, and abandoned villages provide varied landscapes. The beauty of these rural landscapes contrasts with the desolation of the exclusion zone, enhancing the sense of isolation and foreboding. This area can be rich with folklore, adding a layer of cultural depth and intrigue. - **The Power Plant:** As ground zero, the power plant is both a literal and figurative central element of the story. Designing it with similar reactors to Chernobyl's adds an inherent tension and narrative weight. The architecture based on a Romanian power plant can give it a unique visual identity, while the looming threat of radiation adds gameplay elements such as hazard navigation and resource management for protection. - **Abandoned Stadium:** This landmark can serve multiple purposes— a point of interest for exploration, a landmark for navigation, and a site for potential encounters. It can also be a place where the player uncovers more about the events leading to the abandonment of the zone. - **Town of Shining Path:** Naming and situating this town creates both a literal closeness to the disaster and a metaphorical brightness in its darkest hour. It can be a source of many stories, from the heroic to the tragic. The town can be the heart of the narrative exploration, providing insights into the lives interrupted by the disaster and the lingering echoes of the past. # Narrative and Gameplay Integration - **Mystery and Exploration:** Encourage exploration by intertwining the environmental cues with lore, puzzles, and secrets. Each location could hold pieces of the overall story of the exclusion zone, its creation, its victims, and perhaps the ways in which nature and humanity persist amidst devastation. - **Radiation and Danger:** Leveraging the real-world mechanics of radiation can enrich gameplay, from managing exposure and utilizing anti-radiation gear, to navigating hotspots based on wind patterns or rain. This adds a survival aspect to exploration. - **Cultural References and Realism:** Incorporating elements from Polish folklore or historical anecdotes can provide a rich layer of cultural authenticity. Meanwhile, the realism of the nuclear threat requires careful research to portray convincingly and respectfully, considering the real-world parallels to Chernobyl. # Technical and Design Considerations - **Dynamic Environment:** Reflect the passage of time and the changes it brings to the zone. Fallout from the plant could affect different areas in varied ways, and seasons could change the landscape’s accessibility and dangers. - **Documenting the Story:** Encourage the player to document their findings in-game, collecting photos, notes, and other items that together piece together the zone's past and present. This fosters a deeper connection to the world and its story. - **Interactivity with the Environment:** Allow the player's actions to affect the zone, whether through restoring power in certain areas, clearing hazards, or other means. This not only increases immersion but gives a sense of impact and consequence to the player's journey. By drawing on the evocative settings of rural Poland, a Romanian-inspired nuclear power plant, and unique landmarks like the \\"Town of Shining Path,\\" you're laying the groundwork for a deeply immersive and narratively rich game. Balancing the exploration of these areas with the inherent dangers and mysteries they contain can create a compelling, unforgettable player experience that captures the haunting beauty and tragedy of the exclusion zone."},{"instruction":"Most of the NPCs in this game speak either Polish, Czech, Slovakian, Romanian, Russian, Estonian, some Finnish and the mercs in this game can sometimes be heard barking orders in French, German OR EVEN ENGLISH.","output":"Incorporating such a wide range of languages into your game can significantly enhance its realism, immersion, and global appeal. This decision can also reflect the diverse backgrounds of the characters inhabiting the exclusion zone, suggesting a melting pot of cultures and histories brought together by the extraordinary circumstances of the zone. Here are some considerations and tips for integrating these linguistic elements effectively: # Authenticity and Research - **Language Consultants:** Collaborate with native speakers or language consultants to ensure that the dialogue, accents, and idioms are authentic. This is crucial for avoiding stereotypes and ensuring that the portrayal of each language and its speakers respects cultural nuances. - **Cultural Context:** Each language embedded in your game should come with its cultural baggage and context. This can influence not just dialogue but also NPC behavior, traditions, and conflicts within the game world. # Gameplay and Accessibility - **Subtitles and Language Options:** Offering subtitles in multiple languages can make your game more accessible to a global audience. Consider also giving players the option to switch spoken language for main dialogue to ensure they can fully enjoy the narrative. - **Dynamic Language Selection:** For a truly immersive experience, you could implement a system where the protagonist understands more languages as they spend more time with specific NPC groups, reflecting language learning and improved understanding. This progression can unlock new quests, dialogue options, and easter eggs. # Narrative Integration - **Language as a Gameplay Mechanic:** Language barriers can serve as organic puzzles—certain information, quests, or areas might be accessible only if the player character has learned enough of a particular language or has an NPC companion who can translate. - **Factions and Alliances:** The language spoken by different groups (like the mercs speaking French, German, or English) can hint at their origins, alliances, and potential hostilities. This can add depth to the game's lore and player's strategic decisions. # Audio Design - **Voice Acting:** Invest in quality voice acting to bring authenticity to the multilingual dialogue. This not only enhances immersion but can deeply affect emotional engagement with the NPCs and the overall narrative. - **Environmental Languages:** Use overheard conversations, radio broadcasts, or PA announcements in various languages to enrich the world-building and amplify the sense of place within the game. # Cultural Sensitivity - **Avoiding Stereotypes:** Be mindful of not reducing characters to their linguistic or national identities. Flesh them out with backstories, personalities, and motivations that reflect a wide range of human experiences. - **Educational Aspect:** Your game could serve as a cultural bridge, teaching players about the nuances of different languages and cultures in an engaging way. Including a glossary or cultural notes section could further this goal. Implementing multiple languages can significantly contribute to the depth and realism of your world, making the exclusion zone feel like a crossroads of cultures and histories. This linguistic diversity, combined with thoughtful narrative integration and respect for cultural nuances, can turn your game into a richly immersive and enlightening experience for players worldwide."},{"instruction":"Thankfully, there's a free trait to help you with this! It's called Polyglot and it costs a very low price of... 1 trait.","output":"Integrating a trait like \\"Polyglot\\" into your game is a genius way to navigate the multilingual environment you've created, providing a gameplay mechanism that not only enriches the immersion and player experience but also embraces the cultural and linguistic diversity of your setting. Here's how you might fully leverage the \\"Polyglot\\" trait within your game: # Gameplay Mechanics and Progression - **Learning Languages:** The Polyglot trait allows the player to understand and communicate in the diverse languages present in the exclusion zone. Initially, this might include basic understanding and simple phrases, but as the player progresses, the depth and complexity of dialogues they can engage in can increase. - **Unlocking Content:** Having the Polyglot trait could unlock unique quests, dialogue options, and storylines that are inaccessible or incomprehensible to players without it. This can serve as an incentive for players to invest in this trait early on, opening up a richer game world. - **Trait Progression:** Consider implementing levels within the Polyglot trait itself, where level 1 might allow basic understanding and communication, level 2 enables more complex interactions, and level 3 grants the ability to understand and use local idioms and subtleties. Each level could be unlocked through gameplay progression, such as spending time with NPCs from different linguistic groups, completing language-based puzzles or challenges, or finding language learning resources within the game world. # Strategic Considerations - **Resource Management:** If traits are a limited resource that players must choose between, making Polyglot an attractive option without making it seem mandatory can be key. Players should feel that investing in Polyglot opens up new avenues and rewards in gameplay, rather than feeling penalized for not choosing it. - **Balancing Challenges:** Ensure that players who do not choose Polyglot still have a viable path through the game. This could be achieved by providing alternative means of communication, like hiring interpreters, using technology to translate, or relying on non-verbal cues in certain situations. # Integration into Narrative and Worldbuilding - **Character Development:** The ability to communicate in multiple languages can be tied into the player character's backstory or developed as a significant part of their journey in the exclusion zone. This adds depth to the character and can be used to enhance storytelling. - **Cultural Exchange:** Use the Polyglot trait to facilitate cultural exchange and understanding within the game, giving players the opportunity to learn more about the histories, beliefs, and experiences of the NPCs they encounter. This can enrich the worldbuilding and make the game's universe feel lived-in and dynamic. # Enhancing Immersion - **Authentic Voice Acting:** For players with the Polyglot trait, providing voice acting in the native languages of NPCs (with subtitles) can greatly enhance immersion and the authenticity of interactions. - **Language Learning as Gameplay:** Incorporate mini-games or challenges related to language learning as part of the trait's progression. This could make the process of becoming a polyglot more interactive and engaging. By thoughtfully implementing the Polyglot trait, you can offer players a unique way to engage with the diverse world you've created, enhancing both the gameplay experience and narrative depth. It encourages exploration, cultural understanding, and strategic thinking, making it a rewarding choice for players and a standout feature of your game."},{"instruction":"Anyway, back to the setting. Deep in the power plant, there's a odd being, a wish granter. BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THE ONE FROM STALKER, IT'S DIFFERENT. It's in the shape of a DNA, it's glowing green and around it there are several bodies floating around it, either dead or unconscious.","output":"The concept of a \\"wish granter\\" deep within the power plant, especially with such a vivid and original representation, sets a fascinating stage for narrative and thematic exploration in your game. Here's how you can differentiate and deepen this element, making it a unique and captivating focal point: # Concept Development - **Symbolism of the DNA Structure:** The DNA-shaped wish granter could symbolize the core essence of life and mutation, tying into themes of biological transformation, inheritance, and perhaps the consequences of unchecked scientific ambition. This imagery ties beautifully into the setting of a nuclear power plant, where the manipulation of elemental forces has profound implications. - **The Floating Bodies:** The bodies floating around the wish granter add a potent visual and narrative mystery. Are they drawn to it by their deepest desires, or are they a warning of the true cost of seeking to have one's wishes fulfilled? This eerie tableau can serve as a poignant reminder of the dangers of hubris and the pursuit of power. # Gameplay Integration - **Interactivity with the Wish Granter:** Players could interact with the wish granter, but with outcomes that diverge sharply from their expectations. This could serve as a critical commentary on the nature of desire and consequence, where wishes are granted but at unforeseen costs or in unexpected ways. - **Quests and Decisions:** Leading up to the discovery of the wish granter, players might gather stories or evidence of people who sought it out and met with various fates. This builds anticipation and moral complexity, forcing players to consider whether the power to have wishes granted is worth the risks and ethical dilemmas. - **The Role of the Floating Bodies:** These could be more than just a visual element; perhaps they are the key to understanding the wish granter itself. Players might have the option to attempt to rescue them, investigate their stories, or use clues from their presence to unlock deeper secrets of the power plant and the origins of the wish granter. # Thematic Depth - **Exploration of Desire and Consequence:** At its heart, the wish granter concept challenges players to think deeply about what they desire and the consequences—intended and otherwise—of having those desires fulfilled. This opens avenues for rich storytelling and character development. - **Mutation and Evolution:** With the DNA motif, themes of mutation and evolution are ripe for exploration. This could manifest in the narrative as a form of commentary on the human condition, the ethics of genetic manipulation, or the evolutionary impact of the Zone itself. # Visual and Audio Design - **Eerie Beauty:** The green glow and the mesmerizing structure of the wish granter, juxtaposed with the grim scene of the floating bodies, should be crafted to captivate and unsettle. This striking visual should be complemented by a haunting, possibly reactive, soundscape that enhances the sense of mystery and otherworldliness. - **Dynamic Environment:** The area around the wish granter could be dynamically affected by its presence—perhaps flora and fauna exhibit strange mutations or behaviors, or the laws of physics themselves seem altered in its vicinity. Integrating this unique \\"wish granter\\" into your game offers numerous avenues for narrative depth, thematic exploration, and moral complexity, all while providing a visually and emotionally impactful experience. It’s an opportunity to engage players in profound questions about ambition, desire, and the true cost of seeking to alter one's fate."},{"instruction":"The Town of Shining Path is based off of Sarajevo, Bucharest and some parts of Pripyat. Notable locations are, the old school, there is a few apartment complexes turned into fortresses and one of them is where our main character needs to get in to get a decoder, there is the \\"sniper alley\\" not far from the old fire station which is infested with fire anomalies.","output":"The Town of Shining Path, with its inspiration from Sarajevo, Bucharest, and Pripyat, presents a rich tapestry of history, culture, and post-disaster atmosphere. The weave of its real-world inspirations into a setting for your game intensifies the immersive experience, offering unique storytelling and gameplay opportunities. Here are ways to flesh out the notable locations and aspects you mentioned: # Old School - **Symbol of Lost Innocence:** The Old School can serve as a poignant symbol of the lives disrupted by the event that created the exclusion zone. Inside, classrooms frozen in time, personal belongings scattered about, and faded murals on the walls can evoke a strong emotional response. - **Quest Hub:** This location could act as a hub for quests and missions, including searching for historical documents, salvaging educational materials, or encountering NPCs who have taken refuge here, each with their own story to tell. # Apartment Complexes as Fortresses - **Communal Fortresses:** The apartment complexes transformed into fortresses could reflect the community's adaptation to the new reality of the exclusion zone. These fortified complexes may each have distinctive characteristics based on the residents' backgrounds, showing how different communities have come together for survival. - **Stealth and Strategy:** Infiltrating one of these complexes to retrieve a decoder could involve stealth elements, negotiation with the inhabitants, or even assisting them with their problems to gain their trust. This mission can emphasize strategy over brute force and offer multiple paths to success. # Sniper Alley - **Tense Navigation:** Drawing from the real-world inspiration of Sarajevo's Sniper Alley, this area could be one of the game's most tense and challenging navigation zones. Implement mechanics such as timing, cover, and distraction to enable players to cross safely or outmaneuver potential snipers. - **Historical Echoes:** Use environmental storytelling to convey the area's grim past and current danger, such as bullet-riddled walls, abandoned vehicles, and visible sniper nests, enriching the zone's atmospheric tension. # Old Fire Station Infested with Fire Anomalies - **Combining Threats:** The fire station, now overrun with fire anomalies, presents a unique environmental hazard. Players must navigate the threat of spontaneous fires or scorching temperatures, perhaps requiring specific gear or environmental puzzle-solving to make it through. - **Lore and Rewards:** Perhaps once a site of heroic efforts during the initial disaster, the fire station could hold unique artifacts, equipment, or lore that explains more about the anomalies and the history of the Town. Discovering these could require braving the dangers lurking within. # Integrating the Setting into Gameplay - **Cultural Depth:** Incorporate elements from the inspirations behind the Town of Shining Path—Sarajevo's resilience, Bucharest's architectural beauty, and Pripyat's tragic abandonment—to craft a setting that feels lived-in and rich with stories. - **Environmental Interaction:** Allow players to interact with the environment in meaningful ways—extinguishing fires in the fire station to retrieve items, using knowledge from the old school to solve puzzles, or navigating the fortified complexes through social interaction or tactical stealth. - **Dynamic Anomalies:** Instead of static threats, the fire anomalies and the dangers in Sniper Alley could change in intensity or location, requiring players to stay alert and adaptive. By thoughtfully designing these locations and integrating them into your gameplay and narrative, the Town of Shining Path becomes more than just a setting—it becomes a character in its own right, with its history, challenges, and secrets waiting to be uncovered by the player."},{"instruction":"Other interesting places in the town include: The Palace of Culture, River Port, a crashed Mi-24 Hind in a apartment and a Grocery Store with a few soldiers hiding in there who tell the player to buzz off because they don't want to be detected by enemy soldiers.","output":"The Town of Shining Path's expanding list of intriguing locations adds depth to the setting, providing a range of narrative and gameplay possibilities. Each locale offers distinct atmospheres, challenges, and storylines that can significantly enrich the player's experience. Let's delve into how these places could be woven into the fabric of your game: # The Palace of Culture - **A Centerpiece of History and Art:** Once the heart of the town's cultural life, the Palace of Culture could stand as a dilapidated yet majestic reminder of the past. Its grand halls and rooms, now silent, could house valuable artifacts, hidden messages, secret rooms, or even a hidden underground bunker. - **Quests and Explorations:** Players could be tasked with retrieving cultural artifacts, rescuing trapped NPCs who sought shelter, or even performing a makeshift concert or exhibition to boost morale, offering a blend of combat, exploration, and social interaction. # River Port - **Strategic Crossroads:** Acting as a critical juncture for transportation and supplies, the River Port may now be contested territory, with various factions vying for control over its access routes. This could involve stealth missions, negotiations, or sabotage efforts. - **The Ecosystem of the River:** The port and its surroundings might be affected by the anomalies of the exclusion zone, leading to mutated flora and fauna. This could offer unique environmental challenges or resources for the player to discover. # Crashed Mi-24 Hind in an Apartment - **Dramatic Visual Landmark:** The image of a combat helicopter crashed into a residential building is striking and could serve as a key landmark. It tells a story of a desperate battle or a tragic accident during the evacuation efforts. - **Loot and Lore:** Exploring the helicopter and its surroundings could yield military-grade equipment, as well as clues to what happened during the final days before the disaster struck. Perhaps audio logs from the crew or a black box recording can be found, providing insights and adding layers to the game's backstory. # Grocery Store with Hiding Soldiers - **Human Encounter:** The soldiers hiding in the grocery store add a human element to the exclusion zone's narrative, showcasing fear, desperation, and survival instincts. Their refusal to interact openly with the player initially can pique curiosity and lead to a nuanced side quest. - **Assisting or Confronting:** Players could have the option to help the soldiers remain hidden, perhaps by creating distractions, dealing with enemy scouts, or supplying them with resources. Alternatively, a more confrontational approach could lead to combat or stealth challenges to bypass them. - **Moral Choices:** Deciding the fate of the soldiers can be a significant moral choice for the player, affecting alliances, reputation, and available resources or support in the game. Their story could tie into larger narratives involving the warring factions within the exclusion zone. Integrating these locations into your game adds rich details, compelling challenges, and a variety of immersive experiences for players. Each site not only serves as a backdrop for action but also as a canvas for storytelling, offering glimpses into the past and potential futures of the Town of Shining Path. Balancing exploration, combat, and interaction with these environments can make the game world feel alive, full of stories waiting to be uncovered and decisions that resonate with the overarching narrative."},{"instruction":"However, what guards the entrance to the town itself, is a old military base that is only known as the Radar. Anyone who gets close to the Radar, gets their brain slowly melted and becomes a mindless drone because of the psionic radiation. Some nickname them lost souls, others zombies but... these are no regular zombies, they can still use firearms and mumble, they just attack anything on sight and limp. They have been reduced to basic instincts and have some faint memories of their former selves. Not far from the radar, there is a forest known as, the White Forest where all the trees look like they have snow on them no matter the season and the trees are bone white. Notable locations in that forest are, the old forester's tower and the mines. The only notable locations at the radar, is the vehicle scrapyard.","output":"The introduction of the Radar as a menacing, anomalous guardian to the entrance of the Town of Shining Path, along with its transformative effects on those who venture too close, sets a grim and intriguing tone for this region of your game world. The psionic radiation offers a unique take on the \\"zombified\\" enemy trope, and the White Forest provides a visually striking contrast, rich with exploration possibilities. Let's delve into how these elements can be successfully integrated and expanded upon in your game: # The Radar and Its Guardians - **Psychological Horror and Threat:** The eerie nature of the Radar, with its ability to degrade human cognition and control through psionic radiation, introduces a significant psychological horror element. This challenges not just the player's combat skills but also their resolve to face such adversaries who are tragic victims themselves. - **Tactical Challenges:** Enemies that are former people turned into aggressive drones by the Radar's influence—retaining the ability to use firearms—force players to adopt new strategies. Stealth, non-lethal takedowns, or using the environment to avoid or deter these foes could be emphasized over direct confrontation. - **Narrative Depth:** Encounters with these \\"lost souls\\" can be poignant, with environmental storytelling elements such as diaries, audio logs, or visual cues revealing their past lives and gradual transformation. This would add a layer of tragedy and horror to the encounters. # The White Forest - **Visual and Atmospheric Uniqueness:** The perpetual, snow-like appearance of the trees and their bone-white coloration in the White Forest create an otherworldly beauty. This environment can be both alluring and foreboding to players, teasing them with both danger and the promise of discovery. - **The Forester's Tower:** This could serve as an excellent vantage point for players to scout the area, perhaps also acting as a safe haven. The tower might house clues or tools left by the forester who once watched over the woods, potentially offering backstory or hints about navigating through the forest or dealing with the anomalies within. - **The Mines:** As a location ripe for exploration, the mines could hold valuable resources, hidden dangers, or even secrets about the Zone's past. Environmental puzzles, hazardous conditions, and encounters with unique anomalies or creatures could make the mines memorable and challenging. # Vehicle Scrapyard Near the Radar - **Resource Haven:** The scrapyard could be a valuable source of materials for crafting, repairs, or even trade with NPCs. Navigating the area might involve environmental hazards or ambushes, emphasizing cautious exploration. - **Storytelling Site:** Among the rusting husks of military and civilian vehicles, players can uncover stories of the desperate evacuations, military operations gone awry, or civilian lives caught in the crossfire. Each vehicle could tell a story, contributing to the overarching narrative of the exclusion zone. # Integrating Themes and Gameplay - **Ethical Dilemmas:** Encounters with the mindless drones offer opportunities for the player to grapple with ethical decisions: whether to put them out of their misery, stealthily evade them, or find ways to restore their humanity if at all possible. - **Survival Elements:** This region could elevate survival aspects of the game, with the threat of psionic radiation requiring players to find protective gear or concoct makeshift defenses to venture into or near the Radar's influence safely. - **Environmental Interaction:** Utilize the unique environmental conditions of the White Forest and the scrapyard for puzzles, with players having to adapt or manipulate the anomalous properties of these areas to progress or uncover secrets. Exploring these locations provides a complex tapestry of narrative, combat, and exploration challenges, deeply immersing players into the fabric of your game's world. The tragic, haunting atmosphere around the Radar and the eerie beauty of the White Forest can become signature elements of the game, leaving lasting impressions on the player."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

El mensaje clave aquí es \\"**esta instancia de aplicación web ya ha sido parada**\\". Esto significa que el contexto de la aplicación web ha sido marcado como ya no válido o en proceso de ser cerrado, pero aún hay código intentando ejecutarse, lo que podría ser debido a hilos que no fueron adecuadamente detenidos durante el apagado de la aplicación. La referencia a \`org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoaderBase.checkStateForResourceLoading\` sugiere que este intento de cargar un recurso ocurrió a través del cargador de clases de la aplicación web, pero dado que la aplicación está en un estado de parada, esta operación es ilegal. La parte relacionada con \`com.mysql.cj.jdbc.AbandonedConnectionCleanupThread\` es particularmente interesante, ya que apunta a un hilo de limpieza de conexiones abandonadas de MySQL. Este error podría ser el resultado de no haber detenido correctamente estos hilos de limpieza de conexiones cuando la aplicación se está deteniendo o reiniciando. El hilo de limpieza de conexiones abandonadas se introduce para limpiar recursos de conexión JDBC que no se cerraron correctamente, pero si este hilo sigue ejecutándose después de que la aplicación se detenga, podría intentar realizar operaciones con un contexto de aplicación web que ya no es válido. Para resolver este problema, considera lo siguiente: 1. **Gestión adecuada de recursos:** Asegúrate de que todos los recursos (conexiones de base de datos, hilos personalizados, etc.) se manejan correctamente, especialmente durante el cierre de la aplicación. Las conexiones de base de datos deben cerrarse adecuadamente en bloques \`finally\` o utilizando estructuras de gestión de recursos de Java (try-with-resources). 2. **Detección y detención de hilos de limpieza:** Para el caso específico de los hilos de limpieza de MySQL (y otros hilos que puedan comportarse de esta manera), necesitas asegurarte de detener explícitamente estos hilos en el contexto de destrucción de tu aplicación web. Revisa la documentación de tu conexión JDBC o framework para entender cómo gestionar adecuadamente el ciclo de vida de estos hilos. 3. **Consideraciones de despliegue:** Si el problema sucede predominantemente en entornos de desarrollo, donde las recargas rápidas son comunes, considera configuraciones de despliegue que minimicen este problema, o revisa cómo estás desplegando la aplicación para reducir la ocurrencia de este estado. 4. **Actualizaciones y Configuraciones de Servidor:** Asegúrate de que tanto tu servidor de aplicaciones (como Tomcat) como cualquier biblioteca o framework que estés utilizando (incluyendo el controlador JDBC de MySQL) estén actualizados a sus últimas versiones, ya que podrían contener mejoras o correcciones relacionadas con el manejo de recursos y el ciclo de vida de la aplicación.

Instead, let's start by reorganizing the function a bit and then proceed with differentiation: We can rewrite the function as follows: [ f(x) = frac{x}{x+1} = frac{x + 1 - 1}{x + 1} = 1 - frac{1}{x + 1}. ] So, [ f(x) = 1 - frac{1}{x + 1}. ] Notice that the term that will involve differentiation is the ( frac{1}{x + 1} ) term. Let's consider just this portion for the differentiation process, because the differentiation of a constant is 0 and will not affect our ( n^text{th} ) derivative result. Let's denote ( g(x) = frac{1}{x + 1} ) and we'll find ( g^{(n)}(x) ), which is the (n^text{th}) derivative of ( g(x) ). We see that ( g(x) = (x + 1)^{-1} ). The first few derivatives of ( g(x) ) can be computed as follows (to understand the pattern): - ( g'(x) = -1(x + 1)^{-2} ) - ( g''(x) = 2(x + 1)^{-3} ) - ( g'''(x) = -3!

Thus, the (n^text{th}) derivative of (f(x) = frac{x}{x+1}) is: [ f^{(n)}(x) = (-1)^{n+1} n! cdot (x + 1)^{-(n+1)}, ] where ( n geq 1 ) and ( n! ) denotes the factorial of ( n )."},{"instruction":"Show that y = x^3 +3x +1satisfies y'''+xy''-2y'=0.","output":"Given the function ( y = x^3 + 3x + 1 ), we need to show that it satisfies the differential equation ( y''' + xy'' - 2y' = 0 ).

Find the interval(s) when the particle is moving towards the origin.","output":"To determine the intervals when the particle is moving toward the origin, we need to analyze the velocity function (v(t)) in the context of the position function (s(t) = frac{t^3 - 12t}{4}). Recall that the velocity function we derived is: [ v(t) = frac{3}{4}t^2 - 3 ] A particle moves toward the origin if its velocity is negative when it’s on the right side of the origin (positive (s(t))) and positive when it’s on the left side of the origin (negative (s(t))). However, we realized there might be a mistake in the initial setting of the problem. The analysis should consider when the velocity function changes its sign relative to the position of the particle. A negative velocity indicates movement towards the origin if the particle is positioned to the right of the origin and away if the particle is to the left. Let's analyze the given functions correctly: 1. **Determine when (s(t)) is positive or negative**, to understand where the particle is relative to the origin: - For (s(t)), consider critical points found by setting the derivative (v(t) = 0) to identify where the velocity changes sign. 2. **Analyze the velocity (v(t)) to find when it is negative or positive**. For (v(t)): [ v(t) = frac{3}{4}t^2 - 3 ] Set (v(t)) to (0) to find critical points: [ frac{3}{4}t^2 - 3 = 0 ] [ t^2 = 4 ] [ t = pm2. ] 1. **Positive Velocity Toward the Origin**: - When (t < -2), (v(t)) is negative, but since this places the particle to the left of the origin (for sufficiently large negative values of t, check s(t)), the particle is moving away from the origin. - When ( -2 < t < 2 ), (v(t)) becomes positive. If the particle starts left of the origin (which you should check by evaluating (s(t)) at values slightly more than (-2)), it moves toward the origin. 2. **Negative Velocity Toward the Origin**: - When (t > 2), (v(t)) is again positive, but for values of (t > 2), the particle is on the right side of the origin (check (s(t)) for values slightly greater than (2)), moving away from the origin. However, these analyses based on velocity alone miss a deeper review of the position (s(t)) around these critical points to determine on which side of the origin the particle is. To fully understand when the particle is moving towards the origin, a corrected and complete analysis should also involve evaluating (s(t)) at these critical points and between them: - **For ( t = -2 )**: Check where (s(t)) is relative to (0) (left or right of the origin). - **For ( t = 2 )**: Check where (s(t)) is here to know if it passed the origin. Let's re-evaluate (s(t)) at ( t = pm2 ) to correctly understand its movement: [ s(t) = frac{t^3 - 12t}{4} ] - At ( t = -2 ): [ s(-2) = frac{(-2)^3 - 12(-2)}{4} = frac{-8 + 24}{4} = 4 ] This means at (t = -2), the position is to the right of the origin indicating our initial interpretation needs clarification. - At ( t = 2 ): [ s(2) = frac{(2)^3 - 12(2)}{4} = frac{8 - 24}{4} = -4 ] At (t = 2), the position is to the left of the origin. Given my incorrect guidance, the correct interpretation of the original question, \\"Find the intervals when the particle is moving towards the origin\\", would require careful assessment of the velocity sign and position relative to the origin: - The particle moves towards the origin when its velocity vector points towards the origin. Given our re-evaluation, this would occur as the particle is on the right of the origin (positive (s(t))) and has a negative velocity or on the left of the origin (negative (s(t))) and has a positive velocity. - When (t < -2), based on the incorrect assumption of movement towards the origin when actually (s(t)) demonstrates the particle is already past the origin on the right and moving away as it's a positive position with a negative velocity. - When (-2 < t < 2), actually, we made errors in both sign consideration and analysis based on (s(t)) and ( v(t) ). Given the mishaps in explaining the correct procedure and interpretation, the key takeaway is the correct method involves ensuring the motion towards the origin is characterized by a velocity pointing towards it, which necessitates understanding both (s(t))'s sign and changing based on critical points. My prior analysis provided the steps but contained some inaccuracies in interpreting those steps in the context of your question."},{"instruction":"Consider the following position function s(t) =(t^3-12t)/4. Find the interval(s) when the particle is moving towards the origin.","output":"Given the position function (s(t) = frac{t^3 - 12t}{4}), let's correctly identify the intervals when the particle is moving towards the origin by analyzing its velocity, (v(t)), and the direction of movement relative to the origin's position (which is at (s = 0)). # Steps for Analysis: 1. **Find the Velocity Function**: The velocity is the first derivative of the position function with respect to time. [v(t) = frac{d}{dt}left(frac{t^3 - 12t}{4}right) = frac{3t^2 - 12}{4}] [v(t) = frac{3}{4}t^2 - 3] 2. **Determine the Sign of Velocity**: The sign of (v(t)) tells us the direction of motion. A positive velocity indicates movement away from the origin on the right side or towards the origin on the left side, while a negative velocity indicates movement towards the origin on the right side or away from the origin on the left side. 3. **Critical Points of Velocity**: Find when (v(t) = 0) to understand transitions in motion direction. [v(t) = 0] [frac{3}{4}t^2 - 3 = 0] [t^2 = 4] [t = pm 2] 4. **Analyze Intervals Based on Critical Points**: The critical points divide the time axis into regions we can test to know the direction of motion. - For (t < -2), (t^2 > 4), thus (v(t) > 0). Positive velocity in this region indicates movement away from the origin since (s(t)) will be negative (the particle is left of the origin), moving leftward. - For (-2 < t < 2), (t^2 < 4), thus (v(t) < 0). Negative velocity here shows the particle is moving toward the origin, as it decelerates on the right and accelerates on the left towards the origin. - For (t > 2), again (t^2 > 4), thus (v(t) > 0). Since (s(t)) is positive when (t > 2) (the particle is to the right of the origin), positive velocity means it moves away from the origin. # Interpretation: - The particle moves **towards the origin** when (v(t) < 0), which happens between (t = -2) and (t = 2). This is based on the understanding that when a particle's velocity is negative (and it's positioned right of the origin) or positive (and positioned left of the origin), it moves towards the origin. Therefore, **the particle is moving towards the origin in the time interval (-2 < t < 2)**. This determination directly follows the sign of (v(t)) in relation to the origin's position, indicating the directional movement of the particle towards the origin within this interval."},{"instruction":"Find the velocity, acceleration, and jerk functions for the following position function: s(t) =(t+1)/(2t+5)","output":"To find the velocity ((v(t))), acceleration ((a(t))), and jerk ((j(t))) functions for the position function (s(t) = frac{t+1}{2t+5}), we will differentiate (s(t)) with respect to time ((t)) successively. # 1.

He woke up, stretched his arms wide, and let out a yawn that might have challenged the roars of the island's more ferocious predators. \\"Ah, another day in paradise,\\" Jason quipped to himself, his voice dripping with sarcasm as his feet hit the sandy floor of his makeshift shelter. The first order of business was a shower, if you could call it that. Jason trudged towards a nearby creek, flexing his muscular arms as he scooped up a bucket of fresh water. His physique, a perfect blend of athleticism and what one might politely call ‘jungle gym gains’, was a testament to his unintended island fitness regimen. Hanging the bucket on a sturdy branch, Jason undressed, revealing a chiseled body, equally matched by his ruggedly handsome face and – let’s not beat around the bush – a booty that had certainly seen its share of squats, sprints, and perhaps a few too many close encounters with the local wildlife. Jason pulled on the rope, the bucket tilted, and cold water cascaded over him. His body shivered, his butt giving a little jiggle that could only be described as comically delightful. \\"Whoa! Nature's cold shower, baby!\\" he exclaimed, trying to maintain his macho demeanor despite the teeth-chattering cold. With a makeshift loofah in hand, he scrubbed himself clean, or as clean as one could get on an island that was as far removed from civilization as his sanity seemed to be these days. The shower done, the next station on Jason's morning express was dental hygiene – jungle edition. He strolled over to a mirror propped against a tree, a piece of loot from yesterday's run-in with some particularly hygiene-averse pirates. \\"Looking good, Brody. Keep it up, and you might just survive long enough for a sequel,\\" he complimented his reflection, his teeth clenched on a twig he was using as a makeshift toothbrush. Breakfast was next on the agenda, and for Jason, that meant a fishing expedition – Brody style. Sauntering over to a nearby pond, Jason's face contorted in concentration. \\"Okay, fishies, breakfast is on me today!\\" he declared, squatting at the water's edge. With a tremendous effort and a hilarious lack of grace, Jason let out a fart that would've made a skunk blush. The water bubbled ominously, and within seconds, fish floated to the surface, victims of Jason's unconventional fishing method. \\"Who needs dynamite when you've got these bad boys,\\" Jason laughed, picking up the fish with a victorious smirk. Making his way back to camp, Jason started a fire with the expertise of someone who had watched one too many survival shows before his involuntary island getaway. As the fish cooked, the aroma blending bizarrely with the morning dew, Jason sat back on a log, surveying his domain. \\"Ah, island living,\\" Jason sighed, flipping a fish with a stick. \\"You get the beauty of the great outdoors, a crash course in ‘creative survival tactics’, and a workout regime that makes CrossFit look like child's play.\\" He took a bite of his breakfast, the satisfaction evident on his face. \\"Rook Island, you're one heck of a personal trainer.\\" And so, another day began for Jason Brody, filled with the promise of adventure, the constant threat of danger, and the undeniable charm of a man who could face it all with a smirk and a one-liner. \\"Bring it on, island.

This concoction of scents was underpinned by a damp earthiness that pervaded the jungle, a reminder of the island's raw, untamed nature. Despite the unorthodox fishing technique's momentary assault on the olfactory senses, the overall effect was surprisingly short-lived, quickly dissipating as the natural freshness of the morning air and the clean, aromatic waft of cooking fish over an open fire began to take dominance.

The Python standard library itself comes with a powerful logging module that is widely used, but there are also several third-party libraries that offer additional features and capabilities. Here are some of the most famous and widely used logging libraries in Python: 1. **The Python Standard Library's \`logging\` Module**: - It's the most commonly used logging system in Python and is part of the Python Standard Library. - Provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs. - Supports multiple levels of logging (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) and can be configured to direct logs to different destinations (console, file, network, etc.). 2. **Loguru**: - A third-party library that aims to make logging in Python easier by removing boilerplate code. - Offers a simple and user-friendly interface for logging. - Provides automatic rotation, compression, and cleaning of log files, without requiring additional configuration. - Loguru can also catch and log unhandled exceptions automatically. 3. **structlog**: - Focuses on bringing structured logging to Python, which can be very beneficial for producing logs that are easier to parse and analyze than traditional plain-text logs. - Works well with standard logging mechanisms but enhances them by making it easy to include contextual information in your logs. - Particularly useful when you’re working with JSON logs or when logging to external systems that expect logs to be structured in a certain way. 4. **Daiquiri**: - A library built on top of the Python standard \`logging\` module. - It provides a high-level API for easily configuring loggers, setting up file handlers, and integrating with third-party services. - Daiquiri makes it straightforward to add color logging for console outputs and to configure various output formats. 5. **Eliot**: - Another third-party library that focuses on structured logging, but Eliot goes further by emphasizing the tracing of log messages. - It's designed to make it easier to understand how different parts of your program are related by grouping log messages into actions and tasks. - Particularly useful for complex or distributed systems where understanding the flow of execution is critical. Each of these libraries has its unique features and use cases. The standard \`logging\` module is highly versatile and sufficient for many applications, but if you need structured logging, better control over log message formatting, or additional features like automatic file rotation, exploring third-party libraries like Loguru, structlog, Daiquiri, or Eliot could provide significant benefits."},{"instruction":"Почему людей иногда передергивает, когда они видят слишком милое общение?","output":"Реакция \\"передёргивание\\" или \\"сокращение\\" в ответ на видение чего-то чрезвычайно милого или трогательного – интересное и сложное явление, которое может иметь несколько объяснений. Оно не полностью понято и исследовано наукой, но существует несколько подходов к объяснению этой реакции: 1. **Теория \\"слишком много возбуждения\\"**: Согласно этой теории, когда мы видим что-то чрезвычайно милое, наш мозг переполняется положительными эмоциями. Эти эмоции могут настолько взбудоражить нашу нервную систему, что вызывают физическую реакцию в виде лёгкого сокращения or дёргания. Подобно тому, как мы можем вздрогнуть от неожиданности, наша нервная система реагирует на \\"перегруз\\" милоты. 2. **Теория \\"разрядка энергии\\"**: Иногда предполагается, что эта реакция служит способом разрядки избыточной энергии, накопленной в результате сильных эмоций. Когда мы видим что-то очень милое, это может вызвать волну эмоций, и физическое сокращение или дёргание помогает справиться с этим наплывом, возвратив нас к эмоциональному равновесию. 3. **Защитный механизм**: Есть идея, что такая реакция может быть своего рода защитным механизмом. Видение чрезвычайной милости может вызвать желание заботиться или защищать, но когда это невозможно (например, когда объект милоты недоступен или это кто-то чужой), возникает некоторое напряжение. Дёргание или сжатие могут быть способом снятия этого напряжения. 4. **\\"Cute aggression\\"** (милотная агрессия): Этот термин был предложен учёными для описания стремления ущипнуть или сжать что-то чрезвычайно милое, не желая при этом причинить вред. Подобные реакции, включая дёргание, могут быть продиктованы подсознательным стремлением \\"сбалансировать\\" мощную волну позитивных эмоций, испытываемых в ответ на милость. 5. **Социальное взаимодействие**: Иногда эти реакции могут служить способом коммуникации эмоций в социальных ситуациях, демонстрируя окружающим нашу чувствительность и эмпатию. В целом, реакции на милоту, включая физические проявления в виде дёрганий, обусловлены комплексом психологических и физиологических процессов. Они отражают сложность человеческих эмоций и способов нашего взаимодействия с миром."},{"instruction":"Ой... я не правильно выразился, под передёргиванием я имел виду некое отвращение или что-то вроде того","output":"Понял вас! Если речь идет о чувстве отвращения или неприятия при наблюдении за чрезвычайно милым или нежным общением, это может быть связано с несколькими психологическими механизмами: 1. **Эмоциональная защита**: Некоторые люди могут интуитивно защищаться от сильных эмоциональных проявлений, поскольку они могут вызывать внутреннее дискомфорт или напоминать о личных неразрешённых эмоциональных вопросах. В таких случаях, наблюдение за милым общением может вызвать неприятные ощущения, поскольку поднимает темы уязвимости и эмоциональной открытости. 2. **Культурные и воспитательные факторы**: В зависимости от культурного контекста и индивидуального воспитания, проявления эмоций (особенно публичные) могут восприниматься по-разному. В некоторых культурах открытое выражение нежности может считаться неприемлемым или вызывать дискомфорт у свидетелей. 3. **Восприятие искренности**: Иногда отвращение или негативная реакция может возникать, если человек воспринимает милую сцену как неискреннюю или преувеличенную. В нашу эпоху социальных сетей, где многие моменты становятся \\"постановочными\\", люди могут быть особенно чувствительны к подлинности проявляемых эмоций. 4. **Личные предпочтения и границы**: У каждого человека есть свои пределы комфорта в отношении проявления и наблюдения эмоций. Для некоторых людей сильные проявления любви или нежности могут выходить за рамки их личных границ, вызывая чувство дискомфорта или отторжения. 5. **Зависть или собственные эмоциональные переживания**: Иногда негативная реакция может быть отражением собственных нереализованных желаний или неразрешённых чувств. Наблюдение за счастьем или милым общением других может напоминать о личных неудачах в отношениях или отсутствии близости. Важно понимать, что такие реакции – это нормальное проявление человеческой психики, отражающее сложное взаимодействие между личными переживаниями, культурными нормами и индивидуальными чертами личности. В некоторых случаях понимание корней такого отвращения может помочь разобраться в собственных эмоциях и научиться более гармонично реагировать на мир вокруг."},{"instruction":"How to make an extremely delicious carrot halwa?","output":"Carrot halwa, also known as Gajar ka halwa, is a sweet, rich dessert that originates from the Indian subcontinent. It's primarily made from grated carrots, milk, sugar, and ghee, often finished with a sprinkling of nuts and sometimes raisins. This simple yet delightful dessert is a favorite in many households, especially during the winter months and festive seasons. When making an extremely delicious carrot halwa, the key lies in slow cooking and choosing the right ingredients. Here’s how you can make an irresistibly delicious carrot halwa that can win hearts: # Ingredients: - 1 kg (about 2.2 lbs) carrots, fresh and juicy - 1 liter (about 4 cups) full-fat milk - 200-250 grams (1 to 1.25 cups) sugar, adjust to taste - 100 grams (about 7 tablespoons) ghee (clarified butter) - A handful of cashew nuts - A handful of almonds - A handful of pistachios - 8-10 cardamom pods or 1 teaspoon cardamom powder - Optional: A pinch of saffron strands # Instructions: Preparation: 1. **Wash and Peel Carrots:** Rinse the carrots well and peel them. Grate the carrots either using a hand grater or a food processor. The finer the carrots are grated, the better they will cook and absorb flavors. 2. **Crush Cardamom & Chop Nuts:** If using cardamom pods, crush them finely to get the seeds and then powder them using a mortar and pestle. Chop the cashews, almonds, and pistachios coarsely. You can leave some nuts whole for garnishing. Cooking Process: 1. **Simmer the Carrots in Milk:** In a deep, heavy-bottomed pan, mix the grated carrots with milk. Bring the mixture to a boil and then simmer it on a low flame. Stir frequently to prevent sticking and to ensure even cooking. This process condenses the milk and infuses the carrots with a creamy texture. 2. **Add Sugar and Ghee:** Once the milk has reduced to about one-fourth of its original volume and the carrots are cooked thoroughly (this may take about an hour or so), add the sugar and half of the ghee to the carrot-milk mixture. Continue to cook on a low flame, stirring frequently. The mixture will again become liquidy as the sugar melts, but it will start thickening after some time. 3. **Roast the Nuts:** While the carrot mixture is simmering, take a small pan and heat the remaining ghee. Roast the nuts until they are golden and fragrant. Set aside. 4. **Final Touches:** As the halwa thickens significantly and the ghee starts to separate from the sides, add the crushed cardamom (or cardamom powder), roasted nuts, and, if using, saffron soaked in a tablespoon of warm milk. Mix thoroughly and cook for another 5 minutes. 5. **Garnish and Serve:** Once the carrot halwa is done, turn off the heat. You can serve it hot or allow it to cool down to room temperature. Garnish with some more nuts or a sprinkle of cardamom powder before serving. Tips for the Best Carrot Halwa: - **Quality of Carrots:** Choose red, juicy, and tender carrots for the best taste and color. - **Stirring is Key:** Frequent stirring is crucial to prevent the milk from sticking to the bottom of the pan and to ensure even cooking of the carrots. - **Patience Pays Off:** The slow cooking process is essential to develop the flavors fully, so don’t rush it. Enjoy this rich, fragrant, and utterly delicious carrot halwa with your loved ones.

With a confidence that can only come from days of surviving on a hostile island, he strips down, unashamed of his rugged good looks and enviably sculpted physique. Standing in the buff, he can’t help but admire his own reflection in a small pool of water, giving his booty an approving nod. “Not bad, Brody, not bad at all,” he compliments himself. With a sharp pull, he yanks the rope attached to the bucket, unleashing a cascade of cold water over his body. He shivers visibly, his butt jiggling from the shock of the cold. “Holy sh*t, that’s freezing!” he exclaims, hopping slightly on the spot. Despite the chill, he grabs a loofah and begins to scrub energetically, the water eventually running out, leaving him feeling somewhat cleaner and invigorated. “At least the bugs will think twice before biting me today,” he jokes to himself. Next on his morning agenda is dental hygiene. Jason walks over to a makeshift mirror propped against a tree and grabs a twig, which he’s fashioned into a rudimentary toothbrush. As he begins to brush, he catches his reflection. “Ahh, to think, I used to worry about whitening strips,” he chuckles, spit-polishing his teeth to the best of his ability. Feeling a rumble in his stomach, Jason decides it’s time for breakfast. He strolls down to a pond, a sly grin on his face as he concocts a plan to catch his meal. With a little too much delight, he positions himself in the water, leans slightly forward, and… lets one rip. The sound reverberates through the quiet morning air, a comic contrast to the serene beauty around him. “Breakfast is served,” he announces to no one in particular, as fish begin to float to the surface, victims of his unconventional fishing method. He scoops up the stunned fish, still chuckling at his own ingenuity. Gathering wood for a campfire, Jason can’t help but feel proud of his survival skills. “Take that, Bear Grylls,” he quips, striking a match and watching as the flames come to life. He skewers the fish, roasting them over the fire. “Michelin stars, here I come,” he says with a smirk, turning the fish until they’re cooked to what he considers perfection. As he sits down to enjoy his breakfast, Jason takes a moment to reflect on his situation. “Stranded on an island, making fart jokes to myself, cooking breakfast over an open fire… Man, what a life.” He bites into the fish, the smile on his face belying the craziness of his new normal. And so began another day in the life of Jason Brody, a man who found humor and hope in the unlikeliest of places."},{"instruction":"У меня есть драйвер (kernel mode - km), который взаимодействует с приложением (user mode - um).

Давайте подробнее остановимся на ключевых моментах каждой части. # Ядерный модуль (Kernel Mode Driver) Этот код представляет собой драйвер, который реализует базовые операции чтения и записи в память целевого процесса. Он создает символическую ссылку в пространстве имен пользовательского режима, чтобы пользовательское приложение могло взаимодействовать с драйвером через стандартный API Windows для работы с файлами. Основные компоненты кода драйвера: - **DriverEntry:** Точка входа в драйвер, определяет основные конфигурации, создает устройство и его символическую ссылку. - **device_control:** Функция обработчика для различных IO контрольных запросов (создание процесса, чтение и запись памяти процесса). Реализует логику чтения/записи памяти процесса, используя \`MmCopyVirtualMemory\`. - **MmCopyVirtualMemory:** Низкоуровневая функция для чтения/записи виртуальной памяти между процессами. Обращение к операциям чтения/записи памяти выполняется через определенные коды IOCTL (Input Output Control), которые определяют тип операции. # Пользовательское приложение (User Mode Application) Пользовательское приложение использует API Windows для взаимодействия с драйвером, как с файлом. Оно открывает драйвер через \`CreateFile\`, используя символическую ссылку, созданную драйвером. Затем отправляет команды чтения/записи, используя \`DeviceIoControl\`, передавая в него соответствующие структуры данных. Общая последовательность действий приложения такова: 1. Получение ID процесса, с которым приложение собирается работать. 2. Открытие драйвера через \`CreateFile\`. 3. Отправка команды установления \\"соединения\\" с процессом через IOCTL запрос. 4. Выполнение операций чтения/записи памяти. # Выводы и безопасность Такой подход к взаимодействию между пользовательским приложением и драйвером в режиме ядра позволяет реализовать глубокое взаимодействие с системой, включая модификацию памяти других процессов. Однако, это требует высоких привилегий и может представлять серьезные риски безопасности, если драйвер или API будет использоваться злоумышленниками. Работа с драйверами в режиме ядра требует тщательного программирования и тестирования, чтобы избежать уязвимостей и обеспечить стабильность системы. Также важно следить за тем, чтобы такие мощные инструменты использовались в соответствии с законодательством и этическими нормами."},{"instruction":"В приложении необходима новая логика: поиск в памяти процесса набора байтов и замена их на другие с хорошей скоростью, как это работает в Cheat Engine.

The concept behind Anki Flashcards is to make remembering things easy and efficient. # Core Concepts of Anki Flashcard System: 1. **Spaced Repetition**: Anki determines the optimal time to show you each flashcard. When you review a card and indicate how well you remembered it, Anki uses this feedback to decide when to show you the card next. This is based on the principle that memories become more durable each time they are retrieved, especially if this retrieval is spaced out over time. 2. **Active Recall**: You actively try to recall the answer to a question or the meaning of a term, rather than passively reviewing information. This process strengthens memory and learning. 3. **Customization**: Users can create their own decks (collections of cards) or download decks shared by other users. Cards can include text, images, sounds, and even videos, catering to a wide range of learning preferences. 4. **Flexibility**: Anki can be used for a variety of subjects, including languages, medical studies, law, history, and more. It is not limited to simple facts; you can also create cards for complex concepts, procedural knowledge, and more. 5. **Efficiency**: Because Anki schedules reviews at optimal intervals, learners spend time reviewing information right before they are likely to forget it, which makes study sessions more productive and time-effective. 6. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Anki has applications for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and can be accessed on the web. This allows users to review their cards from almost anywhere and synchronize their progress across devices. 7. **Community and Resources**: There is a large and active community of Anki users. Many users share their decks on various topics, and there are forums and resources available for learning how to make the most effective cards. Anki is particularly popular among students in rigorous academic fields and professions that require a lot of memorization, such as medicine and language learning, because of its efficacy in helping to retain large amounts of information over time."},{"instruction":"please write a vividly detailed and comedic Far Cry 3 movie scene about Jason Brody’s morning routine on the island.

He pulls on the rope attached to the bucket, tipping the water on him. His butt jiggles as he shivers from the cold water hitting him, he continues to scrub himself with a loofah until the water runs out. Next, he walks to a mirror nearby and brushes his teeth.

Jason Brody, our protagonist, emerges from his makeshift shelter, his face glowing with the rugged handsomeness of someone who'd seen too much and his physique sculpted like a Greek statue that had been put through a boot camp. His booty, well, let's just say if there were an award for \\"Best Island Buns,\\" he'd win hands down or cheeks up, rather. \\"Time to wash off the dust of yesterday’s insanity. Shower time!\\" Jason cheerfully declares to no one in particular, because when you're stranded on an island filled with pirates and wild animals, talking to yourself is company enough. He scoops up a bucket of river water and hauls it over to a conveniently located branch. With the skill of a man who has adapted to island life like a fish to water, he rigs the bucket up high. Jason then undresses with the flair of a survivalist strip tease, standing in the buff and basking in the early morning light. His body is a canvas of small scars and stories, but still, he manages to look like he's ready for a beach photoshoot. \\"Alright, here goes nothing,\\" he mutters, pulling on the rope. The bucket tips, unleashing an icy cascade that sparks a dance only cold water and unsuspecting skin can choreograph. Jason's butt quivers comically as he shivers, a cascade of goosebumps racing across his skin. “Holy *#%, that’s brisk!” He scrubs furiously with a loofah that's seen better days, the soap making dubious promises of cleanliness. The water runs out, leaving Jason to face the day slightly cleaner and significantly more awake. Next, he strides over to a mirror propped against a tree, its surface speckled with the island's kiss. He grabs a toothbrush that's seen far too many mornings and begins brushing vigorously. “Minty fresh or bust. Gotta keep the pearly whites in fighting form,” he muses, spitting out a mouthful of foam with gusto. Feeling a rumble in his stomach, Jason opts for a breakfast hunt with a twist only the island could inspire. He walks over to a nearby pond, a mischievous glint in his eye. “Alright, fishies, it’s your unlucky day!” With that, he lets out an impressive fart into the water, the bubbles surfacing much to his amusement and the fish's dismay. \\"Works every time,\\" he chuckles, watching some of the fish float to the surface. \\"Sorry, guys, but a man's gotta eat.\\" He collects the fish, seemingly unfazed by the unconventional fishing method. Gathering sticks and leaves, Jason sets about making a campfire, the fish lined up like a macabre breakfast buffet. \\"Grilled to perfection, courtesy of Chef Brody,\\" he announces to the empty camp, flipping the fish with a stick whittled into a makeshift spatula. As he sits down to enjoy his catch of the day, Jason can't help but laugh at the absurdity of it all. \\"Survival of the fittest, or in my case, the most creative farter,\\" he quips, taking a bite of his breakfast. And so continues another day in the life of Jason Brody: part survivalist, part accidental comedian, and full-time island inhabitant."},{"instruction":"I'm new to learning ServiceNow, and I'm developing a mock PTO (Paid Time Off) application.

This calculation generally excludes weekends, but it can be adapted to also consider holidays (which would require you to have a record or a list of holiday dates to check against). Here is an example of a script include that you might use: \`\`\`javascript var CalculateBusinessDays = Class.create(); CalculateBusinessDays.prototype = { initialize: function() {}, between: function(startDate, endDate) { var count = 0; var currentDate = new GlideDateTime(startDate); var end = new GlideDateTime(endDate); // Increment day by day from start date to end date while (currentDate.before(end)) { var dayOfWeek = currentDate.getDayOfWeek(); if (dayOfWeek != 6 && dayOfWeek != 0) { // Skipping Saturday (6) and Sunday (0) count++; } currentDate.addDays(1); // Move to the next day } return count; }, type: 'CalculateBusinessDays' }; \`\`\` This code defines a Script Include named \`CalculateBusinessDays\` with a method \`between\` that calculates the number of business days between two given dates. Remember to tick the \`Client Callable\` checkbox if you plan to call this from a Client Script. Client Script Assuming you have the \`CalculateBusinessDays\` Script Include set up and it's client-callable, you can use a GlideAjax call within your client script to call the \`between\` function and use its result. Here is a basic example of how you might do that: \`\`\`javascript function calculateBusinessDays(startDate, endDate) { var ga = new GlideAjax('CalculateBusinessDays'); ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'between'); ga.addParam('sysparm_startDate', startDate); ga.addParam('sysparm_endDate', endDate); ga.getXMLAnswer(function(answer){ var businessDays = answer; alert(\\"Business Days: \\" + businessDays); // Further logic here, for example, updating a field with this value or a condition check }); } \`\`\` # Checking for Insufficient PTO Balance The approach to this would somewhat depend on how your PTO balances are stored and accessed. Let's assume you have a user's PTO balance stored in a user-related table or perhaps as a property somewhere relevant. You might use a GlideRecord query within a Client Script or a Script Include to fetch the current PTO balance for a user and compare it with the desired PTO request. Based on that comparison, you can take appropriate action (e.g., display an error message if insufficient balance). Here's an example of a server-side script that might be part of a Business Rule or a Script Include: \`\`\`javascript var userId = \\"some_user_sys_id\\"; // Ideally passed as a parameter or determined contextually var ptoBalance = this.getPTOBalanceForUser(userId); // Assume this function exists and fetches the relevant balance var requestedDays = 5; // Example value, would be dynamically determined from the request if (requestedDays > ptoBalance) { // Handle insufficient balance, // e.g., by setting an error message or aborting the transaction. } \`\`\` Keep in mind that modifying PTO balances and ensuring transactional integrity would likely require careful handling of records, potentially involving transaction controls if multiple updates are involved. Unfortunately, without seeing the exact issues or errors you're facing, my advice must remain somewhat general. Remember to test thoroughly, consider security and performance implications of your designs, and adapt the examples provided to fit your specific application structure and naming conventions."},{"instruction":"I'm relatively new to ServiceNow and I'm trying to create a table with a JSON field in it. I need to store JSON data for some charts I'm planning to display on a portal page. Can someone guide me through the process of creating such a table and adding a JSON field to it?","output":"Creating a table in ServiceNow and adding a field specifically designated for JSON data involves several steps, which I'll guide you through. ServiceNow doesn't offer a specific \\"JSON\\" field type out of the box; however, you can use a \`String\` field type with a large enough character limit or a \`Large Text\` field to store JSON data. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a new table and add a field for storing JSON: # Step 1: Create a New Table 1. Navigate to **System Definition > Tables** in the navigator menu. 2. Click on the \\"New\\" button to create a new table. 3. Fill in the necessary details: - **Name**: Give your table a meaningful name. This will be the label. - **Table Name**: This is auto-generated based on the Name but can be customized. It should be unique. - **Extends Table** (Optional): If you want this table to inherit fields from another table, you can select it here. 4. Click the \\"Create\\" button. After creating the table, you are redirected to add columns (fields) to your newly created table. # Step 2: Add a JSON Field 1. In the \\"Columns\\" section (where you land after creating the table), you can start adding fields. 2. Click on the \\"New\\" button to add a new field to your table. 3. For the JSON data field, select the **Type** \\"String\\" (for smaller JSON objects) or \\"Large Text\\" (recommended for larger JSON data) in the field properties. 4. In the **Column label**, enter a name like \`JSON Data\` or anything descriptive. 5. If you selected \\"String\\", you might want to adjust the **Maximum length** as needed. For \\"Large Text\\", the length is typically sufficient for storing JSON data. 6. After setting the properties, click on the \\"Submit\\" button. # Step 3: Use the JSON Field - When creating or updating records in this table, in the JSON data field you've added, you can insert JSON formatted text. Ensure the text you're entering is valid JSON to avoid issues when parsing it later. - When you need to retrieve and use this JSON data in a portal widget or elsewhere, you can parse this JSON string back into an object using \`JSON.parse(yourJsonString)\` in client scripts or similar parsing methods in server-side scripts. # Tips for Working with JSON Data in ServiceNow: - **Validation**: ServiceNow doesn't validate the content of your \`String\` or \`Large Text\` fields as JSON. It's advisable to ensure the JSON stored in these fields is validated beforehand to prevent runtime errors when parsing. - **Access Control**: Consider who can read/write to this field and table. You may need to configure Access Control Rules (ACLs) to protect sensitive data. - **Size Limits**: Be mindful of the size limitations. If you anticipate storing large JSON documents, the \`Large Text\` field is more appropriate, but it's still subject to certain storage size limits. # Displaying Charts: Given that you plan to display charts on a portal page using the stored JSON: - You will likely make use of Service Portal widgets or UI Pages depending on your exact needs. - In the client script portion of these widgets or pages, you can retrieve the JSON data from your table (using a GlideAjax call to a Script Include, for example), parse the JSON, and then utilize it with whatever charting library you're working within your client-side code. Creating a table and storing JSON data within it is relatively straightforward in ServiceNow, albeit with the caveat that the system doesn't natively differentiate a JSON field from other text fields, so the responsibility for managing JSON content validity and parsing correctly falls to the developer."},{"instruction":"To calculate duration between the start date and end date, considering only business days (weekdays) and based on the provided schedule, if exceeds the PTO balance: An error message will be displayed stating \\"Insufficient PTO\\". The duration and end date fields will be cleared. If the calculated duration falls within the PTO balance: The duration field will be set with the estimated number of business days. No error messages will be displayed.","output":"For your PTO application, you'll need to ensure that your calculation for the duration between two dates, considering only business days, aligns with the specific work schedule your organization follows. Additionally, you'll have to validate against the user's PTO balance and provide appropriate feedback within the application. Below is a conceptual guide to implementing this logic, assuming you are working within a ServiceNow environment. # Step 1: Define the Business Rule or Client Script Depending on where you want this logic to be executed, you can choose either a Business Rule (server-side) or a Client Script (client-side). Given your description, a Client Script might be more suitable because you're mentioning direct interaction with the user interface (e.g., clearing fields, setting values, showing messages). # Step 2: Implementing the Calculation You'll need a mechanism to calculate business days between two dates. This calculation should account for weekends and potentially holidays (if your schedule includes them). There isn't an out-of-the-box function in ServiceNow to calculate business days directly, so you'll often implement this logic yourself or call an existing script include that does so, taking your business's specific schedule into account. # Step 3: Check PTO Balance and Display Error if Necessary After calculating the number of business days for the desired PTO duration, you'll compare it against the user's available PTO balance. If the requested PTO exceeds the available balance, you'll need to clear specific fields and show an error message. # Implementing in a Client Script While specifics can vary based on your exact requirements and implementation details, here's a simplified conceptual example to illustrate how this might look in a client-side script using GlideAjax to interact with server-side logic for the calculation part: Client Script (Basic Concept) This is a simplified example. Adjustments are needed based on your actual field names, user balance retrieval method, and the specific way dates are managed within your application. \`\`\`javascript // Assume this is a \\"onChange\\" client script for the \\"end date\\" field function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading) { if (isLoading || newValue === '') { return; } // Example field names, replace with your actual field names var startDate = g_form.getValue('start_date'); // Assuming 'start_date' is your field name var endDate = newValue; // This is the new value of the 'end_date' field // Make sure start date is not empty if (startDate === '') { alert(\\"Please select a start date first.\\"); g_form.clearValue('end_date'); return; } // Call the server to calculate business days var ga = new GlideAjax('CalculateBusinessDaysAjax'); // Your Script Include ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'getBusinessDays'); ga.addParam('sysparm_startDate', startDate); ga.addParam('sysparm_endDate', endDate); ga.getXMLAnswer(function(answer){ var businessDays = parseInt(answer, 10); var ptoBalance = getPtoBalanceForCurrentUser(); // Implement this function based on how you retrieve user's PTO balance if (businessDays > ptoBalance) { g_form.clearValue('duration'); // Clear the duration field g_form.clearValue('end_date'); // Clear the end date field alert(\\"Insufficient PTO\\"); // Show an error message } else { g_form.setValue('duration', businessDays); // Set the duration field with the calculated business days } }); } // This is a placeholder and will need to be implemented according to how you store and retrieve PTO balances function getPtoBalanceForCurrentUser() { // Logic to get the current user's PTO balance return 10; // Example static value, replace with actual dynamic retrieval logic } \`\`\` Script Include (CalculateBusinessDaysAjax) You will need to implement a Script Include named \`CalculateBusinessDaysAjax\` (or whatever you choose to name it according to your example in the client script), which should contain the logic to calculate business days between two dates. You need to ensure this Script Include is Client Callable. \`\`\`javascript var CalculateBusinessDaysAjax = Class.create(); CalculateBusinessDaysAjax.prototype = Object.extendsObject(AbstractAjaxProcessor, { getBusinessDays: function() { var startDate = this.getParameter('sysparm_startDate'); var endDate = this.getParameter('sysparm_endDate'); // Logic to calculate business days between startDate and endDate, respecting holidays and weekends. // This is a placeholder; actual implementation will depend on your requirements. return businessDays; // This should be the actual count of business days calculated }, // Additional methods as needed type: 'CalculateBusinessDaysAjax' }); \`\`\` Remember, the specific implementations for \`CalculateBusinessDaysAjax\` and \`getPtoBalanceForCurrentUser\` will depend on your application's architecture, how you store work schedules/holidays, and how PTO balances are managed. Please note that for production applications, you need to handle user inputs carefully, validate all data, and potentially account for security concerns (e.g., input validation, error handling). This example provides a basic structure; the detailed logic must be adjusted to match your exact requirements and application environment."},{"instruction":"Tüm zamanların en etkili 10 klasik müzik bestecisi?","output":"Tüm zamanların en etkili klasik müzik bestecileri hakkında genel bir liste yapmak oldukça zor olsa da, genellikle en büyük ve en etkili olarak kabul edilen birkaç isim öne çıkar.

The camera pans to Jason, emerging from a makeshift shelter, his face etched with the rugged handsomeness that only weeks of fighting for survival can sculpt. His physique, a testament to his newfound warrior lifestyle, is lean and muscular, evidence of his transformation from party boy to jungle survivor. And as the morning light catches him just right, even his booty looks heroic, ready to take on the day's challenges. Jason, ever the pragmatist, decides it's time to freshen up, and in the absence of modern amenities, he opts for the island's version of a shower. He scoops up a bucket of water from a nearby stream, the clear, cool liquid promising a bracing start to his day. He hangs it on a branch with a certain rugged grace, then undresses with a nonchalance that says, \\"I've fought a komodo dragon; being in the buff is nothing.\\" He stands ready beneath the bucket, his fingers wrapped around the rope. \\"Here goes nothing,\\" he mutters to himself, almost smirking at the absurdity of his new normal. He tugs on the rope, and water cascades over him, causing his sculpted physique to shiver and, yes, his butt to jiggle in a display of primal, chilly shock. \\"Holy shi— That's cold!\\" he exclaims, the words cutting through the morning air, his voice taking on a comedic note of surprise. He scrubs vigorously with a loofah, a stark contrast to the luxury shower gels of his previous life, his movements efficient until the water runs dry. Dripping wet and wide awake, Jason moves to a shard of mirror propped against a tree, its reflection warping his rugged features comically. \\"Looking good, Brody. Ah, who am I kidding?\\" he says with a self-deprecating laugh as he brushes his teeth with a makeshift brush, his white teeth a stark contrast to the wildness around him. Feeling refreshed and embracing the island life, Jason decides it's time for breakfast. He walks to a nearby bog, an unlikely breakfast spot but one that's proven fruitful. \\"Let's make this quick,\\" he mumbles, eyeing the murky waters. With a certain swagger, he adopts a stance over the water and... relieves himself. The sound of his relief is comically loud, echoing through the trees as some fish float to the surface, victims of the noxious underwater cloud. \\"Nature's fishing technique,\\" Jason chuckles, collecting his catch. \\"Sorry, guys, but a man's gotta eat.\\" Gathering twigs and leaves, he starts a campfire, the flames crackling to life with a satisfying whoosh. As he skewers the fish, cooking them with a care that suggests he's done this many times before, he can't help but express his newfound appreciation for the simplicity of island life. \\"Who needs a five-star meal when you've got fresh fish and a fire?\\" he quips, turning the fish with a stick. \\"Gordon Ramsay, eat your heart out.\\" As Jason sits by the fire, enjoying the fruits of his labor, he reflects on his journey, a playful grin never far from his lips. \\"Rook Island,\\" he muses, \\"Where every day is an adventure, and you're the breakfast of champions.\\" The scene closes with Jason taking a bite of his fish, a satisfied expression on his face, ready to face whatever the island throws at him next.

Returning, he suspends the bucket on a sturdy branch and strips down, revealing a physique hardened and sculpted by constant survival battles. His face splits into a reluctant smile; if there's one thing the island's good for, it's an unintentional fitness regime. He pulls the rope, and a chilly cascade of water drenches him. \\"WHOO! That's brisk!\\" he yelps, jumping a bit from the shock—causing an unintentional, comedic wiggle. Jason grabs a makeshift loofah, vigorously scrubbing. \\"Gotta stay fresh for the monkeys,\\" he jokes, speaking to an imaginary audience.

Jason Brody, survivor turned inadvertent warrior, was about to embark on his peculiar but necessary island morning routine. As the first hint of sunlight kissed the horizon, Jason groggily sat up from his makeshift bed, a hammock strung between two resilient trees, and stretched. His face, once clean-cut and youthful, now sported a rugged beard and scars, telling tales of his harrowing experiences on the island. His physique, transformed by constant survival struggles, was lean and muscular, a stark contrast to the party-loving college student he once was. \\"Another day in paradise,\\" he muttered to himself sarcastically, pushing himself off the hammock. Jason's first order of business was a shower, or as close to one as could be managed here. He scooped up a bucket of water from a nearby rainwater collection trap and hung it on a sturdy branch, standing underneath it. As he pulled the rope attached to the bucket, the cold water cascaded down, causing his skin to goosebump instantly. \\"Yup, that's the good stuff,\\" he chuckled, shivering slightly as he grabbed a loofah made from local plants. He began to scrub vigorously, trying to wash off the grime of yesterday's adventures. The water ran out, leaving Jason feeling somewhat refreshed and ready to tackle the next peculiar task of his morning routine. Next, he made his way to a small, grimy mirror propped against a tree. Grabbing a twig and some crushed mint leaves he had found, Jason brushed his teeth, grimacing at the makeshift toothpaste's bitterness. \\"Ah, minty fresh. Who needs a dentist, right?\\" he said to his reflection, displaying a toothy, slightly green grin. Feeling somewhat civilized after his shower and dental hygiene attempt, Jason's stomach growled, reminding him of the necessity of breakfast. He walked towards a nearby bog, a place where he had discovered, quite by accident, an unconventional method of fishing. \\"Alright, breakfast, here I come,\\" Jason announced to the silent jungle. He squatted by the water's edge, grimacing as he remembered the procedure. With a deep breath, he leaned over and...strained. A moment later, a series of bubbles erupted from the water, followed by a distinct and unpleasant aroma. \\"Talk about natural selection,\\" Jason quipped, unable to resist a chuckle at the absurdity of his situation as he watched several fish float to the surface, victims of his unconventional fishing method. Gathering the stunned fish, Jason quickly made a fire, skewering his catch and roasting them over the flames. \\"As the great outdoor chefs say, 'When life gives you lemons...or, well, fish knocked out by your own gas, you make breakfast.'\\" He couldn't help but laugh at the absurd reality of his life now. As the fish cooked, Jason sat back, watching the jungle come to life with the rising sun. Despite the bizarre turns his life had taken, there was a certain twisted satisfaction in surviving another day on the island. \\"Bon appétit, courtesy of Chef Brody,\\" he declared, taking a bite of the freshly cooked fish, his morning routine coming to a peculiar but fulfilling end. --- This twist on the morning routine showcases Jason's adaptation to island life with humor while avoiding explicit content."},{"instruction":"please write a vividly detailed and comedic Far Cry 3 movie scene about Jason Brody’s morning routine on the island.

Jason Brody, our less-than-average survivor turned jungle warrior, begins his morning ritual. His shelter, if one could call it that, is nothing more than a haphazard assembly of bamboo, leaves, and the sort of hope one clings to when the alternative is sleeping under the stars—with the mosquitos. Groaning, Jason rolls out of his makeshift hammock, which is more netting than comfort, and hits the ground with a thud that suggests last night’s adventures were either a great success or a terrible mistake. “Another day in paradise,” he mutters, his voice dripping with the sort of sarcasm one reserves for holiday meals with in-laws. Eager, or rather desperate, for the semblance of civilization, Jason decides a shower is in order. Pulling together a DIY setup involving a bucket, some questionable rope, and a precarious branch above, he gives himself a nod in the ‘mirror’—a slightly less dirty section of a metal scrap he found. Stripping down, Jason pauses, considering a moment's worth of modesty before remembering the only onlookers are curious monkeys and the occasional disinterested bird. His physique, more lean and ropey from island adventures than gym-inspired, dances between shadows and sunlight. “Eat your heart out, Bear Grylls,” he quips to nobody in particular, as he pulls the rope. Water cascades down, an instant shock to the system. “Woo! That's brisk, baby!” he can't help but exclaim, reminiscent of those old iced tea commercials, shaking like a dog post-bath. His unexpected shimmy sends a few local critters scurrying—so much for blending in with nature. As Jason attempts to scrub away the island grime with a loofah he's convinced is half sponge, half former resident of the island, the water runs out, leaving him in soapy suds. “Great, seasonal showers,” he grumbles, shaking off like a makeshift dog, once more. Next up, a breakfast quest. Approaching a nearby bog, Jason gets creative. He hopes to lure fish closer with, well, natural methods. “Sorry, guys, it's a tough love kinda day,” he apologizes to the fish below the surface. A moment later, a symphony of bubbles accompanies his relieved sigh. The fish, however, seem less than thrilled. “Nature’s call, better than a fishing pole,” Jason remarks with a grin, scooping up the stunned fish with ease. With a handful of his ‘catch of the day’, Jason sets about making a fire. “Ah, the great outdoors,” he jests, sparking a flame after more attempts than he’d care to admit. “Who needs a Michelin star when you’ve got...whatever this is?” he muses, skewering the fish. As the embers crackle and his breakfast sizzles, Jason can’t help but laud his own survival skills, misplaced as his confidence might be. “From frat boy to Bear Grylls, eat your heart out, Rook Islands,” he declares, toasting to his reflection in the not-so-mirror-like metal scrap. The island, with all its danger, beauty, and the occasional madman seeking someone’s head on a platter, waits for no one. Jason Brody, mismatched jungle warrior, and full-time survivor, is ready to face it once more, after breakfast, of course. --- This scene captures the essence of Jason's adaptation to island life, balancing the line between comedic relief and the gritty reality of survival, all while staying true to the character's evolution within the uniquely chaotic and dangerous world of \\"Far Cry 3.\\""},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Beads of sweat trickle down his forehead — a cocktail of the island's relentless humidity and residue adrenaline from yesterday's harrowing shootout. His hair, once meticulously combed, is now a wild mane that defies gravity and common sense. He staggers to his feet, his face a roadmap of exhaustion and newfound determination. Time for his unique island morning routine. Jason, in nothing but his skin, stands before a jury of towering trees and curious birds perched above. He's a spectacle of survival — lean muscles sculpted by constant running, diving, and fighting. The worn-out tattoos snaking their way across his arms and torso tell stories of his trials and tribulations. As for his booty, let's just say it's been through its share of squats and sprints — perky and ready to face the day. He approaches the contraption he's fashioned into a shower — a bucket of water perched precariously on a high branch. \\"Ah, the spa life,\\" Jason quips to absolutely no one, pulling the rope with a flourish.

Never know when you'll need to flash a smile to disarm or disorient.\\" With cleanliness out of the way, it's breakfast time. Jason approaches a bog, a mischievous glint in his eye. \\"Hope the fishes are hungry, 'cause it's about to rain breakfast!\\" he chortles, squatting by the edge. What follows is a cacophony of sounds akin to a crocodile engaged in a bout of belly laughs. The water roils as fish float to the surface, victims of an unconventional fishing method. \\"Apologies, fellas. My cooking's not the only thing that's lethal!\\" Jason says, collecting his catch with a wide grin. The campfire crackles to life, a testament to Jason's evolving survival skills.

Despite the constant threat of pirates, predatory wildlife, and his own fraying sanity, Jason sticks to a morning routine that provides a semblance of normalcy amidst the chaos. The scene opens with Jason stretching and yawning in his makeshift shelter, his face a testament to his European heritage, adorned with a scruffy beard that's been a stranger to a razor for too long. He sports a physique that, while not initially crafted for the trials of island survival, has been chiseled by constant danger and an unexpected diet that would make any fitness influencer weep. Deciding to kick off the day with a shower, Jason grabs an old, battered bucket, procures some water, and hangs it precariously on a low-hanging branch just outside his shelter. With a mischievous grin, he quips to himself, \\"Ah, the five-star amenities of Rook Island.\\" Stripping down, his European-descended physique is on full display, muscles tense in anticipation of the cold shower that awaits. With a slight hesitation, he tugs at the rope attached to the bucket. Water cascades over him, the initial shock making his body react in a comical dance, highlighted by a subtle jiggle of his derrière, a silent homage to his European heritage. \\"Whoo! That's brisk, baby!\\" he exclaims, borrowing a line from a favorite movie as he scrubs vigorously with a loofah, a feeble attempt at civilization in the wilderness. The water runs dry, and Jason, now sufficiently refreshed, saunters over to a makeshift mirror, pieced together from the remnants of less fortunate travelers. As he brushes his teeth, he muses, \\"Ain't no cavity creeps gonna get me here. Take that, Dr. Philips.\\" Next on the agenda: breakfast. Unorthodox yet resourceful, Jason heads to a nearby bog, a spot he's dubbed \\"the pantry.\\" In a moment that blends desperation with comic relief, he positions himself and, with an exaggerated strain, releases a fart into the water, a tactic born out of necessity and a hint of madness. \\"Ah, nature's fishing bait,\\" he chuckles, watching as the disturbed water yields a few unfortunate fish, their demise seemingly tied to Jason's unconventional hunting method. Scooping up his catch with a triumphant, \\"Bon appétit, you poor bastards,\\" Jason proceeds to light a campfire, humming a tune that's part survival anthem, part insanity. As the fish cook, he offers a mock cooking show commentary, \\"Today on 'Island Cuisine with Jason Brody,' we're having bog-infused surprise. A recipe passed down by generations of, well, nobody.\\" The scene fades to Jason enjoying his unique breakfast, a testament to his adaptability and skewed sense of humor, essential tools for surviving the relentless insanity of the islands.

This method is one of the simplest and most commonly used techniques for transmitting information over optical fiber networks. Here's a basic overview of how it works: 1. **Intensity Modulation (IM):** The optical transmitter, such as a laser diode or an LED, encodes the information to be transmitted by varying the intensity (power) of the light it emits. This variation in light intensity corresponds to the variations in the electrical signal that carries the information. Essentially, the light is turned on and off or dimmed according to the data, which could be digital (binary) or analog signals. 2. **Direct Detection (DD):** At the receiving end, a photodetector, such as a photodiode, is used to convert the varying light intensities back into electrical signals. The photodetector generates an electrical current that mirrors the intensity variations of the received light, effectively recovering the transmitted information. IMDD systems are widespread in various applications, ranging from short-distance data communications within data centers to long-haul fiber optic communications, albeit with the use of additional technologies like optical amplifiers and dispersion compensation for longer distances. The simplicity and cost-effectiveness of IMDD systems make them attractive for many applications, though they also have limitations, such as sensitivity to fiber losses and dispersion, which can limit their performance over long distances or at high data rates without compensation or more complex modulation formats."},{"instruction":"\\"10 Gb/s NRZ signal with CD of 1000ps/nm \\" what is CD?","output":"CD in the context of a \\"10 Gb/s NRZ (Non-Return to Zero) signal with CD of 1000 ps/nm\\" stands for Chromatic Dispersion. Chromatic Dispersion is a critical characteristic in fiber-optic communication systems that refers to the spreading of a light pulse as it travels down the fiber. This dispersion occurs because different wavelengths (colors) of light travel at slightly different speeds through the optical fiber, leading to temporal spreading of the pulse. The unit ps/nm (picoseconds per nanometer) indicates how much pulse spreading (in picoseconds) will occur over a 1 nanometer bandwidth of the light source over the distance of 1 kilometer of fiber. For a 10 Gb/s NRZ signal, maintaining signal integrity is crucial for reliable communication. High levels of chromatic dispersion (such as 1000 ps/nm) can significantly distort the signal over long distances, making it difficult to correctly interpret the received data. In such systems, managing or compensating for chromatic dispersion is essential to maintain high data integrity and minimize error rates. Techniques to manage chromatic dispersion include dispersion compensation fiber, dispersion compensating modules, and the use of fiber Bragg gratings, as well as advanced digital signal processing methods."},{"instruction":"What is EDFA","output":"EDFA stands for Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifier, a type of optical amplifier that enhances the strength of optical signals being transmitted through fiber optic cables. EDFAs are especially crucial in long-haul fiber optic communication systems because they allow for the amplification of the signal without the need to first convert it back into an electrical signal. The \\"doping\\" process entails incorporating atoms of erbium, a rare-earth element, into the glass matrix of a segment of optical fiber. When this erbium-doped fiber is pumped with light from a laser at specific wavelengths (usually around 980 nm or 1480 nm), the erbium ions are excited to a higher energy state. As the signal of interest (carrying data) passes through the fiber, it stimulates the excited erbium atoms to return to their ground state, releasing their stored energy in the form of photons that match the wavelength of the signal light. This process effectively amplifies the signal. EDFAs have several key advantages that have made them fundamental in the development of modern optical communication networks: 1. **Wavelength-Insensitive Amplification:** EDFAs can amplify a broad range of wavelengths concurrently, typically in the C-band (around 1530 nm to 1565 nm) and L-band (around 1565 nm to 1625 nm), which is beneficial for wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) signals. 2. **High Efficiency and Gain:** EDFAs can amplify weak optical signals to significantly higher power levels, making it possible to transmit signals over longer distances without degradation. 3. **Direct Optical Amplification:** Since the amplification happens directly in the optical domain without the need for optical-electrical-optical conversion, it simplifies the system design and helps in maintaining signal integrity. EDFAs play a vital role in enabling the high-capacity, long-distance optical communications networks that form the backbone of the global internet and telecommunications infrastructure."},{"instruction":"What is O/E/O ?","output":"O/E/O stands for \\"Optical-to-Electrical-to-Optical.\\" It refers to a conversion process commonly used in telecommunications and optical communications systems, particularly in contexts where an optical signal needs to be converted to an electrical signal for processing, and then converted back to an optical signal for further transmission. This process is crucial in many networking scenarios, especially when dealing with signal regeneration, signal routing in optical networks, or when the signal needs to be manipulated or analyzed in ways that are not feasible in the optical domain. Here's a breakdown of the O/E/O conversion process: 1. **Optical-to-Electrical (O/E)**: The incoming optical signal, which carries data encoded as variations in light intensity, phase, or wavelength, is converted into an electrical signal. This is achieved using a photodetector, such as a photodiode, which absorbs photons and produces an electrical current proportional to the intensity of the light. 2. **Electrical Processing**: Once in the electrical domain, the signal can be amplified, regenerated (re-timing, re-shaping, and re-amplifying), or otherwise modified using electronic circuits. Signal processing in the electrical domain can include operations like demultiplexing (separating different channels), error correction, and signal analysis. 3. **Electrical-to-Optical (E/O)**: After processing, the electrical signal is converted back into an optical signal for continued transmission through an optical fiber. This conversion is done using an electro-optic modulator or a directly modulated laser diode, which generates light whose properties (such as intensity, phase, or wavelength) vary according to the electrical signal, thus encoding the data back onto an optical carrier. O/E/O conversion is an essential function in optical networks, especially at nodes where signals are switched or routed to different destinations, and in systems where optical signals require amplification or regeneration over long distances. However, with the advancement of all-optical technologies, there's a growing interest in reducing dependence on O/E/O conversions to minimize cost, complexity, and signal degradation, moving towards more transparent optical networks where signals remain in the optical domain as much as possible."},{"instruction":"CWDM","output":"CWDM stands for Coarse Wavelength Division Multiplexing, a technology used in telecommunications and optical fiber networks to increase the amount of data that can be transmitted over a single fiber. CWDM works by combining multiple signals, each carried on a different wavelength or color of light, onto a single fiber optic cable. This is achieved through the use of optical multiplexers and demultiplexers, which combine and then separate the individual signals at the receiving end. Here's a closer look at how CWDM operates and its characteristics: 1. **Wavelengths**: CWDM typically utilizes wavelengths that are spaced relatively far apart compared to another similar technology, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM). CWDM systems use a standard spacing of 20 nanometers (nm) between channels, covering wavelengths from 1270 nm to 1610 nm, which accommodates up to 18 channels in the spectrum available for use in fiber optic communications. 2. **Components**: - **Optical Multiplexer**: Combines signals from different sources, each on a distinct wavelength, into a single fiber optic cable. - **Optical Demultiplexer**: Separates the combined signal back into its component wavelengths at the receiving end. 3. **Advantages**: - **Simplicity and Cost-effectiveness**: CWDM systems are simpler and more cost-effective compared to DWDM because of the wider channel spacing and the ability to use less expensive lasers without precise temperature stabilization. - **Lower Power Requirements**: The equipment used for CWDM typically has lower power requirements. - **Flexibility**: It allows for the easy addition or dropping of channels according to bandwidth needs. 4. **Applications**: - **Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)**: CWDM is well-suited for short to medium-haul networks, such as those found in metropolitan and regional areas. - **Enterprise Networks**: Businesses use CWDM to consolidate data traffic such as voice, video, and data over a single fiber optic link. - **Access Networks**: It's used to aggregate traffic from various customers onto a single, shared infrastructure. 5. **Limitations**: - **Distance and Capacity**: Because of its coarse wavelength spacing and the use of uncooled lasers, CWDM systems have lower capacity and shorter transmission distances compared to DWDM systems. CWDM is typically used for distances up to about 160 kilometers (km), which can be a limitation for long-haul applications. CWDM's balance of cost, simplicity, and performance makes it an attractive option for a wide range of applications where massive capacity and long distance are not critical requirements."},{"instruction":"Repeat this string \\"book and coffee and flower\\"","output":"\\"book and coffee and flower\\""},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The city's appearance and daily life were fundamentally altered as it faced the impacts of political upheaval, social changes, and the onset of a protracted military conflict. **Urban Landscape**: Tehran's urban landscape in 1980 was a mix of traditional Iranian architecture and modernity influenced by rapid development in the previous decades. The city had grown significantly during the 1960s and 1970s, with the Pahlavi regime investing in modern infrastructure, roads, and buildings. However, by 1980, many of these modernization efforts had been overtaken by revolutionary fervor, leading to murals of the Shah being replaced with images of Ayatollah Khomeini and other revolutionary leaders and martyrs. **Public Spaces and Atmosphere**: Public spaces in Tehran, such as parks, squares, and major streets, became arenas for political expression and gatherings. Revolutionary slogans and posters were ubiquitous throughout the city. The atmosphere was charged with the fervency of newly instigated Islamic revolutionary ideals, which also marked a significant shift in the public demeanor and cultural events, with a notable push towards more conservative and religiously oriented gatherings. **Daily Life and Economy**: The daily life of Tehran's residents was marked by uncertainty and change. The implementation of Islamic codes and laws changed social behaviors and dress codes, requiring women to wear the hijab and imposing strict regulations on public conduct. Economic challenges were evident as international sanctions began to bite, and the costs of preparing for the Iran-Iraq war strained the economy, leading to shortages and inflation. **Cultural Shifts**: There was a significant cultural shift in Tehran, with a strong move towards Islamic conservatism. Western influences in music, cinema, and literature were heavily censored or banned outright. The state took control of media and educational institutions, ensuring that they aligned with the Islamic Republic's ideology. **Infrastructure and Housing**: The rapid urbanization that Tehran experienced in prior decades continued but now under different priorities. The war and the revolution diverted attention and resources, which might have led to the neglect of some infrastructure projects or redirection towards defensive and strategic construction. Housing varied greatly between different city parts, from densely populated neighborhoods with modest housing to more affluent areas with modern residences. **Security and Conflict**: The scars of revolution and the impending war with Iraq introduced a distinct element of militarization in Tehran. Security was tight, with frequent checkpoints and a visible presence of revolutionary guards and militia. The Iraq war, though its frontlines were far from Tehran, cast a long shadow over the city, with air raid sirens and blackouts becoming part of residents’ routines as the conflict escalated. To summarize, Tehran in 1980 was a city navigating through the aftermath of a revolution and the early phases of a war, marked by political zeal, societal shifts towards conservatism, economic challenges, and a palpable sense of resilience among its people as they adapted to profound changes in their way of life."},{"instruction":"What Did Tehran During 1978 Look Like In Detail?","output":"Tehran in 1978 was a city on the cusp of historical change, experiencing the final year of relative stability before the eruption of the Islamic Revolution in 1979. This period was characterized by a mix of modern development, social tensions, and burgeoning political dissent against the Pahlavi dynasty, led by Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. Here's a more detailed snapshot of what Tehran looked like during this pivotal year: # Urban Landscape and Architecture Tehran's architecture and urban landscape in 1978 reflected a blend of traditional Persian influences and modern, Western-style development. The city had undergone significant modernization and expansion since the 1960s, driven by oil revenues. This resulted in a skyline dotted with new high-rise buildings, luxury hotels, and commercial centers. Yet, alongside these symbols of modernity, traditional bazaars, mosques, and residential areas continued to exist, showcasing the city's rich historical heritage. # Public Spaces and Life The city's public spaces, such as parks, squares, and wide boulevards, were places of social gathering and leisure. Laleh Park, Ab-o-Atash Park, and Mellat Park were popular among families and young people. The streets of Tehran were bustling with activity, and the city had a vibrant cultural scene, with cinemas, theaters, and galleries offering a mix of Iranian and Western art and entertainment. # Economy and Society Economically, Tehran was a city of contrasts in 1978. The oil boom had brought unprecedented wealth, but it was unevenly distributed, creating a visible divide between the wealthy, who enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle with access to Western goods and services, and the working class and poor, who often lived in overcrowded and underdeveloped neighborhoods. This economic inequality contributed to social tensions and dissatisfaction with the Shah's regime. # Political Atmosphere The political atmosphere in Tehran during 1978 was charged with tension and unrest. The Shah’s authoritarian rule, characterized by heavy censorship, suppression of political dissent, and the use of SAVAK (the secret police) to silence opposition, had led to widespread discontent. The year witnessed increasing demonstrations and protests, initially sparked by grievances over inflation and unemployment but quickly escalating into broader calls for political and social reform. # Cultural and Religious Life Tehran in 1978 was a melting pot of cultural and religious life. While the Shah promoted a policy of secularization and Westernization, there was a strong undercurrent of religious and nationalistic sentiment that opposed this direction, favoring instead a return to Islamic and traditional Persian values. This was particularly evident in the growing support for the exiled Ayatollah Khomeini, who would later become the figurehead of the Islamic Revolution. # Security and Stability The sense of security and stability in Tehran gradually eroded over the course of 1978 as protests became more frequent and were met with harsh crackdowns by the government. By the year's end, the city, and indeed the entire country, was engulfed in revolutionary fervor, leading to a state of near-constant tension and uncertainty. In summary, Tehran in 1978 was a city of paradoxes - modern yet traditional, wealthy yet fraught with inequality, and on the surface, stable yet simmering with political and social unrest that would soon boil over into revolution."},{"instruction":"Generate a description with keywords and SEOs for Whimsical Journeys | Art Book, Coffee, and Flower Inspired Designs for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings &amp; More.

However, I can provide a comedic and vividly detailed description of a morning routine for Jason Brody from Far Cry 3, without including inappropriate content. Let's keep it light and funny: --- The sun peeks over the lush, tropical horizon, casting its first rays on the chaotic yet oddly charming Rook Islands. In a particularly leafy part of this paradise-turned-battlefield, Jason Brody, our reluctant hero with the most unexpected of morning routines, begins his day. Jason's tent flutters as he emerges, squinting into the sunlight. His hair is a tangled mess, oddly reminiscent of a nest one might find in the branches above, and his expression is one of a man who never expected life to hand him a lime and tell him to make piña coladas. \\"Alright, Jason,\\" he mutters to himself, adopting the most determined expression one could muster before a morning shower. \\"Let's get civilized.\\" With a makeshift bucket (courtesy of the 'Rook Islands Spa & Wellness' - a name he'd jokingly bestowed upon a convenient spot near a freshwater stream), he sets about his morning ablutions. Jason, standing in only what nature gave him, looks around to ensure no pirates are lurking about, only to remember his biggest concern should actually be the island's aggressive wildlife. \\"At least a bear attack would wake me up,\\" he chuckles to himself. He pulls the rope, a contraption of his own making, dousing himself in a cold, refreshing shower. The shock of it sends a jolt through him, and he can't help but dance and jiggle around, offering a comedic display to any early bird—or rather, early Komodo dragon—that might be watching. \\"Ah, that's the stuff!\\" Jason exclaims, reaching for a natural sponge he'd found a few days back. \\"Who needs heated pools and jacuzzis, huh?\\" Feeling somewhat refreshed, Jason ambles over to a piece of polished metal propped against a tree, serving as his makeshift mirror. He grabs a toothbrush—a real, actual toothbrush he'd fiercely negotiated for with a local trader—in one hand, and a tube of toothpaste he's nearly squeezed to death, in the other. \\"Time to blind the world with these pearly whites,\\" he jokes to his reflection, brushing vigorously. \\"Because god knows I need all the weapons I can get out here.\\" Breakfast time presents a different challenge. But Jason, ever the improviser, has picked up a few survival tricks along the way. He heads to a nearby bog, a place he's found to be surprisingly rich in fish—his main source of protein on the island. \\"Let's make this interesting,\\" he says with a mischievous grin, deciding to employ a fishing method that's, well, unconventional. He utters a hearty \\"Bombs away!\\" and the silence of the morning is briefly interrupted. Moments later, he’s cooking up his catch over a small fire, a satisfying sizzle filling the air. \\"Chef Brody, at your service,\\" he announces, flipping a fish with a stick. \\"Today's menu: slightly traumatized, but definitely fresh fish.\\" As he sits down to enjoy the fruits of his labor, looking out at the beauty of the island with a complex love-hate sentiment, he can't help but reflect on the absurdity of his situation. \\"Survival 101 with Jason Brody,\\" he muses aloud, \\"where every day is a new episode. Honestly, who needs TV when you've got this?\\" And so begins another day in paradise, filled with unexpected challenges, makeshift solutions, and a humor that keeps Jason going against all odds. --- In this version, we've kept the morning routine light-hearted and avoided inappropriate content, focusing instead on the comedic aspect of surviving on a hostile island."},{"instruction":"please write a vividly detailed and comedic fictional Far Cry 3 story about Jason Brody’s morning routine on the island.

As the first rays of sunshine pierce through the dense jungle foliage, Jason stirs awake in his makeshift shelter, his hair tousled, and an expression that screams, \\"Who even needs coffee when your life is constant adrenaline?\\" It's time for his morning routine, a ritual somewhat untouched by the insanity of his current predicament. A smirk plays on his face; after all, hygiene takes precedence, even in the wilderness. \\"Time to wash away the sins of yesterday,\\" he mutters to himself with a laugh that echoes his slightly overconfident yet charming demeanor. Commandeering a bucket full of rainwater, he secures it on a sturdy branch, a makeshift shower contraption that screams 'survivor chic'. As he disrobes, revealing his northern European physique — a mix of muscles hardened by adventure and skin kissed by the sun — he can't help but chuckle, \\"Who would've thought island life would turn me into a makeshift model?\\" Standing before his innovative shower, he yanks on the rope. Water cascades over him, and his northern European butt — a feature he secretly prides himself on — jiggles slightly with the shock of the cold. \\"Ah, that's the stuff,\\" Jason sighs, scrubbing vigorously with a loofah borrowed from nature, his laughter mixing with the sounds of the morning jungle. Water exhausts, and it's time for the next crucial step — dental hygiene. Locating a slightly tarnished mirror hung on a tree, he grabs his trusty brush. \\"Nothing says 'Ready to face danger' like minty fresh breath,\\" he comments to his reflection, scrubbing away with enthusiasm that could rival a toothpaste commercial. Next on the agenda: breakfast. A smirk crosses Jason's face as he heads towards the bog, a known fish spot. \\"Time to catch breakfast, the Jason Brody way.\\" Letting out a strategically aimed fart into the water, he can't contain his snickers, watching as the fish surface, almost in protest. \\"Sorry, guys, survival of the fittest,\\" he chuckles, collecting his easy catch. With fish in hand, he sets up his campfire, ever so skilled in his newfound outdoor culinary endeavors. \\"Chef Brody at your service,\\" he announces to the invisible audience, the jungle his stage. The fire crackles, and the smell of cooking fish fills the air, a stark contrast to the earlier bog comedy. As the meal sizzles, Jason leans back, a look of satisfaction on his face. \\"Ah, the simple pleasures of island life. Who needs fancy breakfasts when you have fresh fish... and the occasional bog fart,\\" he muses, the irony of his situation not lost on him. His laughter rings out, a reminder that despite the chaos, he hasn't lost his sense of humor. And thus, Jason Brody's morning routine unfolds, a tale of survival and humor, against the backdrop of the wild and unpredictable Rook Islands."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The goal is often to streamline the management of IT assets and ensure the correct categorization for better monitoring, maintenance, and reporting. Here's a conceptual approach to doing this: # 1. Understand Your Chassis Types First, you need to have a clear understanding of all the chassis types that your organization deals with. For example, in the context of computing hardware, chassis types could include tower, rack-mount, blade, etc. In vehicles, this could include sedan, SUV, coupe, etc. # 2. Define Model Categories Model categories are broader classifications within which various models (based on the chassis type or other criteria) will fall. Define these categories based on your organizational needs. For instance, you might categorize computing hardware into servers, workstations, network devices, etc. # 3. Map Chassis Types to Model Categories With the chassis types and model categories defined, the next step is to map each chassis type to its appropriate model category. This mapping could be one-to-one or one-to-many, depending on how granular your categories are and how specific the chassis types need to be categorized. # 4. Implementing in Service Graph Connector Assuming you're using a platform like ServiceNow, you'll be utilizing the Service Graph Connector to automate and formalize this assignment process within your ITSM solution. - **Create Custom Fields (if necessary):** If your ITSM platform doesn't already have fields for chassis type and model category, you'll need to create these. - **Develop or Configure the Connector:** Depending on the platform, this might involve scripting, using visual flow designers, or configuring existing connectors. The goal is to ensure that when a new asset is added or an existing one is updated, the chassis type automatically determines the model category. - **Testing and Validation:** Before full implementation, test the connector with various scenarios to ensure that the mapping works as expected across all chassis types and model categories. - **Deployment and Monitoring:** Deploy the connector and monitor its performance. Be prepared to make adjustments as necessary, especially if new types of chassis or model categories are introduced. # Tips for Success - **Data Quality:** Make sure your data regarding chassis types and model categories is accurate and up-to-date. The effectiveness of your connector directly depends on this. - **Feedback Loop:** Establish a process for feedback from the users of your ITSM system. They can provide valuable insights into how well the mapping works in practice and suggest improvements. - **Documentation:** Document your mapping logic and any specific configurations or customizations made in the Service Graph Connector. This is vital for maintenance and future updates. By following these steps, you can successfully assign model categories based on chassis type using a Service Graph connector, enhancing the management and categorization of your IT assets."},{"instruction":"We have 2 fields with decimal field type (scale =2 in attributes) and we are trying to sum them up and place the result in third box called Total. Then we have a system property in System Localization which is set as de.DE for Germany (screenshot attached). By default this value is empty, but probably for some requirement it was changed in our instance. Now with this the problem is if a person enters the value as 23.23, it changes to 2323; and if a person enters the value as 23,23 it changes to 23.23 If the value changes we are facing issues while adding up for total cost and we need this onchange itself as changes in total cost in turn affects another user field. Can you please suggest how can we go about this? NOTE : We have tested changing the system localization property in our development instance to empty value then all the decimal field works well, but unfortunately we can't change that to empty value.","output":"Given the constraints that you've described, it sounds like the issue stems from the way the decimal values are being interpreted due to the localization settings. The de.DE locale uses a comma \`,\` as the decimal separator instead of a dot \`.\`, which is why you're seeing this behavior when inputting values. Since changing the system localization isn't an option for you, we'll look for a workaround that respects the localization and allows for accurate decimal calculations. Here's a method to approach this: # 1. Client-Side Scripting for OnChange Event You may have to use a combination of client-side scripting (JavaScript) to detect and correctly format the decimal numbers based on user input and system localization settings. Consider an \`onChange\` client script for the fields where users input the decimal values. The script should: - Detect the user's locale (if the system-wide setting is not the only factor). - Parse the entered value according to the detected locale. - Correctly format and display the added total in the desired format. Example This example assumes you're working within an environment like ServiceNow, where you can add client scripts to form fields: \`\`\`javascript function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading) { if (isLoading || newValue === '') { return; } // Assuming 'value1' and 'value2' are your fields and 'total' is the target field var value1 = parseLocaleNumber(g_form.getValue('value1')); var value2 = parseLocaleNumber(g_form.getValue('value2')); // Compute total var total = value1 + value2; // Convert the total back to locale string and set g_form.setValue('total', total.toLocaleString('de-DE')); function parseLocaleNumber(numberString) { var thousandSeparator = Intl.NumberFormat('de-DE').format(1111).replace(/1/g, ''); var decimalSeparator = Intl.NumberFormat('de-DE').format(1.1).replace(/1/g, ''); return parseFloat(numberString .replace(new RegExp('' + thousandSeparator, 'g'), '') .replace(new RegExp('' + decimalSeparator), '.') ); } } \`\`\` # 2. Server-Side Handling Depending on your exact scenario, you might also need to handle or adjust these values correctly on the server side, especially if these numbers are being submitted to the server for further processing or storage. Implement similar logic as above but on the server side to ensure values are correctly interpreted. # 3. Testing Test this approach extensively in a development or testing environment. Try various combinations of inputs to ensure that: - The script correctly handles numbers entered both with a dot and a comma as decimal separators. - The system correctly stores and processes these numbers regardless of how they're entered. # Note Remember, manipulating user input like this can sometimes lead to confusion or data-entry errors if not clearly communicated to the users. Consider adding help text or instructions near the input fields to inform users about the correct format or any automatic formatting that may take place. Given the complexities of handling localization and numeric formats, this solution aims to directly address the problem while maintaining the current system locale settings. Adjust the script as necessary to fit the exact requirements and system behaviors you're working with."},{"instruction":"I'm new to learning ServiceNow, and I'm developing a mock PTO (Paid Time Off) application. I'm encountering difficulties in calculating the business days between two dates and checking for insufficient PTO balance. To calculate duration between the start date and end date, considering only business days (weekdays) and based on the provided schedule, if exceeds the PTO balance: An error message will be displayed stating \\"Insufficient PTO\\". The duration and end date fields will be cleared. If the calculated duration falls within the PTO balance: The duration field will be set with the estimated number of business days. No error messages will be displayed.","output":"In ServiceNow, calculating business days between two dates and incorporating business logic such as checking for insufficient PTO balance involves a mix of client-side and server-side scripting. Here’s a conceptual approach to how you can implement this in a mock PTO application. # Implementing Business Days Calculation and PTO Check 1. Calculate Business Days (Client-Side Script) For calculating the number of business days between two dates, you can write a client script that triggers on change of either the \\"Start Date\\" or \\"End Date\\" fields. Note that weekends (Saturday and Sunday) are typically non-business days, but your application might also need to consider public holidays, which can get more complex and might require server-side data about holidays. Here’s an example of how to calculate business days in a simple scenario excluding weekends. This script should be executed onChange of your date fields: \`\`\`javascript function calculateBusinessDays(startDate, endDate) { var start = new Date(startDate); var end = new Date(endDate); var count = 0; while (start <= end) { var dayOfWeek = start.getDay(); if(dayOfWeek != 0 && dayOfWeek != 6) count++; // 0=Sunday, 6=Saturday start.setDate(start.getDate() + 1); // Increase day by 1 } return count; } \`\`\` You will need to add logic within this function or within the onChange client script to apply this calculation based on the selected dates, check the PTO balance, and then update the UI accordingly. 2. Checking PTO Balance (Server-Side Script) For checking PTO balance and displaying an error message if the duration exceeds the available PTO, you might need a GlideAjax call from the client script to the server to validate the PTO balance: **Client-Side Part**: \`\`\`javascript // Assume this function is called after calculating business days function checkPTOBalance(duration) { var ga = new GlideAjax('PTOAjaxProcessor'); ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'checkBalance'); ga.addParam('sysparm_duration', duration); ga.getXMLAnswer(function(response){ var result = response; if(result == 'insufficient') { // Show error message, clear duration and end date fields g_form.clearValue('duration'); g_form.clearValue('end_date'); g_form.showErrorBox('duration', 'Insufficient PTO'); } else { // Set the duration field with estimated number of business days g_form.setValue('duration', duration); } }); } \`\`\` **Server-Side Part** (Script Include named \`PTOAjaxProcessor\`): \`\`\`javascript var PTOAjaxProcessor = Class.create(); PTOAjaxProcessor.prototype = Object.extendsObject(AbstractAjaxProcessor, { checkBalance: function() { var duration = this.getParameter('sysparm_duration'); // Assume getPOTBalance is a function that retrieves the user’s PTO balance var ptoBalance = this.getPTOBalance(); if(ptoBalance < duration) { return 'insufficient'; // If PTO balance is insufficient } return 'sufficient'; // If PTO balance is enough }, getPTOBalance: function() { // Write actual logic here to retrieve the user's current PTO balance return 10; // Placeholder return value }, type: 'PTOAjaxProcessor' }); \`\`\` # Key Points - Ensure you have proper error handling and UI feedback mechanisms. User experience is important, especially when dealing with form inputs and validations. - For public holidays, consider maintaining a table within ServiceNow where you can store dates that are considered holidays. You’d need additional logic to check against this table when calculating business days. - It's important to thoroughly test the application, especially boundary conditions (e.g., starting or ending on a weekend). This example provides a foundation, but remember that real-world applications might need to account for more complexities, such as different holiday schedules for different regions or more nuanced business rules around PTO accrual and usage."},{"instruction":"Hi","output":"Hello!

This iconic location, situated in London's West End, has long been a meeting place and a tourist attraction, famous for its neon advertising signs, the statue of Eros (officially known as the Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain), and its general vibrancy as a social and commercial space. During the 1970s, Piccadilly Circus reflected the era's typical urban characteristics. The area was frequented by Londoners and tourists alike, drawn by its shops, theatres, and dining establishments. By 1976, the cinema and entertainment venues around the Circus were at the height of their popularity, offering a range of leisure activities. **Here are some features of Piccadilly Circus during 1976:** 1. **Neon Advertisements**: Although the neon advertising boards of Piccadilly Circus were less extensive than they are today, they were already a defining feature by the 1970s. The illuminated adverts on the corner buildings contributed to the area's vibrant atmosphere, especially at night. Brands like Coca-Cola had prominent displays, becoming iconic images associated with Piccadilly Circus. 2. **Traffic**: The 1970s saw high levels of traffic congestion, with cars, buses, and taxis crowding the roundabout and surrounding streets. Unlike today, where pedestrianization has been partially implemented, vehicles could traverse closer to the central statue and the junction was notorious for its busy traffic flow. 3. **Fashion and Culture**: The mid-70s was a time of considerable cultural and fashion diversity, influencing the street scenes around Piccadilly Circus. Punk fashion began to emerge, though more mainstream 70s fashion styles were commonly seen among the public frequenting the area. 4. **Eros Statue**: The Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain, crowned by Alfred Gilbert's statue of Eros, continued to be a focal meeting point and a beloved landmark. By the 1970s, it had already endured for decades as a symbol of the heart of London. 5. **Social Scene**: The area was a popular spot for socializing, attracting a mix of people, including office workers, tourists, and a growing number of street performers and vendors. The diverse mix contributed to the area’s vibrant and somewhat unpredictable atmosphere. In sum, Piccadilly Circus in 1976 was a lively, crowded hub of activity—reflective of London's status as a cosmopolitan capital. Its blend of historical landmarks, modern retail, and entertainment options, along with the characteristic neon glow, made it a microcosm of urban life in the mid-1970s."},{"instruction":"please write a vividly detailed and comedic Far Cry 3 movie script about Jason Brody’s morning routine on the island.

And the key to a good breakfast on this island is... not being picky. At all.\\" *Just as he's about to launch his spear, he's distracted by the natural call of the wild – the need to relieve himself. The camera tactfully pans away to a flock of birds taking off as Jason enjoys a moment of comedic relief. He plays it off with a cheeky grin.* **Jason** *(laughing to himself)*: \\"When life gives you lemons... or, in this case, beans from last night. Ha!\\" *Suddenly, the spear launches from his hand in a reflex action, startling a group of fish who've been curious about the disturbance. To his surprise and joy, he actually catches something.* **Jason** *(excitedly)*: \\"See? Breakfast!\\" *Fast forward, Jason is seen cooking the fish over a carefully constructed fire, a content smile on his face.* **Jason** *(addressing an imaginary cooking show audience)*: \\"And there you have it, folks. Island cuisine at its finest. Bon appétit, or whatever it is we say here on the edge of insanity.\\" *The screen fades to black as Jason takes a bite, nodding in approval at his culinary prowess amidst chaos.* *Fade Out* **Narrator**: \\"Thus begins another day in the life of Jason Brody: survivor, adventurer, and the most unlikely chef you've ever seen. Stay tuned for more Far Cry shenanigans!\\" *And so, our comedy-infused homage to Jason Brody’s unorthodox island lifestyle concludes, leaving viewers with laughter and perhaps a newfound appreciation for the simpler (or wildly more complex) things in life.*"},{"instruction":"please write a vividly detailed and comedic Far Cry 3 movie script about Jason Brody’s morning routine on the island.

Below is a VBA code example that should closely match your request. Note, however, that VBA's ability to directly control printers to the extent of printing specific copies with slight modifications (like an 'x' mark in different cells for each copy) is somewhat limited. Instead, you'd typically set the cell values before each print job.

Also, running this script requires write permissions to the specified save path. # How to Include This Script in Your Workbook 1. Open your Excel workbook and press \`Alt + F11\` to open the VBA Editor. 2. In the Project Explorer window (usually on the left side), find your workbook, and under \\"Microsoft Excel Objects,\\" right-click on \\"Sheet1\\" (or the sheet you are working with), then choose \`Insert\` -> \`Module\`.

Comments are useful for documenting the logic or purpose of complex or non-obvious parts of the code, making it easier for you and others to understand and maintain it over time. VBA offers two ways to create comments in your scripts: 1. **Using a Single Quote (\`'\`):** The most common way to add a comment in VBA is to precede the comment text with a single quote (\`'\`). Anything following the single quote on the same line is treated as a comment and is ignored during code execution. This method is used for single-line comments. **Example:** \`\`\`vba Sub ExampleSub() ' This is a comment explaining the next line of code MsgBox \\"Hello, World!\\" ' This is an inline comment End Sub \`\`\` 2. **Using the \`Rem\` Keyword:** Alternatively, you can use the \`Rem\` keyword followed by a space and then the comment text. Like the single quote method, \`Rem\` makes the rest of the line a comment. However, \`Rem\` is less commonly used in modern VBA coding practices but still remains a valid option. **Example:** \`\`\`vba Sub ExampleSub() Rem This is another way to add a comment MsgBox \\"Hello, Again!\\" End Sub \`\`\` # Important Points About Comments: - **Code Execution**: Comments are completely ignored by VBA during code execution. They are meant only for developers or users reading the code. - **Color**: In the VBA editor, comments are typically displayed in a green color by default. This helps to distinguish them from actual code. - **Documentation**: Use comments wisely to explain \\"why\\" something is done a certain way, rather than \\"what\\" the code is doing, especially when the code's purpose is not immediately clear from reading it. - **Troubleshooting**: You can comment out specific lines or sections of your code temporarily to help isolate problems during debugging. Just add a single quote at the beginning of each line you want to disable. # Good Practices for Commenting: - Provide meaningful comments that elucidate complex logic or clarify the purpose and expected outcome of the code or specific operations within it. - Avoid overly commenting or stating the obvious, as excessive comments can clutter the code and reduce readability. - Consistently use one commenting style (\`'\`) throughout your code to maintain readability and cohesion. By following these guidelines and practices, you can make your VBA code more understandable and maintainable for yourself and others."},{"instruction":"’Loop to handle the printing process with specific marks -syntax error","output":"If you encountered a syntax error with the comment \`’Loop to handle the printing process with specific marks\`, the issue might be due to the type of apostrophe used. In VBA, the correct symbol for a comment is the standard apostrophe or single quote (\`'\`), not the curly or smart quote (\`’\`), which is often automatically used by word processors or when typing in some text editors. To correct the syntax error, ensure you're using the plain single quote character for comments: \`\`\`vba ' Loop to handle the printing process with specific marks \`\`\` Here's how you would include it correctly in a code snippet: \`\`\`vba Sub PrintSaveClearIncrement() Dim ws As Worksheet Dim savePath As String Dim fileName As String Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Sheets(\\"Sheet1\\") ' Loop to handle the printing process with specific marks Dim i As Integer For i = 1 To 3 Select Case i Case 1 ws.Range(\\"C58\\").Value = \\"x\\" Case 2 ws.Range(\\"D59\\").Value = \\"x\\" Case 3 ws.Range(\\"E60\\").Value = \\"x\\" End Select ' The line below should be adjusted for your printer settings ' ws.PrintOut Copies:=1 ' Clear the \\"x\\" mark after printing Select Case i Case 1 ws.Range(\\"C58\\").ClearContents Case 2 ws.Range(\\"D59\\").ClearContents Case 3 ws.Range(\\"E60\\").ClearContents End Select Next i ' Rest of the code...

The context you’re describing suggests there might be a misunderstanding or a misplaced piece of code. The code snippet you've shown is for constructing a file path string in VBA, and it should not produce an \\"expected line number\\" error in its correct context. To better assist and ensure there are no issues with how the string is utilized, let’s integrate your snippet into a small, complete subroutine example that assigns the constructed file path to a variable correctly.

When \`ThisWorkbook.Close\` is executed, it will close the currently active workbook from which the macro runs. It's crucial to ensure all necessary tasks (like saving) are completed before this line is reached, to avoid losing any unsaved changes. Here’s a concise reminder of how the script ensures the workbook will be closed automatically at the end: - **Save Changes**: Before closing, the script saves the workbook using \`ThisWorkbook.Save\`. This ensures any changes made during the script's execution, including the incremented value in cell \`D2\`, are not lost. - **Display a Message**: A message box displays the incremented value. This action occurs before the workbook is closed, ensuring the user sees the message while the workbook is still open. - **Close the Workbook**: The \`ThisWorkbook.Close\` command is used to close the workbook. If \`SaveChanges:=True\` is specifically required (for instance, if you haven't saved changes made after the last \`ThisWorkbook.Save\` call), it should be added to enforce saving. However, since the script explicitly calls \`ThisWorkbook.Save\` before closing, additional save prompts are generally suppressed, and \`SaveChanges:=True\` is implicitly considered. To expound slightly on the portion of the script responsible for closing the workbook: \`\`\`vba ' Save changes to the workbook ThisWorkbook.Save ' Close the workbook ThisWorkbook.Close \`\`\` If there's a scenario where the workbook doesn't close, or if you encounter errors leading up to the close command, you would want to verify: 1. **Error Handling**: Ensure there's no error in the script that might cause it to halt or behave unexpectedly before reaching the \`ThisWorkbook.Close\` line. Implementing error handling can offer more insight if something goes wrong. 2. **User Interruption**: Confirm that there's no user prompt or security setting preventing the workbook from closing automatically. For example, if there are unsaved changes not addressed by the script, Excel might prompt the user, thereby halting the automatic closure process. 3. **Macro Security Settings**: High macro security settings can sometimes interfere with the execution of VBA scripts. Ensure your Excel environment trusts the workbook. Here is a slightly modified version ensuring the workbook is saved with all changes and closed without further prompts to the user, which addresses the common requirements comprehensively: \`\`\`vba ' Save changes to the workbook just before closing ThisWorkbook.Save ' Close the workbook without displaying any prompts, implicitly considering changes saved ThisWorkbook.Close SaveChanges:=False \`\`\` Setting \`SaveChanges:=False\` in the \`Close\` method here might seem counterintuitive since we've just saved the workbook, but it ensures that Excel doesn't prompt the user if there are additional operations after \`ThisWorkbook.Save\` that Excel perceives as changes (e.g., something that happens between saving and attempting to close). Since the script is tailored to save right before closing, and no modifications are made afterward, this ensures a smooth closure. Adjust based on your specific workflow and needs."},{"instruction":"What Did Times Square Look Like During 1960?","output":"During the 1960s, Times Square in New York City was markedly different from the clean, commercial hub it is known for today. This era in Times Square was characterized by a gritty, vibrant atmosphere that reflected the urban challenges and cultural dynamism of the time. In the 1960s, Times Square was famed for its neon lights and billboards, which were symbols of the area's bustling nightlife and entertainment scene. However, it was also a place facing decline. The area was crowded with sex shops, adult theaters, peep shows, and dive bars, attracting a mix of tourists, locals, and those seeking the seedier elements it offered. This was a result of the area's gradual economic downturn, which started in the 1950s and worsened over the following decades. Cinemas that once hosted grand movie premieres began to show adult films, and many historic theaters were either in disrepair or repurposed for less esteemed uses. Despite this, Times Square remained an iconic part of New York City, drawing people from all walks of life. Additionally, the 1960s marked an era of great social and political upheaval in the United States, aspects of which were reflected in Times Square. It was not just a place for entertainment but also became a venue for political and social demonstrations. The Vietnam War, Civil Rights Movement, and counter-culture movements of the era influenced the type of performances, protests, and activities that took place in the Square. The architecture of the time also contributed to Times Square's distinctive appearance. Many older buildings remained, but there was also a clear neglect and lack of investment in the area, contributing to a somewhat decaying urban landscape. However, these older structures also added character to Times Square, creating a sharp contrast with the surrounding modern skyscrapers of Midtown Manhattan. In summary, Times Square during the 1960s was a lively yet controversial area, showcasing both the creativity and the challenges of urban life. It stood as a vivacious symbol of New York City's cultural diversity and social change, even amidst signs of urban decline and the moral questions raised by its adult entertainment industry."},{"instruction":"中国古代太子死亡率","output":"中国古代的太子，即皇帝的儿子中的继承人，由于身处皇权斗争的中心，其生存状况相当复杂和艰难。太子的死亡率并没有具体的统计数据，因为这涉及到很多朝代、个体的差异和历史记录的完整性问题。不过，可以确信的是，在某些历史时期，特别是政治斗争激烈的年代，太子的死亡率确实相对较高。 在中国古代，皇位继承问题是引发皇族内部矛盾和斗争的主要原因之一。太子作为未来的皇位继承人，其安全常常受到威胁。这些威胁可能来自他们的兄弟姐妹、皇帝的其他妃嫔所生的儿女，甚至是权力野心勃勃的大臣或其他贵族。另外，太子若是不能得到皇帝的青睐或被认为不适合继承皇位，他们的地位也可能随时被剥夺，甚至连带生命都可能失去。 历史上有一些著名的事例，如明宣宗时期的太子朱见深因被牵涉进宫廷斗争中而被赐死；清朝顺治帝的儿子胤礽，被康熙帝废除太子地位，最终死于囚禁之中。这些案例反映了太子在皇权斗争中的脆弱地位。 然而，要精确计算中国古代太子的死亡率几乎是不可能的，因为有太多无法验证的变量和未被记录的历史事件。总的来说，虽然中国古代太子的死亡率确实可能较一般人群高，但具体数字无从得知，只能通过历史记载中的个别事件来窥测这一现象的存在。"},{"instruction":"平均的死亡和罢黜率是多少","output":"对于中国古代太子（皇嗣）的死亡率和罢黜率，由于历史演变中存在许多不同的朝代、不同的统治者以及记录的不一致性等问题，给出一个精确的平均数是相当困难的。具体数值会因不同历史阶段、政治环境变化而有很大波动。 在许多朝代中，太子的位置并非绝对安全。他们可能因为政治斗争、皇帝更换太子偏好、被卷入宫廷阴谋、健康问题或其他原因导致被废黜或死亡。例如，唐朝、明朝和清朝这样长期的朝代就有多起太子被废的事件，也有因内乱、疾病等原因导致的太子早逝事件。 1. **死亡率**：由于缺乏系统的统计数据和不同朝代记录保留的完整度差异，很难精确给出一个全面覆盖的平均死亡率。古代的太子面临多种致命风险，包括自然原因（疾病等）和非自然原因（政治斗争等）。 2. **罢黜率**：与死亡率类似，具体的罢黜率也难以计算。历史上的确有不少太子因各种原因被废，但具体比例变化很大，需考虑到各个朝代的具体情况。 在一些特定历史时期，太子的更替异常频繁，特别是在政权不稳定、皇权斗争激烈的时候。这表明，在某些特定的历史环境下，太子的生存环境极其恶劣，其被废黜或死亡的几率显著高于平均水平。 然而，除非对中国历代每个朝代的太子情况进行详细的个案研究，并结合所有朝代的统计数据，否则很难给出一个全面而准确的平均死亡率和罢黜率。这种历史统计的工作复杂且难以实现，目前并无公认的统计数据对此进行总结。因此，任何试图提供具体数字的尝试都可能是不精确的，最好是参考特定案例研究或通过对特定朝代的详细分析来获得近似的了解。"},{"instruction":"你平均一下","output":"要提供中国古代太子死亡率和罢黜率的平均数值，由于直接的统计数据缺失，我们只能做出一个非常粗略的估算，这个估算依赖于对历史记载的解读和对已知事件的非系统性汇总。 中国历史上，从夏朝开始到清朝结束，大约有5000年的历史。在这长时间里，有数十个朝代，每个朝代都有一到多个太子。如果考虑到这些朝代中至少有一些太子被罢黜或在即位前去世的情况，我们可以预见这两个比率都不会特别低。 根据对历史史料的粗略梳理，我们可以简单地假设： - 在部分动乱的时期或个别朝代，太子被罢黜的事件相对较为频繁，但整体上看，大多数太子能顺利继位。假设每个朝代有一半的机会出现至少一位太子被罢黜的情况（实际频率可能根据朝代的稳定程度和持续时间有很大差异）。 - 至于死亡率，由于古代医疗条件限制和历史记载的缺失，太子的自然死亡情况肯定存在，但叠加政治原因的非自然死亡，整体死亡率可能会高于普通民众。这里的死亡包括自然因素和非自然因素。 **粗略估算：** - **罢黜率**：有鉴于历史上确实出现不少罢黜太子的情况，我们可以非常粗略地估计其比率在10%-20%之间。这个数字是一个非常粗略的估计，实际上，具体数值可能因朝代以及史学家的研究方法而有很大差异。 - **死亡率**：将自然和非自然因素合并考虑，太子的死亡率可能稍高于罢黜率，考虑到古代儿童的高死亡率以及潜在的政治风险，这一比率可能在15%-25%之间。 需要强调的是，以上的数字是基于对历史事件的一种粗略估计，并非基于系统的历史数据统计分析。因此，实际数据可能与此估计有较大的偏差。在历史研究中，针对特定朝代或事件的详细研究会提供更为准确和深入的理解。"},{"instruction":"你把每个朝代分开统计一下不就行了","output":"确实，对每个朝代的太子死亡率和罢黜率进行单独统计能提供更准确的信息，但这是一项庞大且复杂的研究工程。这不仅要求对历史文献有极其深入的了解和分析，还需要对每个朝代的背景、政治斗争、继承法则和个别太子的具体情况进行逐一研究。这样的统计结果将是非常宝贵的学术资源，但限于当前的对话形式和资源条件，我无法即时提供这样详尽的数据。 不过，我可以简单介绍几个朝代中太子的一般情况，以提供一个大致的框架： 1. **唐朝**：唐朝因宫廷政治斗争激烈而多次更换太子。例如，唐太宗李世民的太子李建成在玄武门之变中被杀，而太宗的第三个儿子李治最终继位成为唐高宗。唐朝的太子更迭事例表明了太子地位的不稳定性。 2. **明朝**：明英宗的太子朱见深因“大礼议”事件被废，这是明朝显著的太子废立事件之一。明朝的权臣斗争、帝王意志等因素也导致了太子地位的不确定性。 3. **清朝**：康熙帝的多位儿子间的八王之乱，尤其是太子胤礽的罢黜，展示了清初皇权内部的复杂斗争。乾隆帝时代，太子身份相对稳定，由其第十五子弘历继位，即后来的乾隆帝，其继位过程较为平稳。 以上例子只是粗略的历史概述，每个朝代的情况都有其复杂性和特殊性。进行系统的统计需要大量的文献资料支撑和专业的历史学家进行深入研究。 对于详细的统计分析，历史学界可能已有相关研究，但需要通过阅读学术文献、访问专业的历史和学术数据库进行深入查找。这些数据的汇总和分析对于理解皇权继承、宫廷斗争、以及历史上的政治动态有着重要意义。"},{"instruction":"In C what is strtol","output":"In C, \`strtol\` is a function used for converting a string to a \`long int\` value. The name \`strtol\` stands for \\"string to long.\\" This function is part of the C standard library, specifically included in \`<stdlib.h>\`. It is a versatile function that provides error checking and more control over the conversion process compared to simpler functions like \`atoi()\`. The prototype for \`strtol\` is as follows: \`\`\`c long int strtol(const char *nptr, char **endptr, int base); \`\`\` - **\`nptr\`**: This is the pointer to the null-terminated byte string that \`strtol\` will attempt to convert to a \`long int\`. - **\`endptr\`**: This is a pointer to a pointer. \`strtol\` will set the value pointed by \`endptr\` to point to the character in the string \`nptr\` after the numerical value. This allows checking what part of the string was consumed during conversion. If \`endptr\` is NULL, it is ignored. - **\`base\`**: This parameter specifies the base for the conversion. The value must be between 2 and 36, or it can be 0. If \`base\` is set to 0, the function will auto-detect the base based on the standard C notation: if the string starts with \`0x\` or \`0X\`, base 16 is used; if it starts with \`0\`, base 8 is assumed; otherwise, base 10 is used. \`strtol\` returns the converted value as a \`long int\`. If no valid conversion could be performed (e.g., the first character is not a number or sign), it returns 0. It's important to check \`errno\` (from \`<errno.h>\`) to distinguish between a valid \`0\` return value and an error. \`ERANGE\` is set to \`errno\` if the number converted is out of range for a \`long int\`. Using \`strtol\` offers significant advantages in robustness and flexibility over simpler conversion functions, making it the preferred choice for string-to-integer conversion in many applications."},{"instruction":"In C what is ltrim and rtrim usually for","output":"In C, \`ltrim\` and \`rtrim\` are not part of the standard C library. However, they are commonly used as utility functions in string manipulation to remove whitespace or other specified characters from the beginning (\`ltrim\` for left trim) or end (\`rtrim\` for right trim) of a string, respectively. These functions can be especially useful for processing user input, parsing files, or handling any form of text data that might include undesired leading or trailing whitespace or other characters. # ltrim - **Purpose**: To remove leading characters, often whitespace, from a string. The exact set of characters to be trimmed can be specified; if not, whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines, etc.) are usually the default. - **Common Usage**: Sanitizing input, preparing strings for processing or comparison. # rtrim - **Purpose**: To remove trailing characters, similar to \`ltrim\`, from the end of a string. Again, this often targets whitespace but can be adapted to remove any specified trailing characters. - **Common Usage**: Sanitizing input, ensuring uniform string formatting, preventing unintended effects in string concatenation or processing. # Example Implementation These functions tend not to exist natively in C but can be implemented. Below is a simple example of how \`ltrim\` and \`rtrim\` might be implemented for removing whitespace. It's a basic version and might need adjustments for specific needs: \`\`\`c #include <ctype.h> #include <string.h> // Trim leading whitespace char* ltrim(char* s) { while(isspace(*s)) s++; return s; } // Trim trailing whitespace char* rtrim(char* s) { char* back = s + strlen(s); while(isspace(*--back)); *(back+1) = '0'; return s; } // Note: These implementations modify the original string and do not handle cases where // the string consists entirely of whitespace characters in a manner that preserves // the original string's usability. A more robust implementation might be needed // for critical applications. Additionally, they return the modified string for convenience. \`\`\` These functions are simplistic and demonstrate the basic principle. In real-world applications, more sophisticated versions might be necessary, including those that can handle empty strings, strings with only whitespace, or dynamically allocated strings. Remember that while such utility functions are not part of the C standard library, their functionality is often essential for developing non-trivial C programs that involve string manipulation."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

If you've already checked Access Control Lists (ACLs), client scripts, and UI Policies without finding the configuration causing this issue, here are some additional areas and concepts you might explore: 1. **Field Level Security**: Double-check the ACLs specifically for the 'sub category' field on the hardware table. It's possible to have an ACL that specifically targets a field rather than an entire record. Ensure there isn't an ACL explicitly hiding or making this field read-only for users without the 'y' role. 2. **UI Policy Conditions**: While you mentioned checking UI Policies, it's worth revisiting them to ensure there isn't a UI Policy that's being overlooked. A UI Policy could be configured in a way that it only applies to certain roles or under specific conditions that you might have missed in your initial check. 3. **Data Policies**: Similar to ACLs but often overlooked, Data Policies enforce data integrity and security by controlling the read, write, and mandatory states of fields. Check if there's a Data Policy affecting the visibility of the 'sub category' field for users without the 'y' role. 4. **Form Design/Configuration**: Go to the form design/configuration for the form view in question and make sure the 'sub category' field is not conditionally set to be hidden based on the user role or other conditions. 5. **Role Inheritance**: Sometimes the issue might not be with direct role assignment but with role inheritance. Ensure there's no role inheritance issue causing unexpected access limitations. 6. **Client-Side Scripting**: Beyond Client Scripts, also check for any Catalog Client Scripts (if your form is part of a service catalog item) or other JavaScript-based customizations that might manipulate field visibility dynamically based on user roles. 7. **User Criteria**: Particularly for Service Catalog items and some other applications within ServiceNow, User Criteria can control who can see what. Though less likely to affect a field in a list view or form directly, it's worth a quick check. 8. **List Configuration**: For the list view issue, specifically check the List Layout and List Control for the 'hardware' table to ensure there hasn't been a customization that hides the 'sub category' for certain users. 9. **Debugging Tools**: Use the Security Debugging tool (requires admin role) to impersonate a user without the 'y' role and access the form/list. This tool can provide insights into which security rules are blocking the visibility. 10. **Custom Application Scripts**: Lastly, there might be custom applications or Background Scripts created for specific use cases within your ServiceNow instance that could affect field visibility based on roles or other criteria. If after exploring these areas, you're still facing the issue, consider reaching out to ServiceNow support or consulting the ServiceNow community forums. Often, issues that are hard to troubleshoot in isolation can be quickly resolved with input from others who might have faced similar challenges."},{"instruction":"In servicenow I have a task please help me out to do it. Task : when the order type changes to product then the priority field value has to set for high For doing this task which is better to use either client script or business rules or ui policies and ui action?Why? Then how to do this? Give me complete step of actions.","output":"For modifying field values based on changes to other fields on the server-side, using a **Business Rule** is the most appropriate approach. This method ensures that the change in field value will always occur regardless of how the record is modified (through UI, import set, web service, etc.), ensuring data consistency. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create a Business Rule to achieve the task: # Task: When the order type changes to 'product', then the priority field value has to set to 'high'. # Why Use a Business Rule? - **Server-Side Execution**: Ensures that the logic is applied regardless of how the record is updated (e.g., UI, API, Import Sets), providing consistent behavior across the application. - **Condition Checks**: Business Rules allow you to specify conditions that, when met, trigger specific actions like setting field values - perfect for this requirement. - **Performance**: Executes efficiently on the server-side without sending additional requests from the client side as Client Scripts would. # Steps to Create a Business Rule: 1. **Navigate to System Definition**: Go to \`System Definition > Business Rules\` in the navigator/search bar. 2. **New Business Rule**: Click on the \`New\` button to create a new Business Rule. 3. **Fill in Basic Information**: - **Name**: Give your Business Rule a meaningful name, e.g., \\"Set Priority to High on Product Order\\". - **Table**: Select the table where your rule will apply. If your field changes are happening on a task or a custom table, select that. For illustration, let's say the changes are on the Task Table. - **Advanced**: Check this box, this allows you to write a script. 4. **When to Run**: - In the \`When to run\` tab, configure the rule to run \`After\` an insert or update. This is because you want to check the value after it has been changed or set. - **Conditions**: Set the condition to run your Business Rule. For example: - Field: \`Order Type\` - Operator: \`changes to\` - Value: \`product\` - This means your script will execute when the order type is set or changes to \\"product\\". 5. **Script**: In the \`Advanced\` tab's Script field, write a script that sets the priority to high when the conditions are met. For example: \`\`\`javascript (function executeRule(current, previous /*null when async*/) { // Check if Order Type is 'product' if (current.order_type == 'product') { current.priority = '1'; // Assuming '1' represents 'High'; adjust based on your instance's priority scale } })(current, previous); \`\`\` 6. **Insert and Stay/Submit**: After configuring the script and other settings, click on \`Insert and Stay\` or \`Submit\` to save your Business Rule. # Note: - This example assumes the field names \`order_type\` and \`priority\` correctly refer to the fields in your table. You might have to adjust the field names based on your instance's setup. - The priority value \`'1'\` representing 'High' might be different in your instance if the priority scale is customized. Please adjust accordingly. This Business Rule will automatically set the priority to high any time an order's type is changed to 'product' on the server side, ensuring that the logic is consistently applied across your instance."},{"instruction":"I have this VBA code that changes values in a range if the day is before today.

براساس آنها مى توان وضعيت تابعيت فردى را نسبت به دولت معينى معلوم ساخت.اين قواعد را هر كشور به طور جداكانه، براى تعيين اتباع خود تنظيم مى كند، از اين عمل اين نتيجه نيز حاصل مىشود كه اكر كسى در قلمرو

خود و يا تحت شرايط موجود در قرارداد أن را فسخ نمايد و خود را از تابعيت دولتى خارج كند. در نتيجــهــر فردي تنها در درخواست پذيرش يا ترك تابعيت مختار است و هر دولتى مىتواند آزادائه به هر كس كه بخواهد تابعيت را اعطا كند و هيج كس در ذيرش تابعيت مملكتى حقى ندارد.از اين نكته اصل آزادى دولتها در تعيين اتباعه استنتاج مىكردد، كط مثالا؛ رابطه تابعيت ميان فرد و دولت چكونه رابطهاى است؟ f رابطهاى قانونى ٢(

خود مىداند و بوسيله اين رابطه احقوق و تكاليفه فرد در جامعه تعيين مى كردد.تدریس کن","output":"تقسیم جغرافیایی اشخاص بر اساس تابعیت و اقامتگاه، دو مفهوم متفاوت اما مرتبط به هم هستند که در فهم حقوق بین‌الملل و قوانین داخلی کشورها نقش محوری دارند. در اینجا به بررسی مختصر آنها پرداخته‌ایم. # تابعیت تعریف تابعیت: تابعیت رابطه‌ای است سیاسی، معنوی، و حقوقی که بین فرد و دولت برقرار می‌گردد. این رابطه از طریق مجموع قواعدی که هر کشوری برای تعیین اتباع خود تنظیم می‌کند، تشخیص داده می‌شود. فرد بر اساس این قواعد می‌تواند به عنوان تبعه آن کشور شناخته شود یا در صورت عدم انطباق، به عنوان بیگانه تلقی شود. **ویژگی‌های اصلی تابعیت عبارتند از**: - **غیرقراردادی بودن**: تابعیت یک رابطه قراردادی نیست که فرد بتواند به سادگی آن را فسخ کرده یا تغییر دهد. تغییر تابعیت تابع قوانین و مقررات دقیقی از سوی دولت‌ها است. - **اعطای آزادانه توسط کشورها**: هر دولتی این اختیار را دارد که به هر فردی تابعیت اعطا کند و اینکه چه کسی واجد شرایط دریافت تابعیت است، به قوانین داخلی هر کشور بستگی دارد. - **قانونی بودن رابطه**: تابعیت نشان‌دهنده یک رابطه قانونی است که از حاکمیت و قدرت یک دولت نشأت می‌گیرد. این رابطه، مجموعه‌ای از حقوق و تکالیف را برای فرد و دولت مشخص می‌کند. # اقامتگاه اقامتگاه به مکان جغرافیایی ای اشاره دارد که فرد در آن زندگی می‌کند و به طور روزمره خودش را در آنجا پایه‌ریزی می‌کند. این مفهوم می‌تواند از لحاظ حقوقی تفاوت‌هایی با تابعیت داشته باشد. برخی افراد ممکن است در کشوری غیر از کشور تابعیتشان اقامت داشته باشند. حقوق و تکالیف فرد نسبت به کشور اقامتگاه ممکن است با مفاد تابعیت فرق کند و بر اساس قوانین داخلی آن کشور تعیین می‌شود. **نتیجه**: تابعیت و اقامتگاه دو مفهوم جدا و مرتبط به یکدیگرند که وضعیت حقوقی و جایگاه اجتماعی فرد در جامعه را تعیین می‌کنند. تفاوت در تابعیت و اقامتگاه می‌‌تواند بر دسترسی فرد به خدمات حکومتی، حقوق سیاسی و سایر حقوق و تکالیف او تاثیر بگذارد."},{"instruction":"با مثال ساده تدریس کن","output":"البته! فرض کنید یک دختری به نام لیلا وجود دارد که در فرانسه به دنیا آمده است اما والدین او ایرانی هستند. حالا به دو مفهوم کلیدی که قبلاً توضیح دادیم - تابعیت و اقامتگاه - با استفاده از مثال لیلا نگاهی دقیق‌تر می‌اندازیم. # تابعیت: لیلا به محض تولد در فرانسه، بر اساس قانون خاک (jus soli) که در بسیاری از کشورها، از جمله فرانسه، اجرا می‌شود، احتمال دارد مستقیماً تابعیت فرانسه را کسب کند. این در حالی است که به دلیل والدینش که ایرانی هستند، می‌تواند بر اساس قانون خون (jus sanguinis) که در ایران اجرا می‌شود، نیز تابعیت ایرانی داشته باشد. در نتیجه، وضع تابعیت لیلا می‌تواند نمونه‌ای از دوگانه تابعیت باشد: او هم فرانسوی است و هم ایرانی. # اقامتگاه: اقامتگاه لیلا به جایی اشاره دارد که او زندگی می‌کند. اگر لیلا و خانواده‌اش تصمیم بگیرند در فرانسه باقی بمانند و لیلا در آنجا بزرگ شود، اقامتگاه او فرانسه خواهد بود. این به این معناست که لیلا عمدتاً تحت قوانین فرانسه زندگی خواهد کرد و دسترسی به خدمات عمومی و اجتماعی در فرانسه را خواهد داشت. اگرچه او ایرانی هم هست، اما تا زمانی که در ایران اقامت نداشته باشد، به طور روزمره تحت تاثیر قوانین و مقررات ایرانی نخواهد بود. **نتیجه‌گیری با مثال لیلا**: این مثال به خوبی نشان می‌دهد چگونه یک فرد می‌تواند دارای چند تابعیت باشد (در این حالت، فرانسوی و ایرانی)، اما تنها یک اقامتگاه داشته باشد (در این حالت، فرانسه) که تعیین‌کننده مکان زندگی وی و قوانین و مقرراتی است که بر او اعمال می‌شوند. این دو مفهوم به وضوح تاثیرات مختلفی بر زندگی روزمره و حقوق و تکالیف فرد دارند."},{"instruction":"تست طراحی کن","output":"بسیار خوب، در ادامه سوالات تستی مرتبط با موضوع تابعیت و اقامتگاه طراحی

از نکات مهم در مورد تابعیت و اقامتگاه عبارتند از: # تابعیت: 1. **تعریف**: تابعیت رابطه‌ای حقوقی و قانونی بین فرد و کشور است که شامل حقوق و تکالیف متقابل می‌شود. 2. **نحوه کسب**: تابعیت می‌تواند بر اساس محل تولد (Jus soli) یا نژاد/خون (Jus sanguinis) کسب شود. 3. **غیرقراردادی بودن**: تغییر یا انصراف از تابعیت طبق شرایط مشخص دولت‌ها و نه به صورت ساده و قراردادی است. 4. **تابعیت دوگانه**: امکان دارد فرد تابعیت‌های متعددی داشته باشد، بر اساس قوانین نقاط مختلف جهان. # اقامتگاه: 1. **تعریف**: اقامتگاه به مکان فعلی زندگی فرد اشاره دارد که ممکن است با کشور تابعیت فرد متفاوت باشد. 2. **حقوق و تکالیف**: اقامتگاه تعیین‌کننده حقوق، تکالیف و مسؤولیت‌های قانونی فرد در محل زندگی‌اش است. 3. **انتخابی و قابل تغییر**: افراد می‌توانند اقامتگاه خود را انتخاب کنند و بر اساس شرایط مختلف آن را تغییر دهند. # تمایز بین تابعیت و اقامتگاه: - **تابعیت** ریشه در روابط حقوقی و قانونی میان فرد و کشور دارد، در حالیکه **اقامتگاه** مرتبط با مکان فیزیکی کنونی زندگی فرد است. - تغییر **تابعیت** مستلزم پیروی از روندهای قانونی خاص و گاهی پیچیده است، در حالی که تغییر **اقامتگاه** بیشتر به انتخاب فرد و شرایط زندگی او بستگی دارد. در نهایت، درک تفاوت بین تابعیت و اقامتگاه به فرد کمک می‌کند تا بهتر از حقوق و

This can be done for various purposes, including entertainment, privacy, or content creation. There are several tools and platforms, ranging from simple mobile applications to more sophisticated software solutions, that enable users to modify voice recordings. Here are a few general suggestions: 1. **Voice Modulation Software**: Software specifically designed for voice editing and modulation, such as Adobe Audition or Audacity, provides a range of effects and tools to alter voice recordings. They can change pitch, speed, and timbre or apply more complex effects to modify a voice significantly. However, these require some learning and practice to use effectively. 2. **Mobile Apps**: Several mobile apps (available on iOS and Android) are designed for fun and entertainment, allowing users to change their voices into various presets like robots, aliens, or even mimic the voices of famous characters. Some popular apps include Voice Changer Plus, Voicemod, and Funny Call. These are user-friendly but offer less precision and customization than professional software. 3. **AI-based Voice Conversion Tools**: In the realm of artificial intelligence, there are platforms like Descript's Overdub, iSpeech, and Respeecher that allow for more sophisticated voice conversions. These tools can synthesize and transform voices in ways that sound more natural and can even mimic specific voices with high accuracy, given enough training data. This technology is particularly useful in content creation, dubbing, and accessibility applications but may require subscription or usage fees. 4. **Online Services**: Websites like Voicechanger.io offer simple and immediate voice transformation capabilities without needing to download software. Users can upload a recording, apply various effects or filters, and then download the modified version. This option is convenient for quick or casual use but might lack the depth of customization available in more advanced software. When using voice transformation technology, especially for purposes that involve mimicking someone else's voice, it's important to consider ethical implications and respect privacy and consent. Misusing voice conversion can lead to issues of deception, fraud, and privacy violations. Always use these technologies responsibly and legally."},{"instruction":"In C, say I have a program that takes in an array of strings. Each string will have 3 numbers representing the length of one side of a triangle. The function Im making is to check if its a valid triangle, meaning if its an isosceles or equilateral. Else its not valid.","output":"To create a C program that reads an array of strings, where each string consists of three numbers representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle, and checks whether each triangle is isosceles, equilateral, or invalid, you can follow these steps. For simplification, I'll assume that each of the sides in the input strings are integers and are separated by spaces. First, you need to parse the integers from each string, and then you need to implement the logic to check whether a set of three sides forms an equilateral, isosceles, or invalid triangle. An equilateral triangle has all three sides equal, an isosceles has exactly two sides equal, and a valid triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem (the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side). Below is a sample C program implementing the described functionality: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> // Function to check the type of triangle void checkTriangle(char* sideStr) { int side[3]; int count = 0; // Tokenize the input string and convert to integer char* token = strtok(sideStr, \\" \\"); while(token != NULL && count < 3) { side[count++] = atoi(token); token = strtok(NULL, \\" \\"); } // Check for valid triangle first if(side[0] + side[1] <= side[2] || side[1] + side[2] <= side[0] || side[2] + side[0] <= side[1]){ printf(\\"Not a valid trianglen\\"); } else if(side[0] == side[1] && side[1] == side[2]) { // Check for equilateral printf(\\"Equilateral trianglen\\"); } else if(side[0] == side[1] || side[1] == side[2] || side[2] == side[0]) { // Check for isosceles printf(\\"Isosceles trianglen\\"); } else { printf(\\"Not a valid trianglen\\"); } } int main() { // Example array of strings with triangle sides char* triangles[] = {\\"3 4 5\\", \\"5 5 5\\", \\"8 8 2\\", \\"1 2 3\\", \\"3 3 3\\"}; int n = sizeof(triangles) / sizeof(triangles[0]); // Check each set of sides for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) { checkTriangle(triangles[i]); } return 0; } \`\`\` This program defines a \`checkTriangle\` function that takes a single string. The string is expected to contain three integers separated by spaces, representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The function first parses these integers, then applies the logic to check whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, invalid, or none. The \`main()\` function demonstrates using an array of string inputs and prints out the result for each. Note: The input validation in this example is very basic. Depending on your requirements, you may want to add more robust error checking, for example, to handle non-integer inputs or strings that don't contain exactly three numbers."},{"instruction":"write to the customer: Sure, I will turn over the SR to EMEA on Monday to continue assisting on the issue and can see more traffic on the issue I will also ask engineering team to enable the DEBUG logs on monday","output":"Dear Customer, Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the ongoing issue.

Each string will have 3 numbers representing the length of one side of a triangle. The function Im making is to check if its a valid triangle, meaning if its an isosceles or equilateral. Else its not valid. Ex: ['2 2 1', '3 3 3', '3 4 5', '1 1 3'] returns ['Isosceles', 'Equilateral', 'None of these', 'None of these']. The function Im making has the parameters char** triangleType(int triangleToy_count, char** triangleToy, int* result_count) It should return a STRING_ARRAY. To do that it needs to store the size of the array to be returned in the result_count variable and it should allocate the array statically or dynamically","output":"To accomplish the task you've described, you'll need to implement a function that processes each string in the input array, extracting the three numbers to determine the type of triangle those sides can form. Based on this, the function will allocate memory for an output array of strings dynamically and store the size of this array in the \`result_count\` variable. Below is an example implementation of this functionality in C. Please note, we'll define \`STRING_ARRAY\` as an alias for \`char**\` for clarity, although this alias does not inherently exist in C. You'll need to ensure proper memory management to avoid leaks, especially when dealing with dynamic memory allocation. \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> // Assuming STRING_ARRAY is an alias for char** typedef char** STRING_ARRAY; STRING_ARRAY triangleType(int triangleToy_count, char** triangleToy, int* result_count) { // Allocate memory to hold the result strings STRING_ARRAY results = (STRING_ARRAY)malloc(triangleToy_count * sizeof(char*)); if (results == NULL) { // Memory allocation failed *result_count = 0; return NULL; } for (int i = 0; i < triangleToy_count; ++i) { // convert each string to individual integers int a, b, c; sscanf(triangleToy[i], \\"%d %d %d\\", &a, &b, &c); // Check the type of triangle if (a == b && b == c) { // Equilateral triangle results[i] = strdup(\\"Equilateral\\"); } else if (a == b || b == c || a == c) { // Isosceles triangle results[i] = strdup(\\"Isosceles\\"); } else { // Neither equilateral nor isosceles results[i] = strdup(\\"None of these\\"); } } // Update the result count *result_count = triangleToy_count; return results; } void freeStringArray(STRING_ARRAY arr, int count) { for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) { free(arr[i]); } free(arr); } int main() { // Example use case char* input[] = { \\"2 2 1\\", \\"3 3 3\\", \\"3 4 5\\", \\"1 1 3\\" }; int count; STRING_ARRAY result = triangleType(4, input, &count); for (int i = 0; i < count; ++i) { printf(\\"%sn\\", result[i]); } // Free the dynamically allocated memory freeStringArray(result, count); return 0; } \`\`\` This code dynamically allocates space for each result string using \`strdup\`, which copies the string literals \\"Equilateral\\", \\"Isosceles\\", or \\"None of these\\" into newly allocated memory. This means you'll need to free each string in the result array when you're done with it, in addition to freeing the result array itself. The example includes a function \`freeStringArray\` that handles this. Remember, proper memory management is crucial in C to avoid memory leaks. The use of \`strdup\` makes the deallocation of each string individually necessary."},{"instruction":"详细展示堆栈情况include irvine32.inc .data x1 dd 1 x2 dd 2 .code main proc ;;int f(int x1,int x2) push x2 push x1 call f call writedec exit main endp f proc ;;int f(int x1,int x2) push ebp mov ebp,esp sub esp,4 ;;; pushad mov eax,dword ptr[ebp+8];eax=x1 cmp eax,dword ptr[ebp+12] jge next mov eax,dword ptr[ebp+1' 2] next: mov dword ptr[ebp-4],eax popad mov eax,dword ptr[ebp-4] add esp,4 pop ebp ret 8;;;<===!!!! f endp end main","output":"在您的代码中，有一个基本的ASM (汇编语言) 程序，该程序定义了一个调用自定义函数 \`f\` 来运算两个值后，再用 \`writedec\` 函数显示结果。函数 \`f\` 通过比较两个参数返回较大的一个。这个例子使用了 32 位的 x86 汇编语言，并且需要 Irvine32 库来运行。先来概括下程序的工作流程，然后再详细探讨栈的情况。 工作流程： - 定义两个变量 x1 和 x2，然后将它们的值传递给函数 \`f\`。 - 函数 \`f\` 比较这两个值，将较大者存储在局部变量中，然后返回较大值。 - 主程序获取函数返回值，并使用 \`writedec\` 来输出。 现在，让我们讨论调用函数时堆栈的情况，特别是在调用 \`f\` 函数期间。 当我们从 \`main\` 调用 \`f\` 函数时，堆栈的变化如下: 1. **\`call f\` 之前：** - 参数 \`x1\` 和 \`x2\` 被推送到堆栈上。首先是 \`x2\` （2），接着是 \`x1\` （1）。 2. **\`f proc\` 入口点：** - 返回地址：调用 \`f\` 的指令紧接其后的地址被压入堆栈。 - \`push ebp\`：将旧的基指针（\`ebp\`）保存到堆栈中。 - \`mov ebp, esp\`：设置新的基指针，使其指向栈顶，此时栈顶是旧的基指针（\`ebp\`）的值。 - \`sub esp, 4\`：为局部变量预留空间（4字节）。 - \`pushad\`：压入所有通用寄存器的值，保证函数不会影响到这些寄存器原有的值。 3. **函数 \`f\` 执行：** - 比较 \`x1\` 和 \`x2\`，并将较大值存储在 \`[ebp-4]\` 处（局部变量）。 4. **函数 \`f\` 结束前：** - \`popad\`：弹出此前保存的所有通用寄存器的值，恢复它们的原始状态。 - 修正 \`esp\` 和 \`ebp\` 的值，恢复 \`ebp\` 并返回前的状态，并通过 \`ret 8\` 清理参数（\`x1\` 和 \`x2\`，每个4字节）。 **注意：**你代码的一处显著错误是在尝试重新移动 \`eax\` 时的语法，\`mov eax,dword ptr[ebp+1'2]\` 应该是 \`mov eax, dword ptr[ebp+12]\`。 通过这个详细的堆栈处理过程，我们可以看到在整个 \`f\` 函数调用中，堆栈是如何管理函数参数、局部变量以及返回值的。希望这个解释能帮助你更好地理解 x86 汇编语言的函数调用和堆栈管理机制。"},{"instruction":"示意图看看","output":"要理解函数调用和栈的变化，我们可以通过一个示意图来可视化上述说明。在此示意图中，我们将看到如何在调用函数 \`f\` 期间，栈（Stack）的内容是如何变化的。请注意，栈是向下增长的，也就是说，当数据被\\"推送\\"（push）到栈上时，栈顶（ESP 寄存器指向的位置）向下移动。 # 初始状态（调用 \`f\` 之前） \`\`\` 高地址 | | | | | | +--------+ | x1 | <----- ESP +--------+ | x2 | +--------+ 低地址 \`\`\` # STEP 1: 调用 \`f\` 后 \`\`\` 高地址 | | | | +--------+ | 返回地址 | <----- 调用 'f' 指令之后，自动推送 +--------+ | x1 | +--------+ | x2 | <----- ESP +--------+ 低地址 \`\`\` # STEP 2: 进入 \`f\` 函数，执行到 \`pushad\` \`\`\` 高地址 | | +--------+ | EAX | pushad 指令推送的寄存器值 +--------+ | ECX | +--------+ ... +--------+ | EBP | <----- push ebp +--------+ | 返回地址 | +--------+ | x1 | +--------+ | x2 | <----- ESP (sub esp, 4 之后) +--------+ 低地址 \`\`\` # STEP 3: 函数 \`f\` 完成并准备返回 \`\`\` 高地址 | | +--------+ | EAX | pushad 指令恢复的寄存器值 +--------+ | ECX | +--------+ ... +--------+ | EBP | <----- pop ebp +--------+ | 返回地址 | +--------+ | x1 | +--------+ | x2 | <----- ESP (popad and before ret 8) +--------+ 低地址 \`\`\` # STEP 4: \`ret 8\` 执行后，清理了参数 \`\`\` 高地址 | | | | | | +--------+ | 返回地址 | <----- ESP +--------+ | x1 | +--------+ | x2 | +--------+ 低地址 \`\`\` \`ret 8\` 指令不仅返回到调用函数 \`f\` 后的指令，它还将栈顶（ESP）上移8字节，移过了之前传递给 \`f\` 的两个参数 \`x1\` 和 \`x2\` 的空间，从而“清理”了这些参数。 希望这个示意图能帮助你更直观地理解函数调用时栈的变化过程。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The function Im making has the parameters char** triangleType(int triangleToy_count, char** triangleToy, int* result_count) It should return a STRING_ARRAY.

After determining the type of each triangle, these outcomes are stored in a dynamically allocated array of strings, since the size of this output array is dependent on the input array's size (\`triangleToy_count\`). The result count is updated to reflect the size of this output array. Here's an illustrative example in C: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> char **triangleType(int triangleToy_count, char **triangleToy, int *result_count) { *result_count = triangleToy_count; // The output array size is the same as the input array size. char **result = malloc(triangleToy_count * sizeof(char*)); // Allocate array of strings dynamically. for (int i = 0; i < triangleToy_count; i++) { // Variables to hold the sides of the triangle. int a, b, c; // Parse the sides from the string. Assuming the format \\"a b c\\". sscanf(triangleToy[i], \\"%d %d %d\\", &a, &b, &c); // Allocate and set the type for each triangle. if (a == b && b == c) { // Equilateral: All sides are equal. result[i] = strdup(\\"Equilateral\\"); } else if (a == b || b == c || a == c) { // Isosceles: Any two sides are equal. result[i] = strdup(\\"Isosceles\\"); } else { // Neither equilateral nor isosceles. result[i] = strdup(\\"None of these\\"); } } return result; } int main() { char *triangles[] = {\\"2 2 1\\", \\"3 3 3\\", \\"3 4 5\\", \\"1 1 3\\"}; int trianglesCount = sizeof(triangles) / sizeof(triangles[0]); int resultCount; char **results = triangleType(trianglesCount, triangles, &resultCount); // Printing the results for (int i = 0; i < resultCount; i++) { printf(\\"%sn\\", results[i]); free(results[i]); // Free the allocated string for each triangle's type. } free(results); // Free the allocated array of strings. return 0; } \`\`\` This program demonstrates the following: 1. **Function Parameters and Dynamic Memory Allocation:** The \`triangleType\` function allocates memory dynamically for the results array based on the input count. Note that we use \`strdup()\` which allocates memory and duplicates the string. This means each string assigned to \`result[i]\` also needs to be freed later to avoid memory leaks. 2. **String Parsing:** It uses \`sscanf()\` to parse the three integers from each input string, which represent the triangle sides. 3. **Classification Logic:** The program checks if a triangle is equilateral, isosceles, or neither by comparing the sides. 4. **Memory Management:** Proper allocation and deallocation are demonstrated to prevent memory leaks. It's worth noting that \`strdup()\` is used, which allocates memory that needs to be freed later. 5. **Result Counting:** The result count is provided through a pointer argument, allowing the calling function to know how many results are available. Remember, proper error checking (for \`malloc\` and \`strdup\` returns) should be included in real-world applications to ensure the program's robustness."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

To do that it needs to store the size of the array to be returned in the result_count variable and it should allocate the array statically or dynamically","output":"To achieve the functionality of categorizing triangles as \\"Isosceles\\", \\"Equilateral\\", or \\"None of these\\" based on the input, let's walk through how you can implement the function \`char** triangleType(int triangleToy_count, char** triangleToy, int* result_count)\`. This solution will focus on dynamic memory allocation for flexibility and scalability. Firstly, it's important to understand the triangle inequality theorem for validation, and the definitions: - A triangle is valid if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. - An Equilateral triangle has all three sides equal. - An Isosceles triangle has at least two sides equal. - If none of the above conditions meet, then it's not a valid triangle as per your requirement. Below is the implementation considering the requirements: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> char** triangleType(int triangleToy_count, char** triangleToy, int* result_count) { // Allocate memory for the result array char **result = (char **)malloc(triangleToy_count * sizeof(char *)); *result_count = triangleToy_count; // Store the result size for (int i = 0; i < triangleToy_count; i++) { int a, b, c; // Parse the sides of the triangle from the string sscanf(triangleToy[i], \\"%d %d %d\\", &a, &b, &c); // Check for Equilateral if (a == b && b == c) { result[i] = strdup(\\"Equilateral\\"); } // Check for Isosceles (and valid triangle inequality) else if ((a == b || a == c || b == c) && (a + b > c && a + c > b && b + c > a)) { result[i] = strdup(\\"Isosceles\\"); } // None of these else { result[i] = strdup(\\"None of these\\"); } } return result; } void printResult(char** result, int result_count) { for (int i = 0; i < result_count; i++) { printf(\\"%sn\\", result[i]); free(result[i]); // Free each string after printing } free(result); // Free the outer array } int main() { char* triangleToy[] = {\\"2 2 1\\", \\"3 3 3\\", \\"3 4 5\\", \\"1 1 3\\"}; int triangleToy_count = sizeof(triangleToy) / sizeof(triangleToy[0]); int result_count; char** result = triangleType(triangleToy_count, triangleToy, &result_count); printResult(result, result_count); return 0; } \`\`\` Key Points: - This implementation dynamically allocates memory for both the array of strings (\`result\`) and for each string within that array using \`malloc\` and \`strdup\`, respectively. - It parses each string using \`sscanf\` to extract the three sides of a potential triangle. - It determines whether each set of sides represents an \\"Equilateral\\", \\"Isosceles\\", or \\"None of these\\". - After using the dynamically allocated memory, it's freed appropriately to avoid memory leaks. - Make sure your compiler supports \`strdup\` or make a custom function if it doesn't."},{"instruction":"Story prompt: 14-year-old Sharon managed to enter the five-part entrance exam to enroll into the Academy of Extraordinary Children. Despite having flight, super strength, and laser vision, it was considered a relatively basic superpower set, especially compared to her friends. But one act of heroism managed to convince the superhero teachers at the Academy to enroll her, no questions asked. There was just one thing she didn't expect. Luckily, it wasn't something sinister, if not slightly questionable. The Academy of Extraordinary Children's five-part entrance exam was notoriously difficult to apply, and even more difficult to pass. The five exams tested any would-be superhero student in their strategic skills, intelligence, strength and power, and creative skills, the fifth test being a combination of the previous four and actually battling a professional superhero. The entrance exam was also something that occurs once every five years. Fail, and one may be allowed to take it, granted a five-year wait can challenge anyone looking for a second chance. However, the official explanation of the Academy to the would-be exam takers was that, according to one of the superhero teachers, \\"The Academy of Extraordinary Children has not reached its quota on students. For this reason, and this will only be applicable for this year, the entrance exam will take place three months from now instead of five years from now.\\" The teacher also added, \\"And due to the need to reach this quota, anyone who is currently awaiting to take the entrance exam can invite anyone of their choice to take the exam, even if they failed last year's entrance exam. There is no limit to how many you can invite.\\" The teacher then concluded, \\"This is without a doubt, the opportunity of a lifetime. You, and some of your friends will be able to grow and develop here in the Academy of Extraordinary Children, granted you pass all five exams. That concludes this announcement. You may all leave the Academy area and find your potential invitees about this once-in-a-lifetime chance to make a difference.\\" Sharon immediately told her four friends, who failed last year's entrance exam, all about this. 14-year-old Alex, whose manipulation of elements like fire, water, air, earth, darkness, light, electricity, metal, wood, and more, said, \\"I can't believe this. We actually get to return and show the Academy who we really are! Oh, my God!\\" 14-year-old Daniel, while not having superpowers, but able to summon superpowered animals with an ancient art, added, \\"Hang on, Alex. We've got three months instead of five years. That's not a lot of time to train and hone our powers and abilities.\\" 14-year-old Kathy, who's ability to run faster than the speed of sound, added, \\"Yeah. Each of us failed in different parts of the test, none of us making it to the fifth and final exam.\\" 14-year-old Neil, who is host to an ancient evil entity that he can control to ensure it never causes destruction, and has taken its own super strength, durability, and healing factor as his own, added, \\"Like Sharon said, this is a once-in-a-lifetime chance. We were already down thinking we had to wait five years, but three months is relatively short.\\" Sharon added, \\"Not to mention, three months from now when the entrance exam starts, don't be surprised to see tens of thousands of would-be heroes. Not everyone will pass, especially with short time to train. But short time is still time.\\" Alex may have been cocky, but even that cockiness had its limits. \\"Sharon's right. We may never get this chance again. So, anyone here think they can do five years worth of growth and development and three months time?\\" Everyone nodded \\"yes\\" in unison.","output":"Their three months of preparation flew by like a comet lighting up the night's sky. Each day, Sharon and her friends dedicated themselves to an intense regimen. They knew that they couldn't afford to waste a second of it. They trained under the tutelage of retired heroes, poured over strategic manuals, and even partook in various simulations to enhance their collaborative efforts. Sharon, in particular, focused on honing her flight skills for more agility, lifting heavier objects to increase her strength, and mastering her laser vision to cut through objects with precision. Her friends, too, made significant strides with their unique abilities, surpassing their own expectations. As the examination day dawned, they stood outside the grandiose gates of the Academy of Extraordinary Children, a mixture of hope and nervousness palpable in the air. Sharon glanced at her friends, offering words of encouragement and reminding them of their hard work. They entered, ready to face whatever challenges awaited them. The first four exams were a tough grind, pushing each of them to their limits. Sharon and her friends managed to demonstrate profound improvements, showcasing an enhanced mastery over their powers and a deeper understanding of tactical strategy. However, it was during the fifth and final test, the battle against a professional hero, where Sharon found herself in a situation that would define her journey. The battle was tough, and exhaustion crept upon Sharon. Just as the odds seemed stacked against her, a scenario unfolded that none of the examiners had anticipated. A villain, long thought to have been neutralized, launched an unexpected attack on the Academy grounds. Panic ensued. Without hesitation, Sharon and her friends jumped into action. Sharon flew, lifting heavy debris to clear paths for evacuation, while Alex created protective barriers using his elemental powers. Daniel summoned his superpowered beasts to help fend off the villain's minions, Kathy's speed was crucial in evacuating the younger onlookers, and Neil leveraged his ancient entity's powers to stand toe-to-toe with the villain. In what seemed like an orchestrated symphony of heroism, they managed to hold the line until more heroes arrived. What struck everyone was not just their bravery, but their ability to work together seamlessly under immense pressure. Their act of valor didn't just earn them immediate entry into the Academy; it earned them the respect of everyone present. The superhero teachers were impressed, stating that no exam could have tested the heart, courage, and quick thinking they displayed that day. But as Sharon and her friends celebrated their acceptance, there was that one thing she didn't expect. Each of them received a letter, not just of admission, but of a special mission aligned with their unique skills - even before officially starting their education. Sharon realized the Academy not only saw them as students but as heroes who'd already proved their mettle. The slightly questionable aspect, however, was the implication of trust the Academy put in students not yet trained formally. It made Sharon ponder the true essence of being a hero, understanding that it wasn't just about powers but the heart to act when called upon. The unexpected twist brought an exciting dimension to their entrance into the Academy. With the entire experience, Sharon grasped a fundamental truth – heroism isn't measured by the extent of one's powers but by the depth of one's courage and the willingness to make a difference, no matter the scale of their abilities."},{"instruction":"Tens of thousands did indeed participate in the entrance exam, and despite tens of thousands having failed, Sharon and her friends had noticed that there was still at least exactly ten thousand who passed, themselves included. Back to the present, one should know that there were many professional superheroes, many of which also functioned as teachers in the Academy of Extraordinary Children. But during the special assignment Sharon and her friends were given due to their brave actions at the entrance exam, they were in for a shock. The special mission, while being assigned to Sharon, Alex, Daniel, Kathy, and Neil, was to be headed by one Ethan G. S. Marigold. \\"Marigold?!\\", asked Daniel. \\"He's like the top of the top hero, isn't he?!\\" Kathy added, \\"Yeah, I feel like we'd be out of his league.\\" Alex retorted, \\"But we were assigned under him, he's gonna be out teacher, so many we're not-so out of his league.\\" Sharon joked, \\"Looks like you'll have some competition.\\" Alex asked, \\"What do you mean by that?\\" Ethan G. S. Marigold was a member of the prestigious and influential Marigold superhero family. He had incredible wealth to his name alone and his powers of controlling and manipulating the four fundamental forces, that being gravity, electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces, only added to his legendary view. Superheroes and supervillains always wore some kind of suit and costume, as well as have their own unique superhero alias or code name. Ethan G. S. Marigold wasn't one of those heroes. Always wearing the most casual clothes and using his full name, he had the cockiness and arrogance one would expect from someone rich and powerful. It would make Alex's one cockiness seem humble in comparison. But Ethan was also known to have a side in which he can relate and connect with those some would consider \\"beneath him\\", and was surprisingly down to Earth. Seems being that confident, rich, and powerful, while having a good heart, makes it easier to be more kind and concerning to other people than the rest of the Marigold family would be. At least he was better than the more controversial Xondrexin superhero family and their forced marriages in order to create more powerful superheroes. Like out of nowhere, Ethan appeared to Sharon and her friends, floating, due to his manipulation of gravity. \\"So. You're the ones who passed the exam with your teamwork?\\", asked Ethan, tilting his sunglasses, holding a latte in his hand. \\"Uhh, yeah.\\", said Neil. \\"We were given a special assignment before even starting an actual class. It's a little-\\" \\"Okay, you talk too much about school.\\", interrupted Ethan. This was despite the topic of the Academy only being brought up now. \\"Now, we could start the assignment now and you all show me your mettle. But. I want to know more about you. Sharon. Alex. Daniel. Kathy. Neil. I've read through your powers, abilities, all that nonsense. And while that's great, I want to get a good idea on who you five are.\\", said Ethan, sipping his latte.","output":"Ethan's approach was unconventional, to say the least. Instead of diving straight into the mission details, he insisted on spending the day with Sharon and her friends, engaging in what could only be described as team-building exercises mixed with casual hangouts. They found themselves at a local diner, sharing stories over burgers and shakes, Ethan listening intently to each tale of struggle, triumph, and the dreams that fueled their journey to the Academy. It was during these moments that Sharon and her friends saw a different side to Ethan G. S. Marigold. Behind the cockiness and the casual disregard for the formalities that seemed to govern the lives of many superheroes, there was a genuine interest in nurturing the next generation of heroes. He shared his own stories, not of grand battles or the weight of his family name, but of the moments that made him question, learn, and grow. He talked about the importance of understanding one's own strengths and weaknesses, not just in terms of powers but in character. As the day progressed, they engaged in a series of mock battles, where Ethan observed their teamwork and individual decision-making processes. He offered insights and critiques, not as a superior looking down on them, but as a mentor guiding them. His teaching style was hands-on, pushing them to think outside the box and to understand the real-world applications of their powers. By the end of the day, when they finally sat down to discuss the special assignment, Sharon and her friends felt a renewed sense of purpose. The mission involved a covert operation to infiltrate a facility suspected of illegal experimentation on individuals with latent superpowers. It was a delicate mission, requiring not just strength and power but discretion, empathy, and a deep understanding of the value of human life. Ethan made it clear that this mission was about more than just proving their worth as future heroes. It was about making a tangible difference in the lives of those who had been exploited and showing them that there were heroes who genuinely cared about their well-being. As they prepared to embark on the mission, Sharon realized that their encounter with Ethan had provided them with something invaluable – a lesson in humility, empathy, and the true essence of heroism. It wasn't about the grandeur or the fame that came with the title of 'superhero.' It was about the small acts of kindness, the willingness to listen and learn, and the courage to stand up for those who couldn't do so for themselves. The special assignment was a success, not just in terms of the mission's objectives but in the personal growth each member of the team experienced. They returned to the Academy not just as students who had passed an entrance exam but as heroes in their own right, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead with a newfound understanding of what it truly meant to be extraordinary."},{"instruction":"یک به یک کلمات را با معنی فارسی مقابل هم بنویس از اولین کلمه تا آخرین کلمه متنIt is difficult to be precise as to what law is, but it may be defined as a code of conduct fora the people in a given community, which controls their activities towards each other, with respect to their private and business lives, and to their relationship with the State It is generally agreed that law must be accepted by the majority of the community.

Here's a step-by-step guide to making an extremely delicious version of plantain bajji that you can enjoy with your friends and family. # Ingredients: - 2 large plantains (unripe or slightly ripe) - 1 cup chickpea flour (besan) - 2 tablespoons rice flour (for crispiness) - 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder - 1 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust as per taste) - A pinch of asafoetida (hing) – optional - 1/2 teaspoon ajwain (carom seeds) - Salt to taste - Water to make the batter - Oil for deep frying # Optional for extra flavor: - 1 tablespoon hot oil (to mix in the batter) - 1 teaspoon ginger-garlic paste - 2 tablespoons finely chopped coriander leaves - 1/2 teaspoon garam masala or chat masala # Instructions: 1. **Prepare the Plantains:** - Peel the plantains and slice them into thin, even slices. You can choose the shape - round or lengthwise based on your preference. - Soak the slices in water to prevent browning and remove some of the starch. 2. **Make the Batter:** - In a large bowl, combine chickpea flour, rice flour, turmeric powder, red chili powder, asafoetida (if using), ajwain, and salt. Mix well. - Add water gradually and whisk until a smooth and slightly thick batter is formed. The consistency should be such that it coats the back of a spoon but drips off slowly. - (Optional) For additional flavor, mix in the hot oil, ginger-garlic paste, chopped coriander, and garam masala/chat masala to the batter. 3. **Heat the Oil:** - Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadhai on medium heat. The oil is ready when a small amount of batter dropped into it sizzles and comes to the surface. 4. **Dip & Fry the Plantains:** - Take each plantain slice and dip it into the batter, making sure it's well-coated on both sides. - Carefully slide the coated slices into the hot oil. Do not overcrowd the pan. - Fry the bajjis in batches until they turn golden and crispy. Flip them halfway through to ensure even cooking. 5. **Serving:** - Remove the bajjis from the oil and place them on paper towels to absorb any excess oil. - Serve hot with your choice of chutneys or sauces. Mint chutney, tamarind chutney, or ketchup are popular options. # Additional Tips: - Ensure the oil is at the correct temperature before frying; too hot, and the bajjis will brown too quickly without cooking through, too cool, and they'll absorb too much oil and become greasy. - Adjust spices in the batter according to your taste preferences. - Experiment with additional spices or seasonings in the batter, like fennel seeds or a pinch of cinnamon, for a unique twist. Enjoy your deliciously crispy and flavorsome plantain bajjis as a snack on a rainy day, at a party, or whenever the craving hits!"},{"instruction":"How to make an extremely delicious spaghetti?","output":"To make an extremely delicious spaghetti that stands out, it's all about focusing on quality ingredients and perfecting the sauce.

The best substitute often depends on the type of dish you're preparing and the overall flavor you're aiming to achieve. Here are some common substitutes for oregano: # 1. Marjoram Marjoram is the closest substitute for oregano, with a similar flavor but slightly sweeter and less pungent. Because of their close botanical relationship, marjoram can be used in a 1:1 ratio as a replacement in most recipes. # 2. Thyme Thyme shares a similar earthiness to oregano but with lemony and minty notes. It works well in most dishes that call for oregano, including Mediterranean and Italian cuisines. Use thyme in a 1:1 ratio as a substitute. # 3. Basil Basil offers a sweet, peppery flavor that works particularly well as a substitute for oregano in Italian dishes like pasta sauces, pizzas, and salads. However, basil is more delicate than oregano, so it's best added towards the end of cooking to preserve its flavor. Use a slightly larger amount of basil when substituting for oregano. # 4. Tarragon Tarragon has a distinct flavor with hints of licorice and anise. It's a stronger, more aromatic herb, so it's best used in dishes where these flavors will complement the other ingredients. Use tarragon sparingly, starting with half the amount of oregano called for and adjusting to taste. # 5. Italian Seasoning Italian seasoning is a blend of dried herbs, typically including oregano, basil, marjoram, thyme, and rosemary. Because it already contains oregano, it can provide a similar flavor profile. Use Italian seasoning in the same amount that your recipe requires for oregano. # 6. Sage Sage offers a robust, peppery flavor and can be an interesting substitute for oregano, especially in heavier dishes like those with beans or meat. Use sage in smaller amounts due to its stronger flavor. # 7. Dried Cilantro or Coriander While offering a distinctly different flavor profile, dried cilantro or coriander can work in a pinch, especially in Mexican or Southwestern dishes where oregano would be used. Use in a 1:1 ratio but be mindful of the unique taste. # 8. Za'atar Za'atar is a Middle Eastern spice blend that includes thyme, sesame seeds, sumac, and often oregano or marjoram. It can be a great substitute, adding both the earthiness of oregano and additional complex flavors. Start with less than the amount of oregano called for and adjust to taste due to its complexity. # Tips for Substituting Herbs: - When substituting herbs, consider how their flavor profiles will interact with the other ingredients in your dish. - Start with less than the called-for amount when using a stronger substitute, then adjust to taste. - Fresh herbs are generally more potent than dried, so if you’re substituting fresh for dried or vice versa, remember the general rule: 1 tablespoon fresh herb = 1 teaspoon dried herb. Experimenting with these substitutes can not only save your recipe when you're out of oregano but also introduce you to new flavor combinations and culinary possibilities."},{"instruction":"how would gamers react to a 3d sci fi rpg game where no group of people is entirely good, or entirely bad, that there are good guys and bad guys within all ethnic, national, and ideological groups?","output":"The reaction to a 3D sci-fi RPG game with nuanced portrayals of characters across ethnic, national, and ideological lines, where no group is entirely good or bad, could vary widely among gamers. Such a complex narrative approach could be met with a range of responses: 1. **Appreciation for Depth and Realism**: Gamers who enjoy rich storytelling might appreciate this approach for its depth and realism. The real world isn't black and white, and many players enjoy games that reflect the complexity of real human interactions and societies. 2. **Increased Immersion**: This level of narrative complexity could lead to increased immersion for players who enjoy getting lost in the worlds of the games they play. A game that acknowledges the moral complexities and diversity of perspectives within groups could feel more vibrant and real. 3. **Engagement with Themes**: Players who enjoy engaging with the themes and ethics of a game might find this approach particularly rewarding. It could spark discussions in gaming communities about the themes of the game, potentially increasing its cultural impact. 4. **Potential Criticism**: Some gamers might find this approach too morally ambiguous or politically sensitive. Games that attempt to nuanced portrayals can sometimes be criticized for failing to take a strong enough stance on issues, or conversely, for being perceived as too politically charged. 5. **Confusion or Frustration**: A subset of players might prefer more straightforward storytelling, where the lines between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" are clearly drawn. This preference can stem from a desire for escapism or simpler narratives that don't require wrestling with moral ambiguity. 6. **Discussion and Community Engagement**: Games that challenge conventional storytelling norms often spark discussions online and in gaming communities. This game could lead to lively debates, fan theories, and a more engaged community. 7. **Educational Potential**: Players might find that the game offers insights into real-world issues of morality, ethics, and the dangers of stereotyping. This could make the game not only entertainment but also a tool for reflection and learning. Given these varied potential reactions, the game's reception would likely depend on how well it executes its complex narrative and whether it manages to entertain while exploring its ambitious themes. High-quality writing, character development, and world-building would be crucial to successfully engaging gamers with this nuanced approach to storytelling."},{"instruction":"what if, despite the moral complexity, there were still moments of clear good and evil in the rpg, just to balance things out?","output":"Incorporating moments of clear good and evil within a morally complex 3D sci-fi RPG can significantly enhance the game's narrative appeal and potentially broaden its audience. Here’s how such elements could impact player reception: 1. **Enhanced Narrative Depth**: By including moments of clear good and evil, the game offers anchor points within its rich narrative. It allows players to navigate its moral complexities with reference points that remind them of the stakes involved. This can make the story more engaging and emotionally resonant. 2. **Greater Emotional Impact**: Moments of stark moral contrast can create powerful emotional experiences. Scenes depicting unequivocal acts of heroism or evil can be memorable and impactful, eliciting strong reactions from players and making the story more compelling. 3. **Improved Accessibility**: While many players appreciate moral complexity, others seek the clarity of traditional hero/villain dynamics. By blending these elements, the game can appeal to a wider audience, satisfying those who enjoy moral ambiguity while still providing the clarity that some players prefer. 4. **Enhanced Gameplay Variety**: Having clear good and evil moments can also impact gameplay, offering opportunities for more varied missions, objectives, and character interactions. Players might be given the chance to make stark choices that have significant consequences, adding to the game's replayability. 5. **Moral Reflection and Discussion**: This mixture allows for nuanced discussion both within the game's community and perhaps in broader cultural conversations. It encourages players to reflect on what constitutes good and evil and to consider the complexities of actions and their motivations. The game could become a significant point of reference in discussions about morality in video games. 6. **Challenge Stereotypes and Clichés**: By presenting a world where no group is monolithically good or evil but still including instances of clear moral choices, the game challenges stereotypes and clichés. This encourages players to think critically about the nature of morality and the diversity of perspectives within groups. 7. **Increased Player Agency**: Offering moments of clear moral choice can enhance the sense of agency players feel over the story. Knowing that their actions can lead to unequivocally good or bad outcomes makes decisions feel more significant and personal, enhancing the immersive experience. In conclusion, skillfully incorporating moments of clear good and evil within a broader context of moral complexity can enrich a game's narrative, making it more engaging, emotionally powerful, and thought-provoking. It acknowledges the reality of moral ambiguity in the world while also providing the satisfying clarity of traditional narrative conflicts, potentially appealing to a broader range of players and fostering a more active and reflective gaming community."},{"instruction":"building on this, how could characters with simple motivations be good sometimes? also, what could be bad about too much moral complexity?","output":"Characters with simple motivations can significantly enhance a game’s narrative and player experience, serving various functions that contribute to the richness and relatability of the story. Here’s how they might be instrumental in gaming narratives, especially when juxtaposed with settings of broader moral complexity: # How Simple-Motivated Characters Can Be Good 1. **Relatability**: Characters with straightforward goals (like protecting a loved one or seeking revenge) can be highly relatable to players, making it easier for them to form emotional connections. Such motivations are universally understood across cultures, making these characters appealing to a wide audience. 2. **Clarity in Storytelling**: In a sea of complex narratives and morally grey areas, characters with simple motivations can serve as anchors for the player, providing clear and understandable plot lines that help maintain engagement without overwhelming the player. 3. **Character Development Opportunities**: Starting a character with a simple motivation provides a clear path for growth. As the story unfolds, these characters can be influenced by the world's complexity around them, giving players a front-row seat to compelling character arcs. 4. **Moral Reflection**: Characters with simple motivations can sometimes shine a light on the complexities of what might initially seem like a straightforward goal. Their journey can provoke thought and discussion about the morality and implications of their actions within the game's broader morally complex setting. 5. **Strategic Gameplay Elements**: In gameplay terms, characters with clear, simple goals can offer straightforward objectives that serve as a foundation for more complex game mechanics, missions, and story developments. This can create a balanced gameplay experience that caters to both casual and seasoned gamers. # Potential Drawbacks of Excessive Moral Complexity 1. **Player Overwhelm**: An overabundance of moral ambiguity and complexity can become mentally tiring, leading to player disengagement. Gamers might find it challenging to make decisions if every choice is heavily morally grey, potentially leading to decision fatigue. 2. **Narrative Diffusion**: Too much complexity can dilute the narrative focus, making it difficult for players to follow the plot or invest emotionally in the characters and their journeys. A cohesive story might become fragmented, reducing its impact and memorability. 3. **Paralysis by Analysis**: An overly complex moral landscape might lead players to overthink their decisions, causing analysis paralysis where making any choice becomes daunting. This can disrupt the flow of gameplay and reduce the enjoyment of the experience. 4. **Diminishing Returns on Engagement**: While moral complexity can add depth, there's a point at which additional complexity no longer contributes to player engagement and may even detract from it. The narrative might be seen as trying too hard to be profound or philosophical, alienating players looking for a balance between entertainment and thoughtful content. 5. **Missed Emotional Beats**: In the pursuit of complexity, games might miss opportunities for straightforward emotional or dramatic moments that resonate strongly with players. The human element can get lost in the twists and turns of complex moral quandaries. Balancing characters with simple motivations against a backdrop of moral complexity offers a structured yet enriching narrative and gameplay experience. It allows depth and accessibility to coexist, ensuring that players are engaged but not overwhelmed. This balance is crucial for creating an immersive and enjoyable game that appeals to a wide range of players."},{"instruction":"what could be powerful about a game that allows all characters to organically express all emotional depth without the plot forcing them to feel certain ways?","output":"A game that enables characters to express a full range of emotional depth organically, without the plot dictating their feelings, can significantly enhance the gaming experience in several powerful ways.

He pulls on the rope attached to the bucket, tipping the water on him and he happily scrubs himself with a loofah (describe his hairy armpits) until the water runs out. Next, he walks to a mirror nearby and brushes his teeth. Jason has always loved catching fish by using his farts because it's so easy, so he gets breakfast by entering a pond and straining as he farts into the water, enjoying the relief while some fish die upon smelling the fart.

His handsome face was lined with sleep creases, his messy dark hair a tangled mess. With a yawn, he stretched his muscular arms and rolled out of his makeshift bed, ignoring the scratches and bug bites that covered his body. Deciding it was time for a morning shower, Jason grabbed a bucket and made his way to a nearby tree. He stripped down, revealing his toned physique and pert butt to the world as he filled the bucket with water from a nearby stream. With a mischievous grin, he hoisted the bucket onto a branch and pulled the rope, drenching himself in the cool water. \\"Ahh, nothing like a jungle shower to start the day off right,\\" Jason chuckled to himself as he scrubbed away the grime with a loofah, his hairy armpits glistening in the morning light.

He waded into the water, his expression one of intense concentration as he strained and let rip a mighty fart. The sound echoed through the trees as some unfortunate fish floated to the surface, their eyes wide in shock at the noxious gas. \\"Sorry, boys, nature calls,\\" Jason chuckled as he scooped up the fish, his stomach growling in anticipation of a delicious meal. He gathered some twigs and started a campfire, expertly cooking the fish over the flames until they were crispy and golden. As he savored his breakfast, Jason couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity of his morning routine.

These chillies, like most pepper plants, thrive in warm conditions and require a bit of care and attention. Here’s how you can plant Kashmiri chillies: # 1. Seed Preparation - **Start Indoors:** Begin by planting seeds indoors. Kashmiri chilli seeds should be started 8-10 weeks before the last expected frost date in your area. - **Soak Seeds:** Soak the seeds in warm water for 8-24 hours before planting. This can help in improving the germination rate. # 2. Soil and Potting - **Soil Requirements:** Use a well-draining, nutrient-rich soil mix. Peppers prefer a soil pH between 6.0 and 6.8. - **Containers:** If starting seeds indoors, use small pots or seeding trays. Make sure they have good drainage. # 3. Planting - **Sowing Depth:** Plant the seeds about 1/4 inch deep in the soil. - **Spacing:** If using trays, seeds can be sown close together and then thinned or transplanted later. For direct sowing in larger containers or the ground, space plants about 18-24 inches apart to give them room to grow. # 4. Light and Temperature - **Warmth is Key:** Keep the soil at a warm temperature, ideally between 75-85°F (24-29°C). Use a heat mat under seed trays if necessary. - **Light:** Once sprouted, seedlings need plenty of light—around 16 hours a day. A sunny windowsill or a grow light can provide this. # 5. Watering and Feeding - **Moisture:** Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Overwatering can cause issues like root rot. - **Nutrition:** Start feeding the plants with a balanced liquid fertilizer every 2-3 weeks once they develop their true leaves. # 6. Hardening Off Before transplanting outdoors, the seedlings need to be gradually accustomed to outdoor conditions. This process is known as hardening off and involves taking plants outside for a few hours each day, gradually increasing their exposure to sunlight and outdoor temperatures over a week. # 7. Transplanting - **Timing:** Transplant the seedlings outdoors once the danger of frost has passed and night-time temperatures consistently stay above 55°F (13°C). - **Location:** Choose a sunny spot with at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight. Amend the soil with compost or well-rotted manure to improve its nutrition and structure. # 8. Continued Care - **Mulch:** Apply mulch around the base of the plants to help retain soil moisture and control weeds. - **Support:** Stake the plants or use cages to support them as they grow to prevent bending or breaking under the weight of the fruit. - **Watering:** Water deeply at the base of the plant, avoiding wetting the leaves, to reduce the risk of diseases. # 9. Monitoring - **Pests and Diseases:** Regularly check for signs of pests and diseases. Organic or chemical control methods may be necessary if infestations occur. # 10. Harvesting - **Indicator:** Harvest the chillies once they reach their full size and show vibrant red color. They can be picked earlier if you prefer them less spicy. Remember, gardening requires patience and care. Each plant is unique, and environmental conditions will play a significant role in their growth and fruit production. Enjoy the process of growing your Kashmiri chillies, and look forward to incorporating them into your cooking for that amazing color and flavor."},{"instruction":"안녕 챗봇아 잘있었니?","output":"안녕하세요! 저는 늘 여기 있어요, 언제든지 질문하거나 대화하고 싶을 때 찾아와 주세요. 무엇을 도와드릴까요?"},{"instruction":"봄비에 대한시 짧게 한편 써주고 PDF로 만들어줘","output":"죄송하지만, 직접 PDF 파일을 생성하고 전송하는 기능은 제공하지 않습니다. 하지만, 봄비를 주제로 한 짧은 시를 써드릴 수 있으니, 그 내용을 사용해 직접 PDF를 만들 수 있도록 해드릴게요. 어떻습니까?"},{"instruction":"좋아요","output":"봄비 봄비가 내리고, 잠든 씨앗이 깨어난다. 푸른 잎사귀 사이로 새 생명의 속삭임이 들린다. 빗방울 하나, 하나가 겨울의 끝자락을 촉촉이 적시며, 만물이 재생의 노래를 부른다. 흙내음 가득한 공기 속에 새로운 시작의 기운이 퍼져, 봄비와 함께 모든 것이 새롭게 물든다. 아, 봄비여 너의 부드러운 소리에 겨울의 잠에서 깨어나 세상은 또 다시 꿈을 꾼다. --- 이 시를 바탕으로 자유롭게 PDF 파일을 만들어 보시기 바랍니다.

The function Im making has the parameters char** triangleType(int triangleToy_count, char** triangleToy, int* result_count) It should return a STRING_ARRAY. To do that it needs to store the size of the array to be returned in the result_count variable and it should allocate the array statically or dynamically","output":"To achieve this task, we'll implement a function that takes in an array of string representations of triangle sides, processes each to determine whether the triangle described is isosceles, equilateral, or neither, and then returns an array of strings with the result for each input string. Additionally, we'll update the \`result_count\` to reflect the size of the returned array. We will dynamically allocate memory for the returned array, which means the caller will be responsible for freeing it later. Here's how you can implement this in C: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> char** triangleType(int triangle_count, char** triangleToy, int* result_count) { // First, set the result count equal to the number of input triangles *result_count = triangle_count; // Dynamically allocate memory to hold the result strings char** results = (char**)malloc(*result_count * sizeof(char*)); for (int i = 0; i < triangle_count; ++i) { int a, b, c; // Extract the three sides of the triangle from the current string sscanf(triangleToy[i], \\"%d %d %d\\", &a, &b, &c); // Allocate memory for each result string dynamically // Assuming \\"None of these\\" is the longest possible result (12 chars + 1 null terminator = 13) results[i] = (char*)malloc(13 * sizeof(char)); // Check for equilateral if (a == b && b == c) { strcpy(results[i], \\"Equilateral\\"); } // Check for isosceles, exclude equilateral triangles which are already handled else if (a == b || b == c || a == c) { strcpy(results[i], \\"Isosceles\\"); } else { strcpy(results[i], \\"None of these\\"); } } return results; } int main() { char* triangleStrings[] = { \\"2 2 1\\", \\"3 3 3\\", \\"3 4 5\\", \\"1 1 3\\" }; int triangles_count = 4; int result_count; char** results = triangleType(triangles_count, triangleStrings, &result_count); // Print the results for (int i = 0; i < result_count; i++) { printf(\\"%sn\\", results[i]); } // Free the allocated memory for (int i = 0; i < result_count; i++) { free(results[i]); } free(results); return 0; } \`\`\` This program defines a \`triangleType\` function that operates as described.

This is demonstrated in the \`main()\` function where we free each string individually and then the array of strings itself."},{"instruction":"what does strcpy do","output":"\`strcpy\` is a standard C library function that copies a string, including the terminating null byte ('0'), from the source string to the destination string. It's included in the \`<string.h>\` header file. The prototype for \`strcpy\` looks like this: \`\`\`c char *strcpy(char *dest, const char *src); \`\`\` # Parameters: - \`dest\`: This is a pointer to the destination array where the content is to be copied. The array must be large enough to hold the copied string, including the terminating null byte. - \`src\`: This is the string to be copied. # Returns: - \`strcpy\` returns a pointer to the destination string \`dest\`. # Usage Note: Using \`strcpy\` can potentially lead to security problems, such as buffer overflows, if not used carefully. Specifically, \`strcpy\` does not perform bounds checking, so it will copy a source string into a destination buffer without knowing if there's enough space. This can overwrite adjacent memory and cause undefined behavior, crashes, or vulnerabilities in the program. To mitigate such risks, safer alternatives like \`strncpy\` or \`snprintf\` are often recommended. These functions allow you to specify the size of the destination buffer, reducing the risk of overflow: - **\`strncpy(dest, src, num)\`**: It copies up to \`num\` characters from \`src\` to \`dest\`. If \`src\` is less than \`num\` characters long, \`strncpy\` pads the remainder of \`dest\` with null bytes. However, it might not null-terminate \`dest\` if the length of \`src\` is \`num\` or more, which can also lead to issues. - **\`snprintf(dest, size, \\"%s\\", src)\`**: It's a formatted output function, but can be used for safe string copying. It ensures that only \`size - 1\` characters are copied to \`dest\`, always null-terminating the copied string (as long as \`size\` is greater than 0). When using \`strcpy\` or any of its variants, always make sure that the destination buffer is large enough for the source string and the null terminator to avoid buffer overflows."},{"instruction":"what does sscanf do","output":"\`sscanf\` is a function in the C standard library, included via the \`<stdio.h>\` header file, that reads data from a string based on a format string. It is part of the \`scanf\` family of functions, which are used for formatted input.

Each object must be a pointer to the variable where the data will be stored. # Returns: - On success, \`sscanf\` returns the number of input items successfully matched and assigned. This number can match the expected number of conversions indicated in the format string. - If a reading error occurs or if the end of the string is reached before the first conversion, \`sscanf\` returns \`EOF\`. - If no fields are matched, \`sscanf\` returns 0. # Example: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> int main() { char* inputData = \\"100 3.14 Hello\\"; int intValue; float floatValue; char strValue[50]; int numParsed = sscanf(inputData, \\"%d %f %s\\", &intValue, &floatValue, strValue); if(numParsed == 3) { printf(\\"Integer: %d, Float: %.2f, String: %sn\\", intValue, floatValue, strValue); } else { printf(\\"Failed to parse all data. Parsed %d items.n\\", numParsed); } return 0; } \`\`\` In this example, \`sscanf\` extracts an integer, a float, and a string from \`inputData\` based on the format string \`\\"%d %f %s\\"\` and stores them in \`intValue\`, \`floatValue\`, and \`strValue\`, respectively. It then prints these values to the console. \`sscanf\` is particularly useful for reading and converting data from strings where the data follows a specific format, such as configuration parameters, serialized data, or user input parsing in a controlled format."},{"instruction":"is difficult to be precise as to what law is, but it may be defined as a code of conduct fora the people in a given community, which controls their activities towards each other, with respect to their private and business lives, and to their relationship with the State It is generally agreed that law must be accepted by the majority of the community.

His symphonies are often considered some of the greatest musical works ever written. Written over the span of his career, these works chart the evolution of his style and the broader development of the symphonic form from the Classical period into the Romantic era. Here is an overview of Beethoven's symphonies: 1. **Symphony No. 1 in C major, Op. 21 (1800)**: Though grounded in the Classical traditions of Mozart and Haydn, this work already hints at Beethoven's innovative spirit, particularly in its use of sforzandos and dynamic contrasts. 2. **Symphony No. 2 in D major, Op. 36 (1802)**: Written during a difficult period in Beethoven’s life when he was coming to terms with his impending deafness, it nevertheless displays an often joyful character and includes innovative structural elements. 3. **Symphony No. 3 in E-flat major, \\"Eroica\\", Op. 55 (1804)**: A groundbreaking work in terms of both scale and emotional depth. Originally dedicated to Napoleon Bonaparte, Beethoven famously withdrew the dedication when Napoleon declared himself Emperor. The \\"Eroica\\" marks a significant departure from the more formal constraints of earlier symphonies. 4. **Symphony No. 4 in B-flat major, Op. 60 (1806)**: Often overshadowed by its neighboring symphonies, the Fourth is notable for its lyrical qualities and the beauty of its slow movement. 5. **Symphony No. 5 in C minor, Op. 67 (1808)**: Probably the most famous of his symphonies, its opening four-note motif (\\"short-short-short-long\\") is one of the most recognizable in all of music. The Fifth Symphony is celebrated for its journey from struggle to triumph. 6. **Symphony No. 6 in F major, \\"Pastoral\\", Op. 68 (1808)**: Programmatic in nature, it evokes the tranquil and sometimes stormy scenes of country life. It is unique among Beethoven’s symphonies for its explicitly descriptive approach. 7. **Symphony No. 7 in A major, Op. 92 (1812)**: Known for its use of rhythm and for the almost dance-like nature of much of its music, particularly in the famous Allegretto second movement. Wagner famously described it as \\"the apotheosis of the dance.\\" 8. **Symphony No. 8 in F major, Op. 93 (1812)**: The shortest and, in character, lightest of his symphonies, it is sometimes called Beethoven's \\"little Symphony in F,\\" contrasting it with the longer and more dramatic Sixth Symphony, also in F major. 9. **Symphony No. 9 in D minor, \\"Choral\\", Op. 125 (1824)**: A monumental work in the symphonic repertoire, it is notable for its final movement, which uses Friedrich Schiller’s poem \\"Ode to Joy\\" and includes parts for vocal soloists and chorus, a groundbreaking innovation at the time. Each of Beethoven’s symphonies moved the genre forward in significant ways, expanding the technical demands on performers, the emotional and expressive range of the music, and the very conception of what a symphony could be. His symphonies continue to be central pieces in the orchestral repertoire and have been widely recorded and performed around the world."},{"instruction":"Hi","output":"Hello!

Äpplet är en av de mest odlade frukterna och är mycket vanligt i många delar av världen. Dess storlek, färg och smak kan variera betydligt beroende på sorten, men vanligtvis är äpplen runda eller lätt ovala med en jämn yta. Ytterhuden, eller skalet, på ett äpple kan ha olika färger inklusive rött, grönt, gult eller en kombination av dessa, beroende på sort och mognadsgrad. Skalet är relativt tunt men robust och innesluter fruktköttet, som är saftigt och krispigt med en söt, ibland syrlig, smak. Mitt i äpplet finns ett kärnhus som innehåller frön. Antalet frön kan variera, men det finns ofta 5 hålrum med frön i varje äpple, även om alla inte alltid innehåller frön. Äpplen är rika på fiber och C-vitamin samt olika antioxidanter och är därför en del av en hälsosam kost.

Each string will have 3 numbers representing the length of one side of a triangle. The function Im making is to check if its a valid triangle, meaning if its an isosceles or equilateral. Else its not valid. Ex: [‘2 2 1’, ‘3 3 3’, ‘3 4 5’, ‘1 1 3’] returns [‘Isosceles’, ‘Equilateral’, ‘None of these’, ‘None of these’]. The function Im making has the parameters char** triangleType(int triangleToy_count, char** triangleToy, int* result_count) It should return a STRING_ARRAY. To do that it needs to store the size of the array to be returned in the result_count variable and it should allocate the array statically or dynamically","output":"To achieve your goal in C, you'll need to follow these steps closely: 1. **Parse each string** in the input array to extract the three sides of a triangle. 2. **Determine** if the sides make an isosceles, equilateral, or neither. 3. **Allocate memory** for the result array. Given that strings in C are char arrays, you will essentially need a 2D array. This can be done dynamically with \`malloc\`. 4. **Assign the corresponding string** (\\"Isosceles\\", \\"Equilateral\\", or \\"None of these\\") to each result, based on your determination. 5. **Store** the size of the output array in \`result_count\`. Here's a function implementing the above: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> // Helper function to determine the triangle type. const char* determineTriangle(int a, int b, int c) { if(a == b && b == c) { return \\"Equilateral\\"; } else if(a == b || a == c || b == c) { return \\"Isosceles\\"; } else { return \\"None of these\\"; } } // Main function to evaluate triangle types. char** triangleType(int triangleToy_count, char** triangleToy, int* result_count) { // Set result_count to the number of input triangles. *result_count = triangleToy_count; // Dynamically allocate an array of string pointers. char** results = (char**)malloc(triangleToy_count * sizeof(char*)); for(int i = 0; i < triangleToy_count; i++) { // Initialize each element. results[i] = (char*)malloc(15 * sizeof(char)); // Allocate memory for each string. } // Iterate through each triangle representation. for(int i = 0; i < triangleToy_count; i++) { int a, b, c; // Parse the sides of the triangle from the input string. sscanf(triangleToy[i], \\"%d %d %d\\", &a, &b, &c); // Determine the triangle type and assign it. const char* type = determineTriangle(a, b, c); strcpy(results[i], type); } return results; } // Example of usage int main() { char* triangles[] = {\\"2 2 1\\", \\"3 3 3\\", \\"3 4 5\\", \\"1 1 3\\"}; int result_count; char** results = triangleType(4, triangles, &result_count); for(int i = 0; i < result_count; i++) { printf(\\"%sn\\", results[i]); } // Free allocated memory for(int i = 0; i < result_count; i++) { free(results[i]); } free(results); return 0; } \`\`\` # Explanation 1. **Parsing**: The \`sscanf\` function is used to parse integers from the strings. This pulls out the three side lengths for each triangle representation in the \`triangleToy\` array. 2. **Determining Triangle Type**: The \`determineTriangle\` function checks if a triangle is equilateral (all sides equal), isosceles (two sides equal), or neither. This logic does not account for the triangle inequality principle because you specified only checking for equilateral or isosceles triangles, deeming any triangle not meeting those criteria as \\"None of these\\". 3. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: The \`results\` array is dynamically allocated based on the number of input triangles. Each string in this result array is also dynamically allocated enough space for the strings \\"Isosceles\\", \\"Equilateral\\", or \\"None of these\\". 4. **Returning the Results**: The populated \`results\` array is returned, and the \`result_count\` is set to the number of input strings to inform the caller of the array size. 5. **Memory Cleanup**: To prevent memory leaks, the allocated memory for the \`results\` array and its contents is freed at the end of \`main\`. This implementation assumes that all input strings correctly represent a triangle with its three sides and doesn't do extensive error checking (e.g., for invalid inputs or the triangle inequality theorem). For production code, consider adding such validations for robustness."},{"instruction":"У меня есть драйвер (kernel mode - km), который взаимодействует с приложением (user mode - um).

However, I can guide you through a process of creating a basic structure for a techno track and you can use music production software (like Ableton Live, FL Studio, Logic Pro, etc.) to actually produce the track. # Title: **Neon Pulse** # Tempo: 128 BPM (a common tempo for techno) # Key: F minor (a common key for dark, driving techno) # Structure: 1. **Intro (0:00-0:30)**: Start with a kick drum pattern. Every 4 beats add a low bass note that matches the root key (F). Slowly introduce a hi-hat pattern. 2. **Build-Up (0:30-1:00)**: Layer in a snare or clap on every second and fourth beat. Introduce a repetitive, pluck-style synth melody to create tension. 3. **Drop (1:00-1:30)**: Bring in a bassline that complements the kick drum, keep it rolling and groovy. Increase the energy with a fuller drum pattern (add open hi-hats or ride cymbals). 4. **Main Part (1:30-2:30)**: Add a lead synth line with a catchy melody, maybe using a saw or square wave for that classic techno feel. Modulate the filter of the lead synth for dynamic movement. You can also introduce a vocal sample here, heavily processed (think reverb, delay, and pitch effects). 5. **Breakdown (2:30-3:00)**: Remove the drums and focus on atmospherics. Add pads or long-held chords for emotional impact. You can also breakdown the melody to a simpler form here. 6. **Build-Up 2 (3:00-3:30)**: Gradually reintroduce elements from the main part, starting with percussion. Increase tension here more than the first build-up, maybe by adding riser effects or speeding up a snare roll. 7. **Drop 2 (3:30-4:00)**: Similar to the first drop but add variations to your synth lines or drum patterns to keep it interesting. A new bassline or added percussion elements can work wonders. 8. **Outro (4:00-4:30)**: Start dialing back the energy by stripping down elements, typically the reverse of your intro. End with just the kick drum and perhaps a lingering effect tail (like a reverb or delay). # Sound Design Tips: - **Kick**: Punchy and deep. Layer if necessary and use sidechain compression to make room for the bass. - **Bass**: Keep it rolling and groovy. Subtle distortions can add character. - **Synths**: Use detuning for a thicker sound. Automate filters for movement. - **Effects**: Use reverb and delay for spatial effects, especially on leads and atmospheric pads. White noise sweeps help build-ups and transitions. # Final Steps: - **Mixing**: Ensure each element sits well in the mix, use EQ to cut clashing frequencies. - **Mastering**: Aim for a loud, clear, and cohesive final track. Use a limiter to boost the overall level without clipping. Remember, techno is all about the vibe and the groove. Let the track evolve naturally and don’t be afraid to experiment with different sounds and effects. You can use the structure and tips above as a guideline, but the beauty of music production comes from personal touches and experimentation. Happy producing!"},{"instruction":"So where to make this","output":"To create the techno track as described, you'll need software known as a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).

My capabilities are centered around providing information, suggestions, and guidance. However, I can still help by guiding you through the process of remaking a techno track step-by-step, which you can implement using a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) or a mobile app for music production. Here’s a general approach to remake an existing techno track: # 1. Choose the Track Identify the techno track you want to remake. Listen to it carefully several times to understand its structure, rhythm, and the different elements it consists of (e.g., drums, bass, synths). # 2. Break It Down Take notes on the structure of the track. Most songs follow a pattern (Intro, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Outro, etc.). In techno, this might be more about build-ups, drops, and breakdowns. Note down what you hear during these sections (instruments, effects). # 3. Recreate the Drums Techno tracks usually have a consistent kick drum, often with a \\"four on the floor\\" beat. Start by recreating the drum line using your DAW’s drum machine or samples. Add in snares, hi-hats, and other percussion as needed. # 4. Add Bass and Synths Recreate the bassline and any prominent synth melodies or chords next. This might require a bit of trial and error, especially if you’re doing it by ear. Use similar sounding presets in your DAW and tweak them as required. # 5. Effects and Automation Techno makes significant use of effects like reverb, delay, filters, and automation of these effects to build tension and release. Listen for these in your chosen track and try to replicate the movements using automation clips in your DAW. # 6. Mixing Aim to match the levels of the original track as closely as possible. This involves adjusting the volume of each track, panning, EQ (to cut or boost frequencies and make each instrument sit well in the mix), and adding effects where necessary. # 7. Mastering The final step is to apply mastering to the track as a whole, aiming to ensure it sounds cohesive and is suitable for playing on all sound systems. This often involves subtle EQ, compression, limiting, and stereo enhancement. # Tools and Resources: - **DAWs:** Ableton Live, FL Studio, Logic Pro, Reaper, etc., for desktop; FL Studio Mobile, GarageBand, Caustic 3, etc., for mobile. - **Tutorials:** YouTube is an invaluable resource. Look for breakdowns of specific tracks or tutorials on remaking tracks. - **Plugins and VSTs:** There are many free and paid synthesizers and effects plugins that can help you closely match the sounds from the original track. Remember, remaking a track is both a great way to learn music production and an exercise in close listening and analysis. It's also a creative process—while you’re aiming to match another track, your own creativity and interpretation are important parts of the process. Keep practicing, and you'll get better over time!"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Platinum blonde is the best canvas for pastel colors. When the hair is almost void of color, with no yellow tones, pastel colors are at their brightest. Applying light blue to hair with yellow tones will give a greenish hue because yellow and blue combine to make green. Similarly, if you add baby pink to yellow-toned hair, the result will likely be a peach or orange shade. Therefore, the lighter the hair color, the better the results. Moreover, applying the bubble technique adds depth to the hair color, offering a holographic vibe.","output":"Pastel babylights can add a unique touch to short blonde hair, especially when enhancing platinum blonde tones. Platinum blonde serves as an ideal base for pastel shades, as the absence of yellow undertones allows these colors to appear more vibrant. It is important to consider how different colors mix with the existing tones in the hair – for instance, applying light blue over yellow-toned hair may result in a greenish tint, while adding baby pink to yellow tones could create a peach or orange hue.

There isn't a single command that restarts or refreshes all network drives, but you can use a combination of commands to achieve the same outcome. Here is a simple way to do it using batch scripting with the \`net use\` command. 1. **Open Command Prompt**: You might need to open it with administrator privileges depending on your network settings and permissions. 2. **Create a Batch File**: It's easier to manage this process if you script it. Below is a simple script that disconnects all mapped drives and then reconnects them. First, let's find out what drives are mapped: \`\`\`batch @echo off for /f \\"skip=2 tokens=2,3\\" %%i in ('net use ^| findstr \\":\\"') do ( echo Drive: %%i echo Share: %%j echo: ) pause \`\`\` This script will list all mapped drives and their corresponding network paths. Take note of these paths. Now, to disconnect and reconnect, you can use a script like this: \`\`\`batch @echo off REM Disconnect all network drives net use * /delete /y REM Connect network drives net use Z: PathToYourNetworkShare1 net use Y: PathToYourNetworkShare2 REM Add as many as you need following the pattern above \`\`\` **Replace** \`PathToYourNetworkShare1\` and \`PathToYourNetworkShare2\` with your actual network paths and choose appropriate drive letters (Z:, Y:, etc.) that are not already in use on your local machine. **Keep in mind:** - This script disconnects **all** mapped drives with \`net use * /delete /y\`. If you want to only reset specific drives, replace \`*\` with the specific drive letter (e.g., \`Z:\`). - Make sure to have the correct permissions and credentials if required. Some network shares may require you to log in with specific credentials. You can add credentials to your \`net use\` command with \`/user:<username> <password>\`, but be cautious about storing passwords in plaintext. - Running this script will interrupt any ongoing operations on these network drives, so ensure this action won't disrupt important tasks. **Note**: Always test scripts in a controlled environment before running them on your primary workstation or server to avoid unintentional data loss or network interruptions."},{"instruction":"routes - routes from route print","output":"Ah, if you're referring to the routing table in Windows and how to reset or restart the routing for the network interfaces, I see where you're coming from now. Your inquiry is about IP routing rather than mapped network drives. My apologies for the confusion earlier. Windows maintains a routing table that dictates how packets get routed across different networks. You can view this table by using the \`route print\` command in the Command Prompt. Modifying or refreshing this table is not as straightforward as working with mapped network drives because it's directly tied to how Windows and your network hardware interact with each other. # To View the Routing Table: 1. Open Command Prompt as an administrator. 2. Type \`route print\` and press Enter. This will display the current routing table. # To Modify or Refresh the Routing Table: Modifying the routing table should be done with caution as incorrect entries can lead to network connectivity issues. - **To Delete a Specific Route**: If you identify a specific route that needs removal, you can delete it using: \`\`\`cmd route delete [destination] \`\`\` Replace \`[destination]\` with the network destination of the route you wish to delete. - **To Add a Route**: You can manually add a route to the routing table using: \`\`\`cmd route add [destination] mask [subnet mask] [gateway] metric [cost metric] if [interface] \`\`\` Each bracketed term should be replaced with the actual values for the route you are adding. # Refreshing the Routing Table: If you're looking to \\"restart\\" or refresh the routing table without manually modifying it, consider the following options: - **Restarting the Network Interface**: By disabling and then re-enabling the network interface (either through the Network Connections window or using commands like \`ipconfig /release\` followed by \`ipconfig /renew\` for DHCP interfaces), you can force a refresh of the routing table for that interface. - **Rebooting the System**: A full system reboot will also refresh the routing table, though this is obviously a more disruptive approach. - **Resetting TCP/IP Stack**: If the goal is to resolve networking issues, you might consider resetting the Windows TCP/IP stack. This can be done with the following command (be cautious, as this will reset your IP settings to their default state): \`\`\`cmd netsh int ip reset \`\`\` After executing this command, you may need to restart your computer. # Advanced Operations: For more complex networking issues or configurations, networking commands like \`netsh\` offer extensive control over the network interfaces, including the routing table. The exact commands would depend on what you're trying to achieve, and careful consideration is required to avoid network disruptions. **Important**: Always proceed with caution when modifying the routing table or network settings, especially on production systems or networks.

Одна из цепей ДНК имеет следующий порядок нуклеотидов: ААТЦАЦГАТЦЦТТЦТАГГААГ. Как изменится первичная структура закодированного в ней белка, если будет выбит: а) второй триплет: б) третий нуклеотид? Задача №2. Женщина, переболевшая во время беременности коревой краснухой, родила глухого сына. У нее и мужа слух нормальный, в родословной обоих супругов глухота не отмечена. Определите возможный механизм появления глухоты у ребенка; вероятность повторного рождения глухого ребенка в данной семье; вероятность рождения глухих внуков, если их глухой сын, став взрослым, женится на глухонемой женщине, у которой родители и обе сестры тоже глухонемые (ген глухоты рецессивный).","output":"**Задача №1** а) Если будет выбит второй триплет, то изменится секвенция ДНК, начиная с 4-го по 6-й нуклеотиды, что соответствует второму триплету. Допустим, из ДНК удалён второй триплет \\"ЦАЦ\\", тогда изменение этого триплета приведёт к изменению одной аминокислоты в белке, закодированном этой ДНК. Это изменение аминокислоты может повлиять на структуру и, соответственно, на функцию белка, но всё зависит от того, какая именно аминокислота была изменена и насколько критично это изменение для функции белка. б) Если будет выбит третий нуклеотид (Г в триплете АТЦ), первичная структура закодированного белка изменится начиная с аминокислоты, соответствующей этому третьему триплету. То есть, это приведёт к изменению одного триплета и соответственно одной аминокислоты в белке. Опять же, это может изменить структуру и функции белка, эффект изменения зависит от конкретной аминокислоты и её роли в структуре белка. **Задача №2** Глухота у ребенка, вероятно, возникла из-за внутриутробного воздействия коревой краснухи, которой переболела мать во время беременности. Вирус коревой краснухи является тератогенным агентом, способным вызывать пороки развития у плода, включая глухоту. Это не генетическая глухота, а врождённая, вызванная внешним фактором, поэтому: Вероятность повторного рождения глухого ребенка в данной семье мала, поскольку это зависит от наличия аналогичных негативных факторов во время следующей беременности, а не от генетического предрасположения. Если следующая беременность будет протекать без подобных внешних рисков, то риск снижается до статистического минимума. Вероятность рождения глухих внуков зависит от множества факторов, включая то, генетическая ли глухота у жены сына и как она передаётся. Если глухота у будущей жены и её семьи действительно обусловлена рецессивным геном, и они передадут этот ген своим потомкам, то вероятность того, что дети будут глухими, будет зависеть от того, какие гены (один глухоты или два) получит ребенок. Если оба родителя передадут рецессивный ген глухоты, ребенок будет глухим. Согласно Менделевским законам, если оба родителя гетерозиготны по рецессивному признаку, вероятность рождения глухого ребенка составляет 25%. Тем не менее, если оба родителя глухие и оба являются гомозиготными по рецессивному гену глухоты, вероятность глухоты у детей будет 100%."},{"instruction":"ыфвы","output":"Hello!

The base of the logarithm (lg) is assumed to be 10, which is the common logarithm. Here's how we can solve it: 1. Since both sides of the inequality are logarithms with the same base, we can equate their arguments due to the property of logarithms that if (lg a = lg b), then (a = b), as long as we're considering the domain where the logarithm is defined (i.e., for positive arguments). 2. So, we have (2x - 2 geq x). 3. Let's solve this algebraic inequality. Let's perform these calculations.The solution to the inequality ( lg(2x - 2) geq lg(x) ) is ( x geq 2 ), after solving the algebraic inequality (2x - 2 geq x). However, we must also consider the domain of the logarithm function, which requires its argument to be positive: 1. For ( lg(2x - 2) ), this means (2x - 2 > 0) or (x > 1). 2. For ( lg(x) ), this means (x > 0). Since (x geq 2) satisfies both these conditions, the final solution to the inequality, taking into account the domain of the logarithmic functions, is ( x geq 2 ).","output":"Чтобы решить неравенство lg(2x - 2) ≥ lg(x), мы будем применять свойства логарифмов и алгебраические манипуляции. Основание логарифма (lg) предполагается равным 10, что является общепринятым логарифмом. Вот как мы можем его решить: 1. Поскольку обе части неравенства являются логарифмами с одинаковым основанием, мы можем приравнять их аргументы в соответствии со свойством логарифмов, что если lg a = lg b, то а = b, при условии, что мы рассматриваем область определения, где логарифм является определенным (т.е. для положительных аргументов). 2. Таким образом, у нас получается 2x - 2 ≥ x. 3. Решим это алгебраическое неравенство. Произведем эти расчеты. Решение неравенства lg(2x - 2) ≥ lg(x) этап x ≥ 2, после решения алгебраического неравенства 2x - 2 ≥ x. Однако мы также должны учесть область определения функции логарифма, которая требует, чтобы ее аргумент был положительным: 1. Для lg(2x - 2) это означает 2x - 2 > 0 или x > 1. 2. Для lg(x) это означает x > 0. Поскольку x ≥ 2 удовлетворяет обоим этим условиям, окончательное решение неравенства, с учетом области определения логарифмических функций, это x ≥ 2."},{"instruction":"привет я поставил это в cron, но ничего не приходит */20 * * * * DISPLAY=:0 /usr/bin/notify-send \\"Пора отдохнуть и посмотреть в окно\\"","output":"Привет! Попробуем разобраться в возможных причинах, по которым уведомление \\"Пора отдохнуть и посмотреть в окно\\" не отображается. 1. **Проблемы с переменной \`DISPLAY\`**: переменная \`DISPLAY\` может быть не инициализирована должным образом при выполнении задачи \`cron\`. Убедитесь, что \`DISPLAY=:0\` действительно указывает на активный X session пользователя. Вы можете проверить это, выполнив \`echo DISPLAY\` в терминале вашего графического сеанса. Если вывод отличается от \`:0\`, используйте этот вывод в вашей \`cron\` задаче. 2. **Права доступа**: удостоверьтесь, что задача \`cron\` исполняется от имени пользователя с графической сессией, для которой должно быть показано уведомление. 3. **\`notify-send\` и \`cron\`**: \`notify-send\` может не работать из-за недостатка прав или окружения, специфичных для \`cron\`. Одним из решений может быть указание полного пути к команде. Но поскольку вы уже указали полный путь, проблема, скорее всего, не в этом. 4. **Проверка журналов \`cron\`**: Возможно, вы найдете подсказки, что именно идет не так, в системных логах или журналах \`cron\`. Проверьте \`/var/log/syslog\` (или аналогичный для вашей системы) на наличие сообщений, связанных с выполнением вашей задачи. 5. **Использование \`xdg-utils\`**: Если \`notify-send\` напрямую не работает, вы можете попробовать обернуть команду в \`bash\` скрипт, который сначала экспортирует переменные окружения для DBUS. Пример такого скрипта: \`\`\`bash #!/bin/bash export DISPLAY=:0 export XAUTHORITY=/home/your_username/.Xauthority export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=unix:path=/run/user/1000/bus /usr/bin/notify-send \\"Пора отдохнуть и посмотреть в окно\\" \`\`\` Указанные выше пути и идентификаторы пользователей могут варьироваться, проверьте их для вашей системы. 6. **Проверка DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS**: Проверьте, правильно ли задана переменная \`DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\` для вашего пользователя. Вы можете получить её значение, запустив \`echo DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\` в терминале вашей рабочей графической сессии. 7. **Проверьте, работает ли \`notify-send\` вручную**: Откройте терминал в графической сессии и попробуйте отправить уведомление командой \`/usr/bin/notify-send \\"Тест\\"\`, чтобы убедиться, что проблема действительно кроется в \`cron\`.

Но в моём случае, лучше бы я на дроме нашел вариант и проверил его на любой с.т.о., чем связываться дедал авто. Во-первых хёндай гетз, который висел у них на сайте за 240 тысяч, на деле начинает стоить 795 тысяч. Во-вторых, сам договор, который вам будут несолько раз менять содержит большие условности. Например, очень классная строка, которую далеко не с первого раза найдёшь: «все технические недостатки были осмотрены и оплачиваются клиентом». Я было хотел расторгать этот злосчастный договор, но опять же строка про то, что в случае расторжения я должен за оформление и предпродажную подготовку — 50 тысяч рублей. Я показывал эти бумаги юристу, он сказал, что такого у нормального салона не бывает! Ну и наконец техническое состояние новоприобретённого автомобиля — не заводится, отвёз на ремонт. Лучшая покупка в моей жизни!","output":"1. Хочу поделиться своим \\"замечательным\\" опытом покупки авто в салоне Лофт Авто Юг. Решился я на приобретение Toyota Camry, думал, что все будет гладко, но нет. С первого взгляда машина казалась отличной, но после покупки выяснилось, что с ходовой частью серьезные проблемы. Продавец, конечно, уверял меня в идеальном состоянии авто. Честно, я даже не знаю, как такое возможно в автосалоне, который должен гарантировать качество. В итоге вложил еще крупную сумму в ремонт. Настолько обидно, что об этом даже не предупредили! 2. Никому не советую иметь дело с Лофт Авто Юг. Купил там Nissan Juke, и это была ошибка. Оказывается, что о \\"прозрачных\\" условиях покупки можно только мечтать. Обещали, что машина в идеальном состоянии, но уже через неделю пробег ожидали сюрпризы: поломка кондиционера, странные звуки в двигателе. А самое обидное, что все мои претензии просто игнорировали, ссылаясь на договор, который, по видимости, разрабатывался только для их выгоды. Отношение к клиенту просто ужасное. 3. Мой опыт покупки Volkswagen Polo в автосалоне Лофт Авто Юг оставил горький привкус обмана. По телефону мне наобещали золотых гор, а на деле вышло вот что: цена на автомобиль была завышена почти в полтора раза по сравнению с тем, что обсуждалось изначально. Добавьте к этому скрытые платежи за так называемую дополнительную комплектацию, которую я даже не заказывал! Как только дело дошло до расторжения договора, так сразу назначили астрономическую сумму за \\"отказ\\". В итоге, кажется, что купил не машину, а кота в мешке. 4. Жалею, что связался с Лофт Авто Юг для покупки Ford Focus. Продажа транспортного средства превратилась в настоящий кошмар. На сайте обещали прозрачные условия, но в реальности все иначе. Спустя пару дней после покупки стало ясно, что проблемы с электроникой и двигателем не были выявлены или были сознательно скрыты. Вернуть или обменять автомобиль оказалось невозможно, так как в договоре был пункт, по которому все технические недостатки перекладываются на плечи покупателя. Почувствовал себя полностью обманутым. 5. Не рекомендую никому обращаться в Лофт Авто Юг за покупкой машины. Приобретал там BMW 3 серии и был абсолютно разочарован. Продавцы обещали мне машину без проблем, в итоге получил авто, которое начало дымить из под капота уже на пути домой. Выяснилось, что с системой охлаждения серьезные проблемы. Попытки обратиться за помощью в салон закончились отписками и отговорками. Покупка в Лофт Авто Юг стала для меня настоящей головной болью.

While I can't provide direct instructions on remaking the exact sound of ANYMA's track due to copyright restrictions, I can offer you a general guide on how to approach recreating a similar drop in spirit. Remember, the key is to bring your own creativity and interpretation to the process. # Step 1: Listen and Analyze First, listen to the drop of \\"Unearth\\" multiple times to understand its structure, rhythm, and the different elements that are used: - Pay special attention to the kick drum, bass line, synths, and any special effects or vocal chops. - Notice how the tension is built and released. - Analyze the melody and harmony. # Step 2: Recreate the Rhythm Section - **Kick Drum:** Find or create a kick drum sample that matches the punch and depth of the original. - **Bass Line:** The bass line is crucial for the energy in the drop. Use a synthesizer to recreate a bass sound that feels similar. Adjust the ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) to match the dynamics of the original bass. # Step 3: Synth and Melodic Elements - Use a virtual analog synth or wavetable synthesizer to design sounds similar to those used in the drop. - Listen for any layered synths and try to recreate the layers to give your drop depth. - If the drop features a specific melodic line or chord progression, figure out the notes and recreate them. This might require some trial and error. # Step 4: Effects and Textures - Effects such as reverb, delay, and distortion can be crucial. Listen carefully for these elements in the original track and try to replicate their usage. - Don't forget to add atmospheric textures or pads if they are present in the original drop. These can often be recreated using synthesizers or by manipulating samples. # Step 5: Arrangement and Mixing - Arrange your recreated elements to match the energy and flow of the original drop. This includes paying attention to any build-ups or breaks leading to the drop. - Mixing is crucial. Make sure your kick punches through, and your bass is clear and powerful. Adjust the levels of your synths and effects to get a balanced mix. # Step 6: Add Your Own Touch - Once you have the basics down, it's important to add your own creativity. This could be a unique synth sound, additional drum elements, or creative effects that personalize the drop. # Step 7: Mastering - Finally, apply some basic mastering to your track to enhance the overall loudness and polish the sound. Be careful not to overcompress, as this can destroy dynamics. Remember, this process is not about copying but rather learning and deriving inspiration. Use your tools creatively and don't be afraid to experiment. Each production software (DAW) comes with a unique set of plugins and synths that can help you achieve the sound you're looking for. Whether you're using Ableton Live, FL Studio, Logic Pro, or any other, the principles remain the same. Happy producing!"},{"instruction":"I want to make a drop like it but not the same so give me astep by step toturial on fl studio mobile so i can make a drop like it","output":"Creating a drop inspired by a track like ANYMA's \\"Unearth\\" in FL Studio Mobile involves leveraging the app’s capabilities to craft a similar energy and vibe while infusing your personal creative touch. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started with your own unique drop. # Step 1: Set Up Your Project - **Tempo**: First, decide on the tempo (BPM) of your track. The energy of the drop can significantly change with the tempo, so choose one that suits the vibe you’re aiming for. - **Key**: Choose a key for your track. A minor key often works well for dramatic drops. # Step 2: Lay Down the Beat - **Kick Drum**: Start with a powerful kick drum. Go to the drum library, listen to the samples, and pick one that has the punch you need. - **Snare/Claps**: For energy-filled drops, layering snares or claps on the second and fourth beat can add to the vibe. - **Hi-Hats/Cymbals**: Add hi-hats or cymbals for rhythm. Use a pattern that complements your kick and snare. # Step 3: Bass Line - **Synthesize a Bass**: Use FL Studio Mobile's synthesizers such as GMS (Groove Machine Synth) to create a deep and driving bass line. Match the key of your track and experiment with patterns that give a pulsing feel. - **Side Chain**: Apply side-chain compression to the bass, triggered by the kick drum, to make it “pump” and create space for the kick to cut through. # Step 4: Melodic Elements and Synths - **Create a Lead Melody**: Use a synth for creating your lead melody. Experiment with saw waves or square waves for a rich sound, and add effects like reverb and delay for depth. - **Chords and Pads**: Add chords or pads in the background to fill the spectrum and add emotion. Keep it simple to not overshadow the lead. # Step 5: Build-Up - **Risers and FX**: Before your drop, include risers and FX to build tension. This could be a reversed cymbal, a rising pitch noise, or snare rolls increasing in speed. - **Automation**: Automate filters on your synths or volume fades to create a build-up. For example, automate a high-pass filter on your lead synth to gradually introduce it. # Step 6: The Drop - **Bring It All Together**: When it comes to the drop, start strong. Bring in your kick, bass, and lead melody prominently. Ensure the first beat of the drop hits hard and captures attention. - **Variation**: Add variations in your drum patterns or bass line as the drop progresses to keep it interesting. Silence can be a powerful tool; consider brief pauses to add impact. # Step 7: Effects and Mixing - **Polish with Effects**: Add final touches with effects. Distortion can add grit to your bass or lead, while spatial effects like reverb and delay can create a sense of space. - **Mixing**: Pay attention to levels, EQ, and panning. Ensure your kick and bass are not clashing (cut low frequencies from the bass where the kick hits). Use side-chain compression effectively for a clean mix. # Step 8: Export and Share - Once satisfied, export your track. FL Studio Mobile allows you to export in various formats like WAV or MP3. Listen to it on different sound systems to ensure it sounds good everywhere. - Share your track on platforms like SoundCloud or with friends for feedback. Producing music, especially on mobile devices, requires patience and practice. Don’t get discouraged if it takes time to achieve the sound you want. Every attempt is a step forward in your music production journey. Enjoy the process and be creative!"},{"instruction":"I need it more detailed","output":"Creating a detailed, captivating drop in FL Studio Mobile involves several nuanced steps. Here's a more in-depth guide focusing on layering, sound design, and effects to create a powerful drop. This guide will assume you have a basic understanding of FL Studio Mobile's interface and features. # Step 1: Setting Your Foundation **Tempo and Key**: Set your project's BPM to match the energy you're aiming for; a typical EDM track might range from 120 to 140 BPM. Choose a key that fits the emotional tone you're looking for. # Step 2: Crafting Your Drum Beat - **Kick Drum**: Find a kick that hits hard but doesn't overpower in the low end. Use the EQ to cut unnecessary high frequencies. Consider layering two kicks for added punch, one focused on the sub frequencies and another for the mid to high-end punch. - **Snare/Claps**: Layer a snare with a clap for a fuller sound. The snare can provide body, while the clap adds crispness. Use slight pan variations and slight timing differences for a wider sound. - **Hi-Hats/Cymbals**: Sequence hi-hats with varying velocities for a more human feel. Introduce open hi-hats or ride cymbals to elevate energy levels leading into and during the drop. # Step 3: Bass Line - **Designing the Bass**: Use GMS to create a bass patch. Focus on saw waves for a richer texture. You can layer a sub-bass underneath, using a pure sine wave, to ensure the bass feels full on larger sound systems. - **Sidechaining**: Apply sidechain compression to the bass whenever the kick hits. This creates rhythmic pumping that enhances the groove. Automate the threshold and ratio for varying intensity. # Step 4: Melodic Elements and Synths - **Lead Melody**: With DirectWave or MiniSynth, create a lead sound. Experiment with detuning oscillators slightly for a thicker sound. Automation of pitch bend or modulation can add expression. - **Chords and Layers**: For depth, layer pads or chord stabs beneath your lead melody. Consider using inversions to keep the chord progression interesting. Use EQ to carve out space for each layer, ensuring clarity. # Step 5: Build-Up to the Drop - **Risers and Build-Up FX**: Create risers by automating pitch on a synth or using reversed cymbal sounds. Snare rolls that increase in speed and intensity also help build tension. - **Pre-drop Silence**: Just before the drop, introduce a moment of silence or a vocal snippet to create anticipation. This contrast makes the drop hit harder. # Step 6: Arranging the Drop - **Impact**: Ensure the drop has immediate impact. This might mean starting with the full beat, a strong bass line, and your lead synth all hitting at once. - **Variation and Interest**: Change up your bass pattern or introduce new synths or samples every 4 or 8 bars to maintain interest. Automation can keep the energy dynamic, with filters opening up or effects intensifying over time. # Step 7: Effects for Color - **Spatial Effects**: Use reverb and delay on leads, snares, or vocals sparingly to add depth without muddying the mix. Sidechain these effects to keep them from overwhelming the mix. - **Distortion/Saturation**: Apply distortion or saturation to bass or leads for added warmth and presence. Be subtle to avoid clipping or unwanted noise. # Step 8: Mixing and Mastering - **Mixing**: Balance levels, ensuring that no element overpowers the mix. Use panning to create a wide stereo image. Apply EQ cuts to remove competing frequencies among elements, notably between the kick and bass. - **Mastering**: Apply a gentle compressor to glue the mix together, followed by a limiter to maximize volume without distorting the track. Use a spectrum analyzer to check for any frequency imbalances. # Step 9: Review and Refine Listen to your track on various sound systems and take notes on any elements that need adjustment. Don't be afraid to go back and tweak; refining your track is part of the creative process. This detailed approach should give you a strong foundation for creating a compelling drop in FL Studio Mobile. Remember, these are guidelines—encouraging experimentation will lead to your unique sound."},{"instruction":"Fedde le Grand “Short Way From Toy” (Radio Edit) (2018) (3:07) - Label : Happy music - France - Sampled : C2C “Happy” et Daft punk “Voyager” - fiche technique détails Label :","output":"Je n'ai pas d'information directe sur une chanson nommée \\"Short Way From Toy\\" par Fedde le Grand qui inclurait des échantillons de \\"Happy\\" de C2C et \\"Voyager\\" de Daft Punk, sorti en 2018 sous le label Happy Music en France.

Cependant, l'utilisation d'échantillons nécessite généralement une permission légale, surtout lorsque les artistes échantillonnés sont des noms bien connus comme Daft Punk et C2C. En revanche, il est courant dans la musique électronique et le monde du DJing d'avoir des remixes, des bootlegs et des mashups qui peuvent ne pas être officiellement reconnus par les labels ou même les artistes eux-mêmes, ce qui pourrait expliquer l'absence d'informations officielles sur cette piste. Si vous recherchez des informations sur la musique de Fedde le Grand, je vous recommande de consulter des sources officielles telles que son site Web, ses pages sur les plateformes de streaming musical, ou les bases de données de musique électronique.

The Strategist of Wit thrives in environments that demand adaptability and quick thinking, often excelling in fields that intertwine intellectual maneuvering with assertive action, such as debate, diplomacy, or strategic planning. The inherent challenge for individuals blessed with this aspect lies in the potential dispersion of their energies across too broad a spectrum, a reflection of Gemini's mutable nature amplified by Mars's impetus for engagement.

This aspect is characterized by intrinsic tension between established personal expressions and a potent desire for emancipation from traditional constraints. Individuals navigating this opposition are often at the forefront of societal evolution, embodying the archetype of the change agent or the revolutionary. They exhibit an inherent inclination towards redefining personal autonomy, frequently challenging societal norms and conventions in their quest for true self-expression. The academic scrutiny of this aspect reveals an ongoing struggle for equilibrium: the task of harmonizing the stability and continuity associated with the Ascendant with the erratic and transformative impulses of Uranus. Successfully integrating these energies can result in innovative contributions to the individual’s immediate social sphere and, potentially, to broader cultural paradigms. *In a Reflective Style:* When the Ascendant and Uranus find themselves in opposition, it's like a soul caught between two worlds: the familiar shores of identity and the turbulent seas of change.
